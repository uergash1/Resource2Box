AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, INC., ET AL.    ON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA      REPLY BRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES    I. CIPA DOES NOT INDUCE PUBLIC LIBRARIES TO VIOLATE ANY FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS OF THEIR PATRONS    Appellees' principal contention is that the First Amendment bars a public library from using filtering software to ensure that the library does not make pornographic visual depictions available to its patrons through its own computers on its own premises. From this premise, appellees then argue that the filtering provisions in the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) are unconstitutional on their face because they induce public libraries to commit that constitutional violation. See Multnomah County Br. 24-42; ALA Br. 17-38. Appellees' submission is profoundly wrong. The First Amendment does not bar a public library from declining to be an intermediary in the purveying of pornography to people who enter its premises. To the contrary, such a judgment concerning what material to make available to its patrons conforms to the traditional practices and role of a library. More broadly, it conforms to the traditional latitude that the Constitution affords to the government in the expenditure and the utilization of its own property and resources.    Significantly, moreover, appellees do not challenge the district court's findings that there is an enormous amount of pornography on the Internet, J.S. App. 30a-31a, that library patrons, including minors, regularly search for such material, id. at 2a, that pornography falls outside the collection boundaries of most public libraries, id. at 33a, that filtering software is a reasonably effective way to keep pornography out of the library, id. at 90a-91a, and that a significant number of public libraries acting without any encouragement from Congress have chosen to use filtering software to accomplish that purpose, id. at 3a. Instead, appellees contend (Multnomah County Br. 24-29; ALA Br. 19-28) that because filtering software blocks pornography on the basis of its content, its use by a public library is subject to strict scrutiny under the First Amendment and may be justified only if narrowly tailored to further compelling government interests. That contention lacks merit.    A. Strict Scrutiny Does Not Apply To A Public Library's Content-Based Collection Decisions    Strict scrutiny does not apply to a public library's traditional exercise of judgment in deciding what material to collect for its patrons. Application of that standard to a library's collection practices would fundamentally alter the role of public libraries in our society, and replace librarians with judges in making day-to-day decisions respecting what material to include in or exclude from a library's offerings.    District court findings, largely ignored by appellees, demonstrate why that is so. Of crucial importance, the court found that in order to fulfill their traditional educational and informational mission, public libraries seek to collect material of ""requisite and appropriate quality,"" J.S. App. 34a, and that, as a consequence, public libraries routinely consider the ""content of the material"" in deciding whether to add it to their collections. Id. at 35a. Accordingly, if strict scrutiny were applied to traditional collection practices, public libraries could not perform their traditional role. Instead of public libraries deciding what material to include in their collections based on their assessment of its content, strict scrutiny would transfer that role to book authors, library patrons, and, ultimately, the courts. Under a strict scrutiny regime, any time a library refused to stock a book because it concluded that it did not contain content of suitable or appropriate quality, the author of the book or a library patron could challenge the decision as unconstitutional-including in a suit for damages under 42 U.S.C. 1983. A court would then be required to rule in favor of the challenge unless the public library could show that its decision was narrowly tailored to further a compelling interest.    No decision of this Court supports that notion. To the contrary, Arkansas Educational Television Commission v. Forbes, 523 U.S. 666 (1998), and National Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569 (1998), establish that, when a government entity's mission entails the making of content-based decisions, strict scrutiny does not apply.    ALA asserts (Br. 23 & n.20) that Forbes and Finley are distinguishable because a public library will meet patron demand for lawful material through interlibrary loan. But the district court found that interlibrary loan ""is expensive"" and ""therefore used infrequently."" J.S. App. 34a. Even when cost is not an issue, the court found only that public libraries ""typically will assist patrons in obtaining access"" to lawful material, not that they always will. Ibid. And no decision of this or any other court has been located that even suggests that they have a First Amendment obligation to do so.    Moreover, the question here is whether public libraries may exercise their traditional discretion in deciding what material they will make generally available to the public in their own libraries, not the extent to which they will or must respond to particular patron requests for material that is at another library. For purposes of resolving that question, the pertinent tradition is a library's approach to assembling its permanent collection, not its interlibrary loan policies. As the district court's findings make clear, with respect to its permanent collection, a library does not seek universal coverage, but material of ""requisite and appropriate quality."" J.S. App. 34a.    2. In the end, appellees implicitly concede that a public library's traditional collection practices are not subject to strict scrutiny. Instead, they argue that a public library's decisions concerning what material to make available to its patrons are judged by a different standard when that material is posted on the Internet. However, there is no sound reason that libraries should have less freedom to decide what material to make available on their Internet-connected computers than they have to decide what books, magazines, CD ROMS, movies, microfilm, or records they will make available. At bottom, a library's Internet-connected computers are simply ""a technological extension of the book stack."" S. Rep. No. 141, 106th Cong., 1st Sess. 7 (1999).    Consistent with that understanding, public libraries exercise judgment to exclude from their Internet-connected computers the same kinds of material that they categorically exclude from their physical collections, including material they view as offensive, tasteless, inappropriate, graphically violent, or pornographic. J.S. App. 37a; GXs 71, 83, 99, 247. Under appellees' theory, even though a public library's judgment to exclude such material from numerous other collections is entirely permissible, precisely the same judgment becomes constitutionally suspect when applied to a library's Internet-connected computers. Furthermore, under appellees' theory, a library's judgment not to permit access to e-mail, chat rooms, game sites, or dating services would be subject to either strict scrutiny or the heightened scrutiny that is applicable to time, place, and manner restrictions in a traditional public forum.    Appellees' approach lacks coherence. If a public library has broad discretion-as it surely does-to refuse to collect pornographic magazines, XXX videos, and other material that can be readily found at the nearest adult book store, or any of a myriad other available Internet-connected computers, it should have the same discretion to exclude that material from its computer monitors.    3. Appellees nonetheless struggle, and not without considerable irony, to distinguish a public library's Internet collection practices from its more traditional collection practices, and to impose stringent First Amendment burdens on libraries that simply do not exist in the law. None of their purported distinctions withstands analysis.    a. Multnomah County argues (Br. 39) that a public library's traditional collection practices are distinguishable because CIPA mandates filtering software for all public libraries and overrides local decisions. CIPA does not impose any such mandate. CIPA applies only to those public libraries that wish to receive Internet-related federal financial assistance and agree to accept filtering in order to do so. Those voluntary decisions by public libraries in assembling their collections are entitled to just as much deference as other collection practices. CIPA's effect is the same as if a private donor contributed funds to a library to build its collection on the condition that it not use the funds to purchase pornography. The First Amendment surely allows the library to make the choice to accept such conditional grants from public as well as private donors. Moreover, Multnomah County's purported distinction provides no support for the district court's holding that public libraries that use filtering software, even without any federal assistance, violate the First Amendment rights of their patrons.    b. Appellees also contend (Multnomah County Br. 39; ALA Br. 24) that libraries' Internet collection practices are different from their book selection practices because libraries pre-approve the books they make available, but do not pre-approve the Web sites they make available. Appellees do not explain why a library's discretion to make choices disappears when it decides what not to accept rather than what affirmatively to accept. A public library could, of course, limit its Internet collection to just those sites it pre-screened, but only at the cost of excluding an enormous amount of valuable information that it lacks the capacity or resources to review. Faced with that choice, it is eminently reasonable for a public library to choose not to pre-screen all material, but instead to focus on the categories of material it determines to be inappropriate, wasteful, unnecessary or incompatible with its policies. Indeed, because that approach makes more information available than the alternative of offering only pre-selected sites, it is difficult to understand why either appellees or the First Amendment would favor mandatory pre- screening.    c. Appellees also err in contending (Multnomah County Br. 40-41; ALA Br. 24) that a library's Internet collection is distinguishable from its book collection because filtering software companies do the hard and resource-intensive work of choosing which particular Web sites to exclude, while librarians generally choose the books that are included. Libraries exercise significant editorial judgment in selecting both the particular software they use and the filtering categories they will enable. When a library chooses to enable the pornography category, that is comparable to a judgment not to collect pornographic books. Libraries also retain the capacity to determine whether the filter is excluding sites that the library would prefer to make available, and they can simply adjust the filters to unblock those sites. J.S. App. 52a. Thus, when library staff members determine that filtering software excludes sites that are not pornographic, they can adjust the filter to unblock those sites.    Moreover, in developing their book collections, libraries also rely on third parties. They often rely on journal reviews and bibliographies to select their books, and they sometimes delegate to third-party vendors the task of supplying books that satisfy their collection standards. J.S. App. 35a. ALA seeks to distinguish that practice on the ground that public libraries retain ultimate control over their book collections. But since libraries can add or delete sites from a blocking category, the same is true of their Internet collections.    B. A Library's Internet-Connected Computers Are Not Analogous To A Traditional Public Forum    Multnomah County contends (Br. 24-26) that strict scrutiny applies to a public library's use of filtering software to block material covered by CIPA because a library's Internet-connected computers are analogous to a traditional public forum. That contention is utterly unsustainable. Traditional public forum principles apply only to those places, such as public streets and parks, that have ""immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and, time out of mind, * * * been used for purposes of assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions."" International Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U.S. 672, 679 (1992). The Court has explicitly ""rejected the view that traditional public forum status extends beyond its historic confines."" Forbes, 523 U.S. at 678.    In any event, there is no coherent analogy between Internet access on a computer screen in a public library and a traditional public forum. Multnomah County argues (Br. 24) that the two are analogous because a public library is a quintessential locus for the receipt of a wide array of information. But public sidewalks and parks are not traditional public fora because they are places where a wide array of information may be received. In fact, the range of information they afford may often be quite limited. Rather, parks and sidewalks are public fora because private speakers, and not the government, have always determined the content of the speech that a person may receive there. In contrast, the amount and nature of information that may be obtained in a public library has always been determined by the public library itself, within the funding and other limitations set by the governmental body that established and supports it.    Nor is appellees' analogy assisted by Multnomah County's observation (Br. 26) that the Internet contains more information than is available in a traditional public forum. The Internet itself is not at issue here. Instead, what is at issue is the material from the Internet that a library chooses to make available on its own computers on its own premises. If a library's status as a place to obtain information and its willingness to provide a wide array of information to the public were sufficient to trigger the doctrines applicable to a traditional public forum, strict scrutiny would also apply to a public library's content-based book selections. That consequence of appellees' theory demonstrates that their analogy is fundamentally misconceived. While a public library is generally-but not always-a place where a wide array of information may be obtained, the information that may be obtained has always been whatever the library chooses to provide, and nothing more.    C. A Public Library's Internet-Connected Computers Are Not Designated Public Fora, But Even If They Were, The Library's Content-Based Collection Decisions Would Not Be Subject To Strict Scrutiny    1. Appellees are also mistaken in contending (Multnomah County Br. 27-29; ALA Br. 19-22) that a public library's Internet collection decisions are subject to strict scrutiny because libraries create a designated public forum when they furnish material from the Internet. A designated public forum is created only when the government makes an affirmative choice to open up its property for use as a public forum, Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators' Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 46 (1983), not ""by inaction or by permitting limited discourse, but only by intentionally opening a nontraditional forum for public discourse."" Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, 473 U.S. 788, 802 (1985).    Under those principles, a public library that installs computer terminals on its premises and connects them to the Internet does not thereby create a designated public forum. The computer terminals are simply added to and subsumed in the overall resources of what is, after all, a library, and the computer terminals thus assume the essential character of the other resources the library has assembled in aid of its mission. Accordingly, a library that acquires computer terminals and connects them to the Internet cannot properly be understood as ""intentionally"" opening up its facilities, equipment, and Internet collection as a forum for ""public discourse"" by Web publishers within the meaning of this Court's cases, Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 802-any more than a library's acquisition of books for its collection creates a designated public forum for ""public discourse"" by authors and publishers. Rather, the library has made its information-gathering tools available to its patrons to be used in the way that a library's collection, including other reference material, generally is used. See id. at 801-802, 805-806.    That is especially so with respect to a public library that connects to the Internet with federal assistance. E-rate discounts are available only for ""educational"" purposes, 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(1)(B), and assistance under the Library Services and Technology Act is intended ""to stimulate excellence and promote access to learning and information resources"" in libraries. 20 U.S.C. 9121(2). A public library that connects to the Internet with federal assistance necessarily seeks to further those purposes, and not some broader goal of opening a public forum for public discourse by Web publishers. The library's Internet-connected computers therefore are simply information-gathering tools that, consistently with the limitations Congress has imposed, serve to supplement the library's traditional collections.    Appellees contend (Multnomah County Br. 28; ALA Br. 20-21) that a public library's Internet-connected computers become designated public fora because of the breadth of information that is available on them. But if that were sufficient to create designated public fora, a public library's bookshelves would also qualify. And if that were the test, public television stations would create a designated public forum by offering diverse programming, and the National Endowment for the Arts would create a designated public forum by funding a wide array of art. As those examples demonstrate, a designated forum is not created simply because the government chooses to furnish a wide array of information-especially where, as here, it does so through its own equipment on its own premises.    2. Even if a public library that connects to the Internet with federal assistance has thereby created a designated public forum, that forum would necessarily be limited to the educational and informational purposes for which it was created. Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of the Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995). In the context of limited public fora, the Court has drawn a distinction between content-based and viewpoint-based distinctions. Id. at 829-830. A content-based limitation is permissible if it is reasonable in light of the purposes of the designated forum. Ibid. A viewpoint-based exclusion, by contrast, is presumptively impermissible. Ibid.    The use of filtering software to block access to pornographic material covered by CIPA is content-based, not viewpoint-based. Accordingly, even if a library's Internet-connected computers were treated as a designated public forum, the use of filtering software to block access to material covered by CIPA would not be subject to strict scrutiny. Instead, the relevant question would be whether the use of filtering software is reasonable in light of the informational and educational purposes of that designated public forum. Plainly, a library could permissibly conclude that the exclusion of Internet pornography is reasonably related to those purposes, just as libraries have traditionally done respecting pornographic books.    The designated public forum cases cited by appellees are consistent with that analysis. In Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 831-832, the Court applied strict scrutiny to an exclusion from a designated public forum based on religious viewpoint. The exclusion invalidated in Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 269-270, (1981), was also based on religious viewpoint. Similarly, in City of Madison School District No. 8 v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission, 429 U.S. 167, 175-176 (1976), the Court subjected to strict scrutiny and invalidated a law that allowed ""one side of a debatable public question to have a monopoly in expressing its views to the government.""    ALA contends (Br. 26-27) that permitting the government to define the forum through the use of reasonable content-based distinctions would empty designated public forum analysis of any meaning. That concern is misguided. As Rosenberger makes clear, the government may not define a designated forum in terms of particular viewpoints, and then justify viewpoint-based distinctions as tailored to further the purposes of the forum. In addition, any content-based exclusions that are not viewpoint-based must still be justified as reasonable in light of the purposes of the forum.    D. Filtering Software Is A Reasonable Means For A Library To Ensure That It Does Not Furnish Pornography To Its Patrons    1. Appellees err in contending (Multnomah County Br. 29-32; ALA Br. 29-30) that the use of filtering software is constitutionally deficient because all leading commercial filters block some constitutionally protected speech. Just as a library may choose not to purchase a book or magazine that has both pornographic and non-pornographic content, it may reasonably conclude that it is better to have an effective mechanism for blocking pornographic material than it is to abandon any such safeguard in order to guarantee that no single constitutionally protected Web site is excluded.    Appellees vastly overstate the amount of material that is erroneously excluded by filtering software. The district court estimated that tens of thousands of Web pages are erroneously blocked. J.S. App. 93a. But that represents a minute percentage of the two billion pages that are on the Internet. Id. at 30a. The district court's finding is consistent with evidence offered by appellees' own expert. Of the sites he examined, less than 1% were erroneously blocked. Id. at 79a-85a.1 A recently released study shows that a filter set to block only pornography blocks only 1.4% of all health sites. Caroline R. Richardson et al., Does Pornography-Blocking Software Block Access to Health Information on the Internet?, 288 JAMA 2887, 2891-2892 (2002).2 Other evidence in the record shows that an even smaller percentage of material sought by library patrons is actually blocked.3 Accordingly, a patron will only infrequently confront a site that is erroneously blocked. Moreover, because a standard Internet search ordinarily produces multiple sites addressing the same topic, an erroneous block will not have significance unless the person conducting the search is looking for information that can only be found on that one site.    If that happens, a patron need only ask a librarian to unblock the site. As the district court found, a library has the capacity to permanently unblock any erroneously blocked site. J.S. App. 52a. Asking a librarian to unblock a site is no different from requesting a librarian to retrieve a book that is not on the library's open stacks or to obtain a book by interlibrary loan. ALA complains (Br. 37) that CIPA permits, but does not require, a library to unblock an erroneously blocked site. That complaint is misguided. The district court found that libraries routinely respond to requests to unblock erroneously blocked sites. J.S. App. 46a. Moreover, librarians have a professional duty to assist patrons in finding information, and ALA offers no reason to believe that they will shirk that responsibility when it comes to responding to unblocking requests. In any event, the possibility that they might do so does not render CIPA itself unconstitutional, either on its face or as applied.    Multnomah County notes (Br. 35) that CIPA establishes certain limitations on disabling a filter. But those limitations apply only when a library wishes to disable the filter altogether, thereby permitting access to material that is child pornography, obscene, or harmful to minors. A library that receives Internet-related federal assistance has unrestricted freedom to unblock any site that does not fall within those categories. Appellees persistently blur the distinction between unblocking and disabling, but they are two very different ways of assisting patrons who wish to view blocked material.    Even with respect to disabling, CIPA's limitations are minimal. Under CIPA, at least with respect to adults, a filter may be disabled for any lawful purpose. 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(3) (disabling permitted for both adults and minors); 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(6)(D) (disabling permitted for adults).    Appellees argue (Multnomah County Br 36-37; ALA Br. 37-38) that unblocking and disabling are inadequate because some patrons may be too embarrassed to ask for assistance from a librarian, and because a request may not be processed immediately. J.S. App. 172a. That criticism is unpersuasive. Requesting assistance is the standard way to obtain books in a closed stack, behind the reference desk, or through interlibrary loan. Similarly, a library patron seeking a book that has been checked out or a book that can be obtained only through interlibrary loan must ordinarily wait some period of time before obtaining it. There is no reason that the Constitution should require a library to adopt a different set of procedures to handle unblocking requests. But to the extent that a library may wish to take additional measures to facilitate unblocking requests, such as permitting them to be made anonymously, or expediting their processing, nothing in CIPA precludes it from doing so.4 And if libraries are unwilling to unblock particular sites, the sites are available on countless Internet-connected computers throughout the country.    2. Appellees contend (Multnomah Br. 33-34; ALA Br. 34-35) that there are less restrictive and equally effective ways to preclude library patrons from receiving access to illegal and harmful pornography on library computers. However, they conspicuously fail to defend the principal alternative identified by the district court-a tap-on-the-shoulder policy. Appellees apparently share the government's view (Gov't Br. 37-38) that such a policy is far more intrusive, restrictive, inefficient, ineffective, and burdensome on library staff than filtering software.    Multnomah County proposes (Br. 33-34) as a less restrictive alternative that a library simply announce its policy and hope that library users who agree to comply with it will do so. Evidence in the record shows that even a policy that is enforced through active monitoring is not as effective as the use of filtering software in preventing deliberate efforts to obtain pornography. J.S. App. 40a. A policy that does not involve any active monitoring, like the one Multnomah County proposes, would be even less effective. In addition, the process of securing such agreements would pose extra burdens on both library staff and patrons, and would require a library staff to bring up the subject of pornography with patrons in a way that could be offensive to the patrons and detract from their use of the library.    ALA proposes (Br. 35) as its featured alternative that a library offer optional filtering software to adults, and require young minors to obtain parental permission to use an unfiltered computer. ALA's optional filtering alternative does nothing to address a library's legitimate concern that many adults in public libraries deliberately use the library's computers to seek pornography on the Internet. ALA's parental consent proposal is equally flawed. Libraries have a legitimate interest in ensuring that their computers are not used by minors to obtain pornography, regardless of whether parents give them permission to do so.5    3. Appellees' attack on filtering software ultimately reduces to an argument that it is not a perfect solution to the problem. But even when strict scrutiny applies, perfection is not required. Here, however, strict scrutiny is not applicable. Rather, at most, a library that uses filtering software must show that it is a reasonable way to further the library's traditional educational and informational mission. Appellees' objections do not come close to showing that filtering software fails to satisfy that standard.    II. CIPA DOES NOT IMPOSE AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL CONDITION ON THE RECEIPT OF FEDERAL ASSISTANCE    1. Appellees contend (Multnomah County Br. 45-48; ALA Br. 38- 50) that the district court's judgment may be affirmed on the alternative ground that CIPA imposes an unconstitutional condition on the receipt of federal assistance. Relying on Legal Services Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533 (2001), they argue that CIPA's filtering conditions ""distort"" the function of public libraries (Multnomah County Br. 48) and ""suppress speech inherent"" in those libraries (ALA Br. 48). Appellees' reliance on Velazquez is wholly misplaced. In that case, the federal funding program prohibited attorneys from advocating against the government -a role that was perceived in that context to be indispensable to the proper functioning of the judicial process. The funding restriction also disfavored certain speech based on its viewpoint. Neither of those distinctive features is present here. Public libraries do not have an adversarial relationship with the government that would be compromised by accepting federal funding on the conditions established under CIPA, and those conditions do not make any distinctions based on viewpoint.    Moreover, CIPA's conditions do not in any sense distort a library's function or suppress speech inherent in that setting. Neither the collection of pornographic visual depictions nor the provision of unfiltered Internet access is inherent in the traditional role of public libraries. Libraries have never had as their goal ""universal coverage,"" J.S. App. 34a, and indeed have historically not included pornography in their collections. Thus, many libraries have found that filtering software furthers rather than distorts their traditional educational and informational mission, because it gives them the flexibility to block access to material that is outside their collection boundaries, while reserving use of their computers for legitimate research and information gathering. And because CIPA permits unblocking, libraries that wish to provide the maximum amount of lawful information are free to do so.    ALA asserts (Br. 41-42) that CIPA distorts a public library's function and suppresses speech inherent in that setting simply because it removes discretion from public libraries to decide for themselves whether to use filtering software. That assertion is inconsistent with ALA's contention elsewhere (Br. 17-38) that public libraries lack any discretion at all under the First Amendment to use filtering software. It also is without merit. To the extent that libraries wish to offer unfiltered access, they are free to do so without federal assistance. If a library wishes to receive federal assistance, however, Congress has wide latitude to establish conditions that ensure that the assistance will be used for the purposes that Congress intended.    Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173 (1991), is controlling on that point. In that case, the Court held that Congress has authority to insist ""that public funds be spent for the purposes for which they were authorized."" Id. at 196. ALA errs in characterizing Rust (Br. 40-41 & n.39) as a case involving government speech. The Rust Court held that Congress could impose the funding condition because ""when the Government appropriates public funds to establish a program, it is entitled to define the limits of that program."" 500 U.S. at 194. Here, Congress has defined its program as one that seeks to facilitate Internet access at libraries for educational and informational purposes, which Congress has reasonably determined should entail corresponding restrictions on using the program to make available material that is obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors. Because the use of filtering software helps to carry out the program as so defined, it is a permissible condition under Rust.    2. Appellees alternatively contend (Multnomah County Br. 45-46; ALA Br. 43-44) that CIPA exceeds permissible limits because it applies to every computer at a library that receives assistance, even those purchased and connected without federal assistance. As an initial matter, that question does not need to be resolved in this facial challenge. If a particular library wishes to use non-federal funds to offer unfiltered access on a particular computer at the library, it may raise that issue in an as-applied challenge. In any event, CIPA's ""any computer"" condition is a permissible exercise of Congress's spending power. Under the Spending Clause, Congress is entitled to ""require[] a certain degree of separation"" from the E-rate and LSTA programs ""in order to ensure the integrity"" of those programs. Rust, 500 U.S. at 198. Permitting public libraries to offer unfiltered access at the very facilities that receive Internet-related assistance would undermine the integrity of those federal programs.    Multnomah County errs in arguing (Br. 45-46) that CIPA's ""any computer"" condition conflicts with this Court's decision in FCC v. League of Women Voters, 468 U.S. 364, 400 (1984). In that case, the Court invalidated a funding restriction on editorializing because it prohibited recipients from editorializing through a separate affiliate. Ibid. CIPA does not suffer from that vice. A recipient that wishes to offer unfiltered access outside the scope of the federal program may do so through an affiliated library that does not receive federal Internet-related assistance.    ALA is mistaken in claiming (Br. 44) that CIPA does not afford that option. Under its express terms, CIPA's conditions attach only to the computers of the particular libraries that receive Internet-related assistance. 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(1)(A) and (B); 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(6)(B) and (C). An affiliated library receiving no federal assistance is therefore not covered. That is the way the federal enforcement agencies interpret CIPA, and that interpretation is consistent with both CIPA's text, and the principle that statutes should be interpreted to avoid constitutional questions, not to create them.    3. While the foregoing is sufficient to show that CIPA is not invalid on its face as imposing an unconstitutional condition, there is also a substantial question whether appellees may assert an unconstitutional conditions claim at all. The courts of appeals have uniformly concluded that government entities are not protected by the First Amendment. Gov't Br. 40-41. Moreover, while appellees wish to assert the rights of their patrons, this Court has never held that an unconstitutional conditions claim may be asserted on behalf of persons upon whom no conditions have been imposed. See id. at 41-42. All of the cases cited by appellees for that proposition (Multnomah County Br. 46; ALA Br. 45-46) involved one or more recipients upon whom an allegedly unconstitutional condition had been imposed, so the Court had no occasion to resolve the question.6    ALA contends (Br. 48-49) that if municipalities have no First Amendment rights, there is no limit on the speech restrictions that Congress could impose on municipalities directly or though funding conditions. That contention is incorrect. The Tenth Amendment would place some limits on direct restrictions, and the Spending Clause requires that any speech-related or other conditions must be related to the purposes for which the assistance is provided. See South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 206 (1987).7    * * * * *    The judgment of the district court should be reversed.    Respectfully submitted.    THEODORE B. OLSON  Solicitor General      FEBRUARY 2003    1 Appellees disavow (Multnomah County Br. 30 n.2; ALA Br. 32 n.31) the significance of their expert's testimony, but the district court relied on that testimony, J.S. App. 84a-85a, and appellees have not shown that reliance to be clearly erroneous. There is no reason to believe that the estimate based on the testimony of appellees' expert significantly understates the percentage of erroneous blocks. Indeed, appellees' expert skewed his results in two ways that would tend to overestimate the percentage of sites erroneously blocked. First, his sample consisted of sites that were more likely to be erroneously blocked. Id. at 85a. Second, he counted a site as erroneously blocked if any one of the software programs erroneously blocked it. Id. at 79a.    2 ALA notes (Br. 32-33 n.31) that the same study shows that a filter set to block pornography blocks 10% of the sites using the search terms safe sex, condom, and gay. 288 JAMA at 2891. That still leaves 90% of those sites accessible. A library collection that contained 90% of all books on a particular topic would be extraordinarily inclusive, not constitutionally suspect. The same is true for Web sites.    3 Biek Test. 76 (Tacoma filter intercepts occur in .5%-.6% of the attempts to load a URL); Joint Exh. 6 (McBride Dep.), at 47 (at Greenville County Library System, the ratio of blocked sites to sites requested is approximately .005%).    4 Because of the distinctive features of public libraries, appellees err in relying on decisions in which the Court has condemned schemes that required persons to seek permission to engage in activity protected by the First Amendment. Lamont v. Postmaster Gen., 381 U.S. 301 (1965) (permission to receive certain mailings); Denver Area Educ. Telecom. Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518 U.S. 727 (1996) (request to receive sexually explicit programming); Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc'y of N.Y., Inc. v. Village of Stratton, 536 U.S. 150 (2002) (permission to conduct door-to-door canvassing). The routine practice of seeking assistance from a professional librarian in obtaining material from the library's own collection is nothing like the schemes at issue in those cases.    5 The other alternatives suggested by appellees-privacy screens, recessed monitors, training on Internet use, placing computers in areas of high traffic either do not address a library's interest in preventing its computers from being used by persons who seek out material covered by CIPA, or are substantially less effective than filtering software. See Gov't Br. 38-39. Those alternatives also are not as effective in preventing inadvertent exposure to material covered by CIPA. Id. at 39.    6 The Court's decision in First National Bank v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765 (1978), does not assist appellees. The Court's holding that a private corporation may assert that restrictions on its speech violate the First Amendment does not imply that a public entity may.    7 Multnomah County errs in arguing (Br. 42-45) that a public library's use of filtering software constitutes an impermissible prior restraint on speech. A library's use of filtering software is no more a prior restraint on speech than is its refusal to provide patrons with pornographic magazines. Both are collection decisions that affect only what material may be obtained from the library, not from private sources. Multnomah County sees a difference where the use of filtering software results from CIPA, rather than a local library's own decision. But where CIPA applies, local libraries have voluntarily agreed to install filtering software as a condition of receiving federal Internet-related assistance. The installation of such software therefore does result from local library decisions. In any event, prior restraint doctrine does not depend on whether an action is locally or federally inspired, but on whether the action is a prior restraint on speech. CIPA imposes no such restraint."
GX252-99-4671046	"UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT  ARIF DURRANI, Petitioner, v. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Respondent.  : : : : : : :  CRIMINAL NO. 3:86CR59 (SRU)  RULING In 1987, Petitioner Arif Durrani (""Durrani"") was convicted of violating the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C.  2778, and the accompanying International Traffic In Arms Regulations, 22 C.F.R.  120 et seq., and was sentenced to a term of incarceration. Having fully served his sentence and been released from custody, Durrani brought the current petition for a writ of coram nobis or audita querela, seeking an order vacating his conviction. Alternatively, Durrani requests additional discovery to support his claim that he was shipping arms to Iran on behalf of the United States government. This is Durrani's fourth post-conviction attack on his sentence. The government moves to dismiss the petition, arguing that the claims are procedurally barred, untimely and meritless. On July 25, 2003, the court heard oral argument on the current petition. For the reasons that follow, Durrani's motion to vacate his sentence and/or to seek additional discovery is denied. I. Background Because the background to this case was thoroughly developed in the Second Circuit's decision affirming Durrani's conviction, Durrani v. United States, 835 F.2d 410 (2d Cir. 1987), the court will discuss only the facts relevant to the current petition.   On October 8, 1986,1 Durrani was charged with exporting arms without a State Department license.2 Shortly thereafter, allegations began to surface that high-ranking United States government officials were involved in what came to be known as the Iran-Contra affair, a covert operation in which the United States government was selling arms to Iran in exchange for the release of American hostages. Before trial on the criminal charges against him, Durrani moved to dismiss the indictment, claiming that the government was selectively prosecuting violators of the licensing provision. In his motion to dismiss, Durrani did not allege that the government had requested his assistance in locating military parts. Rather, only after the release of the Senate Intelligence report on the Iran-Contra Affair, in January 1987, did Durrani raise for the first time that he was working in concert with the government.  At trial, Durrani argued that his actions derived from officially-sanctioned covert operations, and he was therefore exempt from any licensing requirements. Durrani claimed that he was working at the request of Manuel Pires (""Pires""), an international arms dealer, whom Durrani claimed was working for Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North of the United States National Security Counsel (""NSC""). Durrani On February 18, 1986, the government filed a superseding indictment to include charges of attempting to export arms without a State Department license and failing to register as an arms exporter with the State Department Office of Munitions Control. ""The Arms Export Control Act establishes the basic requirements for the sale and export of American-made military equipment and ammunition to foreign purchasers. Before a private exporter may sell any article contained on the [U.S. Munitions List] he must apply for an export license from the U.S. State Department's Office of Munitions Control. The exporter must include in the application a description of the arms, their ultimate destination, and their intended use. The Munitions Control Office then decides whether to grant the license based upon the information contained in the application. If an export license is granted, the exporter must present it to the Customs Service at the time of export."" Kuhali v. Reno, 266 F.3d 93, 104 (2d Cir. 2001) (citing United States v. Schwartz, 924 F.2d 410, 416 (2d Cir. 1991)). 2 2 1   argued that Pires, at the insistence of Colonel North, requested Durrani to locate missile parts to ship to Iran. The prosecution argued that Colonel North would not have requested Durrani, either directly or indirectly, to locate military parts for the United States government because the Central Intelligence Agency (""CIA""), not private parties, was in charge of obtaining all military parts for Colonel North. In addition, Charles Moyer of the CIA claimed the CIA had no record of an association with Pires or Durrani. On April 2, 1987, a jury found Durrani guilty on all three charges. On December 3, 1987, the Second Circuit affirmed the conviction. United States v. Durrani, 835 F.2d 410 (2d Cir. 1987). On July 15, 1988, pursuant to Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, as it was in effect at the time of the offense in this case, Durrani filed a motion for reduction of sentence. Durrani argued that ""important new information regarding the role of private individuals in the Iran arms deals strongly suggests that the court may have been unduly and unnecessarily harsh in its assessment."" Recognizing that a Rule 35(b) motion is ""essentially a plea for leniency,"" the District Court (Judge T.F. Gilroy Daly) held that neither the submission by the parties nor the rest of the record suggests that Durrani should be entitled to any grant of leniency. ""Quite the contrary, the record reveals that [the] defendant on several occasions has committed or has caused to be committed falsehoods in the pretrial, trial and post-trial proceedings in this matter, reflecting a complete disdain for the law and this Court."" Accordingly, on May 23, 1989, Judge Daly denied Durrani's Rule 35(b) motion. On March 4, 1990, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  2255, Durrani filed a pro se habeas corpus petition to vacate his conviction. On August 6, 1991, Durrani, with the assistance of counsel, filed an amended section 2255 petition, alleging that the government had withheld various forms of exculpatory material. Particularly relevant for purposes of this motion, Durrani alleged that agents or employees of 3   the United States government knew at the time of Durrani's trial that the United States government, either directly or indirectly, involved private individuals, including Pires, in the procurement of military weapons for shipment to Iran. Judge Daly permitted Durrani time to accumulate evidence to support his section 2255 petition. In its attempt to comply with Durrani's document production requests, the government asked the Office of Independent Counsel (""OIC"") to search its files for documents relevant to Durrani's request. On October 2, 1991, after an in camera review, Judge Daly ordered some of the OIC-produced documents to be disclosed to Durrani. Despite repeated discovery deadline extensions, Durrani was unable to gather sufficient evidence to support his claim that he was working in concert with the United States government. Accordingly, on May 21, 1992, Durrani moved for voluntary dismissal of his section 2255 petition claiming that he wanted to resolve his pending Immigration and Naturalization Services (""INS"") proceedings prior to focusing on his section 2255 petition. After a hearing at which Durrani was present, Judge Daly granted the motion, ruling: ""On consent of the government, counsel for the petitioner, and the petitioner himself and consistent with the Court's ruling in open court on this same date, the motion is hereby ORDERED dismissed without prejudice to renewal upon a filing, on or before, December 31, 1992, made in compliance with the appropriate rules F.R.C.P. 41(a)(2). If no renewed motion is filed on or by that date, this dismissal will be with prejudice."" On December 28, 1992, three days before the filing deadline, Durrani requested a 30-day extension of time, suggesting that the INS proceeding had prevented him from paying due attention to the section 2255 proceeding. The court denied Durrani's request holding that, ""[a]s this matter has been continued innumerable times and as the reason for requesting this extension is that the movant 4   himself has not given adequate attention to this matter, the motion is DENIED in the interest of finality, and the petition hereby ordered dismissed with prejudice."" Durrani did not appeal the court's denial of the motion. Durrani was released from prison in September 1992. In 1995, the INS declared Durrani deportable. Durrani challenged this determination and sought political asylum. According to Durrani, his efforts were denied in October 1997 because the INS deemed Durrani an aggravated felon pursuant to the 1996 Amendments to the immigration laws.3 Durrani then voluntarily left the United States in January 1998. Durrani claims he spent the next three years attempting to gain a visa to reenter the United States and that it was not until recently (at some point in 2001) that he realized the INS would not grant him a visa. On January 14, 2002, ten years after he was released from prison and fifteen years after he was convicted, Durrani filed the current petition seeking to vacate his sentence. Durrani argues that the court should grant the petition because prior to trial, and during the section 2255 proceedings, the government failed to disclose potentially exculpatory/impeachment evidence that could have corroborated his claim that he was working on behalf of Pires and Colonel North. Durrani submits that, if the undisclosed documents had been turned over, he would have potentially been able to link  In 1992, when Durrani was found guilty, his conviction was not classified as an aggravated felony. See 8 U.S.C.  1101(a)(43) (1994); Echendu, 2003 WL 21653370 *4. As such, he was not subject to deportation under the immigration laws in force at the time. Pursuant to the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (""IIRIRA""), however, Durrani's conviction is now classified as an aggravated felony, making Durrani deportable. See id; see also United States v. Luna-Reynoso, 258 F.3d 111, 113 (2d Cir. 2001) (upholding the application of the redefinition of aggravated felony to convictions prior to IIRIRA). 5  3   Pires to the CIA, thereby impeaching Moyer's testimony that the CIA did not use private individuals to gather military parts and that the CIA did not have any records of Pires. Alternatively, Durrani requests the court to grant him additional discovery to support his claim that he was working in concert with the United States government. Durrani believes that if his conviction is vacated he will be able to obtain a visa to re-enter the United States. The government moves to dismiss the petition, arguing that his claims are procedurally barred because he previously litigated the current claims in his prior habeas corpus petition that was denied with prejudice. In addition, the government argues that Durrani's claims are untimely. Alternatively, the government argues that the petition should be denied on the merits because Durrani has presented no evidence that the government withheld potentially exculpatory/ impeachment evidence. The government then argues that Durrani should not be permitted additional discovery -fifteen-years after he was convicted, ten years after the habeas corpus deadline passed and seven years after he was deported -- to support an otherwise meritless claim. II. DISCUSSION A. Propriety of Collateral Attack. Prior to reaching the merits of the coram nobis petition, the court must determine whether, in light of Durrani's prior habeas corpus petition, which raises grounds identical to those in the current petition, the petition is properly before the court. Polizzi v. United States, 550 F.2d 1133, 1135-36 (9th Cir. 1976) (""Although principles of res judicata do not bar a prisoner from re-litigating on ... coram nobis issues raised in the original appeal, a district court may refuse to entertain a repetitive petition ... previously determined on the merits."") (internal quotations omitted) (citing Kaufman v. United States, 394 U.S. 217, 227 (1969)); see also Chin v. United States, 622 F.2d 1090, 1092 (2d Cir. 1980) 6   (recognizing that, absent special circumstances, once a matter has been decided adversely to a defendant on direct appeal it cannot be relitigated in a coram nobis petition); Willis v. United States, 654 F.2d 23 (8th Cir. 1981) (""[C]oram nobis may not be used to relitigate matters raised in a  2255 motion.""); Klein v. United States, 880 F.2d 250, 254 n.1 (10th Cir. 1989) ( ""[C]oram nobis relief is not available to litigate issues already litigated; it is reserved for claims which have yet to receive their first disposition."") (citing United States v. Keane , 852 F.2d 199, 203 (7th Cir. 1988)). It is appropriate to use the same analytical framework when ruling on the propriety of current coram nobis petition as when analyzing successive habeas corpus petitions. See Fleming v. United States, 146 F.3d 88, 90 (2d Cir. 1998) (recognizing that ""because of the similarities between coram nobis proceedings and  2255 proceedings, the  2255 procedure often is applied by analogy in coram nobis cases"") (quoting Blanton v. United States, 94 F.3d 227, 235 (6th Cir. 1996)). Accordingly, the court will refuse to entertain a coram nobis petition if: (1) the same grounds presented in the current petition were determined adversely to petitioner in an earlier collateral proceeding; (2) the prior determination was on the merits, and (3) the ""ends of justice"" would not be served by reaching the merits of the repetitive grounds in the current petition. Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1, 15 (1963) (setting the standard for determining the propriety of successive habeas corpus petitions); United States ex rel. Schnitzler v. Follette, 406 F.2d 319, 322 (2d Cir. 1969) (reversing a district court's decision to entertain a habeas corpus application when the application was factually and legally identical to one previously rejected on the merits by the Second Circuit). After applying the three-part test, it is clear that the court should not entertain the merits of Durrani's coram nobis petition. First, the grounds presented in the section 2255 petition are the same 7   grounds presented in the current petition. In his section 2255 petition, Durrani requested the court to vacate his sentence because, in part, the government failed to disclose evidence that the ""United States government knew at the time of trial that private people, directly or indirectly, including Manuel Pires, among others, were involved in the procurement of weapons, ... at the behest of the United States government or its agents and with their discretion and encouragement, as part of an effort to free American Hostages in Iran ...."" In the current petition, Durrani claims that the government failed to disclose exculpatory or potentially exculpatory evidence, either at the time of trial and/or during the course of the section 2255 proceedings, that would have linked Pires to the United States government's effort to export arms to Iran. Durrani argues that evidence demonstrating that the government was using Pires, a private party, to locate military spare parts, would have supported his claim that he was working with Pires to secure arms for the United States to ship to Iran. Accordingly, Durrani presents the same grounds for relief in the current petition as he previously raised in his section 2255 petition. Fleming v. United States, 1993 WL 37304 at 2 (a ground for relief is simply a sufficient legal basis for granting the relief sought, and identical grounds may often be proved by different factual allegations) (internal citations omitted) (quoting Sanders, 373 U.S. at 15). In addition, it is clear that the habeas corpus petition was determined adversely to Durrani because it was dismissed with prejudice. Second, ""[a] dismissal with prejudice is a `final judgment' on the merits which will bar a second suit between same parties for same cause of action."" Cleveland v. Higgins, 148 F.2d 722, 724 (2d Cir. 1945) (recognizing that for res judicata purposes ""a dismissal with prejudice is a final judgment on the merits which will bar a second suit between the same parties for the same cause of action.""); Pfotzer v. Amercoat Corp., 548 F.2d 51, 52 (2d Cir. 1977); Phillips v. Shannon, 445 F.2d 460 (7th Cir. 1971) 8   (recognizing that the overwhelming weight of authority holds that a dismissal with prejudice constitutes a disposition on the merits). Third, Durrani argues that, the ""ends of justice"" would be served by the court reaching the merits of the current petition. The Second Circuit has interpreted ""the ends of justice"" ""to include situations in which the relevant facts had not been adequately developed on petitioner's first application, and instances where a change in the law had occurred since the previous determination against him."" Schnitzler, 406 F.2d at 321 (interpreting Sanders, 373 U.S. at 16-17); United States v. Bradford, 178 F. Supp. 709, 711 (D.C.N.Y. 1959). Neither of those situations applies here. Durrani submits, in principal part, an internal OIC memorandum (hereinafter referred to as ""Exhibit 8"")4 as evidence in support of his claim that the government was untruthful about its association with Pires and that the government withheld potentially exculpatory or impeachment evidence. Exhibit 8 does not indicate that either Durrani or Pires worked on behalf of the United States government or one of its agencies. At most, Exhibit 8 suggests that, in 1988, the CIA possessed a document that  4  Exhibit 8 reads as follows:  TO: Bob Scwartz FROM: Randy Bellows DATE: January 11, 1988 RE: Durrani The CIA showed me a document yesterday concerning IGAM (International Gray Arms Market). In it were references to one or more of the individuals listed in paragraphs [sic] 5 of my Durrani Brady list. (The names are Pires, Dost, Zadeh.) I've requested this document from the CIA and asked Rick Page to draw it to your attention when it comes in. This is a document we may want to turn over to the USAO (although we'll probably need CIA's ""Third Agency"" permission to do so.) cc: Rick Page 9   connected Pires to the international gray arms market. Even assuming that the CIA had evidence of such a connection, that connection does not lend support to Durrani's claim that he worked directly or indirectly for the United States government.5 Moreover, the ends of justice would  not be served by reaching the merits of the current petition. Durrani was given until December 31, 1992, to gather evidence to support his section 2255 petition. On December 28, 1992, Durrani requested a 30-day extension to support his claim. The request was denied. If Durrani believed that the court erroneously denied the deadline extension, he should have appealed. Instead, Durrani asks the court to take up what amount to a successive section 2255 petition some ten years later after the deadline passed. In sum, the petitioner has made no showing warranting reconsideration of his claim. Durrani's claim that he was excused from the licensing provisions or that he received an inequitable sentence in light of his work on behalf of the United States government was developed at trial, on appeal, in the Rule 35 motion and in the section 2255 proceeding. This is Durrani's fourth post-conviction attempt to litigate the same issue that has previously and repeatedly been decided against him. In the current  Durrani also submitted an affidavit of Pires (""Exhibit 6""). The affidavit is unsworn. In addition, Pires does not claim in the affidavit to have been working for the United States government or any agency of the government. Rather, Pires states that he was working with the government of Iran to purchase military equipment from Israel and from Israeli companies. At oral argument, Durrani's counsel admitted that the affidavit ""does not say in any shape or form that [Durrani] was operating with the United States Government."" Tr. 07/25/03 at 17. Durrani also submitted correspondence between the United States Attorney's Office and the OIC relating to potential communications between Durrani and Pires. See Durrani's Exhibits 15 and 16. Durrani contends that, because the correspondence indicates that each side would search for files or records relevant to Durrani's defense, such records or files actually existed. Consistent with his argument regarding Exhibit 8, without knowledge that any relevant documents exist, Durrani requests the court to speculate that the government possesses evidence in support of his claims. 10  5   petition, Durrani provides no new credible evidence supporting his connection to the United States government. Accordingly, in the absence of credible new evidence or a change of law, Durrani is not entitled to another review of that issue. See Schnitzler, 406 F.2d at 321; United States v. Stimac, 684 F. Supp. 545, 547 (""even if [Stimac] could move under coram nobis, the writ presently before the court raises the same Brady claim that this Court determined petitioner Stimac procedurally defaulted on in his previous  2255 motions""). Durrani's present petition is procedurally barred. Nevertheless, because it is always possible that the appellate court may disagree, this decision will consider the merits of the coram nobis petition. B. Coram Nobis  Pursuant to the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C.  1651(a), a district court is authorized to grant the common law writ of error coram nobis. 28 U.S.C.  1651(a) (""The Supreme Court and all courts established by Act of Congress may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions agreeable to the usages and principles of law.""); United States v. Morgan, 346 U.S. 502, 511 (1954) (holding that the enactment of 28 U.S.C.  2255 did not supersede the availability of writ of coram nobis). The writ is available as a ""remedy of last resort for petitioners who are no longer in custody pursuant to a criminal conviction and therefore cannot pursue direct review or collateral relief by means of a writ of habeas corpus."" Fleming v. United States, 146 F.3d 88, 89-90 (2d Cir. 1998). The court is authorized to grant the writ, however, only ""under circumstances compelling such action to achieve justice."" Morgan, 346 U.S. at 511; Carlisle v. United States, 517 U.S. 416, 429 (1996) (stating that ""it is difficult to conceive of a situation in a federal criminal case today where [a writ of coram nobis ] would be necessary or appropriate."" (bracketed material in original) (quoting United 11   States v. Smith, 331 U.S. 469, 475 n.4 (1947)); United States v. LaPlante, 57 F.3d 252, 253 (2d Cir. 1995) (""Though formally abolished in civil cases, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b), the writs of error coram nobis and audita querela remain available in very limited circumstances with respect to criminal convictions.""). The writ is issued ""to correct errors of fact unknown to the court at the time of the judgment, without fault of the defendant, which, if known, would probably have prevented the judgment."" Morgan, 346 U.S. at 516. In evaluating a coram nobis claim, the proceedings leading to the petitioner's conviction are presumed to be correct, and the burden rests on the petitioner to demonstrate that: (1) sound reasons exist for his failure to seek appropriate relief earlier; (2) he continues to suffer legal consequences from his conviction that may be remedied by granting of the writ; and (3) granting such relief is necessary under the circumstances to achieve justice. Foont v. United States, 93 F.3d 76, 79 (2d Cir. 1996); Morgan, 346 U.S. at 512. 1. Sound Reasons for Delay The first issue is whether petitioner's delay in seeking relief renders coram nobis relief unavailable. Foont , 93 F.3d at 79. More specifically, the petitioner has the burden to provide sound reasons why he failed to secure prior collateral relief, see Morgan, 346 U.S. at 512; Foont , 93 F.3d at 79, which includes why he failed to seek prior coram nobis relief. See Echendu v. United States, 2003 WL 21653370 *7 (E.D.N.Y. 2003) (finding that petitioner had not offered a sound reason for the delay in seeking earlier collateral relief and in seeking earlier coram nobis relief). In addition, the ""availability"" of prior relief is determined by whether or not petitioner could attempt to secure such relief; it is irrelevant whether or not the petitioner would actually be successful in securing it. United 12   States v. Farley, 971 F. Supp. 184 (E.D. Pa. 1997) (clarifying that the fact that a petitioner is unable to secure  2255 relief does not mean that such relief in ""unavailable"" for purposes of coram nobis analysis), citing Bennett v. United States, 1997 WL 285987 (N.D. Il. 1997); Collins v. United States, 2000 WL 516892 * 6 (E.D.N.Y. 2000) (dismissing Collins' petition for coram nobis because ""Collins [could] not argue that his claim is one that could not have been addressed in any other post-conviction proceeding.""). Durrani has not offered any justification why he failed to seek available collateral relief earlier. He cannot argue that his claim is one that could not have been addressed in any other prior postconviction proceeding because Durrani, in fact, raised the same claim in a prior post-conviction proceeding, namely the section 2255 proceeding. In the current petition, as well as in the section 2255 petition, Durrani argued that the government withheld information that would have supported Durrani's claim that private individuals, including Manuel Pires, secured military parts on behalf of the United States government for shipment to Iran. Accordingly, Durrani is precluded from raising the same claim in the current proceedings because prior post-conviction relief was available. The fact that Durrani was unable to comply with the section 2255 deadline does not mean that prior section 2255 relief was not available, it only means that Durrani was unable to secure it. See Farley, 971 F. Supp. at 186. In addition, Durrani has failed to adequately explain why he did not seek coram nobis relief earlier. Durrani claims that, in order to conserve limited personal and judicial resources, he attempted to resolve his immigration proceedings prior to seeking coram nobis relief. Durrani admits that ""[a]lthough it is true that [the] INS efforts also served as the basis for his delays ten years ago, rather than burden the Court with proceedings that could have become moot through a simple administrative 13   decision, [he] instead chose to wait until it was clear no relief was forthcoming."" Durrani Reply Memo. Doc. # 13, at 4; see also Tr. 07/25/03, at 4. This argument fails for several reasons. First, Durrani's concern not to burden the court by filing a proceeding does not excuse Durrani from waiting ten years since he was released from prison to file the current petition. In general, there is nothing inconsistent with a criminal defendant pursing both immigration and judicial remedies simultaneously. Although, in certain circumstances, the pendency of immigration proceedings can justify a short delay in filing a coram nobis petition, such circumstances do not exist in this case. For example, in Tocci v. United States, 178 F. Supp. 2d 176, 181 (N.D.N.Y. 2001), the petitioner filed his habeas corpus petition four months late, yet the court construed the tardy habeas petition as a coram nobis petition. The court excused the four-month delay ""given the absence of counsel and of any advice to Tocci of his right to appeal, given the commencement and continued pendency of the removal proceeding, given the absence of any other direct or collateral reviews of Tocci's claims, and given the [brief four-month] period of delay."" Id. at 182. In the present case, Durrani missed the habeas deadline by ten years and was represented on direct appeal, during the section 2255 proceedings, and on his Rule 35 motion. Whereas Tocci had not availed himself of other avenues of direct or collateral review, the current motion is Durrani's fourth attempt at post-conviction relief. Second, Durrani erroneously believes that, in analyzing the sufficiency of the sound reason for delay in filing the coram nobis petition, the court should measure the period of delay from the completion of the immigration proceedings until the filing of the coram nobis petition. To the court's knowledge, however, no other court has used the date on which immigration proceedings are 14   completed as the appropriate commencement point for analyzing a petitioner's delay in filing a coram nobis petition. In United States v. Ko, 1999 WL 1216730, *4 (S.D.N.Y. 1999), the court noted that the appropriate time period in which to analyze a petitioner's delay in filing a coram nobis petition commences with the date of the deportation order. Under that standard, and in light of Durrani's claim that the INS classified him as deportable in 1995,6 Durrani waited approximately seven years to file the current petition. Alternatively, the court in Echendu v. United States, 2003 WL 21653370 *5 (E.D.N.Y. 2003), held that petitioner's delay in filing a corum nobis petition seeking relief from deportation proceedings ""is properly calculated with reference to the period between the day the IIRIRA was enacted [September 30, 1996] and the day the petition was filed ...."" Under this time frame, Durrani waited approximately six years. Regardless of which measure the court uses, Durrani has not provided a sufficient excuse for the tremendous delay in filing his petition. See Tocci, 178 F. Supp. 2d at 181 (""[T]he sufficiency of the reasons bears an inverse relationship to the length of the delay -- the longer the delay, the more compelling must be the reasons.""). Typically, ""[i]n the absence of a sound reasons provided by the petitioner, the courts have generally found that a belated petition for coram nobis should be dismissed if its filing has been delayed for more than several years."" Echendu, 2003 WL 21653370 *6 (petitioner barred by unjustified seven-year delay); Foont , 93 F.3d at 80 (petitioner barred by unjustified fouryear-and-eight-month delay); Mastrogiacomo v. United States, 2001 WL 799741, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 16, 2001) (petitioner barred by unjustified three-year delay); cf. Nicks v. United States, 835 F.  Even if the INS erroneously classified him as deportable in 1995, as Durrani claims, Durrani was still on notice in 1995 that the INS was going to deport him. 15  6   Supp. 151, 155 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (petitioner justified a fifteen-year delay because ""[a]t no time revealed by the post-sentencing record was Nicks in a condition to evaluate the need for and prospects of coram nobis relief, or to instruct his attorneys in that regard.""). The court does not accept Durrani's concern for conserving personal and judicial resources as a legitimate reason to delay the filing of a coram nobis petition because there is nothing inconsistent with pursuing immigration and judicial remedies simultaneously. Moreover, as compared to Tocci, there are no special circumstances excusing the delay. This is Durrani's fourth attempt at post-conviction relief and he was provided with able counsel throughout his judicial proceedings. Accordingly, because Durrani has not provided a sufficient justification for his failure to seek earlier available collateral relief and earlier coram nobis relief, the court need not consider the other elements of the coram nobis petition. In an exercise of caution, however, the court will examine whether Durrani has satisfied the third prong of the coram nobis evaluation. 7  The court recognizes that a petitioner's inability to re-enter the United States as a collateral consequence to a criminal conviction is a sufficient legal consequence for coram nobis relief. See Tapia Garcia v. INS., 237 F. 3d 1216, 1218 (10th Cir. 2001) (alien's ""inability to reenter and reside legally in the United States with his family is a collateral consequence of his deportation because it is clearly a concrete disadvantage imposed as a matter of law""); Steel v. Blackman, 236 F.3d 130, 135 n.4 (3d Cir. 2001) (""Erroneous conviction of an aggravated felony will have several continuing and serious legal consequences for [alien], including serving as a permanent bar preventing his return to the United States to visit his family.""); Ko, WL 1216730, at *4 (holding that deportation proceedings sufficient to demonstrate adverse legal consequences); Polanco v. United States, 803 F. Supp. 928 (S.D.N.Y. 1992) (same). The government argues that, even if the court vacates Durrani's conviction, Durrani is still not eligible for re-entry into the United States pursuant to the IIRIRA given the nature of the conduct underlying his conviction. Because Durrain clearly fails to demonstrate the other elements of coram nobis, it is unnecessary to determine which party has the correct interpretation of the effect of the IIRIRA. 16  7   2. Compelling Circumstances To demonstrate compelling circumstances, a petitioner must show a defect in the proceedings that resulted in a ""complete miscarriage of justice."" Davis v. United States, 417 U.S. 333, 346 (1974). Durrani's ""compelling circumstances"" argument in support of his petition for a writ of coram nobis is premised upon an alleged denial of his constitutional right to a fair trial -- on the ground that the prosecutors withheld exculpatory or potentially exculpatory evidence in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). According to Brady, ""[t]he suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to the accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution."" Id. at 87; United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d 132, 139 (2d Cir. 2001). ""Favorable evidence includes not only evidence that tends to exculpate the accused, but also evidence that is useful to impeach the credibility of a government witness."" Coppa, 267 F.3d at 139 (citing Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154 (1972)). ""Evidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome."" United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682 (1985). Durrani argues that the government violated Brady, in principal part, by failing to disclose the unidentified document referenced in Exhibit 8. See Tr. 07/25/03, at 13 (""without a doubt, the primary reliance for at least the existence of [potentially exculpatory see id. at 7] is Exhibit 8""). It is not disputed that Exhibit 8, on its face, does not constitute exculpatory material because neither Exhibit 8 itself, nor the document referenced in Exhibit 8, indicates that Durrani worked directly 17   or indirectly on behalf of the United States. At most, Exhibit 8 suggests that the CIA possessed a document that potentially linked Pires to the international gray arms market. Even assuming that to be the case, the document would not constitute exculpatory evidence within the meaning of Brady. In addition, Exhibit 8 cannot be reasonably interpreted as impeachment evidence. At trial, Charles Moyer of the CIA testified that the CIA had ""no record of an association with Manuel Pires."" Def. Ex. 4 at 134, 139. Exhibit 8 indicates nothing contradictory to that testimony. Whether or not Pires was linked to the international gray arms market is irrelevant to whether the CIA was associated with Pires. In his affidavit, Pires himself claims to have been working on behalf of Iran. See Def. Ex. # 6. Moreover, Moyer testified that the ""if Mr. Pires had been employed by or associated with the Central Intelligence Agency"" that his records would have reflected that. Id. at 139. Durrani has presented no credible evidence undermining Mr. Moyer's testimony. Durrani argues that if, the unidentified document referred to in Exhibit 8 was disclosed, the document could constitute Brady material or the document could lead to the production of other documents that could be considered Brady material. As such, Durrani is arguing that the government violated Brady by failing to disclose potentially exculpatory and/or impeachment evidence. As such, Durrani's motions falls short of Brady's materiality requirement. Carter v. Rafferty, 621 F. Supp. 533, 549 fn.1 (D. N.J. 1985) (""There must be a real possibility that the evidence would have affected the result.""); United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 109-110 (1976) (""the mere possibility that an item of undisclosed information might have helped the defense, or might have affected the outcome of the trial does not establish, materiality in the constitutional sense.""); United States v. Williams, 792 F. Supp. 1120, 1229 (S.D. Ind. 1992) (... ""the rule of Brady is not a rule of discovery, but a doctrine of 18   constitutional error to be raised when specific evidence is withheld which deprives the Defendant of a fair trial.""). Durrani has failed to demonstrate that there is a real possibility that the government withheld Brady material. First, Exhibit 8 does not indicate that the government possessed the undisclosed document referenced in Exhibit 8 either at the time of Durrani's trial, appeal or during the section 2255 proceeding. Second, Exhibit 8 does not indicate that the undisclosed document referenced in Exhibit 8 is favorable to Durrani. At most, Exhibit 8 suggests that the unidentified document connects Pires to the international gray arms market. There is no indication that the unidentified document would reveal that either Durrani or Pires worked on behalf of the United States government.8 Third, Durrani simply hasn't demonstrated that there is a ""real possibility"" that the undisclosed document could potentially constitute Brady material. As such, Durrani's lack of evidence suggesting a real possibility the government violated Brady precludes the court from finding compelling circumstances warranting that court to grant the coram nobis petition. C. Writ of Audita Querela Writs of audita querela and coram nobis ""are similar, but not identical."" United States v. Reyes, 945 F.2d 862, 863 n.1 (5th Cir. 1991). Usually, a writ of coram nobis is used ""to attack a judgment that was infirm [at the time it issued], for reasons that later came to light."" Id. By contrast, a writ of  The same reasoning applies to Exhibits 15 and 16, which Durrani submits in support of his petition. Those exhibits are letters of communication between the OIC and the United States Attorney's Office regarding efforts to comply with the Government's Brady obligations. The letters do not indicate that the government, in fact, had Brady material. Again, Durrani's argument relies on pure speculation as to whether Brady material exists. 19  8   audita querela is used to challenge ""a judgment that was correct at the time rendered but which is rendered infirm by matters which arise after its rendition."" Id. It is meant ""only to allow a defendant to present a defense not discovered until after judgment was rendered."" Id.; see LaPlante, 57 F.3d at 252 (""Audita querela is probably available where there is a legal, as contrasted with an equitable, objection to a conviction that has arisen subsequent to the conviction ....""); United States v. Tablie, 166 F.3d 505, 507 (2d Cir. 1999) (recognizing the necessity of a legal defect in the conviction in order to obtain relief). In addition, audita querela is not available when the relief sought is available through another post-conviction remedy. Tablie, 166 F.3d at 507 (citing United States v. Holder, 936 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1991)); United States v. Logan, 22 F. Supp. 2d 691, 694 (W.D. Mich. 1998) (Where a petitioner's claims ""could have been pursued in a  2255 motion, they cannot come through the audita querela backdoor.""). Durrani is not now raising a new defense, rather he is raising the same defense that he previously raised on direct appeal and in his section 2255 petition, which was dismissed with prejudice. In addition, audita querela is not available because the relief Durrani seeks was available through alternative post-conviction remedies. Accordingly, Durrani's petition for audita querela must be denied.  D. Discovery In the alternative to granting the current petition, Durrani requests the court to permit him to conduct ""very limited narrow supervised discovery."" Tr. 07/25/03, at 19. Durrani's version of ""very limited narrow discovery"" includes requesting all documents that reference Durrani, Pires, or the companies involved in the shipment of arms to Iran, that are in the possession of the: Central 20   Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, National Security Counsel, National archives, INS and the United States Attorney's Office. Id. at 20. In light of the Second Circuit's statement that, ""[b]ecause of the similarities between coram nobis proceedings and section 2255 proceedings, the section 2255 procedure often is applied by analogy in coram nobis case,"" United States v. Mandanici, 205 F.3d 519 (quoting Fleming, 146 F.3d at 90 n.2) (internal quotation marks omitted), the section 2255 standard for permitting discovery will be applied to the present coram nobis petition. Accordingly, Durrani is not ""entitled to discovery as a matter of course, but must show good cause for his request."" Perez v. United States, 274 F. Supp. 2d 330, 336 (E.D.N.Y. 2003) (citing Bracy v. Gramley, 520 U.S. 899, 904 (1997)). Durrani argues that, because the document referenced in Exhibit 8 was not disclosed, it is likely that there are other documents that also were not disclosed. See Tr. 07/25/03, at 29. In addition, Durrani argues that, because the burden on the government to produce documents created or maintained over the past two decades is minimal, justice requires discovery if there is even the ""slightest"" chance of discovering Brady material. Id. at 27. Durrani is not permitted additional discovery. Durrani was convicted in 1987. He has sought post-conviction relief through direct appeal, a Rule 35 motion, and a section 2255 motion on the same issue that he raises in the current petition. He has previously been given extensive discovery on the exact same issue. Moreover, if he needed additional discovery in 1992, then he should have appealed Judge Daly's ruling rather than petition the court ten years after the habeas corpus deadline passed. In the current petition, Durrani presents no credible evidence that the government possesses Brady material. Given the lack of a colorable claim, the time delay, and the inevitably enormous burden that would be placed on the government and its agencies to comply with Durrani's discovery requests, 21   Durrani's request must be denied. See Perez, 274 F. Supp. 2d at 330 (denying a discovery request when it is appropriately characterized as a ""mere fishing expedition""). III. Conclusion Durrani's petition for a writ of coram nobis or audita querela [doc. # 1] is DENIED. In addition, Durrani's request to conduct discovery [doc. #1] is also DENIED. The clerk shall close this file. It is so ordered. Dated at Bridgeport, Connecticut, this _____ day of November 2003.  __________________________ Stefan R. Underhill United States District Judge  22"

When recipients open          the email, they find an advertisement for the sale of toner, inkjets and          other printing supplies.         ""The defendants were trying to make people believe they were receiving          important information from someone they already knew, when, in fact, it          was nothing more than a commercial pitch,"" said Attorney General          Christine Gregoire. ""When email spam is misleading and deceptive,          it's more than just annoying. In Washington, it's illegal.""         The lawsuit contends the emails violate the state's Unsolicited Electronic          Mail Act, which outlaws misleading and deceptive subject lines and false          sender information that conceals the email's true source. The Attorney          General's Office believes the defendants have sent thousands of emails          to Washington residents.          In a unique public-private partnership, Microsoft helped in this lawsuit          by supplying investigative information about the defendants, as well as          providing information about deceptive emails sent through their Hotmail          system to Washington addresses. Gregoire praised Microsoft for helping          her office with this case.         ""The filing of this case shows that the partnership of business,          government and consumers is effective. Spammers should be prepared to          defend themselves in court, overcome increasingly effective anti-spam          technology, and face better educated consumers,"" said Gregoire.         The Attorney General's Office is asking for a court order to permanently          ban further deceptive emails and is seeking up to $2,000 in civil penalties          per violation.

GX006-23-6554168	"For Release:   April                 17, 2003 FTC Asks Court to Block                 Deceptive Spam Operation                   Misleading Subject Lines Allegedly                 Exposed Unwitting Consumers to Sexually Explicit Material                   The Federal Trade Commission has asked a U.S. District                 court judge to block an allegedly illegal spam operation that uses deceptively bland                 subject lines, false return addresses, and empty ""reply-to"" links to expose                 unsuspecting consumers, including children, to sexually explicit material. The agency                 alleges that Brian Westby used the spam in an attempt to drive business to an adult Web                 site, ""Married But Lonely."" The FTC has asked the court to order a halt to the                 deceptive spam, pending trial. It will seek a permanent injunction at trial.                   According to the FTC complaint, the defendant sent spam                 with subject lines that would disguise the contents of the e-mail. For example, subject                 lines have included ""Did you hear the news?"" and ""New movie info.""                 When consumers opened the e-mail messages, they were immediately subjected to sexually                 explicit solicitations to visit the defendant's adult-oriented Web sites. Because of the                 deceptive subject lines, consumers had no reason to expect to see such material, the FTC                 alleges. In some cases, consumers may have opened the e-mails in their offices, in                 violation of company policies. In other cases, children may have been exposed to                 inappropriate adult-oriented material, the FTC complaint notes. The defendant's spam                 provides a hyperlink or an e-mail address for consumers who wish to                 ""unsubscribe""or stop receiving e-mail in the future. According to the FTC, when                 consumers used the hyperlink or e-mail address in an attempt to get off the mailing list,                 they received an error message - they could not unsubscribe.                   The FTC also alleges that the defendant used false                 ""reply to"" or ""from"" information in the e-mail, making it appear that                 some innocent third party was the sender. This practice is known as ""spoofing.""                 As a result, thousands of undeliverable e-mails flooded back to the computer systems of                 these third parties, deluging their computer systems with an influx of spam that couldn't                 be delivered to the addressee. In addition, it unfairly portrayed these innocent                 bystanders as duplicitous spammers, often resulting in their receiving hundreds of angry                 e-mails from those that had been spammed, according to the FTC.                   In papers filed with the court, the agency says the                 deceptive practices violate the FTC Act. The complaint says the defendant and his                 businesses have and will continue to injure consumers, and that the defendant has been                 unjustly enriched as the result of his illegal scheme. The agency has asked the court to                 halt the scheme.                   Brian D. Westby is based in the St. Louis, Missouri suburb                 of Ballwin.                   The FTC vote to file the complaint was 5-0. It was filed in                 U. S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division.

The suit names a California company and its two owners/operators.   ""Spamming is the scourge of the Information Age.  It burdens the Internet system, costs individuals and businesses an estimated $8 billion a year and is extremely annoying to those who find their e-mails clogged with electronic junk mail,"" Lockyer said.  ""In filing this action, we are sounding a warning that we will track down and prosecute those who send illegal spam.""   Named as defendants are Paul Willis of Northridge and Claudia Griffin of Canyon Country, as well as their company, PW Marketing LLC.  The defendants are alleged to have sent millions of illegal, unsolicited commercial e-mails promoting products that the company claims will help others make money through spamming.  The company's unsolicited e-mails advertise books, software and lists of e-mail addresses, including one list purported to contain only e-mail addresses of California residents.   Filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court, the lawsuit alleges the company violated various California consumer protection statutes that prohibit the sending of spam, using false addresses in advertising, failing to disclose required information, engaging in untrue or deceptive advertising and engaging in unfair business competition.     Since 1998, California has prohibited individuals and companies from sending commercial e-mail to those who have neither requested nor consented to receive the e-mail, or with whom they do not have an existing business or personal relationship, unless:      The sender has either established a toll-free telephone number that recipients can call to stop future e-mails or included a valid e-mail address that recipients can contact to stop future e-mails;    And the subject line of the e-mail begins with the four characters ""ADV:"" designating it as commercial communication, or ""ADV:ADLT"" designating it as sexual, adult material.    The state lawsuit seeks an injunction prohibiting the owners from engaging in the unlawful activities and civil penalties of $2,500 for each violation of state law by both individual defendants, or at least $2 million.    The lawsuit  filed against Willis, Griffin and PW Marketing is the first that the office has brought on behalf of the people of California. The Attorney General's Office recently defended the constitutionality of the California statute in a friend of the court brief in a case brought against spammers by private individuals. In that case, Ferguson v. Friendfinders, Inc., (2002) 94 Cal.App.4th 1255, the First District Court of Appeal in San Francisco ruled that California's anti-spam law is constitutional.   Lockyer noted spam cases can be difficult to investigate. ""It is costly and time-consuming to track down spammers who often hide their identities and locations by routing, or 'relaying,' their solicitations through unsuspecting or unprotected Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or the mail servers of innocent third parties,"" he said.   Even when spammers include mailing addresses and phone numbers that make it easier to track them, prosecutors need the help of consumers. Under California law, spam is not illegal unless it is actually received by a California resident. Lockyer encouraged California consumers who believe they are targets of illegal commercial e-mails to contact their local prosecutors or file complaints with the Attorney General's Office.

""Spam is an annoying invasion of privacy for our citizens and a costly burden to our businesses at a time when we're trying get the economy back on track,"" said Lockyer.  ""We will continue to strongly enforce our anti-spam laws to protect Californians from this high tech pollutant.  Spam cost American businesses about $9 billion in lost productivity and screening expenses in 2002, when spam accounted for roughly 40 percent of all email.""   The  judgment  entered by the court today came in the first action filed by the State of California under its anti-spam law.  Lockyer filed the lawsuit in September 2002.   Besides the $2 million in civil penalties, the judgment substantially restricts the business practices of PW Marketing, Willis and Griffin.  In future enforcement actions, the Attorney General's Office will use these ""injunctive relief "" provisions as a model.  Specifically, the provisions prohibit the defendants from:      Sending unsolicited commercial emails.   Disguising their identity by sending email that appears to originate from an email address that is neither the actual address nor the address where replies can be received.   Sending emails that contain false or misleading information about the country or Internet mail server from where the advertisement is sent.   Accessing and using the computers, computer systems or computer networks of other persons or businesses without their permission or in violation of their terms of service.   Using false or misleading information to register for an email address, Internet service or Internet domain name.   Using, transferring or otherwise making available to other persons email address lists compiled for the purpose of sending spam.   For 10 years, owning, managing or holding any economic interest in any company that advertises over the Internet, without first providing written notice to the Attorney General.    The lawsuit alleged the defendants sent millions of unsolicited email advertisements promoting products that PW Marketing claimed would help the recipients make money through spam.  The defendants' spam hawked books, software and lists of email addresses.   California's anti-spam law will be strengthened under a new statute that takes effect Jan. 1, 2004 (SB 186, Murray).  The law prohibits unsolicited email advertisements sent to or from any California email address, unless the recipient gives prior permission (under current law the recipient has to opt out), or has an existing business relationship with the sender.  It also permits private individuals to sue spammers and collect actual damages, plus $1,000 per email and up to $1 million per incident.   Lockyer encouraged Californians who believe they have received spam to file complaints with the Attorney General's Office.  Complaints can be filed by writing the Public Inquiry Unit at P.O.

Sweeney, is a Senior Regional Economist with the Corps.  Dr. Sweeney alleged to OSC that Corps officials manipulated the cost benefit analysis on the feasibility of wide-scale improvements to the navigation system on the Upper Mississippi River and Illinois Waterway in a way that resulted in a positive proposal for unnecessary and expensive improvements potentially costing in excess of one billion dollars.  The whistleblower alleged that Corps officials failed to comply with appropriate laws, rules and regulations when they manipulated key variables pertaining to the required cost benefit analysis contained in the Corps’ feasibility report.        The whistleblower was the original technical manager of the economic study of the project.  Based upon the information that he provided to the OSC, Special Counsel Elaine Kaplan determined that there exists a substantial likelihood that officials in the Corps have engaged in violations of law, rule or regulation and a gross waste of funds.        Pursuant to her statutory obligation (5 U.S.C. § 1213) Special Counsel Kaplan requested that the Secretary of Defense investigate Dr. Sweeney’s allegations and report back to OSC the Department of Defense’s findings, including the corrective actions it intends to take, within the statutory time frame of sixty days.        The OSC is an independent federal agency.  In addition to investigating and prosecuting complaints of unlawful retaliation, the OSC provides federal employees with a secure channel for blowing the whistle on violations of law, rule or regulation, gross mismanagement or waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health and safety.  By law, the OSC is empowered to require agencies to conduct investigations and report back to OSC whenever the Special Counsel finds a substantial likelihood that a federal employee’s disclosures demonstrate the existence of one of these conditions.

Boldt, Administrative Law Judge. At the request of the petitioner, a formal written transcript was prepared and made available to the parties in August of 1995. The parties submitted written briefs and the last brief was received on November 6, 1995. In accordance with sets. 227.47 and 227.53(1)(c), Stats., the PARTIES to this proceeding are certified as follows: Petitioner, Mr. Kurt F. Froebel, by Attorney W illiam S. Roush, Jr. Davis & Kuehhau, S.C. 111 E. Kilboum Ave., Suite 1400 Milwaukee, W isconsin 53202-6613 W isconsin Department of Natural Resources,by Attorney Thomas F. Steidl P. 0. Box 7921 Madison, W isconsin 53707-7921 FINDINGS OF FACT 1. Funk ' Dam is located approximately one mile upstream of North Lake on the s Oconomowoc River in the Town of Merton,in the N.E. quarter of the N. W. quarter of Section 15, Township 8 Norm, Range 18 East, Waukesha County. The Old Mill Dam was built around 1850 and rebuilt in 1890 and 1928. The dam was washed out in 1965 and in March of 1975. At the time relevant to decision of this case, in the summer of 1992, the dam consisted of three stop log section gates, each 3 ' wide and a 60 ' wide emergency spillway. The dam also involved a 350 ' long earthen embankment.  >  i   343-92-322 Page 2 2. The dam washed out in 1965. In 1971, the Department notified dam owner Mr. Gerald Quinn that the dam was in poor condition and recommended repairs that were necessaryto properly maintain the dam. There was a subsequentdam failure on March 12, 1975. The Department of Natural Resourcesissued an order requiring Mr. Quinn to repair the dam on May 6, 1975. The Department attempted to hold Mr. Quinn accountable for dam repair and satisfying the DNR dam safety requirements. Quinn refused to comply with the Department ' orders. s On November 17, 1982, the Department issued a Determination that the dam 3. was unsafe and abandoned and a Notice of the Department ' intent to remove the darn. Mr. s Quinn challenged the Department ' Determination. However, the challenge was ultimately s dismissed by the W isconsin Court of AppeaIs on May 28, 1985. 4. On August 17, 1992, the DNR began its drawdown of the impoundment behind Funk ' Dam in anticipation of dam removal. On August 18, 1992, the Department s prepared a public notice requesting comments on its proposal to remove the Funk ' Dam. s The notice also sought public input on the Department of Natural Resources 'Environmental Assessment(EA) for removal of the project. On September 9, 1992, the DNR conducted a public informational hearing on 5. the proposed removal of the dam and on the EA for the project. On October 2, 1992, the Department ' contractor began removing Funk ' Dam. s s On October 12, 1992, the North Lake Management District filed a petition for 6. a contested case hearing challenging the Department ' decision to remove the dam. The s contested case hearing was stayed pending judicial resolution of the issue of whether or not there was a right to a contested case hearing under sec. 227.42, Stats., on the EA conducted by the DNR on the dam removal decision. See: North Lake Management District v. DNR, 182 W is. 2d 500 (Wis. Ct. App. 1994). The W isconsin Court of Appeals held that there was no such right. 7. Petitioner Kurt Froebel submitted a Notice of Appearance, Notice of Motion and Motion to Intervene in this administrative review proceeding on December 19, 1994. On January 23, 1995, the Division granted Petitioner Froebel ' motion to intervene and s Petitioner Froebel submitted a Petition for a Contested Case Hearing on February 1, 1995. At some point in 1986, Mike Bozek, of Water Resources, DNR Southeastern 8. District conducted a mill pond sediment survey of the potential depth and distribution and transport of sediment then located upstream of the Funk ' Dam. The object of the study was s an analysis attempting to predict the amount of sediment to be washed out of the impoundment should the dam be removed and identification of the fact that under a failure a larger amount could be removed. (Ex. 4) The Bozek study undertook a cross section or transection across the stream channel to identify soft, transportable sediments as well as   3-83-92-322 Page 3 compacted sediments. Bozek used a 1.5 inch diameter stick and poked the stick into the impoundment sediments in order to measurethe amount of soft sediment potentially transportable. The pole method employed by Mr. Bozek was reasonableand appropriate under the circumstances. The methodology has been used by other experts in the field and is very similar to a technique used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. (TR, pp. 676-677) Bozek calculated a range of from 93 to 186 yards (80 percent water) to 23 to 46 yards (95 percent water) for the amount of sediment expected to be transported out of the channel and deposited downstream to the river and into North Lake. Bozek further estimated that 90 percent of the total potential sediment load was transported downstream when the dam failed in 1975. The parties essentially agree that an error was made in Bozek ' calculations. The s 1994 R A Smith Study concluded that the Bozek study made an error in calculating the volume of transect 1 and that the correct range was ""actually 610 to 1,220 cubic yards. "" The Bozek study underestimated the potential sediment available for transport upon removal of the dam and drawdown of the impoundment. However, the record is not clear as to how this underestimation affected the DNR drawdown/removal plans. Plainly, the Bozek study contemplated a potentially large volume of soft sediment available for transport. Further, in the EA, the Department observed that ""an increase in the sediment load to the lake is expected during drawdown. "" (Ex. 8) 9. In August, 1991 the State Legislature passedlegislation which authorized annual appropriations for fiscal years 1991-92 and 1992-93 for the removal of abandoned dams in the state by the Department of Natural Resources. Once appropriated funds became available, the Department began the process to remove Funk ' Dam. A drawdown plan for s the impoundment behind the dam was developed by W illiam Sturtevant, Assistant State Dam Safety Engineer. (Ex. 5) 10. There is no real factual question that Funk ' dam was unsafe and was s dangerous to life health and property prior to removal by the Department. The Depamnent was very concerned about the potential of flooding resulting from dam failure. A 1982 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers study determined that the dam provided no meaningful flood control for North Lake. Removal of the dam was expected to improve storage capacity of the floodplain and increase flood control for North Lake. (TR, pp. 168, 233, Ex. 8) Sturtevant conducted a ten-year inspection in 1988 and found the dam to be in very poor condition. The Department also believed that removal of the dam would reduce sediment transport in the area by stabilizing bottom sediments in the mill pond. (Ex. 8) A clear preponderance of the credible evidence supports a Finding that the Department ' decision to s remove the Funk ' dam was reasonablegiven Department concerns about public safety and s sediment transport.   3-SE-92-322 Page 4 11. The central issue in the case is whether the Department ' implementation of its s decision to remove the Funk ' dam was reasonable,necessaryand appropriate based upon s information foreseeabIeto the DNR at the time of dam removal. The Bozek smdy made several recommendationsto reduce the mass of sediment transported downstream: 1) Slowly lower water levels in the impoundment during dam removal. 2) Using a crane, dig a sedimentation pit in front of the present dam to act as in channel sediment pit. The crane can both be used to disassemblethe dam and dredge the sedimentation pit as it fills during drawdown. Spoils should not be deposited in the wetlands adjacent to the channel. 3) Only one dam structure should be removed to concentrate flow through one stream channel and maximize depth there during low flows. 4) Mud flat areas should be seededwith a wildlife seed mixture to stabilize these areas. (Ex. 4, pp. 6-7) At some unknown time in 1992, DNR Assistant Dam Safety Engineer W illiam 12. Sturtevant prepared a formal drawdown plan (Ex. 5) which set forth minimum requirements for the contractor undertaking draining of the ml11pond. A summary of the features of the drawdown plan is as follows: Steps and procedures for draining of the Funk ' mill pond are: s A. Erosion control in me form of a sediment barriers/traps must be placed prior to the initiation of the drawdown. Barriers are required to be installed both upstream and downstream of the dam. Install combination of pump(s) and syphons along the embankment and start draining the pond. Lift the top board of the gated section of the dam l/2 of its vertical dimension. As the pond is drained, rocks are to be removed from the breached section of the dam equal in elevation to the water level in the pond. Allow the pond to dram until the water level has stabilized at an elevation even with the bottom of the raised board. Continue to work at removing the rocks and concrete in me breached section of the dam as the water levels in the pond recede. The river will form a channel upstream of the breached section. Once use of the pumps and syphons becomes inefficient, remove the rocks and  B. C. D.  E.  F.   3-SE-92-322 Page 5 concrete in the breached section of the dam until the pond is completely drained. G. Remove rock and concrete fill in the existing breach area so as to drain the remaining portion of the pond at a rate not to exceed 0.5 feet per day. The breached section of the dam is to be opened up to a bottom dimension of no less than 45 feet with 3: 1 (horizontal:vertical) side slopes. The rock and concrete removed from the breach area shall be used along the side slopes of the breach in order to reduce further erosion of the earthen embankment. Sediment collected in the downstream sediment trap shall be left in place if outside the defined stream channel and removed by hand if deposited in the stream channel. (Ex. 5)  H.  I.  J.  There is no question that some significant features of both the Bozek 13. recommendationsand of the Sturtevant drawdown plan were not followed during dam removal. No sediment pit or basin was created upstream of the dam as recommended by Bozek. No sediment trap or barrier was placed upstream of the dam as contemplated by the drawdown plan. Downstream sediment traps were not effective nor properly pumped by the contractor. No pumps and siphons were installed along the embankment prior to drainage. Nor was all of the dam removed. The Department argues that on-site conditions made it infeasible to follow all of the above recommendationsand that there were legitimate reasons for the failure to follow the particulars of the drawdown and removal plans. The petitioner argues that failure to follow the plans and to undertake certain other sediment control measuresled to massive sediment dischargesthat could have been prevented. Accordingly, the alleged defects must be considered separately and as a whole to properly determine the reasonableness the Deparmrent ' implementation of the dam removal. of s 14. UW-Milwaukee Professor Jerry Kaster of the Great Lake Studies and Biological SciencesDepartment, testified on behalf of the petitioner. Kaster testified that excess amounts of sediments transported were the result of the Department ' failure to build s a large sediment settling basin, preferably in front of the dam spillway. (TR, p. 591) Kaster concluded as follows: the fact is that neither of these settling basins were constructed as recommendedby the DNR personnel. And that ' s   3-SE-92-322 Page 6 where the trouble began. It is possible to retain sediment, but it has to be done in a proper way, and it just -- I mean, when you walk on site and see what had been constructed to retain that sediment, the first thing anyone could do, including a lay person, is shake their head. Those sediment basins were simply too small. Id. The DNR argues that it was impossible to build the upstream sediment basin because of engineering problems in creating a basin large enough to be effective. The Department argues further that efforts to create such a basin would have re-suspendedvirtually ail of the sediment in the impoundment and released a much larger volume of sediment. However, it is not at all clear from the record why these conditions were not foreseeable to Department personnel. As early as 1986, as the EA notes, the Department estimated a cost of $2500.00 for construction of a sedimentation basin. (Ex. 8, p. 2) The Department was well aware of public concerns relating to the release of sediment at the time of dam removal. The record is replete with concerns on this exact issue expressedwell prior to design of the drawdown plan. Further, prior to the implementation of dam removal, Sturtevant had been to the site at least five or six times. (TR, p. 31) Sturtevant was aware or should have been aware of the soft sediment in the area, the lack of room for a large settling basin and the size of the impoundment. If the DNR was unable to overseeconstruction of such a settling basin in front of the spillway, Kaster opined, then the Department should have followed the recommendationsdescribed by former DNR water quality planner Neil O ' Reilly. (TR, pp. 591, Ex. 43) O ' Reilly prepared a RecommendedErosion Control Plan that included specific plans for the placement of a sedimentation basin in front of, that is upstream of, the Funk Road Bridge. O ' Reilly recommendedthat such a basin could have been constructed by placing either a sandbag dike, or steel or wood sheet pile structure in front of three culverts in the area to create a controlled impounded area. (Id.) The record does not adequately explain why the measuresrecommendedby Bozek and O ' Reilly could not be implemented. (TR, pp. 700-701) Further, if larger sedimentation basins could not have been constructed, the Department should not have representedto the public that it would build them, nor that the DNR ' efforts to collect sediment would be adequateto protect the navigable waters of s the river and North Lake. 15. Other suggestederosion control features were not followed. The downstream sediment basins were too small to be effective. The drawdown plan called for pumping of downstream sediment traps. Stmtevant testified that the Department twice tried to pump the sediment traps but that these efforts were unsuccessfulbecausethe material was so fine it resuspendeditself before the suction hoses could become operative. (TR, p. 65) North Lake Management Commissioner Terry Prust testified that he had actually observed the Department ' contractor pumping sediment from silt traps back into the river. (TR, p. 4.51) s When Prust asked them what they were doing, the contractor ' excuse was that the DNR did s not tell them what to do with it. In fairness to the Department, this was clearly not true, as s the Department ' bidding contract clearly specified areas to deposit this sediment. Prust   343-92-322 Page 7  concluded that the whole operation did not work as the DNR had hoped it would and that the drawdown was not undertaken professionally or well planned. (TR, p. 455) 16. Heavy rams occurred during the drawdown and removal efforts, causing the impoundment to fill several times. This required further drawdowns and discharged additional sediment into the river and lake. (TR, p. 300) 17. As noted, not all of the dam was removed as had been hoped. The Department ' EA had warned against partial removal of the dam for the following reasons: s Remove the existing concrete spillway and emergency spillway. This option would leave the placement of the earthen embankment. While eliminating some of the water quality problems the most significant drawback to this option would be the potential failure of the earthen embankment during high water. The RA Smith 1995 draft study concluded that this prediction had essentially come true and that the streambank erosion near the dam needed to be stabilized after the partial dam removal. The RA Smith study suggestedthat streambankswould benefit from placement of rock riprap on the 100 feet of streambank on the east bank downstream from the outlet. The study also recommendedthat the structural integrity of dam breach itself be stabilized. (Ex. 24, Chapter 4) 18. A considerable amount of sediment was discharged into the Oconomowoc River as a result of the removal of Funk ' Dam. The petitioners established through s photographs and testimony that large new muck and silt bars were formed after the dam abandonment. (TR, pp. 619-620; Exs. 32-35) Formation of these unstable mud flat areas were the direct result of the dam removal. The R.A. Smith sediment analysis concluded that the partial dam removal was ""likely responsible ""for the recent sediment deposits downstream in the Oconomowoc River and in North Lake. The report noted that there are noticeable sediment beds downstream of the STH 83 bridge and in the inlet to North lake; and these beds have possible negative effects on the fishery of the river and lake as well as the water clarity of the lake. (Ex. 25, Conclusions) Further, the petitioners establishedthat a large amount of silt not visible from the land surface was deposited into North Lake (TR, p. 573) and that such a volume of sediment would be damaging to organisms in the river and lake. (Kaster, TR, p. 594) Kaster performed testing of sediment transport from the Funk ' Dam mill pond to s North Lake before during and after the drawdown and partial removal of the dam. All of these studies confined that a large volume of sediment was transported as a result of the dam removal and that hundreds of tons of excesssediment continue to be deposited in North Lake as a result of the partial dam removal. (TR, pp. 584-585)   0  3-SE-92-322 Page 8 19. A preponderance of the credible evidence supports a finding that a large amount of sediment was discharged into the Oconomowoc river and into North Lake as a result of the partial removal of the Funk ' dam. The record taken as a whole also establishes s that these navigable waterways have been detrimentally impacted by the manner in which the partial dam removal was undertaken. It is difficult to sort out what portion of the increase of sediment transport is directly the result of the failure of the Department and its contractor to undertake the dam removal in a manner that better limited sediment transport. What is clear from the record is that the possibility of transport of a large amount of sediment was foreseeableto the Department. The DNR had sound reasons for removal of the dam; the Department properly planned for remova of the dam. However, as the dam was removed, the Department was too quick to throw out its drawdown and removal plans as being impossible to perform. While it is difficult to sort through the cause and effect of the Department ' actions in this case, the evidence supports a finding that the failure to follow s the recommended drawdown and removal plans was a cause of the release of a large volume of sediment into public waters. This case has a unique and extensive procedural posture that raise serious 20. issuesas to the jurisdiction and authority of the ALJ. This case was not noticed as an enforcement action or as a hearing on the reasonableness necessity for any remedial or actions by the Department or its contractor. There is no specific statutory authority for the ALJ to Order remedial actions by the Department or its contractor in light of the Division ' s conclusion that the failure to follow the drawdown and removal plan contributed to the release of sediment into the waters of the state. Under these circumstances, the ALJ believes the best course is to remand the case back to the Department to take such actrons as the DNR sees fit under the circumstances. 21. The Department did not error in failing to require a W isconsin Pollution Discharge Elimination System (WADES) permit in connection with dam removal. Vollbrecht and Sturtevant testified that the Department does not require WPDES permits for dam removal in addition to permits under Chapter 31. Vollbrecht testified that such a WPDES permit would likely have had similar conditions as the Chapter 31 permits. 22. The restoration of the dam is not feasible and may result in the transport of significant amounts of sediment. At the hearing prior petitioner counsel Lonsdorf essentially waived the issue of reconstruction of the dam, stating that the petitioner had no interest in putting back the dam. Further, reconstruction of the dam to meet existing dam standards would cost several hundred thousands of dollars. There is nothing in the record that any party would be willing to assumeownership and maintenance of the dam in the event it was reconstructed. Taken as a whole, there is no evidence in the record which would justify the extreme step of reconstruction of the dam. Further, this issue is outside the scope of the review of me reasonableness and necessity for the decison to remove Funk ' dam. of s   .  io  3-SE-92-322 Page 9 DISCUSSION Several years have passed since the removal of the Funk ' Dam in the late summer of s 1992. The contested case was continued for over two years, as North Lake Management District (NLMD) pursued the Environmental Assessmentissuesin the appellate courts. This decision, accordingly, will reflect a degree of hindsight not available to Department employees at the time of removal of the dam. The Department properly sought removal of an abandoned and unsafe dam. The DNR ' efforts to plan for removal of the dam were s reasonable. The actual removal was plagued by heavy rains, which played a big part in the release of far more sediment into the Oconomowoc river and North Lake man expected. Further, on site conditions made it difficult to follow the Department ' plans, and the s Department ' contractor apparently employed individuals who did not understand the basic s purpose of sediment traps. The result was release of a large amount of sediment into the river and lake. The parties both raise legal issuesas to the jurisdiction of the ALJ to order the Department to take remedial measuresnearly four years after the underlying events in this case. The Department argues under Village of Thiensville v. DNR, 130 Wis. 2d 276, 386 N.W.2d 519 (Ct. App. 1986), that the Department ' decision must be reviewed m terms of s the data and information available to the Department at the time the decision to remove the dam was made. Village of Thiensville, was a WPDES case interpreting sec. 147.20(1)(b), Stats. The Court of Appeals held, first, that the hearing examiner properly refused to admit evidence or to allow any challenge to WPDES permit terms that were not affected by the specific permit modification noticed by the Department. Other conditions of the permit, not modified by the DNR and not timely appealed by the petitioner, were held to be outside the review under sec. 147.20, Stats. Id., p. 282 Secondly, the Court of Appeals held that sec. 147.20, Stats. required that me hearing examiner limit his review to events which had been considered by the DNR. Id., p. 283. Village of Thiensville, therefore, affords administrative agencies fimdamental fairness in ensuring that review proceedings have finality and focus on the issues at hand or reasonably foreseeableto the Department. While Village of Thiensville is not a Chapter 30, Stats. case the ALJ believes these principles should be operative in most administrative review proceedings. The ALJ finds that the question of and sediment loading into the river and lake are directly related to the reasonableness necessity of the drawdown and removal efforts and that these issueswere reasonably foreseeable to me Department. (See: Finding #14) The RA Smith studies are therefore considered only for the limited purpose of correcting and commenting upon information available or reasonably foreseeable to the Department. The instant hearing was not noticed or contemplated as a hearing on the appropriatenessof possible plans to remediate sediment loadings. The petitioner argues that the ALJ has authority to Order remedial measuresby the Department pursuant to sec. 30.03(4)(a), Stats. It seemsclear that this provision governs Chapter 3 1, Stats., proceedings as well as those specifically under Chapter 30, Stats. Sec. 30.03(2), Stats., states that me   3-SE-92-322 Page 10 attorney general is authorized to bring proceedings to ""abate any nuisance committed under this chapter or Ch. 31. "" Sec. 30.03(4)(a), Stats., states in pertinent part: If the department learns of. a possible infringement of the public rights relating to navigable waters, and the department determines that the public interest may not be adequately served by the imposition of a penalty or forfeiture, the department may proceed as provided in this The department may order a hearing under ch. 227 paragraph . concerning the possible . mfringement, and may request the hearing examiner to issue an order directing the responsible parties to perform or refrain from performing acts in order to fully protect the interests of the public in the navigable waters. . The petitioner argues that this section authorizes the AU to enter ""whatever injunctive orders are necessaryto effectuate the purposes of the statutes--m this case to order restoration of the environmental conditions of the former Funk ' Dam impoundment, the s Oconomowoc River and North Lake. "" (Petitioner ' Brief, p. 30) s The ALJ believes the petitioner overstatesthe authority of the Division in this matter. On its face, sec. 30.03, Stats., requires ""a hearing under ch. 227 "" specifically relating to a ""possible infringement of the public rights relating to navigable waters. "" As DNR counsel notes, the instant proceeding was not noticed as a sec. 30.03, Stats., enforcement proceeding. Further, such a hearing is contemplated under the statutes only in instances were ""the department determines that the public interest may not be adequately served by the imposition of a penalty or forfeiture. "" In this case, the Division lacks authority to impose a forfeiture or penalty upon the Department. The record would not support entry of such a forfeiture or penalty in any event, as the department has not violated any prior condition or order justifying entry of such a forfeiture. Accordingly, sec. 30.03, Stats. does not provide authority for the ALJ to reach the issue of the proper remedies to restore the environment in light of the release of sediment. The Petitioner also argues that sec. 31.185(5), Stats., provides a basis for legal authority for the Division to order that remedial actions be undertaken by the Department. However, this provision is inapplicable to the present situation. On its face, sec. 31.185(5), Stats., applies only in caseswhere DNR is issuing a permit to an applicant to abandon a dam. That statutory subsectionprovides: 31.185(5) As a prerequisite to the granting of a permit under this section, the department may require the applicant to comply with such conditions as it deems reasonably necessaryin the particular case to   3-SE-92-322 Page 11 preserve public rights in navigable waters, to promote safety, and to protect life, health and property. It is evident that this statutory provision is inapplicable to the current proceedings smce the DNR is not required to obtain a permit to abandon a dam, but is specifically authorized under sec. 31.187, Stats., to remove abandoned dams. The ALJ concludes that the Division does not have authority to Order the Department to draw up a remedial plan to addressthe sediment loading in the Oconomowoc River and North Lake. Administrative agencieshave only such powers as are expressly granted to them or necessarily implied and any power sought to be exercised must be found within the four comers of the statute under which the agency proceeds. American Brass Co. v. State Board of Health, 243 W is. 440, (1944). The ALI can find no express nor necessarily implied authority to order remedial actions by the DNR under this unique fact situation. Further, it would be timdamentally unfair to require specific remedial actions by the DNR when the Department has not had the opportunity to specifically addressthese Issuesat hearing. As a practical matter, on the basis of the limited and largely one-sided evidence presented at hearing, some remedial actions by the Department or its contractor would appear to be in order. The RA Smith 1995 draft study may well represent a basis for the restoration of the river and the stabilization of the area to prevent further sediment loading into these waters. However, it is not for the AIJ to determine that issue definitively in the context of the present proceeding. The petitioner argues that the DNR did not allow sufficient opportunity for public comment prior to the decision to remove the dam. The public informational hearing in this case was held after the slow drawdown was begun. Clearly, the better practice would be to begin drawdown of an abandoned dam to be removed after holding the required public informational hearing. However, Department did comply with the procedural requirements by holding the September 9, 1992, public informational hearing prior to the actual removal of the dam. This is all that is required under sec. 31.253, Stats. Overall, this case and the participation of the petitioner, who did not himself file a petition to review until after the withdrawal of the NLMD request for a hearing, speak volumes as to the Department ' efforts s to include the public in its Chapter 31, Stats. process. Finally, the AIJ does not accept the proposition that the DNR needed to require a WPDES permit in connection with its dam removal efforts. Department witnesses testified that the conditions of such a permit would clearly overlap with requirements for dam removal. Accordingly, the petitioners arguments as to requirement of an additional WPDES permit are without merit.   3-SE-92-322 Page 12 CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 1. The Division of Hearings and Appeals has authority pursuant to Ch. 31 and sec. 227.43(l)(b), Stats., and in accordancewith the foregoing Findings of Fact to hear contested cases and issue certain statutorily defined necessaryOrders in casesinvolving abandonmentof dams on navigable waters. 2. Section 3 1.185(5) states that as a prerequisite to the granting of a permit to abandon a dam the Department may require the applicant to comply with such conditions as it deems reasonably necessaryin the particular case to preserve public rights in navigable waters, to promote safety, and to protect life, health and property. The DNR may remove or cause to be removed, in such manner as it deems 3. fit, old and abandoned dams in this state, upon giving 60 days notice in writing to the owner thereof, if the owner can be found. Sec. 31.187(2). The Department met all procedural requirements, of this section by issuing Notice of Intent to remove Funk ' Dam on s November 1, 1982, pursuant to then sec. 29.04, Stats. 4. Section 31.253, Stats. requires that the DNR hold a public informational hearing on the proposed removal of a dam when such a hearing is requested, as in the instant case, prior to seeking or causing the removal of the dam under Chapter 31, Stats. The DNR complied with this procedural requirement by conducting a public informatlonal hearing on September9, 1992 in the Town of Merton. The DNR has authority, in the interest of public rights in navigable waters or 5. to promote safety and protect life, health and property, to regulate and control the level and flow of water in all navigable waters pursuant to sec. 31.02(l), Stats. This section does not specifically authorize the Department to begin the drawdown process for dam removal without entry of a specific order by the DNR. No such order was entered in this matter. Section 30.03(2), Stats., statesthat the attorney general is authorized to bring 6. proceedings to ""abate any nuisance committed under this chapter or Ch. 3 1. "" Section 30,03(4)(a), Stats., states in pertinent part: If the department leams of . a possible infringement of the public rights relating to navigable waters, and the department determines that the public interest may not be adequatelyserved by the imposition of a penalty or forfeiture, the depamnent may proceed as provided in this paragraph . . The department may order a hearing under Ch. 227 concerning the possible infringement, and may request the hearing examiner to issue an order directing the responsible parties to perform or refrain from performing acts in order to fully protect the interests of the public in the navigable waters   3-SE-92-322 Page 13 The instant contestedcase hearing was not noticed as an enforcement proceeding under this subsection, nor would it have been appropriate to have done so. Section 30.03, Stats., does not provide legal authority for the Division to Order specific remedial actions in this matter. 7. Under Village of Thiensville v. DNR, 130 W is. 2d 276, 386 N.W.2d 519 (Ct. App. 1986), the Department ' decision must be reviewed in terms of the data and s information available to the Department at the time the decision to remove the dam was made. The ALJ has relied upon the subsequentRA Smith studies for the limited purpose of correcting errors in earlier Department calculation of sediment loadings and commenting on information available to the DNR at the time of its decision to remove the dam. 8. The DNR in seeking removal of the Funk ' Dam was not ""the owner or s operator of a point source discharging Pollutants into the waters of the state "" within the meaning of sec. 147.025(l), Stats. No WPDES permit is necessaryin connection with either removal of the dam or any continuing sediment transport emanating from the Funk ' Dam. s ORDER Wherefore IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, that this matter be REMANDED back to the Department of Natural Resourcesfor such actions as the agency in its discretion deems appropriate.

GX011-97-13607011	"MOUNTAIN LION FOUNDATION et al., Plaintiffs and Appellants,   v.  FISH AND GAME COMMISSION, Defendant and Appellant;  COUNTY OF KERN DEPARTMENT OF PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES,  Real Party in Interest and Appellant.    S053508    SUPREME COURT OF CALIFORNIA    16 Cal. 4th 105    July 31, 1997, Filed      Daniel E. Lungren, Attorney General, Roderick E. Walston, Chief Assistant Attorney General, Charles W. Getz IV, Assistant Attorney General, and John Davidson, Deputy Attorney General, for Defendant and Appellant.     Joseph J. Brecher, David L. Henkin and Joel R. Reynolds for Plaintiffs and Appellants.     B. C. Barnum, Sr., County Counsel, and Charles F. Collins, Deputy County Counsel, for Real Party in Interest and Appellant.     Robin L. Rivett and M. Reed Hopper as Amici Curiae on behalf of Defendant and Appellant and Real Party in Interest and Appellant.       The California Endangered Species Act (CESA) provides protection and management resources for certain native species of fish, wildlife, and plants in imminent danger of or threatened with extinction. Under CESA, the Fish and Game Commission (Commission) is assigned the task of establishing a list of endangered species and a list of threatened species. The Commission is required to add or remove species from either list when warranted, and to develop criteria for determining if a species is endangered or threatened.     The litigation in this case followed the Commission's decision to remove the Mojave ground squirrel from the threatened species list. The delisting decision was the first time since CESA's enactment that protection had been withdrawn from any species.     The Court of Appeal concluded the Commission abused its discretion in removing the ground squirrel from the list of threatened species because the Commission's failure to prepare and certify an environmental impact report (EIR) when evaluating the delisting petition violated the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). We conclude: (1) CESA can be harmonized with CEQA; (2) the Commission is entitled to an exemption from the EIR requirement of CEQA when it follows its certified regulatory program; and (3) the Commission abused its discretion in delisting the Mojave ground squirrel by failing to comply with its own procedures. We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.     I. Background     In November 1991, the Commission accepted a petition from the Kern County Department of Planning and Development (Kern County) seeking removal of the Mojave ground squirrel from the list of threatened species. As part of a process lasting nearly two years, the Commission, with assistance from the Department of Fish and Game (Department), solicited public comment, obtained an independent review and report on the status of the ground squirrel, and, after conducting an extensive public hearing, decided to remove the Mojave ground squirrel from the list of threatened species.     Mountain Lion Foundation and others (hereafter referred to collectively as Mountain Lion) filed a petition for writ of administrative mandamus seeking to set aside the Commission's decision. The petition alleged the Commission failed to meet the requirements of CESA, and the Commission's findings are not supported by substantial evidence. The petition also alleged the Commission's delisting was carried out in violation of CEQA. The trial court rejected Mountain Lion's CESA contentions. As to Mountain Lion's CEQA claim, however, the trial court determined that removing the ground squirrel from the threatened species list was an activity subject to CEQA, and that none of the exemptions to CEQA applied. Because the Commission had carried out the delisting without first preparing and certifying an EIR as required under CEQA, the court ordered the Commission to vacate its decision.     Mountain Lion appealed the trial court's judgment in favor of the Commission on the CESA claim, and the Commission and Kern County appealed the trial court's judgment in favor of Mountain Lion on the CEQA claim. The Court of Appeal affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding the Commission did not violate CESA when it delisted the Mojave ground squirrel but it failed to comply with the requirements of CEQA by not preparing and certifying an EIR prior to the delisting.     We granted petitions for review by the Commission and by Kern County.     II. Discussion     CEQA is a comprehensive scheme designed to provide long-term protection to the environment. (Pub. Resources Code,  21001; all further statutory references are to this code unless otherwise noted.) In enacting CEQA, the Legislature declared its intention that all public agencies responsible for regulating activities affecting the environment give prime consideration to preventing environmental damage when carrying out their duties. (  21000, subd. (g); see generally,  Sierra Club v. Bd. of Forestry (1994) 7 Cal. 4th 1215, 1229, 876 P.2d 505,  hereafter Sierra Club; Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v.  Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal. 3d 376, 390, 253 Cal. Rptr. 426, 764 P.2d 278,  hereafter Laurel Heights;  Concerned Citizens of Costa Mesa, Inc. v. 32nd Dist. Agricultural Assn. (1986) 42 Cal. 3d 929, 935, 231 Cal. Rptr. 748, 727 P.2d 1029.)  CEQA is to be interpreted ""to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language."" ( Friends of Mammoth v. Board of Supervisors (1972) 8 Cal. 3d 247, 259, 104 Cal. Rptr. 761, 502 P.2d 1049.)      Generally, CEQA applies to discretionary projects. (  21080, subd. (a).) A project is an activity undertaken by a public agency which may cause a physical change in the environment. (  21065; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14,  15378; all further citations to title 14, section 15000 et seq. of California Code of Regulations will be referred to as Guidelines.) A discretionary project is one subject to ""judgmental controls,"" i.e., where the agency can use its judgment in deciding whether and how to carry out the project. (Guidelines,  15002, subd. (i); cf.  Friends of Westwood, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1987) 191 Cal. App. 3d 259, 271-273, 235 Cal. Rptr. 788  [distinguishing decisionmaking discretion subject to CEQA from ""ministerial"" activity that is not].)     If a public agency proposes to approve a discretionary project, the agency's activity may nonetheless be exempt from CEQA by legislative command. (See, e.g.,  21080, subd. (b) [exempting specific projects from CEQA]; see also  21080.01-21080.03 [exempting construction and maintenance of specified prison facilities]; see generally,  Napa Valley Wine Train, Inc. v. Public Utilities Com. (1990) 50 Cal. 3d 370, 376, 267 Cal. Rptr. 569, 787 P.2d 976.)  Other classes of projects are ""categorically exempt"" from CEQA pursuant to administrative regulation because they do not have a significant effect on the environment. (  21084; see  No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal. 3d 68, 74, 118 Cal. Rptr. 34, 529 P.2d 66,  hereafter No Oil;  Dunn-Edwards Corp. v. Bay Area Air Quality Management Dist. (1992) 9 Cal. App. 4th 644, 653-655,  hereafter Dunn-Edwards.) Finally, CEQA does not apply if ""it can be seen with certainty"" that a project will not have a significant effect on the environment. (Guidelines,  15061, subd. (b)(3); see  No Oil, supra, 13 Cal. 3d at p. 74  [discretionary activity having no possibility of causing significant environmental effect not subject to CEQA].) A ""significant effect on the environment"" is a substantial or potentially substantial, adverse change in the environment. (  21068.) "" 'Environment' "" is defined as the ""physical conditions which exist within the area which will be affected by a proposed project, including land, air, water, minerals, flora, fauna, noise, and objects of historic or aesthetic significance."" (  21060.5.)     Whenever a project may have a significant and adverse physical effect on the environment, an EIR must be prepared and certified. (  21100, subd. (a); cf.  Bozung v. Local Agency Formation Com. (1975) 13 Cal. 3d 263, 277-279, 118 Cal. Rptr. 249, 529 P.2d 1017;   City of Livermore v. Local Agency Formation Com. (1986) 184 Cal. App. 3d 531, 538, 230 Cal. Rptr. 867.)  An EIR provides the public and responsible government agencies with detailed information on the potential environmental consequences of an agency's proposed decision. (See generally,  No Oil, supra, 13 Cal.3d at p. 81;   Sundstrom v. County of Mendocino (1988) 202 Cal. App. 3d 296, 307, 248 Cal. Rptr. 352.)  The EIR describes ways to minimize significant environmental effects, and suggests alternatives to the project, including the option of ""no project."" (  21061;  Laurel Heights, supra, 47 Cal. 3d at pp. 390-391;  see also Guidelines,  15126, subd. (d)(4) [""no project"" alternative to be considered along with proposed project's environmental impact].)     In some cases, notwithstanding a public agency's determination that a proposed activity may have a significant, adverse effect on the environment, an EIR is not required. Certain state agencies, operating under their own regulatory programs, generate a plan or other environmental review document that serves as a functional equivalent of an EIR. (  21080.5, subd. (a);  Sierra Club, supra, 7 Cal. 4th at pp. 1229-1230;   Wildlife Alive v. Chickering (1976) 18 Cal. 3d 190, 196, 132 Cal. Rptr. 377, 553 P.2d 537,  hereafter Wildlife Alive;  Citizens for Non-Toxic Pest Control v. Department of Food & Agriculture (1986) 187 Cal. App. 3d 1575, 1584, 232 Cal. Rptr. 729,  hereafter Citizens.) Because the plan or document is generally narrower in scope than an EIR, environmental review can be completed more expeditiously. (See Note, The Timber Harvest Plan Exemption from the California Environmental Quality Act: Due Process and Statutory Intent, 41 Hastings L.J. (1990) 727, 735.)     To qualify, the agency's regulatory program must be certified by the Secretary of the Resources Agency (Secretary). (  21080.5, subd. (e).) An agency operating pursuant to a certified regulatory program must comply with all of CEQA's other requirements. ( Sierra Club, supra, 7 Cal. 4th at pp. 1228, 1230-1231;   Mountain Lion Coalition v. Fish & Game Com. (1989) 214 Cal. App. 3d 1043, 1051, 263 Cal. Rptr. 104;   City of Sacramento v. State Water Resources Control Bd. (1992) 2 Cal. App. 4th 960, 976-978.)      A. Is There An Irreconcilable Conflict Between CESA And CEQA That Exempts The Commission's Delisting Decision From CEQA?     Kern County, joined by the Commission and amicus curiae Pacific Legal Foundation, contend there is an irreconcilable conflict between CESA and CEQA, and thus the Commission's actions pursuant to CESA must be exempt from the requirements of CEQA. As Kern County posits, CESA mandates a narrow, species-based focus that necessarily precludes consideration of many of the factors that must be evaluated in accordance with CEQA; thus, the Commission's compliance with CEQA will violate CESA.     1. California Endangered Species Act     To understand the interplay between the two statutory schemes, we review CESA in some detail. In 1970, California became one of the first states in the nation to protect endangered and rare animals. (Stats. 1970, ch. 1510,  3, p. 2998;  Natural Resources Defense Council v. Fish & Game Com. (1994) 28 Cal. App. 4th 1104, 1111.)  In 1984, these provisions were repealed and replaced with CESA. (Stats. 1984, ch. 1162,  5 & 6, p. 3988; id., ch. 1240,  1, p. 4243.) In enacting CESA, the Legislature expressly recognized that certain species of wildlife face extinction ""because their habitats are threatened with destruction, adverse modification, or severe curtailment, or because of overexploitation, disease, predation, or other factors."" (Fish & G. Code,  2051, subd. (b).) The Legislature further declared, ""It is the policy of the state to conserve, protect, restore, and enhance any endangered species or any threatened species and its habitat."" (Fish & G. Code,  2052.)     Under CESA, a native species of bird, mammal, fish, amphibian, reptile, or plant is considered ""endangered"" when it ""is in serious danger of becoming extinct throughout all, or a significant portion, of its range"" (Fish & G. Code,  2062), and ""threatened"" when it ""is likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable future in the absence of . . . special protection and management efforts."" (Fish & G. Code,  2067.) The Commission is responsible for maintaining lists of endangered and threatened species. (Fish & G. Code,  2070.) CESA requires the Commission to add or remove species from either list ""if it finds, upon the receipt of sufficient scientific information pursuant to [Fish and Game Code sections 2070-2079] that the action is warranted."" (Fish & G. Code,  2070.)     CESA requires the Commission to establish guidelines permitting interested parties to petition to add a species to, or remove a species from, the endangered or threatened species list, and directs the Department to recommend, and the Commission to adopt, criteria for determining if a species is endangered or threatened. (Fish & G. Code,  2071, 2071.5.) Accordingly, the Commission has regulations governing the submission and review of petitions for listing, ""uplisting,"" ""downlisting,"" and delisting endangered or threatened species. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14,  670.1.)     CESA establishes a two-step process by which the Commission decides whether to add or remove a species from either the endangered or threatened species list. ( Natural Resources Defense Council v. Fish & Game Com., supra, 28 Cal. App. 4th at pp. 1114-1115.)  First, a petition to list or delist must provide sufficient scientific information to show a listing or delisting may be warranted. (Fish & G. Code,  2074.2, subd. (a).) For example, the petition must provide scientific information on the species population trend, range, distribution, abundance, and life history, and ""any other factors that the petitioner deems relevant."" (Fish & G. Code,  2072.3.) The petition is referred to the Department for evaluation and recommendation either to reject the petition for lack of sufficient scientific information indicating the action may be warranted, or to accept and consider the petition because it includes such information. (Fish & G. Code,  2073.5.) If the petition is sufficient and is accepted by the Commission, the Department prepares a written status report on the species. (Fish & G. Code,  2074.6.) Other interested parties may also submit written comments and scientific reports. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14,  670.1, subd. (h).)     On receipt of the Department's report and recommendation, the Commission schedules a hearing for final consideration of the petition (Fish & G. Code,  2075), and decides whether the petitioned action is warranted or not warranted. (Fish & G. Code,  2075.5.) Under regulations tracking the definition of endangered species contained in Fish and Game Code section 2062, the Commission is required to find a listing warranted if the continued existence of the species is in serious danger or threatened by any one or any combination of six factors, including ""1. Present or threatened modification or destruction of its habitat; [P] 2. Overexploitation; [P] 3. Predation; [P] 4. Competition; [P] 5. Disease; or [P] 6. Other natural occurrences or human-related activities."" (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14,  670.1, subd. (i)(1)(A).) The Commission may find a delisting warranted if the Commission finds the species' existence no longer threatened by any one or any combination of the same factors. (Id., subd. (i)(1)(B).)     2. Implied Exemption From CEQA     In addressing Kern County's contention that a delisting decision is impliedly exempt from CEQA due to an irreconcilable conflict between CESA and CEQA, we are first guided by the principle stated in Wildlife Alive, supra, 18 Cal. 3d at page 195, that where exceptions to a general rule are specified by statute, other exceptions are not to be presumed unless a contrary legislative intent can be discerned. Nothing in the language or history of CEQA or CESA indicates the Legislature intended the Commission to be exempt from CEQA when carrying out its responsibilities under CESA. Accordingly, Kern County's argument must be rejected.     The Legislature has provided that certain projects are exempt from the requirements of CEQA. (See  21080, subd. (b), 21084, subd. (a).) The Legislature did not expressly create a CEQA exemption for the Commission's actions under CESA. Nor does CESA include an express exemption from CEQA. It is evident, however, that the Legislature knows how to create such an exception when one is intended. (See, e.g., Health & Saf. Code,  44561, subd. (a) [bonds issued by pollution control, financing authority exempt from CEQA]; Wat. Code,  13389 [state and regional water boards exempted from preparing EIR prior to adopting waste discharge requirements]; cf.  Dunn-Edwards, supra, 9 Cal. App. 4th at pp. 658-659  [nothing in Health and Safety Code evidencing legislative intent to repeal CEQA with respect to air districts].)     The Legislature amended CEQA in 1975 by adding section 21080.5, which allows state agencies with environmental responsibilities to use their own procedures for reviewing proposed projects in lieu of an EIR. If the Legislature had believed these agencies were exempt, the amendment would have been a needless act. (Wildlife Alive, supra, 18 Cal. 3d at pp. 195-196; cf. Sierra Club, supra, 7 Cal. 4th at pp. 1230-1231 [relying on similar reasoning to reject argument that timber harvesting is exempt from CEQA];  Environmental Protection Information Center, Inc. v. Johnson (1985) 170 Cal. App. 3d 604, 616-617, 216 Cal. Rptr. 502  [same].)     CEQA further provides in section 21004, ""In mitigating or avoiding a significant effect of a public project on the environment, a public agency may exercise only those express or implied powers provided by law other than [CEQA]. However, a public agency may use discretionary powers provided by such other law for the purpose of mitigating or avoiding a significant effect on the environment subject to the express or implied constraints or limitations that may be provided by law."" This provision strongly suggests the Legislature intended CEQA to apply to all public agencies undertaking discretionary projects and to the fullest extent possible, even if the agency's discretion to comply with all of CEQA's requirements may be constrained by the substantive provisions of the law governing the public agency. 1  Such an intent is inconsistent with Kern County's assertion that incompatibility between the Commission's species-focused determination to list or delist under CESA and the broader requirements of CEQA impliedly exempts the Commission's delisting decision from all of CEQA.           FN1  The dissent reads section 21004     solely as a limitation on the power provided by CEQA.     However, in making clear that provisions of CEQA may be     subject to the powers of the public agency, section 21004     also affirms the Legislature's intent that CEQA ""be used     in conjunction with discretionary powers granted to public     agencies by other laws."" (Guidelines,  15040, subd.     (a) [conforming the Guidelines to the statute's enactment     with clarifying interpretations].)       In its brief, amicus curiae Pacific Legal Foundation contends CESA exempts the Commission from the requirements of CEQA because ""a delisting decision under CESA is a nondiscretionary biological determination."" As previously noted, only discretionary projects are subject to CEQA. (  21080, subd. (a).) A nondiscretionary or ministerial project is exempt. (  21080, subd. (b)(1); Guidelines,  15268.) Thus, if the Commission's decision to delist a species is properly characterized as ministerial, it is exempt from CEQA. Contrary to Pacific Legal Foundation's view, however, the Commission's decision whether or not a delisting is warranted is discretionary within the meaning of CEQA.     The statutory distinction between discretionary and purely ministerial projects implicitly recognizes that unless a public agency can shape the project in a way that would respond to concerns raised in an EIR, or its functional equivalent, environmental review would be a meaningless exercise. (Cf.  Friends of Westwood, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, supra, 191 Cal. App. 3d at p. 267.)  Thus, ministerial projects ""involve little or no personal judgment by the public official as to the wisdom or manner of carrying out the project. The public official merely applies the law to the facts as presented but uses no special discretion or judgment in reaching a decision. A ministerial decision involves only the use of fixed standards or objective measurements, and the public official cannot use personal, subjective judgment in deciding whether or how the project should be carried out."" (Guidelines,  15369.) By contrast, a discretionary project is one which ""requires the exercise of judgment or deliberation when the public agency or body decides to approve or disapprove a particular activity."" (Guidelines,  15357; see  Miller v. City of Hermosa Beach (1993) 13 Cal. App. 4th 1118, 1138-1142  [applying these definitions to decide whether city's building permit process was subject to CEQA].)     The numerous statutory provisions and administrative regulations governing the listing and delisting process leave no doubt as to the discretionary nature of the Commission's delisting decision. (See, e.g., Fish & G. Code,  2074.2, 2075 [Commission shall consider petition]; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14,  670.1, subd. (i)(1)(B) [species may be delisted if Commission determines its existence no longer threatened by enumerated factors].) The Commission itself appears to understand its determination whether or not a delisting is warranted to be a discretionary one. In the ""Notice of Findings"" made in connection with the delisting petition at issue here, the Commission stated that under the statutory requirements of CESA, it ""must not only consider all of the evidence introduced in the proceedings, but also must weigh and evaluate it -- that is, it must determine whether evidence received is scientifically credible, reasonable and reliable."" We note that commentators have characterized CESA's listing and delisting process as ""quasi-judicial,"" finding the Commission's ""wide discretion to make listing determinations similar to a judge's decision-making role in a courtroom. [Fn. omitted.]"" (Dwyer & Murphy, Fulfilling the Promise: Reconsidering and Reforming the California Endangered Species Act (1995) 35 Nat. Resources J. 735, 745; see also Kelly & D'Angelo, Near Extinction: California's Protection of Endangered Species (Spring/Summer 1990) 10 Cal. Regulatory L. Rptr. 1, 4, 9.)     The procedural facts of this case provide ample evidence of the Commission's exercise of discretion. Here, the Department evaluated the delisting petition to determine whether it contained sufficient scientific information to show the petitioned action may be warranted. The Department concluded the petition was deficient. The Commission declined to follow the Department's recommendation, however, and accepted the petition for consideration. The Department then prepared a comprehensive status review of the Mojave ground squirrel, concluding the delisting was not warranted because the species was likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future. After conducting a public hearing on the delisting petition, the Commission voted to delist the Mojave ground squirrel.     Although the Commission is required to list or delist ""if it finds, upon the receipt of sufficient scientific information . . ., that the action is warranted"" (Fish & G. Code,  2070), this standard is not so fixed and objective as to eliminate the need for judgment and deliberation on the Commission's part. Pacific Legal Foundation's characterization of a delisting decision as ""nondiscretionary"" cannot be reconciled with the truly discretionary nature of the Commission's statutory responsibilities under CESA, or the Commission's obvious exercise of discretion in this case.     Where a project involves elements of both ministerial and discretionary action, it is subject to CEQA. (Guidelines,  15268, subd. (d);  Friends of Westwood, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, supra, 191 Cal. App. 3d at p. 271  [observing principle that CEQA applies even where agency's role is largely ministerial].) As previously discussed, the Legislature intended CEQA to apply to discretionary projects, even when the agency's discretion to fully comply with CEQA is constrained by the substantive laws governing its actions. Assuming the Commission's discretion to delist is constrained by CESA, the Commission is obligated nonetheless to comply with CEQA's environmental protection mandate to the greatest extent possible ""within the reasonable scope of the statutory language."" ( Friends of Mammoth v. Board of Supervisors, supra, 8 Cal. 3d at p. 259.)      Our conclusion here that CEQA applies to the Commission's delisting decision is consistent with numerous decisions of this court and the Courts of Appeal rejecting assertions by state agencies that an incompatibility between their statutory directives and CEQA requirements exempts them from compliance with the latter. (See, e.g., Sierra Club, supra, 7 Cal. 4th at p. 1231 [timber harvesting under Forest Practice Act]; Wildlife Alive, supra, 18 Cal. 3d at pp. 198-201 [setting hunting seasons pursuant to Fish and Game Code];  Bozung v. Local Agency Formation Com., supra, 13 Cal. 3d at pp. 282-286  [Knox-Nisbet Act];  Environmental Protection Information Center v. Johnson, supra, 170 Cal. App. 3d at p. 620  [Forest Practice Act];  City of Coronado v. California Coastal Zone Conservation Com. (1977) 69 Cal. App. 3d 570, 138 Cal. Rptr. 241  [coastal commission permit issuance procedures].)     In further support of its argument that CESA's requirements for carrying out a delisting are irreconcilable with and therefore exempt from the requirements of CEQA, Kern County urges this court to adopt the reasoning of  Pacific Legal Foundation v. Andrus (1981) 657 F.2d 829  (hereafter Andrus). The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held in Andrus that the Secretary of the Interior was not required to file an environmental impact statement pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) when making the decision to list a species under the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA). ( Id. at pp. 835-837.)  For a number of reasons, we decline to follow the reasoning of Andrus here.     First, Andrus does not present a strong case of statutory irreconcilability warranting an exemption from environmental review. As the United States Supreme Court's decision in Flint Ridge Dev. Co. v.  Scenic Rivers Assn. (1976) 426 U.S. 776, 49 L. Ed. 2d 205, 96 S. Ct. 2430  (hereafter Flint Ridge) strongly suggests, a federal agency is exempt from preparing an impact statement under NEPA only when there is a ""clear and unavoidable conflict in statutory authority."" ( Id. at p. 788.)      The question in  Flint Ridge, supra, 426 U.S. 776,  was whether the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) was required to prepare an environmental impact statement pursuant to NEPA before allowing a statement of record filed by a real estate developer to become effective within 30 days after it was filed. Under the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act  (15 U.S.C.  1701  et seq.), the Secretary of HUD has a duty to permit a statement of record to go into effect within 30 days unless the statement was inaccurate or incomplete. The Supreme Court recognized that it was impossible for the Secretary of HUD to prepare an impact statement prior to the date she was obligated to allow the disclosure statement to go into effect. Relying on language in NEPA requiring all federal agencies to comply with the impact statement requirement ""to the fullest extent possible"" (Flint Ridge,  supra, 426 U.S. at pp. 778-785),  the court concluded that ""where a clear and unavoidable conflict in statutory authority exists, NEPA must give way."" ( Id. at p. 788.)  The court held even if the HUD Secretary's duty under the disclosure act to effectuate the disclosure statement constituted federal action significantly affecting the environment, an impact statement need not be prepared. ( Id. at p. 791.)      Andrus acknowledged that federal agencies are expected to comply with NEPA unless there is a statutory conflict that expressly prohibits or makes full compliance impossible. (Andrus, supra, 657 F.2d at p. 833.) It also recognized the ESA provisions at issue in the case did not create the type of statutory conflict with NEPA that existed in Flint Ridge, and did not suggest the preparation of an impact statement would conflict with the Interior Secretary's responsibilities under ESA. Nonetheless, Andrus distinguished Flint Ridge as a case involving time constraints and the necessity of expeditious action by a public agency. (Andrus, supra, 657 F.2d at p. 834.)     Such a narrow reading of Flint Ridge is questionable, however, in light of the high court's characterization of its inquiry as whether requiring the preparation of an environmental impact statement ""would create an irreconcilable and fundamental conflict with the Secretary's duties"" under the statute at issue in the case. ( Flint Ridge, supra, 426 U.S. at p. 788;  cf.  Jones v. Gordon (9th Cir. 1986) 792 F.2d 821, 825-826  [federal environmental agencies not exempt from NEPA absent clear and unavoidable statutory conflict].) Absent such a ""clear and fundamental conflict of statutory duty"" (Flint Ridge, supra, 426 U.S. at p. 791), the soundness of the Andrus court's holding exempting a listing under ESA from the impact statement requirements of NEPA is open to question.     Kern County argues nonetheless that because CEQA was modeled after NEPA, and CESA was modeled after ESA, Andrus presents a proper construction of CEQA and CESA. This court need not follow federal precedent, however, when the federal provisions cannot fairly be said to parallel ours. (Cf.  Wildlife Alive, supra, 18 Cal. 3d at pp. 201-202.)  We find the federal statutes at issue in Andrus are different in significant respects from the statutory schemes at issue in this case. Thus, we find Andrus unpersuasive authority here.     In holding the Secretary of the Interior need not prepare an environmental impact statement before listing a species as endangered or threatened under ESA, the court in Andrus reasoned such a requirement would not serve the purposes of ESA or NEPA. (Andrus, supra, 675 F.2d at pp. 835-837.) The court found preparation of an impact statement for a listing would be a ""waste of time"" because the Secretary of the Interior has no authority to consider environmental impact when determining whether to list a species pursuant to ESA. (Id. at p. 836.) The court opined the legislative history of ESA suggests the Interior Secretary's duty to list was considered by Congress to be mandatory, not discretionary. (Andrus, supra, 657 F.2d at pp. 838-839.) Additionally, the court viewed the requirement of an impact statement before listing a species as threatened or endangered as unnecessary because, by listing a species and thereby working to prevent the irretrievable loss of a natural resource, the Interior Secretary is furthering the environmental protection goals of NEPA. (Andrus, supra, 657 F.2d at p. 837.) The court found the legislative history of NEPA to suggest Congress did not intend to subject agencies dedicated to protecting the environment to the requirements of NEPA. ( Andrus, supra, 657 F.2d at p. 838.)      The Andrus court's conclusion that the Interior Secretary need not prepare an impact statement before carrying out a listing also rested on the court's view that adding a species to the endangered species list itself furthers the purpose of NEPA, even in the absence of an impact statement. (Andrus, supra, 657 F.2d at p. 835.) Andrus found in the legislative history of NEPA an indication that Congress did not intend NEPA to apply to federal agencies having environmental responsibilities. (Andrus, supra, 657 F.2d at p. 838.) For several reasons, we find the reasoning in Andrus inapplicable here.     First, although Andrus's observation--that a listing serves the same environmental protection goals of NEPA--arguably supports the proposition that preparation of an EIR for a listing under CESA would be an unnecessary exercise, the same cannot be said with respect to a delisting. A delisting by definition withdraws existing environmental protections from the affected species. Unlike the arguably superfluous function served by an environmental impact statement in the listing decision at issue in Andrus, supra, 657 F.2d at page 836, to require environmental review as part of the Commission's delisting decisionmaking process serves not to duplicate but to further the purposes of CEQA, by bringing to light the possible environmental consequences of the proposed removal of protections from the species. Moreover, the Andrus court's reliance on the legislative history of NEPA to support its view that NEPA was not intended to govern the actions of federal environmental agencies has no relevance to our inquiry here. The federal courts have fashioned a functional equivalent test to exempt certain activities of such federal agencies from NEPA requirements. (See, e.g.,  Portland Cement Association v. Ruckelshaus (D.C. Cir. 1973) 158 U.S. App. D.C. 308, 486 F.2d 375, 384-385;  Appalachian Power Co. v.  Environmental Pro. Agcy. (4th Cir. 1973) 477 F.2d 495, 508.)  However, our Legislature has provided in section 21080.5 an express limited exemption from CEQA for qualified state agencies having environmental responsibilities. (Cf.  Wildlife Alive, supra, 18 Cal. 3d at pp. 201-202  [rejecting federal functional equivalent test in light of enactment of section 21080.5].) Thus, even if Andrus is correct that Congress did not intend NEPA to apply to federal environmental agencies, the enactment of section 21080.5 precludes the conclusion that the Legislature similarly intended to exempt from CEQA the state's public agencies charged with environmental responsibilities.     Unlike the Andrus court's determination that preparation of an impact statement for a listing under ESA would be a ""waste of time,"" (supra,  657 F.2d at p. 836)  we find a delisting decision under CESA that is made in accordance with CEQA would serve an important purpose in helping to shape and inform the Commission's exercise of discretion. The benefits and purposes of the CEQA process can be reconciled with the Commission's duty under CESA to make a species-focused determination when considering a petition for delisting. Indeed, we are obligated to harmonize the objectives common to both statutory schemes to the fullest extent the language of the statutes fairly permits. ( Bozung v. Local Agency Formation Com., supra, 13 Cal. 3d at p. 274;   Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. Arcata Nat. Corp. (1976) 59 Cal. App. 3d 959, 131 Cal. Rptr. 172  [harmonizing provisions of CEQA and Forest Practice Act];  Gallegos v. State Bd. of Forestry (1978) 76 Cal. App. 3d 945, 142 Cal. Rptr. 86  [same].)     As part of the CEQA review process, an agency that proposes to carry out a discretionary project must provide written responses to significant environmental objections prior to the agency's final decision. (Guidelines,  15132, subd. (d), 15362, subd. (b); cf.  Rural Landowners Assn. v. City Council (1983) 143 Cal. App. 3d 1013, 1020-1021, 192 Cal. Rptr. 325.)  Articulating its reasons for rejecting opposing views in written form while the delisting petition is still pending helps sharpen the Commission's understanding of the significant points raised in opposition to the petition. CEQA also requires the public agency to consider feasible alternatives to the project which would lessen any significant adverse environmental impact. (  21002, 21081;  City of Poway v. City of San Diego (1984) 155 Cal. App. 3d 1037, 1045-1046, 202 Cal. Rptr. 366,  hereafter City of Poway.) One alternative is ""no project."" (See Guidelines,  15126, subd. (d)(2) [""no project"" alternative to be considered along with proposed project's environmental impact];  Dusek v. Redevelopment Agency (1985) 173 Cal. App. 3d 1029, 1043, 219 Cal. Rptr. 346.)  CESA defines a ""threatened"" species as a species that ""although not presently threatened with extinction, is likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable future in the absence of the special protection and management efforts required by this chapter."" (Fish & G. Code,  2067.) Thus, when making its delisting decision, the Commission considers the environmental impact of a delisting decision on the subject species. Presumably, the decision to delist is a determination that the withdrawal of CESA protections will not endanger the species in the future. However, the Commission could further benefit by considering a ""no project"" alternative under CEQA during the delisting process. A delisting decision made in conjunction with CEQA's focus on significant environmental effects will better ensure the delisting itself will not have future environmental consequences that endanger the subject species, and will help prevent expenditure of the Commission's time and resources on a petition seeking the relisting of a delisted species that suffered significant effects as a result of the withdrawal of CESA protections. Under CEQA, a public agency must also consider measures that might mitigate a project's adverse environmental impact, and adopt them if feasible. (  21002, 21081.) Because the decision to withdraw CESA protections from one species could affect other species and flora that share the same habitat, the development, consideration, and adoption of feasible mitigation measures enhance the overall species protection goals of CESA while encouraging a more environmentally sound delisting decision.     In light of the distinctions between CEQA and NEPA, between CESA and ESA, and between a delisting and a listing, and recognizing the utility of the CEQA process to a delisting decision under CESA, we conclude Andrus does not constitute persuasive authority for exempting a delisting decision under CESA from the requirements of CEQA on the basis of an irreconcilable statutory conflict.     B. Is The Commission's Delisting Decision Otherwise Exempt From CEQA? (The Categorical Exemption)     Kern County and the Commission claim the Commission's delisting action was categorically exempt from CEQA. The Court of Appeal correctly rejected a similar contention.     The Legislature has directed the Secretary to promulgate a list of classes of projects that have no significant effect on the environment. (  21084; Guidelines,  15300 et seq. [29 classes of categorical exemptions].) A project falling within such a categorical exemption is not subject to CEQA. ( No Oil, supra, 13 Cal. 3d at p. 74;  Dunn-Edwards,  supra, 9 Cal. App. 4th at p. 656;   Association for Protection etc. Values v. City of Ukiah (1991) 2 Cal. App. 4th 720, 725-726.)      The Commission's invocation of a categorical exemption was in error for several reasons. First, a categorical exemption represents a determination by the Secretary that a particular project does not have a significant effect on the environment. (  21084.) It follows that an activity that may have a significant effect on the environment cannot be categorically exempt. (Cf. Guidelines,  15061, subd. (b)(3) [CEQA applies only to projects having potential for causing significant effect on environment; where no possibility that activity will have significant effect, activity not subject to CEQA].) As the interplay between the Commission's regulations and the Guidelines makes clear, the removal of a species from the endangered or threatened species list is an activity that may have a significant effect on the environment. A delisting therefore cannot be categorically exempt.     Under CEQA, an agency contemplating an action having ""the potential to . . . reduce the . . . number or restrict the range of an endangered, rare or threatened species"" (Guidelines,  15065, subd. (a)) must find that the project ""may have a significant effect on the environment"" (Guidelines,  15065), and a species that is currently listed as endangered or threatened under CESA is a ""rare or endangered"" animal or plant for such purposes. (Guidelines,  15380.) Under the Commission's regulations governing the review of listing and delisting petitions, a threatened or endangered species that is the subject of a delisting petition retains its protected status throughout the delisting process. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14,  670.1, subd. (i)(1)(B)(1).) Because the removal of a species from the endangered or threatened list withdraws existing levels of protection, a delisting creates at least the potential for population reduction or habitat restriction. Thus, the Commission is obligated to find a delisting may have a significant environmental effect. Such a finding precludes invocation of a categorical exemption. (Cf.  Dunn-Edwards, supra, 9 Cal. App. 4th at pp. 656-658  [holding categorical exemption inapplicable where adoption of regulations tightening emission standards for architectural solvents will result in adverse environmental effects];  International Longshoremen's & Warehousemen's Union v. Board of Supervisors (1981) 116 Cal. App. 3d 265, 276, 171 Cal. Rptr. 875  [same with regard to relaxation of air quality standards].)     The record indicates the Commission claimed the delisting of the Mojave ground squirrel was categorically exempt because it was within the class of ""actions taken by regulatory agencies as authorized by state law or local ordinance to assure the maintenance, restoration, or enhancement of a natural resource where the regulatory process involves procedures for protection of the environment."" (Guidelines,  15307; id.,  15308.) Contrary to the Commission's claim of a categorical exemption, however, a delisting action cannot be fairly included within this class of projects. Exemption categories are not to be expanded beyond the reasonable scope of their statutory language. ( Dehne v. County of Santa Clara (1981) 115 Cal. App. 3d 827, 842, 171 Cal. Rptr. 753.)      The delisting of a species withdraws a number of statutory protections. For example, CESA establishes a policy adding significant weight to the CEQA balancing scale on the side favoring protection of a listed species over projects that might jeopardize them or their habitats. (Fish & G. Code,  2053.) With limited exceptions, CESA prohibits the taking, importation, possession, sale, or purchase of any endangered or threatened species. (Fish & G. Code,  2080.) CESA also requires state agencies to consult with the Department to ensure that the agency's action is not likely to ""jeopardize"" the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species. A finding of jeopardy requires ""reasonable and prudent alternatives consistent with conserving the species which would prevent jeopardy."" (Fish & G. Code,  2092, subd. (a).) Because a delisting removes rather than secures these protections, the categorical exemption for actions assuring the maintenance, preservation or enhancement of a natural resource set forth in sections 15307 and 15308 of the Guidelines does not apply. (Cf.  Wildlife Alive, supra, 18 Cal. 3d at pp. 204-206  [categorical exemption for activities assuring maintenance, preservation, or enhancement of natural resource inapplicable to setting of hunting and fishing seasons];  International Longshoremen's & Warehousemen's Union v. Board of Supervisors, supra, 116 Cal. App. 3d at pp. 275-276  [exemption inapplicable to agency action leading to relaxation of air quality standards relating to allowable levels of nitrogen oxide emissions].)     Kern County argues that a delisting should not be viewed as an isolated action, but rather as an integral part of the entire statutory scheme of CESA. The county posits that because a delisting is merely part of the overall CESA process, and because this process provides for the maintenance, restoration or enhancement of the species, a delisting under CESA is categorically exempt from CEQA pursuant to the relevant Guidelines.     It is apparent that CESA contemplates delistings as an integral part of the entire statutory scheme. Ideally, the delisting of a species signals the successful restoration of a previously endangered or threatened population. Nonetheless, it is significant that CESA does not impose a requirement for species recovery planning as part of the overall statutory scheme. Although the Department is required to conduct a status review of each of the listed species and report its findings and recommendations for species recovery to the Commission (Fish & G. Code,  2074.6), CESA does not require the implementation of recommendations. For this reason, contrary to the County's argument, it is more appropriate to view the Commission's delisting action as an activity separate from the Commission's consideration of whether or not to provide CESA protections by adding a candidate species to the endangered or threatened species list. Because a delisting involves the removal of, rather than the provision for, the statutory protections of CESA, it cannot be characterized as an action taken to ""assure the maintenance, restoration, or enhancement of a natural resource."" (Guidelines,  15307; id.,  15308.)     C. The Certified Regulatory Program     The Court of Appeal in this case determined the Commission's delisting of the Mojave ground squirrel was not exempt from CEQA. It also concluded the Commission had to prepare and certify an EIR before removing a species from the threatened species list. In the court's view, the CESA procedures for adding or removing species from the endangered or threatened species list do not qualify as a certified regulatory program providing the functional equivalent of an EIR. The Court of Appeal also found the Commission's existing certified regulatory program limited to the establishment of hunting and fishing seasons and the related issuance of licenses. We do not agree.     1. The Scope Of The Certified Regulatory Program     As previously noted, section 21080.5 establishes a limited exemption from CEQA's EIR requirements for qualifying state agencies having environmental protection responsibilities. An agency that carries out its discretionary activities according to a regulatory program requiring an environmental plan or document may submit such a document in lieu of an EIR if the Secretary has certified that the regulatory program meets certain statutory criteria. (  21080.5, subds. (a), (d), (e).) For example, an agency seeking certification must adopt regulations requiring that final action on the proposed activity include written responses to significant environmental points raised during the decisionmaking process. (  21080.5, subd. (b)(2)(iv).) The agency must also implement guidelines for evaluating the proposed activity consistently with the environmental protection purposes of the regulatory program. (  21080.5, subd. (b)(2)(ii).) The document generated pursuant to the agency's regulatory program must include alternatives to the proposed project and mitigation measures to minimize significant adverse environmental effects (  21080.5, subd. (b)(3)(i)), and be made available for review by other public agencies and the public (  21080.5, subd. (b)(3)(ii)).     The CEQA Guidelines list the certified regulatory programs that the Secretary has determined meet all of the statutory criteria for exemption from EIR preparation set forth in section 21080.5. (Guidelines,  15251.) Among the programs on this list is ""the regulatory program of the Fish and Game Commission pursuant to the Fish and Game Code."" (Guidelines,  15251, subd. (b).)     The Commission's regulatory program was certified by the Secretary in 1976, shortly after this court's decision in Wildlife Alive, supra, 18 Cal. 3d 190. The court held in Wildlife Alive that in light of the Legislature's then-recent enactment of section 21080.5 creating an express statutory exemption from EIR requirements for qualifying state agencies, the Commission could not claim an implied exemption from CEQA when setting bear hunting season dates and issuing hunting permits. (Id. at pp. 195-198.)     The procedures adopted by the Commission in 1976 and submitted to the Secretary for certification of its regulatory program pursuant to section 21080.5 first appeared as section 3.90 of title 14 of the former California Administrative Code (now California Code of Regulations). In 1982, the section was renumbered section 781.5, without any change in the language. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14,  781.5; all further citations to title 14, California Code of Regulations, section 781.5 will be referred to as Regulatory Program.) The provisions comprising the regulatory program are worded broadly, and, by their terms, apply to the Commission's varied regulatory responsibilities under the Fish and Game Code.     The Commission's review procedures adopted for certification pursuant to section 21080.5 are applicable when the Commission is called on to consider recommendations by the Department regarding the adoption of regulations ""which may have a significant effect on the environment, or it is anticipated that a substantial body of opinion will reasonably consider the environmental effect to be adverse."" (Regulatory Program, subd. (a).) For the following reasons, we conclude a delisting under CESA falls within the express terms of subdivision (a), triggering the review procedures established in the regulatory program. First, the delisting process requires the Department to make recommendations to the Commission regarding petitions for delisting. (Fish & G. Code,  2073.5; see also Fish & G. Code,  2072.7 [in absence of petition, Department may make recommendation regarding removal] of species from endangered or threatened list].) Second, a delisting under CESA requires the adoption of a regulation. In order for a listing or delisting to be effective, the Commission must amend its regulations listing endangered and threatened species. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14,  670.2 [list of endangered, threatened plants]; id.,  670.5 [animals].) Finally, and as previously discussed, a proposal regarding the removal of existing CESA protections for a species on the endangered or threatened species list concerns the adoption of a regulation ""which may have a significant effect on the environment."" (Regulatory Program, subd. (a).)     Mountain Lion contends the Commission's certified regulatory program does not contemplate a delisting decision under CESA because CESA was enacted in 1984, subsequent to the Secretary's certification in 1976. However, the fact CESA was adopted after the Secretary's certification does not foreclose application of the procedures comprising the Commission's existing certified regulatory program to a delisting decision. To the contrary, it appears the Legislature intended a state agency's certified regulatory program to remain in force notwithstanding subsequent additions and amendments to the program, unless and until the Secretary withdraws the certification.     Section 21080.5, subdivisions (e) and (f) govern the possible effect of subsequent changes in a state agency's regulatory program following certification by the Secretary. Subdivision (e) grants the Secretary authority to certify a regulatory program, and to withdraw such certification after determining that the regulatory program has been altered so that it no longer meets the certification criteria. Subdivision (f) of section 21080.5 provides that once a regulatory program has been certified, ""any proposed change in the program which could affect compliance with the qualifications for certification"" may be submitted to the Secretary for review and comment. (  21080.5, subd. (f).) If the agency decides to submit a proposed change, the Secretary determines ""whether the proposed change will alter the regulatory program so that it no longer meets the qualification for certification . . . and will result in a withdrawal of certification as provided in this section."" (Ibid.)     In enacting these provisions, the Legislature appears to have contemplated that once certification occurs, alterations in the regulatory program through statutory amendment or regulatory change will not affect the program's continued vitality unless and until the Secretary withdraws certification. If the Secretary has not made the determination that changes in the regulatory program affect the qualifications for certification, a state agency acting pursuant to later-enacted amendments to its regulatory program may continue to generate an environmental document in accordance with its own procedures in lieu of preparing and certifying an EIR.     Mountain Lion did not seek in its petition for writ of mandate an order directing the Secretary to withdraw certification of the Commission's regulatory program on the ground it had been impermissibly altered by the enactment of CESA. Nor does it raise such a claim here. Because the statutory directives of CESA do not compromise any of the criteria for certification of the Commission's regulatory program, the Commission may properly utilize the review procedures of its certified regulatory program when proceeding under CESA. (Cf.  Laupheimer v. State of California (1988) 200 Cal. App. 3d 440, 459-460, 246 Cal. Rptr. 82  [Department of Forestry need not have resubmitted timber harvesting plan procedures to Secretary when statutory amendments to Forest Practice Act made after certification of regulatory program did not affect certification qualifications].)     Moreover, Mountain Lion points to nothing that suggests the Legislature intended the Commission to refrain from applying the review procedures of its existing certified regulatory program to a delisting decision. We may presume that when it enacted CESA the Legislature was aware of the regulations adopted to satisfy the requirements of certification pursuant to section 21080.5. (Cf.  Moore v. California State Bd. of Accountancy (1992) 2 Cal. 4th 999, 1017-1018, 831 P.2d 798.)  Indeed, as we concluded (ante, at pp. 19-20), the review procedures established by the Commission for certification of its regulatory program both complement and enhance the statutory framework of CESA. For these reasons, and notwithstanding the fact that CESA was enacted after the Secretary's certification of the Commission's regulatory program in 1976, we conclude the Commission is entitled to an exemption from the EIR process as provided in section 21080.5 by adhering to its certified regulatory program when carrying out a delisting under CESA.     This conclusion is consistent with the Commission's conduct prior to the litigation in this case. In a document entitled ""Notice of Determination,"" dated September 7, 1993, the Commission's executive director certified that the Commission found the delisting of the Mojave ground squirrel was ""taken in compliance with [the Commission's regulatory program] and Section 21080.5 of the Public Resources Code . . . ."" Although the Commission's further declaration the delisting of the Mojave ground squirrel ""will not have a significant adverse effect on the environment"" was in error, as previously discussed, the Commission's asserted consideration of the possible environmental effects of the delisting decision under the auspices of its certified regulatory program and section 21080.5 provides strong evidence that the Commission can comply with CEQA to the fullest possible extent when evaluating a delisting petition.     As previously noted, the Secretary's certification of the Commission's regulatory program is expressed in broad terms as ""the regulatory program of the Fish and Game Commission pursuant to the Fish and Game Code."" (Guidelines,  15251, subd. (b).) Notwithstanding the broadly worded certification, the Court of Appeal concluded the procedures for generating a substitute environmental document did not apply to a delisting under CESA because the certified regulatory program governed only the Commission's establishment of hunting and fishing seasons and issuance of licenses. For several reasons, we disagree with the Court of Appeal's conclusion.     In describing the Commission's certified regulatory program, the Secretary did not qualify or limit its scope to hunting and fishing regulations. The Secretary clearly had the ability and authority to do so, however. In a number of instances, the Secretary has certified a regulatory program that is narrowly defined and restrictive in scope. For example, the Secretary has certified ""that portion of the regulatory program of the Air Resources Board which involves the adoption, approval, amendment, or repeal of standards, rules, regulations, or plans to be used in the regulatory program for the protection and enhancement of ambient air quality."" (Guidelines,  15251, subd. (d); see also id.,  15251, subds. (a) [certifying regulation of timber harvesting operations pursuant to chapter 8, commencing with section 4511, of part 2 of division 4 of the Public Resources Code], (i) [certifying pesticide regulatory program administered by the Food and Agriculture Department and county agricultural commissioners].)     The Court of Appeal relied on several references to the Commission's regulation of hunting seasons and hunting and fishing licenses in the Secretary's 1976 statement of findings for its conclusion that the regulatory program includes only the setting of hunting and fishing seasons and issuance of licenses. The references do not support its conclusion.     When the Commission sought certification of its regulatory program in 1976, the newly enacted statutory exemption only applied to the regulatory programs of state agencies involved in ""the issuance to a person . . . of a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement for use."" (  21080.5, added by Stats. 1975, ch. 1187,  1, p. 2931.) In his statement of findings certifying that the Commission's regulatory program complied with the requirements of section 21080.5, the Secretary identified former California Administrative Code, title 14, section 3.90 (now Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14,  781.5) as the certified regulatory program. The Secretary noted the regulations adopted by the Commission and set forth in former section 3.90 did not directly involve licensing. Nonetheless, the Secretary found the Commission's regulatory program met the criteria of section 21080.5 because there was a necessary relationship between the Commission's regulation of hunting and fishing and the issuance of licenses by the Department of Fish and Game.     Contrary to the Court of Appeal's conclusion, the Secretary's reference to hunting seasons does not demonstrate that the intended scope of the regulatory program is limited to licensing. It shows only that the Secretary's certification of the Commission's regulatory program was carried out within the scope of his then-existing authority. In order for the Commission's regulatory program to comply with the criteria set forth in section 21080.5, the program had to involve ""the issuance . . . of a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement for use."" (  21080.5, subd. (b)(1).) Under the Fish and Game Code, the issuance of licenses is the responsibility of the Department, not the Commission. The Secretary's reference to the setting of hunting and fishing seasons was made to establish the necessary linkage between the Commission's discretionary regulatory responsibilities and the requirement of section 21080.5, as it then existed. At that time, the certification of a program other than one involving licenses would have exceeded the scope of the Secretary's authority.       Approximately one year after the Secretary's certification of ""the regulatory program of the Fish and Game Commission pursuant to the Fish and Game Code"" (Guidelines,  15251, subd. (b)), section 21080.5 was amended to include regulatory programs involving ""the adoption or approval of standards, rules, regulations or plans for use in the regulatory program."" (Stats. 1977, ch. 1200,  6.5, p. 3999.) As commentators have observed, it is the language of section 21080.5 and the terms of the agency's certification that determine the scope of the activities entitled to an exemption from the EIR requirements. (Remy et al., Guide to the California Environmental Quality Act (1993 ed.) p. 86; cf. Citizens, supra, 187 Cal. App. 3d at pp. 1584-1585 [amendment to section 21080.5 made that section applicable to pesticide regulatory program even though original certification by Secretary occurred prior to amendment].)     2. Compliance With The Requirements Of The Certified Regulatory Program     In order to claim the exemption from CEQA's EIR requirements, an agency must demonstrate strict compliance with its certified regulatory program. (Section 21080.5, subd. (a); Citizens, supra, 187 Cal. App. 3d at p. 1586;  City of Coronado v. California Coastal Zone Conservation Com., supra, 69 Cal. App. 3d at p. 581.)  We must therefore determine whether the Commission followed its own procedures. For the reasons that follow, we conclude it did not.     Kern County argues we must presume official duty is regularly performed. (Evid. Code,  664.) However, such a presumption is misplaced in a case like this where the record affirmatively shows the Commission failed to satisfy every requirement of its certified regulatory program. (Cf.  City of Sacramento v. State Water Resources Control Bd., supra, 2 Cal. App. 4th at p. 976  [regular performance of official duty presumed in absence of contrary evidence]; see also  Schaeffer Land Trust v. San Jose City Council (1989) 215 Cal. App. 3d 612, 622, 263 Cal. Rptr. 813  [appellate court conducts independent review of record to determine whether public agency followed mandatory procedures in arriving at its decision].)     The record indicates the Commission believed a delisting action was categorically exempt from CEQA. As the Commission's executive director told persons attending the Commission's June 17, 1993, public meeting, ""in the normal proceedings of listing a species as threatened or endangered, the Commission reserves its actions regarding a CEQA determination until the actual listing of that species. Based on legal advice from the Attorney General's office, we'll follow the same format in delisting and so we will be making a CEQA determination . . . . when we actually take the regulatory action to delist the Mojave ground squirrel. . . ."" Thereafter, the Commission filed a notice of exemption with the Office of Planning and Research claiming a categorical exemption from CEQA. The record makes clear the Commission proceeded with the delisting of the Mojave ground squirrel as if the delisting was categorically exempt from CEQA. It follows that the Commission did not faithfully follow the procedures of its certified regulatory program when evaluating the delisting petition.     The record confirms the Commission's failure to satisfy these procedural requirements in several respects. First, the Commission did not respond to significant environmental opposition. The Commission's regulations require that written responses to comments be prepared prior to the final public meeting. Responses to comments received at the final meeting may be made orally by the Commission during the meeting. The oral responses are included in the official written minutes of the meeting. (Regulatory Program, subd. (h); see also  21080.5, subd. (d)(2)(iv) [written response requirement].)     The Commission received numerous letters and heard testimony raising significant environmental concerns during the petition evaluation process. However, the Commission neither received nor responded on the record to public comments during its final meeting on the delisting proposal. Nor did the Commission prepare written responses to significant environmental objections prior to issuing its final notice of regulatory change removing the Mojave ground squirrel from the threatened species list.     The record shows that, pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, the Commission submitted its rulemaking file delisting the Mojave ground squirrel to the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) for approval. The OAL disapproved the Commission's regulatory action because the Commission's final statement of reasons failed to include a summary and response to public comments, in violation of former Government Code section 11346.7, subdivision (b)(3) (now see Gov. Code,  11346.2, 11346.9). In response to the OAL's decision, the Commission submitted an addendum to the final statement of purpose of its regulatory action, summarizing and responding to points raised during the petition review process.     Many of the Commission's responses to public comment included in the addendum address significant environmental points raised during the Commission's review of the delisting petition. However, these responses were clearly made to cure a Government Code deficiency in the regulatory action delisting the ground squirrel, and not in order to comply with the requirements of the Commission's certified regulatory program.     The Commission's post-decisionmaking responses to significant environmental concerns do not satisfy the written response component of its certified regulatory program. Nor do they comply with the spirit of this requirement. The written response requirement ensures that members of the Commission will fully consider the information necessary to render decisions that intelligently take into account the environmental consequences. (Cf.  Sutter Sensible Planning, Inc. v. Board of Supervisors (1981) 122 Cal. App. 3d 813, 820, 176 Cal. Rptr. 342;   Rural Landowners Assn. v. City Council, supra, 143 Cal. App. 3d 1013, 1020-1021.)  It also promotes the policy of citizen input underlying CEQA. ( People v. County of Kern (1974) 39 Cal. App. 3d 830, 841, 115 Cal. Rptr. 67.)  When the written responses are prepared and issued after a decision has been made, however, the purpose served by such a requirement cannot be achieved.     In addition to the failure to comply with the written response requirement of its certified regulatory program, the Commission did not satisfy the program's directive to assess feasible project alternatives and mitigation measures. The Commission's review procedures prohibit the Commission from adopting proposed regulations ""if there are feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures available which would substantially lessen any significant adverse impact which the activity may have on the environment, unless specific economic, social or other conditions make infeasible such project alternatives or such mitigation measures."" (Regulatory Program, subd. (g); see  21080.5, subd. (d)(2)(i) [feasibility requirement].)     The Commission's regulation tracks the language of section 21002, one of the substantive provisions of CEQA which the Commission is required to carry out even when operating pursuant to its certified regulatory program. (Guidelines,  15250; Sierra Club, supra, 7 Cal. 4th at pp. 1230-1231;  Environmental Protection Information Center, Inc. v. Johnson, supra, 170 Cal. App. 3d at p. 617.)  Thus, if the Commission satisfies its CEQA obligation to mitigate or avoid significant environmental effects whenever feasible, it has also complied with the corresponding provision in its certified regulatory program.     CEQA's substantive mandate that public agencies refrain from approving projects for which there are feasible alternatives or mitigation measures is effectuated in section 21081. (See  City of Poway, supra, 155 Cal. App. 3d at pp. 1045-1046.)  Under this provision, a decisionmaking agency is prohibited from approving a project for which significant environmental effects have been identified unless it makes specific findings about alternatives and mitigation measures. (  21081; see also  Environmental Council v. Board of Supervisors (1982) 135 Cal. App. 3d 428, 439, 185 Cal. Rptr. 363.)  The requirement ensures there is evidence of the public agency's actual consideration of alternatives and mitigation measures, and reveals to citizens the analytical process by which the public agency arrived at its decision. ( Citizens for Quality Growth v. City of Mt. Shasta (1988) 198 Cal. App. 3d 433, 440-441, 243 Cal. Rptr. 727;  City of Poway, supra, 155 Cal. App. 3d at p. 1046;  Resource Defense Fund v. Local Agency Formation Com. (1987) 191 Cal. App. 3d 886, 896, 236 Cal. Rptr. 794.)  Under CEQA, the public agency bears the burden of affirmatively demonstrating that, notwithstanding a project's impact on the environment, the agency's approval of the proposed project followed meaningful consideration of alternatives and mitigation measures. (City of Poway, supra, 155 Cal. App. 3d at p. 1046.) The record in this case indicates the Commission has failed to meet this burden.     There is no evidence in the record the Commission evaluated feasible mitigation measures during its review of the petition to delist the Mojave ground squirrel. The Commission contends consideration of mitigation measures was unnecessary because a finding that the delisting was warranted under CESA is the equivalent of finding that the delisting would not have a significant, adverse impact on the ground squirrel. The contention has merit. Under CESA, a ""threatened"" species is a species that although not presently threatened with extinction is likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future in the absence of CESA protections. (Fish & G. Code,  2067.) Presumably, the removal of a species from the threatened species list would not be ""warranted"" within the meaning of CESA if to do so was likely to endanger the species in the future. (See Fish & G. Code,  2070 [Commission shall add or remove species from endangered or threatened list when warranted by sufficient scientific information].) The consideration of mitigation measures to minimize identifiable adverse effects on the candidate species is thus not only unnecessary under CEQA, but would appear to be improper under CESA's substantive provisions. (Cf.  Sundstrom v. County of Mendocino, supra, 202 Cal. App. 3d at pp. 308-309  [use permit condition requiring compliance with environmental regulations is proper mitigating measure because compliance avoids potentially significant environmental effects].)     At the same time, however, the delisting decision does not represent a finding with regard to the possible significant effects of a delisting on the environment generally. (Cf.  21060.5 [defining ""environment"" broadly as physical conditions which exist within area affected by a proposed project including land, air, water, flora, fauna, etc.].) Because the ground squirrel shares its habitat with other species of plants and animals, some of which are not protected by CESA, it is possible the removal of protections from the one species will have a significant, adverse effect on others. Carrying out a delisting in accordance with CESA thus does not eliminate the need for the Commission to consider and adopt feasible mitigation measures that would lessen or avoid the identified significant environmental impacts of the delisting. As suggested by analysis in the Department's status report in this case, the Commission has the authority to implement a variety of measures to mitigate adverse environmental impacts of a delisting, such as ordering the Department to place affected species on its list of birds and mammals of special concern for further study and observation.     As to CEQA's requirement that public agencies consider project alternatives, the Commission points out that CESA mandates the Commission either grant or deny the delisting petition based on the evidence before it, thereby precluding the Commission from considering or adopting any other alternatives. We find the Commission's point well taken in light of CESA's substantive provisions governing the listing and delisting of species. However, CEQA contemplates a ""no project"" alternative. (Guidelines,  15126, subd. (d)(4).) Thus, CEQA's substantive requirement that the public agency consider feasible project alternatives can be used in conjunction with CESA.     The Commission further argues the record demonstrates the Commission satisfied CEQA's alternatives requirement. We disagree. When the Commission accepted Kern County's petition to delist the Mojave ground squirrel, the Department prepared a report to the Commission reviewing the status of the Mojave ground squirrel and recommending the petitioned action should not be taken. (See Fish & G. Code,  2074.6.) In its status review, the Department indicated a concern that by delisting the species, the habitat of the Mojave ground squirrel would continue to be destroyed, fragmented, and degraded. The Department was of the view that removing the ground squirrel from the list of threatened species would withdraw not only the protections of CESA, but also the special consideration for the species under CEQA's project-review process, and under the multiagency West Mojave coordinated management plan. The Department urged that the only alternative to the proposed regulatory action that would provide the protections equivalent to those of CESA was the continued listing of the ground squirrel as a threatened species under CESA.     The only evidence in the record of the Commission's consideration of this alternative to the proposed delisting appears in its ""Final Statement of Purpose for Regulatory Action,"" a document prepared after the Commission had determined it would approve the delisting petition and had proceeded to amend its regulations to remove the ground squirrel from the threatened species list. The Commission asserted that to make no change in its regulations with respect to the ground squirrel would be ""inconsistent with Commission findings."" It stated further, without elaboration, that ""no alternative considered by the Department would be more effective in carrying out the purposes for which the regulation is proposed or would be as effective and less burdensome to the affected private persons than the proposed regulation.""     The Commission's cursory rejection of the alternative to the proposed delisting does not constitute an adequate assessment of alternatives as required under CEQA and the Commission's certified regulatory program. Although the Commission's evaluation and rejection of the Department's recommendation to retain the ground squirrel on the threatened species list need not be exhaustive, it must reasonably reflect that due consideration was given to this alternative. The Commission's rejection of the proposed alternative as ""inconsistent with the Commission's findings"" fails to provide solid evidence of a meaningful review of the project alternative that would avoid the significant environmental effects identified by the Department. (Cf.  Sierra Club v. Gilroy City Council (1990) 222 Cal. App. 3d 30, 44, 271 Cal. Rptr. 393  [resolution adopted by council evidences the agency's careful consideration and rejection as unfeasible numerous project alternatives];  Foundation for San Francisco's Architectural Heritage v. City and County of San Francisco (1980) 106 Cal. App. 3d 893, 913-914, 165 Cal. Rptr. 401  [CEQA's findings requirement satisfied where Board provided nine different bases for its finding of no feasible alternative to project].)     We conclude the Commission failed to comply with the requirements of CEQA and its own regulatory program when it removed the Mojave ground squirrel from the list of threatened species without responding in writing to significant environmental opposition and without meaningful consideration of the ""no project"" alternative. Because it did not proceed in accordance with procedures mandated by law, the Commission abused its discretion in delisting the species. (Code Civ. Proc.,  1094.5, subd. (b); cf. Sierra Club, supra, 7 Cal. 4th at pp. 1235-1237 [failure to proceed in accordance with law presumptively prejudicial when mandatory procedures not followed].)     III. Disposition     The judgment of the Court of Appeal affirming the trial court's issuance of a writ of mandate ordering the Commission to set aside the delisting of the Mojave ground squirrel is affirmed.       DISSENT:BY BAXTER, J.     I respectfully dissent. The California Endangered Species Act (CESA; Fish & G. Code,  2050 et seq.) states the exact procedures and criteria by which the California Fish and Game Commission (Commission) is to decide whether individual plant or animal varieties shall appear, or continue to appear, on California's ""threatened"" and ""endangered"" species lists. A species must be listed if ""sufficient scientific information"" persuades the Commission that the species' continued existence is endangered or threatened. Once listed, a species must be removed from the list (delisted), if the Commission determines, from similar ""scientific information,"" that the species faces no imminent or likely threat or danger. The decision requires a detailed study and report by an expert agency, public notice, hearing, and comment, and full and formal findings by the Commission. But the process, while careful and public, is narrowly focused; the determination to list or delist must be based solely upon the ecological health of the species under consideration.     After protracted proceedings under CESA, the Commission found that the Mojave ground squirrel does not meet CESA's standards of threat or endangerment. The Commission explained that the squirrel was originally listed as ""rare,"" with little evidentiary support, under a predecessor statute, and thus automatically appeared on CESA's ""endangered"" list without further evaluation of its true status. Moreover, the Commission noted, while reliable estimates of the squirrel's population remain unavailable (and probably impossible), this species ranges throughout a desert habitat of almost 5 million acres, which is largely under public control and faces no significant development. Nor, the Commission concluded, was there evidence of the squirrel's decimation by disease, predation, exploitation, competition, or other natural occurrences or human activity. Accordingly, the Commission determined to delist the squirrel. On administrative mandamus, the superior court upheld the Commission's decision.     However, the majority, like the Court of Appeal, are not content with the workings of CESA's logical, complete, self-contained, and environmentally specific scheme. Instead, they conclude that the Commission's action to delist the Mojave ground squirrel under CESA is invalid because the Commission did not also follow the separate and distinct criteria and procedures of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA; Pub. Resources Code,  21000 et seq.), including CEQA's requirement that an environmental impact report (EIR) or its functional equivalent be prepared and considered.     But by its express terms and design, CEQA forces an agency to address and accommodate broad competing values -- environmental, social, and economic -- that contradict the narrow focus CESA requires the Commission to take when deciding whether to list or delist a threatened or endangered species. Where the issues considered under both statutes are the same, separate compliance with CEQA is a meaningless and wasteful duplication of CESA's own extensive provisions for full scrutiny and informed public participation. Thus, as two recent federal decisions concluded in the context of analogous federal laws, CEQA has no sensible place in such a proceeding.     For these reasons, I cannot join the majority's strained effort to fit a square peg into a round hole. I conclude that CEQA's EIR and procedural requirements cannot be reconciled with the particular statutes the Commission must apply when listing or ""delisting"" a threatened or endangered species. In my view, the Commission thus violated no law when it delisted the Mojave ground squirrel but failed to follow CEQA's procedures in addition to CESA's. I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeal.     I.     The focused purposes of CESA are made clear by its codified findings and policy declarations. These express concern about species of fish, wildlife, and plants that are ""in danger of, or threatened with, extinction"" because of overexploitation, destruction of habitat, disease, predation, and other factors. (Fish & G. Code,  2051, subd. (b).) CESA thus makes it the state's policy to ""conserve, protect, restore, and enhance"" all ""endangered"" or ""threatened"" species and their habitats. (Id.,  2052.)     Once a species is identified as endangered or threatened, it is entitled to a number of statutory protections. For example, with limited exceptions, CESA forbids the import, export, taking, possession, purchase, or sale of endangered or threatened species. (Fish & G. Code,  2080.) State agencies should not approve projects which jeopardize endangered or threatened species unless specific economic, social, or other conditions make other alternatives infeasible. (Id.,  2053, 2054, 2092, subd. (a).) Agencies should use their authority to conserve endangered and threatened species. (Id.,  2055.)     However, the initial determination whether a species qualifies for these protections by virtue of its threatened or endangered status is more narrowly circumscribed. Under CESA, the Commission must maintain a list of threatened and endangered species (Fish & G. Code,  2070), which are defined by the statute. A species of fish, plant, or wildlife is ""endangered"" if it is ""in serious danger of becoming extinct throughout all, or a significant portion, of its range due to one or more causes, including loss of habitat, change in habitat, overexploitation, predation, competition, or disease."" (Id.,  2062.) A species is ""threatened"" if it is ""likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable future in the absence of the special protection and management efforts required by this chapter."" (Id.,  2067.) The Commission ""shall add or remove a species from either [the ""endangered"" or ""threatened"" species] list if it finds, upon the receipt of sufficient scientific information pursuant to this article, that the action is warranted."" (Id.,  2070, italics added.) The Commission is to adopt ""criteria for determining if a species is endangered or threatened."" (Id.,  2071.5.)     Pursuant to section 2071.5 of the Fish and Game Code, the Commission has promulgated guidelines which further address the standards by which a determination to list or delist should be made. These guidelines closely track the statutory definitions of ""endangered"" and ""threatened"" species. Under the guidelines, a species ""shall be listed as endangered or threatened . . . if the Commission determines that its continued existence is in serious danger or is threatened by any one or any combination of the following factors: [P] 1. Present or threatened modification or destruction of its habitat; [P] 2. Overexploitation; [P] 3. Predation; [P] 4. Competition; [P] 5. Disease; or [P] 6. Other natural occurrences or human-related activities."" (Cal.Code Regs., tit. 14,  670.1, subd. (i)(1)(A).) ""A species may be delisted . . . if the Commission determines that its continued existence is no longer threatened by any one or any combination of the factors provided in subsection (i)(1)(A) . . . ."" (Id., subd. (i)(1)(B).) 2            FN2  Contrary to the majority's     implication, the word ""may"" in this latter sentence     simply confirms that the Commission is not required to     maintain the species on the list despite a finding that no     further threat or danger exists. Indeed, the governing     statute (Fish & G. Code,  2070) makes delisting     mandatory when the Commission finds a listed species subject     to no current threat or danger. Hence, the guideline's     wording cannot be construed as authorizing the Commission to     decline to delist even if it makes such a finding.        CESA also provides detailed procedures for the Commission's decision to list or delist a species. Listing or delisting may be triggered by the petition of an ""interested person,"" or by a recommendation from the Department of Fish and Game (Department) itself. (Fish & G. Code,  2072.3, 2072.7.) After a noticed hearing, the Commission may reject, without further consideration, any petition or recommendation which does not include sufficient ""scientific information"" that the action recommended is ""warranted."" (Id.,  2074, 2074.2 (subd. (a)(1).) If the Commission ""accepts"" the petition or recommendation for further consideration (id.,  2074.2, subd. (a)(2)), the Department must review the status of the subject species, and must provide an expert written report to the Commission. (Id.,  2074.6.) This report, which shall be ""based upon the best scientific evidence available to the Department,"" must ""indicate[] whether the petitioned action is warranted,"" must include ""a preliminary identification of the habitat that may be essential to the continued existence of the species,"" and must ""recommend[] management activities or other recommendations for the recovery of the species."" (Ibid.) The Department's report is supplemented by the public solicitation of ""data and comments . . . from as many persons as is practicable."" (Id.,  2074.4; see Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14,  670.1, subd. (h).)     At a further noticed hearing, and after receipt of written and oral comment, the Commission must then make a ""finding[]"" whether the action of listing or delisting is warranted. (Fish & G. Code,  2075, 2075.5.) Before this ""finding[]"" can be implemented as a formal rule, the Commission must also comply with the rulemaking provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act. (APA; Gov. Code,  11340 et seq.) These call for public notice, comment, and hearing, as well as a written statement of reasons with response to public recommendations and objections, as specified by the APA. (Fish & G. Code,  2075.5, subd. (2); see Gov. Code,  11346.2, subd. (b); 11346.4, subd. (a), 11346.8, subd. (a); 11346.9, subd. (a).)     Thus, in a CESA list/delist proceeding, the Commission is to determine only whether a species meets the statutory and regulatory standards of threat or endangerment. 2  The criteria, documents, and procedures by which CESA requires the Commission to make this decision are expressly detailed in CESA, and are tailored to ensure that the Commission's narrow discretion will be carefully and publicly exercised.            FN2  Noting the essentially     ""evidentiary and fact-finding"" nature of the     Commission's authority in a CESA list/delist proceeding, one     recent Court of Appeal decision characterized the     Commission's action as ""quasi-adjudicatory."" ( Natural     Resources Defense Council v. Fish & Game Com. (1994) 28     Cal. App. 4th 1104, 1116, 1120.)        On the other hand, CEQA, the state's primary environmental legislation, is concerned with all the environmental effects of a ""project"" contemplated by a public agency, i.e., any unexempted agency activity that may have a significant adverse environmental effect. (Pub. Resources Code,  21000, 21001, 21065.) CEQA requires agencies, by formal findings, to avoid or mitigate the adverse environmental effects of such activities and decisions to the extent made feasible by economic, social, or other conditions. (Id.,  21002, 21002.1, subd. (b), 21081.)     Unless an exemption applies, an agency must issue a ""negative declaration,"" or must prepare and consider an EIR, before undertaking any ""project."" (Pub. Resources Code,  21080, subds. (c), (d).) The EIR requirement is intended to induce environmentally sensitive agency decisions by ""identifying the significant effects on the environment of a project, . . . identifying alternatives to the project, and . . . indicating the manner in which those significant effects can be mitigated or avoided."" (Id.,  21002.1, subd. (a).)     An EIR, where required, must detail ""all"" the significant environmental effects of the ""project,"" specifically including its impact on inducing development of land and human population growth, must disclose ""any"" significant unavoidable effect of the project on the environment, and must list alternatives or mitigation measures to reduce or eliminate these effects. (Pub. Resources Code,  21100, 21100.1.) A ""project"" may be not be approved if less damaging alternatives or mitigation measures are available, except where ""specific economic, social, or other conditions make infeasible such . . . alternatives or . . . mitigation measures."" (Id.,  21002.)     Similar standards apply to a ""project"" which, though subject to CEQA in general, is exempted by CEQA itself from the EIR requirement under the auspices of a ""certified"" environmental ""regulatory program."" To be eligible for ""certification,"" such a ""regulatory program"" must, among other things, provide for full environmental consideration under CEQA's standards, pursuant to documentation and procedures which are the functional equivalent of the EIR process. Under the current statutory provisions, the program must ""require[] a plan or other documentation containing environmental information"" (Pub. Resources Code,  21080.5, subd. (a)); must prohibit approval or adoption of an activity if feasible alternatives or mitigation measures ""would substantially lessen any significant adverse [environmental] effect"" (id., subd. (d)(2)(A), italics added); must provide for public notice, review, and comment (id., subd. (d)(2)(F)); and must mandate the agency's written response to all significant environmental points raised during the evaluation process (id., subd. (d)(2)(D)). Written documentation required by the program must describe the activity, as well as alternatives and mitigation measures ""to minimize any significant adverse environmental impact"" (id., subd. (d)(3)(A), italics added), and must be available for public review and comment (id., subd. (d)(3)(B)).     CESA and CEQA thus establish two independent schemes adapted to two distinct goals. CESA is tailored to provide careful public determination of a narrow issue, i.e., whether apart from any other concern, an individual plant or animal species is in fact ""threatened"" or ""endangered"" as a matter of ""scientific information."" By contrast, CEQA provides a process to ensure that environmental considerations (including, of course, the ""endangered"" or ""threatened"" status of any species) will influence the making and implementation of broader public policy, in which other issues and interests are also properly at play. Aside from a mutual concern with public scrutiny and participation, for which each statute amply provides in its own fashion, the processes of one scheme have little logical relation, in purpose or design, with those of the other. In fact, the Commission cannot follow all the directives of CEQA's EIR provisions, while at the same time adhering to its narrow factfinding discretion under CESA.     Statutes should be reconciled and harmonized where reasonably possible (e.g.,  Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. Macri (1992) 4 Cal. 4th 318, 326, 842 P.2d 112),  but courts must avoid statutory constructions that lead to illogical or absurd results (e.g.,  Landrum v. Superior Court (1981) 30 Cal. 3d 1, 9, 177 Cal. Rptr. 325, 634 P.2d 352).  Here, despite the majority's laborious attempts to demonstrate otherwise, the two statutory schemes at issue are mutually incompatible. CESA, the statute with specific application to the ""endangered"" and ""threatened"" species lists, must therefore govern to the exclusion of CEQA's inconsistent provisions.     II.     Two United States Courts of Appeals have reached the identical conclusion under the analogous provisions of federal law. Though the majority attempt to distinguish these decisions, the reasoning of the federal cases is pertinent and persuasive.     In  Pacific Legal Foundation v. Andrus (1981) 657 F.2d 829  (Pacific Legal Foundation), the Sixth Circuit held that when determining whether to list a species as endangered for purposes of the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA;  16 U.S.C.A.  1531  et seq.), the Fish and Wildlife Service need not comply with the separate provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA;  42 U.S.C.A.  4321  et seq.), including NEPA's requirement for the preparation and consideration of an environmental impact statement (EIS). The Court of Appeals acknowledged that NEPA governs all environmentally significant federal actions ""to the fullest extent possible."" (Pacific Legal Foundation, supra, 657 F.2d at p. 833; see  42 U.S.C.A.  4332 (2).) The court further conceded that an ESA listing decision, as such, neither enjoys an express exemption from NEPA, nor is impliedly exempt under a theory of ""functional equivalence."" (Pacific Legal Foundation, supra, at pp. 834-835.) Nonetheless, the court concluded that the two schemes were in conflict, such that simultaneous compliance with both was precluded.     Pacific Legal Foundation, supra, reasoned primarily that ESA contemplates a mandatory species-focused determination, in which other matters may not be considered, while NEPA ""supplements the existing goals of agencies and provides that [they] should also consider environmental concerns. [Citations.]"" (Pacific Legal Foundation, supra, 657 F.2d at p. 835.) Because ""the statutory mandate of ESA prevents the Secretary [of the Interior] from considering the [broader] environmental impact when listing a species as endangered or threatened,"" the issues a valid EIS must identify and discuss cannot be addressed or accommodated. (Pacific Legal Foundation, supra, at p. 836, italics added.) The filing of an EIS in a listing proceeding therefore serves the purposes of neither ESA nor NEPA. (Pacific Legal Foundation, supra, at pp. 835-836.)     The Court of Appeals specifically rejected the argument, similar to that embraced by the majority here, that an EIS should nonetheless be required in order to serve the public informational goals of NEPA. As the court explained, ""this purpose [of informing the public] does not exist independent of the primary purpose to insure an informed decision by the agency contemplating federal action . . . . The [EIS] provides the basis for critical evaluation of the agency action by those not associated with the agency. [Citation.] If the agency cannot consider the environmental impact, an [EIS] is useless . . . in evaluating [the agency's] action."" (Pacific Legal Foundation, supra, 657 F.2d at p. 838, italics in original.)     More recently, another federal appeals court concluded that even when ESA requires consideration of issues beyond the needs of the threatened or endangered species itself, ESA's procedures have ""displaced"" those of NEPA in this particular area. In  Douglas County v. Babbitt (9th Cir. 1995) 48 F.3d 1495  (Douglas County), the Court of Appeals addressed the application of NEPA to the designation, under ESA, of an endangered species' ""critical habitat.""     As the court explained, whenever a species is listed as endangered or threatened under ESA, the Secretary of the Interior must also designate its ""critical habitat,"" within which locale federal actions likely to disrupt the species are forbidden. (Douglas County, supra, 48 Cal. 3d at p. 1497; see  16 U.S.C.A.  1532 (5)(A), 1536(a)(2).) Unlike the listing decision itself, the designation of ""critical habitat"" must consider, in addition to the ""best scientific data available[,] . . . the economic impact, and any other relevant impact, of specifying any particular area as critical habitat."" (Douglas County, supra, at p. 1497; see  16 U.S.C.A.  1533 (b)(2).) The ""critical habitat"" designation must be preceded by notice to the public, the affected states, and the scientific community, and by a public hearing if one is requested. (Douglas County, supra, at p. 1503; see  16 U.S.C.A.  1533 (b)(5).)     Despite ESA's mandate to consider all ""relevant impacts"" of a ""critical habitat"" designation, the Douglas County court held that NEPA's EIS requirement is inapplicable in this context. The court reasoned, inter alia, that in a statutory scheme adopted and amended after NEPA, Congress made no mention of NEPA, instead providing careful and comprehensive, but clearly disparate, statutory procedures by which the designation of critical habitat was to occur. Thus, the court concluded, by rendering the provisions of NEPA ""superfluous"" in this regard, Congress had made an implicit choice that the specific procedures set forth in ESA for the ""critical habitat"" determination should displace those of NEPA. (Douglas County, supra, 48 F.3d at pp.1502-1503.)     The federal courts' reasoning is compelling for purposes of the analogous California statutes. Here, as in the federal scheme, the decision to list or delist a threatened or endangered species is governed by specific and comprehensive legislation that was adopted after the statute addressing environmental decisionmaking in general. California's endangered species statute, like its federal counterpart, makes no mention of other environmental laws, but instead mandates particular agency action after the exercise of a narrow, scientific, and species-focused factfinding discretion. In California, as under federal law, the nature of the decision required is incompatible with the broader interest-balancing function of environmental statutes like CEQA and NEPA. And CEQA, like NEPA, has no pure ""informational"" function where the ""information"" at issue could have no actual effect on the agency's decision.     Moreover, in our state, as under the federal analogs, the specific statutory procedures for a list/delist action are detailed, distinct, and tailored to the particular scope of the agency's discretion. Hence, it is sensible to infer that our Legislature, like Congress, has ""displaced"" more general procedures which might otherwise apply, and has rendered them ""superfluous.""     The majority, however, reject the federal courts' analyses for purposes of California law. Their reasons for doing so are unpersuasive.     First, the majority suggest that even under the controlling federal law, Pacific Legal Foundation, supra, ""presents [no] strong case of statutory irreconcilability warranting an exemption from environmental review."" According to the majority, Pacific Legal Foundation rests on a ""questionable"" interpretation of the federal irreconcilability standard set forth in  Flint Ridge Development Co. v. Scenic Rivers Assn. (1976) 426 U.S. 776, 49 L. Ed. 2d 205, 96 S. Ct. 2430.  In Flint Ridge, the United States Supreme Court concluded that because NEPA ""was not intended to repeal by implication any other statute,"" a federal agency is exempt from NEPA's EIS requirement where compliance would create a ""clear and unavoidable conflict in statutory authority."" (Flint Ridge, supra, 426 U.S. at p. 788.)     As the majority note, Flint Ridge considered whether the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development must prepare an EIS pursuant to NEPA before allowing a ""statement of record"" filed under the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act (Act) to go into effect. Under the Act, the Secretary had no discretion to disapprove a statement except for facial inaccuracy, and the statement automatically became effective unless the Secretary notified the filing developer within 30 days that the statement was deficient. Finding it ""inconceivable"" that NEPA's EIS process could be completed within the mandatory 30-day period provided by the Act, the high court held that NEPA must give way. (Flint Ridge, supra, 426 U.S. at pp. 788-791.)     In  Pacific Legal Foundation, supra,  the court acknowledged that the ""time constraint"" at issue in Flint Ridge was not present (Pacific Legal Foundation, supra, 657 F.2d at p. 835), but it nonetheless found a similar degree of incompatibility between two statutory schemes. Contrary to the majority's contention, nothing in Pacific Legal Foundation is inconsistent with Flint Ridge. Flint Ridge applied the sensible principle that if a statute imposes specific duties on a particular agency, or limits that agency's discretion, in a way that precludes compliance with other, generally applicable laws, the latter must defer to the former. As Pacific Legal Foundation explained at length, ESA presents such a conflict with NEPA.     An identical tension arises between CESA and CEQA. Pacific Legal Foundation's conclusions were sound for purposes of federal law, and they are equally compelling here.     The majority suggest that significant differences between the state and federal schemes diminish the force of the federal decisions for California purposes. In particular, the majority stress that CEQA, unlike NEPA, includes no implied exception for ""functional equivalence,"" but exempts ""functionally equivalent"" environmental schemes from the EIR requirement only under the express provision for ""certified regulatory programs"" ( Wildlife Alive v. Chickering (1976) 18 Cal. 3d 190, 204, 132 Cal. Rptr. 377, 553 P.2d 537  (Wildlife Alive); Pub. Resources Code,  21080.5).     However, the federal decisions that found NEPA inapplicable to endangered species list proceedings under ESA did not primarily rely on any federal theory of ""functional equivalence"" between the two schemes. Indeed, as  Pacific Legal Foundation, supra, 657 F.2d 829  acknowledged, the listing or delisting of a species under ESA is not exempt from NEPA for any such reason. On the contrary, the federal cases reasoned that the goals, purposes, standards, and agency discretion contemplated by the two schemes are incompatible, such that where the more specific statute expressly applies, it displaces the more general. Similar considerations apply here. 3              FN3  The majority suggest the     relevance of Pacific Legal Foundation, supra, is reduced by     that decision's substantial reliance on the premise that the     listing of a species as endangered or threatened under ESA     necessarily promotes environmental goals regardless of     compliance with NEPA. Such reasoning, the majority conclude,     has no force in a delisting proceeding, where the result may     be to withdraw environmental protections to which the species     was formerly entitled. Whatever the merits of this argument     in the abstract, it distorts the analysis of Pacific Legal     Foundation. That case did suggest, as a     ""makeweight,"" that NEPA need not apply because a     decision to list a species as endangered or threatened can     only benefit the environment in any event. (See  Pacific     Legal Foundation, supra, 657 F.2d at p. 837.)  However,     the principal thrust of the decision, equally applicable     here, is that the standards and procedures governing agency     action under the two statutory schemes are in irreconcilable     conflict.        In sum, the majority provide no convincing reason to depart from the federal precedent when deciding the issue presented here. I would embrace those authorities, by analogy, as dispositive.     III.     The majority offer other arguments for a conclusion that CEQA must apply to a list/delist decision under CESA. First, they note that the Legislature has provided express exemptions from CEQA where it deemed such treatment appropriate. (Citing Pub. Resources Code,  21080, subd. (b) [miscellaneous exemptions for ""functional equivalence"" and for certain projects meeting strong environmental, commercial, or transportation needs], 21084, subd. (a) [""categorical exemptions"" for projects having no significant adverse environmental effect]; Health & Saf. Code,  44561, subd. (a) [financing and construction of pollution and waste management control facilities]; Wat. Code,  13389 [adoption by regional water quality control boards of local standards for waste discharge into sources of drinking water].) But the Legislature's determination that some government activities are exempt for policy reasons which outweigh the application of CEQA has little bearing on the issue here -- whether two particular statutory schemes exhibit such conflicting designs, functions, purposes, and procedures that they cannot reasonably be applied at the same time.     The majority also assert that California courts have ""consistently"" rejected claims of statutory incompatibility with CEQA. (Citing, e.g., Wildlife Alive, supra, 18 Cal. 3d 190, 198-201,  553 P.2d 537, 132 Cal. Rptr. 377  [setting of hunting seasons pursuant to Fish and Game Code];  Bozung v. Local Agency Formation Com. (13 Cal. 3d 263, 282-286, 118 Cal. Rptr. 249, 529 P.2d 1017  [approval by local agency formation commission of municipal annexation pursuant to Knox-Nisbet Act];  Environmental Protection Information Center v. Johnson (1985) 170 Cal. App. 3d 604, 620, 216 Cal. Rptr. 502  [approval of timber harvesting plan under Forest Practices Act];  City of Coronado v. California Coastal Zone Conservation Commission (1977) 69 Cal. App. 3d 570, 581, 138 Cal. Rptr. 241  [Coastal Commission permit issuance procedures]; also cf.  Sierra Club v. State Bd. of Forestry (1994) 7 Cal. 4th 1215, 1231, 876 P.2d 505  [application of CEQA's non-EIR provisions to Forest Practices Act].) In none of the cited examples, however, was an agency expressly constrained, contrary to CEQA, to focus on one severable aspect of environmental policy, then provided with detailed procedures, different from CEQA's, but tailored to ensure that this narrowly focused environmental decision would be made in an informed, careful, sensitive, and public way.     CEQA, like NEPA, must be interpreted ""to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language."" ( Friends of Mammoth v. Board of Supervisors (1972) 8 Cal. 3d 247, 259, 104 Cal. Rptr. 761, 502 P.2d 1049,  italics added.) However, no inference arises that CEQA may ride roughshod over the clearly contrary provisions of another statutory scheme, simply because neither statute has expressly recognized the conflict.     IV.     The majority concede, if reluctantly, that CESA does not permit a list/delist decision to be influenced by environmental impacts beyond the ecological status of the subject species itself. However, the majority urge, this limitation does not preclude a harmonized application of CEQA to a CESA proceeding.     First, the majority point to a particular section of CEQA, Public Resources Code section 21004, as an indication that CEQA was intended to apply, in adapted form, even where agency discretion is limited by other statutes. Section 21004 provides that, in mitigating or avoiding a significant effect of a project on the environment, a public agency may exercise its ""discretionary powers,"" express or implied, as provided by ""other law,"" but ""only"" such powers. (Italics added.) 4              FN4  Public Resources Code section     21004 provides: ""In mitigating or avoiding a significant     effect of a project on the environment, a public agency may     exercise only those express or implied powers provided by law     other than this division. However, a public agency may use     discretionary powers provided by such other law for the     purpose of mitigating or avoiding a significant effect on the     environment subject to the express or implied constraints or     limitations that may be provided by law.""        This statute provides no support for the majority's views. By its plain terms, although Public Resources Code section 21004 allows agencies to ameliorate environmental effects through use of their existing ""discretionary powers,"" the statute does not enlarge the limited and narrowly focused ""discretion"" the Commission may exercise in a list/delist proceeding under CESA.     When it adopted Public Resources Code section 21004 in 1982, the Legislature explained at length the statute's purpose and effect. Section 21004 was designed to address pending litigation which asserted that CEQA independently empowered all agencies to ""impose fees and other exactions"" to achieve environmental ends. (Stats. 1982, Ch. 1438,  4, subd. (b), p. 5485.) On the contrary, the Legislature declared, while agencies may use their existing powers -- such as the powers to levy fees, impose exactions, or condemn property, if present -- with CEQA's environmental goals in mind, agencies acquire no new or different enforcement powers solely by virtue of CEQA. (Id., subd. (a), p. 5484.)     This amendment to CEQA, designed to clarify that statute's limitations in a particular context, cannot be construed to extend the reach of CEQA's EIR provisions by superimposing them over the express and conflicting provisions of other environmental laws. If Public Resources Code section 21004 has any implications for the issue presented by this case, they are contrary to the one seized upon by the majority. 5              FN5  The majority suggest at length     that the Commission's decision, under CESA, to delist the     Mojave ground squirrel was exempt from CEQA's EIR requirement     only to the extent expressly excused by strict compliance     with the alternative procedures set forth in the Commission's     ""certified regulatory program."" (See Pub. Resources     Code,  21080.5; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14,  781.5.) But     the Secretary of Resources only ""certified"" the     ""regulatory program"" administered by the Commission     in 1976, thus exempting the 1976 ""program"" from the     EIR requirement of CEQA. This 1976 ""certification""     raises no inference that the Commission's proceedings under     CESA are part of the ""certified regulatory     program,"" or are otherwise subject to CEQA. The     ""program"" the Secretary ""certified"" did     not include the subsequently adopted CESA, with its distinct     procedural provisions. Indeed, because the procedures set     forth in the Commission's ""certified regulatory     program"" were intended as the ""functional     equivalent"" of the preparation and consideration of an     EIR under CEQA, they are as much at odds with the detailed     procedural requirements of CESA as is CEQA itself. (See text     discussion, ante, pp. 7-8.) Hence, the Commission's     ""certified regulatory program"" cannot be viewed as     evidence of  harmony between CESA and CEQA.       Finally, the majority falter when they attempt to explain how CEQA's EIR's procedures (or the ""functionally equivalent"" process set forth in the Commission's ""certified regulatory program"") can be adapted to a list/delist proceeding, and why such an adaptation serves the purposes of both statutes. In these strained and tortured efforts, the fallacy of the majority's position becomes apparent.     First, the majority suggest, adherence to CEQA forces the Commission to consider environmentally sensitive ""alternatives"" to the proposed ""project."" But as the majority appear to concede, in CESA proceedings to remove a species from the threatened or endangered list, the Commission has only two ""alternatives."" These choices are to delist if ""scientific information"" persuades the Commission that the species is not endangered or threatened, and to refrain from delisting if the evidence is otherwise.     These limited ""alternatives,"" and the pertinent evidence bearing on each, are necessarily set forth in the documentation and public commentary required by CESA itself. Moreover, as previously indicated, CESA provides its own careful and detailed procedures for ensuring the Commission's reasoned choice between the only two available ""alternatives."" The Commission must make a ""finding[]"" whether the requested action to delist is ""warranted."" That ""finding[]"" is subject to judicial review of the Commission's reasoning, and cannot be formally implemented in any event until the rulemaking processes of the APA have been completed. Here, the Commission explained in detail its reasons for concluding that the Mojave ground squirrel was not endangered or threatened within the meaning of CESA, and must therefore be delisted. Accordingly, the majority make no convincing case that CEQA must be superimposed on CESA in order to ensure the Commission properly considers available ""alternatives.""     Next, the majority insist that an EIR or equivalent document will identify measures to ""mitigate"" the ""project's"" adverse environmental effects. But as the majority acknowledge, the consideration of ""mitigation measures"" to avoid any adverse effect of delisting on the subject species is simply inappropriate. Because a species may not be delisted if it is threatened or endangered, the decision to delist is a determination that no such threat or danger exists. Accordingly, there is no place or need for the ""mitigation"" of ""adverse"" environmental impacts to which a species might be exposed by a decision to delist it. 6              FN6  Apparently desperate to     demonstrate how an EIR under CEQA would promote and     complement the narrow goals of a delisting proceeding under     CESA, counsel for appellant suggested at oral argument that     an EIR would have forced the Department to conduct the     reliable count of the Mojave ground squirrel's population     which is missing from the current record. But the expert     species status report required from the Department under CESA     itself should contain such a count where the information is     pertinent and available; an EIR adds nothing in this respect.     Here, the record makes clear that a reliable count of the     Mojave ground squirrel population is lacking for reasons of     practicality and availability which have nothing to do with     the absence of an EIR under CEQA.        Thus left to grasp at straws, the majority proffer a more convoluted theory for the relevance of CEQA's ""mitigation"" requirements. The majority suggest that even if a decision whether to delist must focus solely on the ecological status of the listed species itself, the Commission may take steps otherwise within its authority to mitigate any adverse effects of its decision on other flora and fauna that share the subject species' habitat. Consideration of an EIR or equivalent document during the delisting process, the majority reason, will ensure identification of any such incidental species impacts, and of feasible measures to mitigate or avoid them. For example, the majority suggest, if an EIR prepared for proceedings to delist one species discloses that the delisting may adversely affect another species, the Commission might consider such remedial actions as ""ordering the Department to place [the incidentally] affected species on its list of birds and mammals of special concern for further study and observation."" (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 37.)     The majority thus imply the need for two simultaneous and parallel proceedings. One proceeding, under CESA, must determine narrowly whether a listed species should be delisted on the basis of its own ecological status. Another equally elaborate proceeding, under CEQA, must identify and mitigate any and all adverse ""incidental"" effects of the delist decision on plants and animals whose status is not under formal consideration. 7  Thus, in the majority's view, the CEQA ""tail"" wags the CESA ""dog.""           FN7  By the majority's topsy-turvy logic, these     incidentally affected species would apparently be entitled to     more sensitive consideration than the candidate for delisting     itself. The majority concede that because delisting means the     subject species itself is not endangered or threatened, an     EIR would not have to identify measures to     ""mitigate"" the adverse environmental effect of     delisting on that species. On the other hand, according to     the majority, the EIR would have to disclose     ""mitigation"" measures for other flora and fauna     whose threatened or endangered status is not even at issue.     This cannot be the law.       The short answer is that in a proceeding to list or delist a particular species, CESA mandates a focus on the status of that species alone. The statute does not contemplate that a proceeding to consider whether one species is threatened or endangered shall become a forum for debate about the status of others. By the same token, CEQA seeks to ensure that an agency will decide on the basis of full environmental information whether to authorize or implement the ""project"" itself. Under CESA, as the majority admit, the Commission's decision whether to delist one species cannot be based on the possible incidental impacts on other species. Hence, in this respect as well, the majority has provided no justification for ""grafting"" an EIR requirement onto a CESA list/delist proceeding. 8            FN8  Of course, the Department and     the Commission should always identify and respond to any     environmental concern for which they are responsible by law.     It does not follow, however, that a proceeding to delist one     species under CESA is invalid under CEQA unless it included     an EIR alerting the Commission to the potential effect on     other species, even though such information could have no     legal effect upon the Commission's specific decision whether     to delist.        The majority find one other reason, relevant to this case, why the Commission should be subject to CEQA's procedures as well as CESA's when deciding whether to remove a species from the endangered or threatened list. The majority suggest that the Commission violated its own ""certified regulatory program,"" and thus erred under CEQA, when it made a ""finding[]"" to delist the Mojave ground squirrel (Fish & G. Code,  2075.5) without simultaneously providing a public response to each ""significant environmental objection[]"" raised by the public comments and testimony. (See Pub. Resources Code,  21080.5, subd. (d)(2)(D); Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14,  781.5, subd. (h).) That CESA and the APA require such responses, in writing, before the Commission's ""finding[]"" can be implemented as a formal rule is insufficient, in the majority's view, because it does not serve CEQA's purpose of demonstrating that the relevant environmental issues were fully considered in advance of the agency's actual ""final decision.""     Again, the majority's value judgments are contrary to the Legislature's own policy and procedural choices when it adopted CESA. In the first place, CESA does not permit the Commission to consider, much less ""respond"" to, environmental considerations beyond the threatened or endangered status of the individual species under consideration. On the other hand, CESA provides in detail for public participation adapted to the limited nature of the Commission's discretion. These procedures include public notice, hearing, and comment, a formal ""finding[]"" of ""warranted"" action, and an equally public APA rulemaking process in which the Commission must make a complete response to pertinent comments and objections. (See discussion, ante, pp. 5-6.) The majority present no convincing reason why this considered process must, or even may, give way to conflicting provisions of CEQA.     V.     In sum, I am persuaded that CESA and CEQA represent distinct and exclusive statutory schemes, tailored to different purposes and goals, and incapable of reconciliation. Accordingly, I conclude that the Commission acted properly insofar as it adhered to CESA's procedures in its decision to delist the Mojave ground squirrel, without additional efforts to comply with the conflicting provisions of CEQA. I would therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal.     BAXTER, J.

Background A. Legislative Requirements for Rulemaking Proceeding  The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (""DMCA""'), Pub. L. 105-304 (1998), was enacted to comply with the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) and WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT). It established ""a wide range of rules that will govern not only copyright owners in the marketplace for electronic commerce, but also consumers, manufacturers, distributors, libraries, educators, and on-line service providers"" and ""define[d] whether consumers and businesses may engage in certain conduct, or use certain devices, in the course of transacting electronic commerce.""1  Title I of the Act, which added a new Chapter 12 to Title 17 U.S.C., prohibits circumvention of technological measures employed by or on behalf of copyright owners to protect their works (hereinafter ""access controls"") . Specifically, 1201(a)(1)(A)2 provides, in part, that ""No person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title."" In order to ensure that the public will have continued ability to engage in noninfringing uses of copyrighted works, such as fair use,3 subparagraph (B) limits this prohibition. It provides that the prohibition against circumvention ""shall not apply to persons who are users of a copyrighted work which is in a particular class of works, if such persons are, or are likely to be in the succeeding three-year period, adversely affected by virtue of such prohibition in their ability to make Report of the House Committee on Commerce on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, H.R. Rep. No. 105-551, pt. 2, at 22 (1998) (hereinafter ""Commerce Comm. Report""). 2 3 1  All statutory references hereinafter are to sections of Title 17, United States Code. See id. at 36.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 5  noninfringing uses of that particular class of works under this title"" as determined in a rulemaking proceeding. The rulemaking proceeding is conducted by the Register of Copyrights, who is to provide notice of the rulemaking, seek comments from the public, consult with the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information of the Department of Commerce, and recommend final regulations to the Librarian of Congress.4 The regulations, to be issued by the Librarian of Congress, announce ""any class of copyrighted works for which the Librarian has determined, pursuant to the rulemaking conducted under subparagraph (C), that noninfringing uses by persons who are users of a copyrighted work are, or are likely to be, adversely affected, and the prohibition contained in subparagraph (A) shall not apply to such users with respect to such class of works for the ensuing 3-year period."" 5  The first 1201 rulemaking took place three years ago, and on October 27, 2000, the Librarian announced noninfringing users of two classes of works would not be subject to the prohibition on circumvention of access controls.6 The regulations announced by the Librarian were effective for the period commencing October 28, 2000. Exemptions to the prohibition on circumvention remain in force for a three-year period and expire at the end of that period. The Librarian is required to make a determination on potential new exemptions every three years.  Report of the Committee of Conference on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, H.R. Rep.

Responsibilities of Register of Copyrights and Librarian of Congress  As noted above, the prohibition against circumvention is subject to triennial review by Register of Copyrights and the Librarian of Congress in order to permit a determination whether users of particular classes of copyrighted works are, or in the next three years are likely to be, adversely affected by the prohibition in their ability to make noninfringing uses of copyrighted works. The primary responsibility of the Register and the Librarian in this rulemaking proceeding is to assess whether the implementation of access control measures is diminishing the ability of individuals to use copyrighted works in ways that are otherwise lawful.7 As examples of technological protection measures in effect today, the Commerce Committee offered the use of ``password codes'' to control authorized access to computer programs and encryption or scrambling of cable programming, videocassettes, and CD-ROMs.8 Congress intended that the Register solicit input that would enable consideration of a broad range of current or likely future adverse impacts. The nature of the inquiry for the rulemaking process as a whole is delineated in the statutory areas to be examined, as set forth in section 1201(a)(1)(C): (i) The availability for use of copyrighted works; (ii) The availability for use of works for nonprofit archival, preservation, and educational purposes; (iii) The impact that the prohibition on the circumvention of technological measures applied to copyrighted works has on criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research; (iv) The effect of circumvention of technological measures on the market for or value of copyrighted works; and (v) Such other factors as the Librarian considers appropriate. These factors to be considered in the rulemaking process require the Register to carefully balance the availability of works for use, the effect of the prohibition on particular uses and the effect of circumvention on copyrighted works.  7 8  Commerce Comm. Report, at 37. Id.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 7  C.  The Purpose and Focus of the Rulemaking 1. Purpose of the Rulemaking  As originally drafted, 1201(a)(1) consisted of only one sentence--what is now the first sentence of 1201(a)(1): ""No person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title.""9 Section 1201(a)(2), like the provision finally enacted, prohibited the manufacture, importation, offering to the public, providing or otherwise trafficking in any technology, product, service, device, or component to circumvent access control measures. Section 1201(a) thus addressed ""access control"" measures, prohibiting both the conduct of circumventing those measures and devices that circumvent them. Thus, 1201(a) prohibits both the conduct of circumventing access control measures and trafficking in products, services and devices that circumvent access control measures. In addition to 1201(a)(1)'s prohibition on circumvention of access control measures, 1201 also addressed circumvention of a different type of technological measure. Section 1201(b) prohibits the manufacture, importation, offering to the public, providing or otherwise trafficking in any technology, product, service, device, or component to circumvent protection afforded by a technological measure that effectively protects a right of a copyright owner under title 17 in a copyrighted work. The type of technological measure addressed in 1201(b) includes copy-control measures and other measures that control uses of works that would infringe the exclusive rights of the copyright owner. They will frequently be referred to herein as copy controls. But unlike 1201(a), which prohibits both the conduct of circumvention and devices that circumvent, 1201(b) does not prohibit the conduct of circumventing copy control measures. The prohibition in 1201(b) extends only to devices that circumvent copy control measures. The decision not to prohibit the conduct of circumventing copy controls was made, in part, because it would penalize some noninfringing conduct such as fair use. In the House of Representatives, the DMCA was sequentially referred to the Committee on Commerce after it was reported out of the Judiciary Committee. The Commerce Committee was concerned that section 1201, in its original form, might  9  See S. Rep. No. 105-190 (1998), and H.R. Rep. No. 105-551, pt. I (1998).   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 8  undermine Congress' commitment to fair use.10 While acknowledging that the growth and development of the Internet has had a significant positive impact on the access of students, researchers, consumers, and the public at large to information and that a ""plethora of information, most of it embodied in materials subject to copyright protection, is available to individuals, often for free, that just a few years ago could have been located and acquired only through the expenditure of considerable time, resources, and money,""'11 the Committee was concerned that ""marketplace realities may someday dictate a different outcome, resulting in less access, rather than more, to copyrighted materials that are important to education, scholarship, and other socially vital endeavors.""12 Possible measures that might lead to such an outcome included the elimination of print or other hard-copy versions, permanent encryption of all electronic copies and adoption of business models that restrict distribution and availability of works. The Committee concluded that ""[i]n this scenario, it could be appropriate to modify the flat prohibition against the circumvention of effective technological measures that control access to copyrighted materials, in order to ensure that access for lawful purposes is not unjustifiably diminished.""13 In order to address such possible developments, the Commerce Committee proposed a modification of  1201 which it characterized as a ""`fail-safe' mechanism.""14 In the words of the Committee Report, ""This mechanism would monitor developments in the marketplace for copyrighted materials, and allow the enforceability of the prohibition against the act of circumvention to be selectively waived, for limited time periods, if necessary to prevent a diminution in the availability to individual users of a particular category of copyrighted materials.""15 The ""fail-safe"" mechanism is this rulemaking. In its final form as enacted  10 11 12 13 14 15  Commerce Comm. Report at 35. Id. Id. at 36. Id. Id. Id.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 9  by Congress, slightly modified from the mechanism that appeared in the version of the DMCA reported out of the Commerce Committee, the Register is to conduct a rulemaking proceeding and, after consulting with the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information of the Department of Commerce, recommend to the Librarian whether he should conclude ""that persons who are users of a copyrighted work are, or are likely to be in the succeeding 3-year period, adversely affected by the prohibition under [ 1201(a)(1)(A)] in their ability to make noninfringing uses under [Title 17] of a particular class of copyrighted works.""16 ""The Librarian shall publish any class of copyrighted works for which the Librarian has determined, pursuant to the rulemaking conducted under subparagraph (C), that noninfringing uses by persons who are users of a copyrighted work are, or are likely to be, adversely affected, and the prohibition contained in subparagraph (A) shall not apply to such users with respect to such class of works for the ensuing 3-year period.""17 The Commerce Committee offered additional guidance as to the task of the Register and the Librarian in this rulemaking. ""The goal of the proceeding is to assess whether the implementation of technological protection measures that effectively control access to copyrighted works is adversely affecting the ability of individual users to make lawful uses of copyrighted works .... The primary goal of the rulemaking proceeding is to assess whether the prevalence of these technological protections, with respect to particular categories of copyrighted materials, is diminishing the ability of individuals to use these works in ways that are otherwise lawful.""18 Thus, the task of this rulemaking appears to be to determine whether the availability and use of access control measures has already diminished or is about to diminish the ability of the public to engage in the lawful uses of copyrighted works that the public had traditionally been able to make prior to the enactment of the DMCA.

Coble)(Comm. Print 1998), at 6.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 10  Committee Report stated, in examining the factors set forth in section 1201(a)(1)(C), the focus must be on ""whether the implementation of technological protection measures (such as encryption or scrambling) has caused adverse impact on the ability of users to make lawful uses."" 19  2.  The Necessary Showing  The language of section 1201(a)(1) does not offer much guidance as to the respective burdens of proponents and opponents of any classes of works to be exempted from the prohibition on circumvention. The Commerce Comm. Report stated that ""[t]he regulatory prohibition is presumed to apply to any and all kinds of works, including those as to which a waiver of applicability was previously in effect, unless, and until, the Secretary makes a new determination that the adverse impact criteria have been met with respect to a particular class and therefore issues a new waiver."" 20  After reviewing the record and the legislative history of the section, the Register concluded that the burden of proof for proposed exemption was on the proponents of the exemption.21 In order to make a prima facie case for an exemption, proponents must show by a preponderance of the evidence that there has been or is likely to be a substantial adverse effect on noninfringing uses by users of copyrighted works.22 As the Copyright Office's notice of inquiry  19 20  Id. at 2.  Commerce Comm. Report, at 37. The Commerce Committee proposal would have placed responsibility for the rulemaking in the hands of the Secretary of Commerce. As finally enacted, the DMCA shifted that responsibility to the Librarian, upon the recommendation of the Register. 21 22  65 FR at 64558-64559.  For additional discussion of the use and meaning of the term ""substantial,"" see the discussion below (section I.D.) of the Register's consultation with the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information of the Department of Commerce.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 11  explained, de minimis problems, isolated harm or mere inconveniences would not suffice to provide the necessary showing.23 Similarly, for proof of ""likely"" adverse effects on noninfringing uses, the Register found that a proponent must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the harm alleged is more likely than not; a proponent may not rely on speculation alone to sustain a prima facie case of likely adverse effects on noninfringing uses.24 The Register also emphasized the requirement of showing a causal nexus between the prohibition on circumvention and the alleged harm.25 Adverse impacts that are the result of factors other than the prohibition are not within the scope of this rulemaking.  The Register also makes it clear within this recommendation that the proposed exemptions are reviewed de novo. The existence of a previous exemption creates no presumption for consideration of a new exemption, but rather the proponent of such an exemption must make a prima facie case in each three-year period.  3.  Determination of ""Class of Works""  A major focus of the previous (and first) rulemaking proceeding was how a ``class'' of works is to be defined. The Register determined that the statutory language requires that the Librarian identify a ""class of works"" based upon attributes of the works themselves, and not by reference to some external criteria such as the intended use or users of the works. The Register also found that the legislative history appears to leave no other alternative than to interpret the statute as requiring a ""class"" to be defined primarily, if not exclusively, by reference to attributes of the works themselves. The Commerce Committee Report addressed the issue of determining a class of works:  23 24 25  67 FR 63578, 63579-63580 (October 15, 2002). Id. 65 FR at 64559.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 12  The issue of defining the scope or boundaries of a ""particular class"" of copyrighted works as to which the implementation of technological protection measures has been shown to have had an adverse impact is an important one to be determined during the rulemaking proceedings. In assessing whether users of copyrighted works have been, or are likely to be adversely affected, the Secretary shall assess users' ability to make lawful uses of works ""within each particular class of copyrighted works specified in the rulemaking."" The Committee intends that the ""particular class of copyrighted works"" be a narrow and focused subset of the broad categories of works of authorship than [sic] is identified in section 102 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. 102).26 Because the term ``category'' of works has a well-understood meaning in the copyright law, referring to the categories set forth in section 102, the Register concluded that the starting point for any definition of a ""particular class"" of works in this rulemaking must be one of the section 102 categories. The illustrative list of categories appearing in section 102 of Title 17 is only a starting point for this decision and a ""class"" will generally constitute some subset of a section 102 category. Crafting the appropriate scope of a ""class"" is one of the major functions of the rulemaking proceeding. The scope of any class will necessarily be determined by the evidence of the present or likely adverse effects on noninfringing uses. The determination of the appropriate scope of a ""class of works"" recommended for exemption will also take into account the adverse effects an exemption may have on the market for or value of copyrighted works. While starting with a section 102 category of works, or a subcategory thereof, the description of a ""particular class"" of works ordinarily should be further refined by reference to other factors that assist in ensuring that the scope of the class addresses the scope of the harm to noninfringing uses. For example, the class might be defined in part by reference to the medium on which the works are distributed, or even to the access control measures applied to them. But classifying a work solely by reference to the medium on which the work appears, or the access control measures applied to the work, would be beyond the  26  Commerce Comm. Report, at 38   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 13  scope of what ""particular class of work"" is intended to be. And it is not permissible to classify a work by reference to the type of user or use (e.g., libraries, or scholarly research). 27  D.  Consultation with the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information  Section 1201(a)(1)(C) requires the Register of Copyrights to consult with the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information of the Department of Commerce and report and comment on the Assistant Secretary's views in the making of the recommendation to the Librarian of Congress.  The Register of Copyrights met with Assistant Secretary Nancy Victory at the Department of Commerce in November, 2002 to discuss the rulemaking proceeding initiated by the Copyright Office. The Assistant Secretary, who is also the Administrator of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), was briefed on the rulemaking process established by the Register and was invited to provide input as early as possible so that such information could be fully considered by the Register in the course of this rulemaking proceeding.  After this initial meeting, the Assistant Secretary and her staff were notified about developments in the rulemaking, such as the posting of comments and reply comments on the Copyright Office's website, and were kept apprised of information about the hearings that would be held in Washington, D.C. and in Los Angeles, California. Senior counsel for NTIA attended hearings at both locations.  27  For a more detailed discussion of the term ""class of works,"" see, 65 FR at 64559 -  64561.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 14  Following the hearings and prior to beginning deliberations on the record in the rulemaking, on June 6, 2003, the Register wrote to the Assistant Secretary requesting further consultation and offered to meet again to discuss the Assistant Secretary's views or, alternatively, requesting the Assistant Secretary's views and analysis in writing. Another meeting was held between the Register and the Assistant Secretary on July 28, 2003 at the Department of Commerce. At that time, the Assistant Secretary briefed the Register on her views and advised the Register that a letter elaborating on those views would be sent to the Register shortly. The Assistant Secretary advised the Register that rather than address any particular proposals for exemptions, NTIA would be commenting on the rulemaking process itself.  In an August 11, 2003 letter to the Register, the Assistant Secretary addressed many of the points discussed at the previous meeting and which provided ""advice to the Register that will inform her consideration of the record, and will help to ensure that both the underlying rulemaking proceeding and her recommendation to the Librarian of Congress comply with the intent of Congress as reflected in the statute and its legislative history.""  The Assistant Secretary first addressed the appropriate standard for the burden of proof in the rulemaking process. The letter stated that ""NTIA is concerned that the standard set forth in the Notice of Inquiry (the ""NOI"") imposes a significantly heightened burden on proponents of an exemption, and is therefore inconsistent with the opportunity that Congress intended to afford the user community."" In particular, the letter expressed concern that the Copyright Office's initial NOI of October 15, 2002 used the term ""substantial"" in relation to the quantum of evidence necessary to prove that the prohibition on circumvention has had an adverse effect on noninfringing uses of works by users of copyrighted works. The Assistant Secretary stated that since the word ""substantial"" does not appear in the statutory text, this ""more stringent requirement thus appears to add a significant new term to the express language of the statute."" The Assistant Secretary stated that   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 15  ""[g]iven the clarity of Section 1201(a)(1), no basis exists to justify insertion of a material modifier into its text.""  The Assistant Secretary's letter continued by opining that the NOI's ""requirement"" that commenters provide ""actual"" and ""first-hand"" knowledge of problems in the marketplace resulting from the prohibition exceeds the plain language of the statute and thus raises the bar for proponents of exemptions. The letter stated that this ""requirement"" cannot logically be applied prospectively and that therefore this ""refinement"" should be abandoned ""and a standard more consistent with the statutory language should be adopted.""28 Similarly, with respect to future ""likely adverse impacts,"" the letter objected that there is no basis for requiring a showing of ""extraordinary circumstances in which the evidence of likelihood is highly specific, strong and persuasive,"" and asserted that no requirements beyond ""likely adverse effects"" are warranted.  The Assistant Secretary also stated that she agreed with the October 15, 2002 NOI that the burden of proof rests with proponents of exemptions and that the assessment of adverse impacts is to be determined de novo. The Assistant Secretary also agreed with the Register that the starting point for identifying a particular class of works to be exempted must be one of the section 102 categories, but suggested that the intended use of the work or the attributes of the user will sometimes be critical to that determination.  The Register has carefully considered the views of the Assistant Secretary and can report that, despite any impression that might be drawn from the Assistant Secretary's letter, the Register and the Assistant Secretary actually appear to view the legal criteria governing this rulemaking in much the same way. The Assistant Secretary, like some other observers and commenters, appears to  28  NTIA letter at 3.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 16  have read the NOI as imposing a higher burden on proponents of exempted classes than was intended or than the Register believes was stated in the NOI. It had been the Register's intent that the NOI, which was based upon the criteria set forth in the announcement of the final rule in the October 2000 rulemaking, would clarify the appropriate burden of proof and required showing by proponents.  Because it appears that the Assistant Secretary (among others) has in some respects misapprehended what was said in the NOI, it is pertinent to offer some additional clarification.  It appears that the use of the term ""substantial"" in the NOI and in the Register's recommendation in 2000 has caused undue alarm. A term that has one meaning in the context of a particular body of law may have different connotations for persons who do not specialize in that field. The phrase ""substantial adverse impact,"" as quoted from the House Manager's Report in the previous recommendation and the NOI, has been mischaracterized by many commenters, including both proponents and opponents of exemptions, as requiring a high standard of proof. The Register did not quote this term from the legislative history in order to impose a heightened standard for proposals for exemptions, but rather used the phrase, taken from the House Manager's Report on the DMCA (at p. 6), as a shorthand phrase to supplement and clarify what both the House Manager's Report and the House Commerce Committee Report stated about the necessary showing for proponents of exemptions. Read in context, the phrase ""substantial adverse impact""  the words used by the House Manager's Report  is the equivalent of what the Commerce Committee Report described as a requirement of a showing of ""distinct, verifiable, and measurable impacts."" See Commerce Comm. Report, at 37. ""Substantial,"" after all, simply means the opposite of ""insubstantial."" Surely an exemption would not be warranted if its proponents made a showing that the prohibition on circumvention was having an insubstantial adverse impact on users' ability to engage in noninfringing uses of copyrighted works. Stating that there is a requirement of   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 17  ""substantial"" adverse impact is another way of saying that a showing of more than ""de minimis impacts"" is required. See id. (exemption ""should not be based upon de minimis impacts"").  The dictionary defines ""substantial"" as ""consisting of or relating to substance;"" ""not imaginary or illusory."" Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary 1153 (1980). Similarly, the Supreme Court has stated: ""Substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.""29 The Court's use of ""substantial"" in that context is similar to the meaning that the Register intended to convey in her use of the term in this rulemaking and the previous rulemaking. The Register is confident that Congress did not intend that hypothetical or inadequate evidence could be the basis for an exemption. The Assistant Secretary's letter appears to agree with this view. It appears, therefore, that NTIA and many others have misunderstood the meaning of the term ""substantial"" in this context. The Register reaffirms that ""substantial"" is a reasonable description of the requisite showing when it is given its proper meaning.  Further, the meaning of this term was clarified in the Register's 2000 recommendation which highlighted the congruence between the language of the Commerce Committee's Report and the House Manager's Report.30 When the Commerce Committee and House Manager's Reports are read together, it becomes clear that this burden of proof is not more stringent than the statutory text, but rather is a clarification that any showing must be based on real, verifiable, and reasonable evidence. Such a showing is equally applicable to present or likely harm. Substantial evidence of likely adverse impacts is more than mere speculative or theoretical harm. It requires more than ""mere inconveniences, or individual cases."" With this further clarification, the Register hopes that this  29 30  Metropolitan Stevedore Co. v. Rambo, 521 U.S. 121, 149 (1997). 65 FR 64556, 64558 n.4 (October 27, 2000)   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 18  term will be accurately understood by all participants in future rulemakings. This is the meaning that has been consistently applied by the Register throughout the history of this rulemaking process, and the Register intends to apply it in the future.  As the NOI stated, ""[d]e minimis or isolated problems would be insufficient to warrant an exemption for a class of works. Similarly, mere inconveniences to noninfringing uses or theoretical critiques of section 1201 would not satisfy the requisite showing."" Despite the Register's efforts to inform commenters about the proper composition of comments, a sizeable number of comments were again based on theoretical arguments, de minimis or completely absent proof of present or likely harm, and mere inconveniences. Nevertheless, even these comments were accepted, considered, put into the record in this rulemaking, and generally addressed in this recommendation.  The Register must also clarify the record with respect to the NOI's statements about ""firsthand knowledge"" and ""actual instances of verifiable problems existing in the marketplace."" Both of these statements were clearly made in relation to evidence of existing adverse effects and did not refer to the required showing with respect to ""likely adverse effects."" Proof that users ""are adversely affected by the prohibition"" can only be interpreted as requiring that users are ""actually harmed."" To prove actual harm, a proponent must provide a factual basis. ""Actual instances of verifiable problems"" is a clear way of presenting this term to the public and is entirely consistent with a standard of actual harm. On the other hand, ""first-hand knowledge"" was not stated as a ""requirement"" in the NOI, but rather was an effort to encourage those with such knowledge to come forward. The NOI merely stated that ""a compelling case will be based on first-hand knowledge"" (emphasis added) and as will be revealed in the analysis of the exemptions recommended below, the majority included ""first-hand knowledge."" The Register stands by her preference to hear from persons with actual knowledge of the facts they are asserting as a basis for requesting an exemption. Experience with the first two rulemakings has confirmed that participants (or their representatives)   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 19  with no actual knowledge of the facts have been of little assistance in evaluating a proposed exemption. The most compelling cases will be presented by those with the most thorough knowledge of the facts.  The NOI was very clear in stating the Register's view that proof of ""likely adverse effects"" during the next three years does not entail a heightened requirement involving ""first-hand knowledge"" and ""actual instances of verifiable problems existing in the marketplace."" These statements in the NOI appeared in a sentence describing ""the burden with respect to actual harm,"" which the previous sentence in the NOI distinguished from harm ""that it is `likely' to occur in the ensuing 3-year period."" The Register therefore agrees with the Assistant Secretary (and has not stated otherwise) that ""this requirement cannot logically be applied prospectively, as the refinement would mandate `first-hand knowledge' of future problems in order to sustain a `compelling case' for an exemption.""  The Assistant Secretary's letter states that the NOI seems to suggest that an exemption based on ""likely"" future adverse impacts during the applicable period should only be made ""in extraordinary circumstances in which the evidence of likelihood is highly specific, strong and persuasive"" because the NOI quoted the legislative history to that effect.31 Giving due regard to legislative history, the Register has not stated that she will require such a showing as a prerequisite for an exemption based on likely future harm. The legislative history is certainly relevant on this point, and any proponent of an exemption based solely on a prediction of future harm should be prepared to address it. But the NOI did not state that such a requirement will be imposed with respect to a showing of likely future harm. In fact, it stated (just after quoting the ""highly specific, strong and persuasive"" language) that ""[w]hile such a statement could be interpreted as raising the  31  House Manager's Report at 6.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 20  burden beyond a standard of a preponderance of the evidence, the statutory language enacted . . . does not specify a standard beyond more likely than not.""32 While speculation alone will not be sufficient, the NOI makes clear that proof of ""likely adverse effects"" requires only a showing of likelihood  i.e., more likely than not, the traditional preponderance of the evidence standard. The burden of proof required by the Register is no more stringent than the statutory text.  After this closer inspection, it is apparent that the Register and the Assistant Secretary are in agreement on most points raised in the NTIA's August 11, 2003 letter. The Register also concurs with NTIA's view that it would be useful for Congress to provide additional guidance on the term ""class of works,"" a view expressed by the Register in her recommendation three years ago. 33  II.  Solicitation of Public Comments and Hearings On October 15, 2002, the Librarian and the Register initiated the second rulemaking  proceeding pursuant to 1201(a)(1)(C) with publication of a Notice of Inquiry.34 The Notice of Inquiry requested written comments from all interested parties, including representatives of educational institutions, libraries and archives, scholars, researchers, copyright owners and other members of the public. The Notice devoted a great deal of attention to setting out the legislative parameters and the scope of the rulemaking based on the determinations made in the first rulemaking. The Register was determined to make the comments she received publicly available as quickly as possible in order to elicit a broad range of public participation; therefore, the Notice  32 33 34  67 FR at 63579 65 FR at 64562. 67 FR 63578; http://www.copyright.gov/fedreg/2002/67fr63578.html.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 21  stated a preference for submission of comments in electronic format and created a web-based form to facilitate comment submission. 35  During the initial comment period that ended on December 18, 2002, the Copyright Office received 50 written comments, all of which were received electronically and posted on the Office's website.36 Parties submitting comments during this period were asked to specify a class or classes of works proposed for exemption and to provide the factual and/or legal basis for each proposed exemption along with summaries of their arguments. Many of the fifty initial comments contained proposals for multiple classes of works proposed for exemption.  During the reply comment period which ended on February 19, 2003, commenters were requested to provide either support or opposition to the proposals for exemption introduced in the initial comment period and to provide factual and/or legal arguments in support of their position. The Office received a total of 272 reply comments in response to the initial proposals for exemption. All of these reply comments were also received electronically and posted on the Copyright Office website.37  Due to the fact that the established comment period necessarily ended many months before a final determination on the evidence was complete, the Office created a new process by which a petitioner could seek consideration for a newly proposed exemption for a class of works which could not reasonably have been offered during the formal comment period.38 This process was intended to  35 36 37 38  Id. http://www.copyright.gov/1201/2003/comments/index.html. http://www.copyright.gov/1201/2003/reply/reply1.html. See, 67 FR at 63582.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 22  provide some flexibility to take account of important unanticipated developments. One such petition was received, and the Register granted the petition to consider the additional classes of works proposed in that petition.39 Since this petition was granted during the reply comment period, the Copyright Office created a new reply period for reply comments responsive to the proposed exemptions contained in the granted petition.40 This reply comment period ended on March 10, 2003 and the Office received an additional 65 reply comments responsive to this proposal which were also posted on the Office's website.41  The Copyright Office also conducted public hearings on six separate days: in Washington, DC on April 11, May 1, 2 and 4, 200342 and in Los Angeles, California, at the UCLA Law School on May 14 and 15, 2003.43 Forty-four witnesses representing over 60 groups testified at six days of hearings held in either Washington, DC or Los Angeles, California. The transcripts for all of these hearing were posted on the Copyright Office's website shortly after their receipt.44 Following the hearings, the Office sent questions to certain witnesses participating in the hearings to clarify certain statements made during the hearings or to respond to questions resulting from particular testimony at the hearings. The questions and post-hearing responses received by the Copyright Office were made  39 40 41 42 43 44  http://www.copyright.gov/1201/2003/petitions/index.html 68 FR 6678. http://www.copyright.gov/fedreg/2003/68fr6678.html 68 FR 13652 and, see also, 68 FR 19966. 68 FR 15972. http://www.copyright.gov/1201/2003/hearings/schedule.html   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 23  available on the Office's website.45 The entire record in this and the previous 1201(a)(1)(C) rulemaking are available on the Office's website.46  The Register has now carefully reviewed and analyzed the entire record in this rulemaking proceeding, including all of the comments and the transcripts of the hearings in order to determine whether any class of copyrighted works should be exempt from the prohibition against circumvention during the next three years. The analysis of the record produced in this rulemaking, including the proposals recommended for exemption by the Register as well as those not recommended by the Register, is set forth herein.47  III.  Discussion A. The Four Exempted Classes 1. Compilations consisting of lists of Internet locations blocked by commercially marketed filtering software applications that are intended to prevent access to domains, websites or portions of websites, but not including lists of Internet locations blocked by software applications that operate exclusively to protect against damage to a computer or computer network or lists of Internet locations blocked by software applications that operate exclusively to prevent receipt of email. For purposes of this exemption,""Internet locations"" are defined to include ""domains, uniform resource locators (URLs), numeric IP addresses or any combination thereof.""  45 46 47  http://www.copyright.gov/1201/2003/post-hearing/index.html http://www.copyright.gov/1201/index.html  In referring to the comments and hearing materials, the Register will use the following abbreviations and conventions: C - Initial Comment, R - Reply Comment, TTranscript, and PHR - Post Hearing Response. When comments or reply comments include a parenthetical number, e.g., C25(2), this refers to the number of the proposal referenced within the comment (e.g., Proposed Class No. 2 in Comment 25). Citations to page numbers of the transcript refer to the pages of the official transcript that is currently posted on the Copyright Office website. References to post hearing responses will include the date only if there are multiple responses from the same individual or organization.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 24  As in the previous rulemaking, initial comments proposed an exemption to the prohibition on circumvention in order to access the lists of blocked websites that are used in various filtering software programs sometimes referred to as ""censorware."" These programs are intended to prevent children and other Internet users from viewing objectionable material while online. It was alleged that although the software is intended to serve a useful societal purpose, the emphasis of the programs is on blocking rather than accuracy. Critics contend that the result of this focus is that filtering software used to prevent access to objectionable material tends to over-block, thereby preventing access to legitimate information resources.  Unlike the last rulemaking, where there was no opposition to the proposed exemption, in the current rulemaking the proposed exemption drew some objections. Opponents to the exemption argued that filtering software companies serve a critical societal purpose and that an exemption would undermine the integrity of filtering software. They also argued that filtering software companies have responded to the concerns that led to the exemption in the previous rulemaking and now provide reasonable means for ascertaining the material or sites that a particular filtering software blocks. Opponents also argued that the proponents have not met their burden of showing substantial harm and that exemptions cannot be ""renewed"" in the absence of evidence that the conditions leading to a previous exemption have not been corrected. Such a ""renewal,"" it was argued, would shift the burden of proof to the opponents and undermine the de novo review intended by Congress in this triennial rulemaking.48 Opponents also stated that even if the Register found that an exemption was warranted, the particular class articulated in the previous rulemaking was overly  48  R33, pp. 6, 11; R34, p. 9.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 25  broad and that repeating an exemption for that class could create adverse consequences for other types of software, such as antivirus and spam software.49  At the outset, the Register disagrees with the commenters who suggested that an exemption can be ""renewed"" if the opponents of an exemption do not prove that adverse effects identified in a previous rulemaking have not been cured. The burden of proof for an exemption rests with its proponents, and the fact that an exemption was granted in the previous rulemaking creates no presumptions. The exemptions in each rulemaking are considered de novo.50 Congress anticipated that market conditions would be constantly changing and that the market would be viewed anew in each triennial proceeding.  While the Register rejects the argument that the previous exemption should be ""renewed"" in the absence of evidence that the adverse effects which led to the previous exemption have been cured in the marketplace, the Register finds that the record in the current rulemaking warrants a new exemption. The previous exemption covered ""Compilations consisting of lists of websites blocked by filtering software applications."" For the reasons specified below, the Register recommends that the new class exempted should be designated as ""compilations consisting of lists of Internet locations blocked by commercially marketed filtering software applications that are intended to prevent access to domains, websites or portions of websites, but not including lists of Internet locations blocked by software applications that operate exclusively to protect against damage to a computer or computer network or lists of Internet locations blocked by software applications that operate exclusively to prevent receipt of email."" For purposes of this exemption,""Internet locations""  See, e.g., R23, p. 13; T Steve Metalitz, May 14, 2003, p. 29; PHR Steve Metalitz, Joint Reply Commenters, June 30, 2003, p. 3-4; PHR David Burt, N2H2, Inc., et al., p. 4-7. 50  49  Commerce Comm. Report at 37. Accord, NTIA letter.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 26  are defined to include ""domains, uniform resource locators (URLs), numeric IP addresses or any combination thereof.""  The Register's recommendation in favor of this exemption is based primarily on the evidence introduced in the comments and testimony by one person, Seth Finkelstein, a non-lawyer participating on his own behalf. In addition to identifying a class of works that related to the specific facts presented, he identified the qualitative nature of the noninfringing uses for which circumvention was necessary and generally identified the technological measure which controlled access to this class. There was no dispute that the lists of Internet locations blocked by filtering software are generally encrypted or otherwise protected by an access control measure. The remedy sought was causally related to the noninfringing uses that are necessary to conduct research, comment and criticism on the filtering software at issue. Mr. Finkelstein also anticipated objections to the exemption and proved that available alternatives to the exemption were insufficient to remedy the adverse effect caused by the prohibition. The insufficiency of alternatives was supported by testimony and demonstrative evidence at the hearing in California by James Tyre. Finally, Mr. Finkelstein's succinct initial comment addressed the statutory requirements and thoughtfully analyzed each of the statutory factors required to be considered in this rulemaking.  The case made by Mr. Finkelstein for this exemption is also instructive for the manner in which it met the requisite showing. The evidence produced did not prove that a substantial number of people have utilized or were likely to utilize an exemption. On the contrary, the evidence tended to prove that very few people have had the motivation or technological ability to circumvent this technological measure, to investigate the lists of blocked sites in filtering software or to report on, comment on or criticize such lists. Although there was little need for an exemption in quantitative terms (i.e., in terms of the number of persons likely to take advantage of it directly), it was the qualitative need for an exemption that was controlling in this case; absent the ability of a few to   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 27  carry out their noninfringing efforts notwithstanding the prohibition set forth in section 1201, the many would not reap the fruits of such efforts  the information, analysis, criticism and comment enabled by the quantitatively small number of acts of circumvention. The fact that the act of circumvention was unlikely to be widespread rebutted copyright owners' concerns of abuse and further supported the conclusion that the potential adverse effects to copyright owners would be minimal. The showing that the particular noninfringing use prevented was a result of the prohibition on circumvention and that these uses were necessary to criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research, further strengthened the argument.  Opponents argued that circumvention is not necessary because other alternative sources for the information sought to be obtained are available, but the proponents of the exemption successfully discredited this assertion. While it is true that limited ""querying"" of the databases is available on some of the filtering software companies' sites, the circumscribed nature of this querying foreclosed comprehensive or meaningful results. Opponents produced evidence that many reviews of filtering software platforms reached conclusions based on these querying capabilities or by utilizing various sampling techniques, yet this evidence only proved that some parties were willing to settle for the results produced by such superficial tests. In light of the millions (or more) of potential URLs, it is indisputable that actually viewing the entire list of blocked Internet locations will produce data much more comprehensive than querying about one hundred URLs.  Had opponents been able to prove that the likely harm of an exemption would have outweighed the benefit of comprehensive testing, particularly given the availability of limited testing, a balancing of the interests might have favored opponents. Where, however, there is no indication of likely harm that would result from an exemption and where proponents have proven the inadequacy of existing alternatives (the limited queries that some filtering software providers permit) and the societal benefit of more extensive access that is available only through circumvention, the   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 28  balance favors the proponents of the exemption. The opponents' arguments that circumvention would undermine the integrity of the filtering software or that an exemption could have an adverse effect on other types of protective software are unpersuasive. The societal benefit of preventing children or others from viewing objectionable sites is likely to be unaffected or even assisted by an exemption. A computer which has filtering software installed will continue to block sites within its blocking list even if one knows the URLs for the sites. Proponents of an exemption pointed out that in the fiercely competitive filtering software market, one filtering software company has actually posted the URLs of blocked sites on its company website as a form of comparative advertising, in order to reveal that it was blocking objectionable sites which another competitor was failing to block. Thus, exposing what filtering software does not block or exposing over-blocking or questionable blocking does not undermine the goal of protecting children and others from harmful or objectionable material. In fact, the evidence tended to show that the results only obtainable by means of circumvention may in fact improve under- or over-blocking flaws in filtering software, thus furthering the potential benefit of such software. Since the end result of the circumvention is criticism, comment, and possibly news reporting on existing problems, filtering software companies may utilize the research to address problems revealed by such publicity. Given the competition in the filtering software market for market share, robust blocking currently appears to be more important than precision. The evidence tended to show that the incentive to continually verify the objectionable nature of the blocked sites appears lackluster at best  an important concern given the rapid pace and dynamic nature of the Internet  and is of less concern to filtering companies than is the concern for comprehensiveness.51 This may be understandable, but this focus on comprehensiveness does not alter the societal benefit of learning about over-blocking that may occur. Taken to an extreme, moreover, an obsession with comprehensiveness could lead to unnecessary or even harmful censorship of legitimate information that would adversely affect the usefulness of Internet research. While the marketplace might, in theory, limit excesses in the over-  51  T David Burt and Seth Finkelstein, April 11, 2003, p. 81-84.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 29  blocking of legitimate information, the market can only correct problems that participants in the marketplace are aware of. That is at the heart of this exemption  allowing information to be made available to the public in a lawful manner. The exposure of alleged flaws by those with an incentive to learn about them can be utilized by the filtering companies themselves, if they so choose, to make their software more accurate. The exemption is likely to have the effect of encouraging legitimate public debate based on the information obtained through circumvention.  The ability to engage in legitimate research, criticism and comment about filtering software is even more compelling as a result of the recent Supreme Court decision upholding the constitutionality of the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA).52 Since CIPA requires libraries to install ""filtering software"" in order to block access to objectionable material as a condition of receiving federal funds, it becomes all the more important for the public to understand potential problems in particular filtering programs that may be installed in public facilities. Since the Court found that an important safety valve within CIPA was the ability of a library patron to request the disabling of such software, it appears all the more important that the public be able to obtain objective information about the performance or potential limitations of such software in order to make the determination whether to request such disabling.  In contrast to the strength of the case in favor of an exemption, there was virtually no plausible evidence that such an exemption would have any relevant adverse effects on the market for or value of these copyrighted works.53 While it is obviously true that the exposure of substantial flaws in a program will adversely affect the filtering software's value by affecting market demand,  United States v. American Library Association, Inc., ___ U.S. ___, 123 S.Ct. 2297, 156 L.Ed.2d 221 (2003). 53  52  See e.g., T David Burt, Seth Finkelstein and Jonathan Band, April 11, 2003 p. 66-  72.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 30  such an adverse market effect is not a relevant concern in this rulemaking.54 In assessing the likelihood of harm to filtering software that would result from an exemption, the absence of any identifiable harm that resulted from the previous exemption is informative. While there is no burden on the opponents of exemption to show that a similar preexisting exemption has caused harm, silence on the issue may raise inferences. While opponents raised the possibility that the lack of use of the prior exemption may have minimized the harm, they also claimed that such minimal or nonexistent use obviated the need for an exemption. As previously noted, however, this proposed exemption is not grounded on the need for widespread circumvention. In this factual setting, enabling the efforts of the few who will find sanctuary in the exemption will have the effect of remedying the adverse effects of the prohibition on the public generally by allowing those who circumvent measures that protect lists of blocked websites to comment publicly on their findings.  In response to the concern that the designation of this class in the previous rulemaking was overbroad and had the capacity to create unintended consequences for other types of software, such as antivirus or spam filtering software, the Copyright Office posed a post-hearing question to seek further clarification from the witnesses who testified on this subject. After considering these responses in conjunction with the comments and the testimony, the Register finds that rather than being too broad, the class of works previously exempted may be too narrow to encompass the facts introduced in this rulemaking.  In the previous rulemaking, the class was designated as ""compilations consisting of lists of websites blocked by filtering software applications."" Despite the asserted concern that an unintended consequence of such a class designation could be that other forms of filtering software would be Cf. Campbell v. Acuff-Rose, 510 U.S. 569, 591-592 (1994) (""We do not, of course, suggest that a parody may not harm the market at all, but when a lethal parody, like a scathing theater review, kills demand for the original, it does not produce a harm cognizable under the Copyright Act."") 54   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 31  compromised by this class, the Register is skeptical of this argument. The prior exemption was narrowly tailored to allow circumvention of ""lists of websites blocked by filtering software."" Since it seems unlikely that spam filtering software which filters email or antivirus software which protects against malicious or suspicious file types necessarily contain ""lists of websites,"" it is unclear how such a class could affect such other types of filtering software. Unfortunately, there was little evidence produced on this issue. The Joint Reply Commenters' response to the specific post-hearing question posed by the Copyright Office stated ""[i]t is important to note the broad array of critical network security tools that may employ lists of websites protected by access controls. These include for example, firewalls (which in effect filter traffic based on defined parameters contained in a compilation or database) and antivirus products (which perform a similar function using compilations or databases of virus definitions or characteristics).""55 The Register agrees that the proposed exemption is intended to be limited to the type of filtering software known as ""censorware"" and that there is no intention to affect spam filtering software, virus protection software or other security software such as firewalls.  A representative of a number of the filtering software companies suggested that filtering software is often marketed in security ""suites,"" which are bundled packages of security software applications together with filtering software that provide a ""layered"" security approach. Filtering software companies attempted to create a circular argument that it would be unfair to exempt filtering software applications but then exclude such suites from the exemption, since this would provide the largest software companies with a market advantage; at the same time these same companies appear to argue that the Register could not recommend exempting the filtering software bundled in these suites, since such an exemption would compromise the integrity of the overall security suite. While the Register agrees that an exemption from the prohibition on circumvention for filtering software applications cannot distinguish between stand-alone programs and filtering  55  PHR Steve Metalitz, Joint Reply Commenters, June 30, 2003, p. 3-4.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 32  software incorporated into a suite, an exemption need not compromise the integrity of an entire suite in order to allow circumvention of the list of websites utilized by the filtering software program. The present exemption has existed for the past three years and would allow any person to circumvent any access control that bars access to the list of blocked websites, but no evidence has been introduced that there have been adverse effects on the filtering software market or the market for security software suites. Many of these suites have undergone development while the present exemption has been in place, thus making it implausible that such security suites relied primarily on the legal prohibitions of  1201(a)(1) rather than robust technological protections. In addition, there appears to be no technological reason why the creators of suites must bundle their information behind only a single, omnibus access control measure. Since it could be expected that a security software suite should be a technologically robust system, the lists of Internet locations related to the filtering software could be a segregated database or the access controls could be layered to provide independent security to various components of the suites. Not only would such redundancy appear to make technological sense, but it would appear to be prudent under the law since an exemption for one part of a suite would not necessarily adversely affect other parts of the suite.  In an abundance of caution, however, the Register finds that some modification of the language of the previous exemption is compatible with the present record. The Register recommends exemption of ""compilations consisting of lists of Internet locations blocked by commercially marketed filtering software applications that are intended to prevent access to domains, websites or portions of websites, but not including lists of Internet locations blocked by software applications that operate exclusively to protect against damage to a computer or computer network or lists of Internet locations blocked by software applications that operate exclusively to prevent receipt of email."" For purposes of this exemption, ""Internet locations"" are defined to include ""domains, uniform resource locators (URLs), numeric IP addresses or any combination thereof."" The changes in the wording are the result of two refinements in the record. First, the term ""lists of websites"" used in the previous exemption has been changed to ""list of Internet locations"" including domains, URLs,   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 33  numeric IP addresses. The record revealed that filtering software applications vary on how they block access  e.g., by blocking specific URLs, or IP addresses, or some combination  and on what they block  e.g., entire websites or individual pages, or some combination.56 It therefore is appropriate to broaden the scope of that particular term.  Second, ""filtering"" is a term that may be used broadly, including filters for email or viruses. While there is no evidence in the record regarding how exempting lists of Internet addresses could implicate anti-virus filters or email addresses, the record created by proponents is limited to the need to circumvent filtering software that is commercially marketed to prevent access to Internet content. Using the term ""commercially marketed filtering software"" is an effort to limit the scope of the class of works to this particular type of filtering software without opening the door to other filtering systems. Although proponents have offered the term ""censorware,"" the Register finds that term pejorative and ambiguous. ""Commercially marketed filtering software"" is a more objective description of the particular class.  The analysis of the statutory factors in relation to this proposed exemption reveals: (1) The availability for use of the lists of blocked Internet locations is currently limited. While some querying and sampling is available, these methods do not allow a comprehensive means of determining what is being blocked and why these locations are being blocked. In addition, the market for filtering software has generally grown despite the fact that an exemption has been in place since the prohibition went into effect. There is no reason to believe that continuing the exemption will have an adverse effect on the availability of the software itself. (2) The availability for use for archival, preservation or educational purposes has not been addressed in this rulemaking. (3) The impact of the prohibition on criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or  56  T David Burt, April 11, 2003, p. 80.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 34  research in relation to these lists of blocked Internet locations is significant. If the prohibition were in effect for these works, the only criticism, comment, news reporting or research on these works that would be available would be the limited querying and sampling that was shown to be generally inadequate for more than superficial analysis. Given the broad use of such filtering software in schools and libraries, over-blocking could adversely affect scholarship and research performed on the Internet. (4) The effect of circumvention on the market for or value of these works appears to be minimal. The evidence of the past three years is instructive for the likelihood of future harm. The lack of harm is in part due to the fact that few took advantage of the exemption and in part due to the narrow scope of the exemption. While a new exemption requires taking into account of the present realities of the data assembled in these lists, e.g., IP addresses, URLs and combinations of these forms of addresses, it also requires limiting unintended consequences. Therefore, the new exemption exempts circumvention of lists of ""Internet addresses"" in commercially marketed filtering software rather than ""lists of websites,"" while at the same time excluding circumvention of lists of Internet addresses blocked by software applications that operate exclusively to protect against damage to a computer or computer network, e.g., antivirus or firewall applications, or lists of Internet addresses blocked by software application that operate exclusively to prevent receipt of email, e.g., spam filters.  2.  Computer programs protected by dongles that prevent access due to malfunction or damage and which are obsolete.  Many commenters supported a renewal of the exemption made in 2000 for ""literary works, including computer programs and databases, protected by access control mechanisms that fail to permit access because of malfunction, damage or obsoleteness.""57 Few commenters, however, provided any factual support for such an exemption. There was a complete absence of specificity regarding what works are involved, what type of harm has occurred, or the scope of such present or  57  E.g., C29(4), C30(6), C32, C33, R10, R12, R15, R21   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 35  likely harm in many of the comments. Instead, many commenters simply requested that the Librarian renew the exemption established in the previous rulemaking. They claimed that since there is no evidence that the conditions in the market have changed, the exemption should be renewed. Since such a claim for ""renewal"" is discussed extensively above, it suffices to restate that such burdenshifting is incompatible with the de novo nature of the triennial review.58 Allowing a presumption to be created based on a finding of likely harm made in a preceding rulemaking would effectively transform any exemption into a permanent exemption unless opponents satisfied a burden of going forward with new evidence.  However, a few commenters and persons testifying at the hearings did provide some factual support, although such evidence focused on a narrower class of works. 59  In particular, Joseph  Montoro presented some evidence, albeit not abundant evidence, some significant and some only anecdotal, that the adverse effects related to ""dongles"" or hardware locks continue to exist. The Register has considered the totality of the evidence  including evidence of past harm, present needs, and likely future harm, as well as the concerns raised by opponents that the previous exemption was too broad  together with the absence of any evidence of an adverse effect on the market for or value of the class of works at issue. It is also instructive that an exemption has been in place for the past three years, but opponents did not cite any evidence of harm resulting from that exemption. Viewed as a whole, the case was made for a new but more narrowly tailored exemption. 60  Commerce Report, H.R. Rep. No. 105-551, pt.2, 37 (1998) and accord, letter from NTIA at 4.

This client was the Nebraska Service Center of the Immigration and Naturalization Service office which was, at the time, a part of the U.S. Department of Justice.62 The letter received from the INS office stated: ""[i]f those dongles had failed or become inoperable, there would have been an indefinite halt in travel document production."" The letter also added that the time and training that would have been necessary to change to new software would have been prohibitive. If a person purchased software that should still work but for the failure of the technological protection measure controlling access, the continued use of that software would appear to qualify as a noninfringing use.  The letter submitted by Mr. Montoro presents a variation on the theme of damaged dongles, but the situation described does not appear to fall within the scope of the existing exemption. From the testimony and the letter, it does not appear that the technological measure was actually preventing access to the computer program, but rather that, based on experiences in the past, one  As discussed in the previous rulemaking, dongles are hardware locks attached to a computer that interact with software programs to prevent unauthorized access to that software. 65 FR at 64565. In addition to testimony about this client's problem with dongles, Mr. Montoro supplemented the record at the hearing with documentary evidence which included a copy of a letter from a Program Analyst from the INS office. A public copy of this document is available for inspection at the United States Copyright Office. 62  61   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 37  might expect that it would prevent access at some time in the future. While the access control may have been obsolete, in that the software vendor was no longer in business and no replacement could be obtained, the fact that it was obsolete was not causing it to fail to permit access.  The exemption in place for the past three years did not include computer programs protected by dongles that might prevent access due to malfunction or damage, nor has any participant in this rulemaking proceeding suggested such an exemption. It required that the access control actually ""fail to permit access because of malfunction, damage, or obsoleteness."" However, the principal example presented by Mr. Montoro related to a fact situation that would not be covered by the current exemption  nor, as will be seen, would it be covered by the exemption the Register is recommending. Mr. Montoro's testimony raises the question of whether access controls such as dongles which ""may fail,"" or which one fears might fail, have impeded or are likely to impede users of software in their ability to make noninfringing uses. As a matter of logic, it does not appear that this can be so, and as a matter of fact, it has not been proven. As long as a dongle is working properly, it is difficult to understand how it would be preventing noninfringing uses. The fear that it might cease to work properly does not adversely affect the user's ability to engage in noninfringing uses; at most, it adversely affects the user's confidence that he will be able to continue engaging in noninfringing uses. But section 1201(a)(1) (C) does not instruct the Librarian to take into account one's fear that one will be unable to continue to engage in permitted uses. Especially when no showing has been made of the likelihood of failure, the Register is unwilling to recommend an exemption that has no objective criteria as its basis. 63  A claim that a dongle prevents access due to  damage or malfunction is subject to verification, but no objective criteria have been suggested whereby one could establish whether dongles that currently work are likely to fail during the next three-year period. Indeed, because any dongle could fail within the next three years, an exemption  Cf. 65 FR at 64566 (rejecting, in rulemaking proceeding in 2000, extension of exemption to situations involving lost dongles, due to difficulty in ascertaining whether a dongle has truly been lost  a claim that is easy to assert and virtually impossible to disprove).  63   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 38  that covered dongles that have not failed but may fail in the future would, in effect, cover all dongles.  Thus, the record does not support an exemption for computer software protected by dongles that are working properly. Indeed, the record does not support an exemption that would cover all malfunctioning dongles, since in many cases the manufacturer will readily replace or repair the dongle.64 A limiting principle based on the evidence produced is warranted to avoid unnecessary harm to the market for or value of computer programs protected by dongles.  The evidence suggests that qualification of the exemption is appropriate. In the INS situation, the most significant fact was that the company that manufactured the software and dongle was no longer in business. Even though an exemption for prospective failure is not supportable, the fact that no support would be available to the user in the event of the dongle's failure is a critical concern to users of dongle-protected software. Other comments addressed this unavailability of support that was often the result of the sale or dissolution of the software company that originally marketed the software or the discontinuation of support by a software company or a successor company.65 In some other cases where the software manufacturer was still in business, lengthy time delays in responsiveness or excessively high costs for replacement, sometimes equivalent to the purchase price of the software, were experienced. 66  Numerous instances were presented of users of dongle-  protected software expressing concern about the unavailability of replacement or repair.67  64 65 66 67  T Keith Kupferschmid, May 2, 2003, p. 189-90. C32(5) and T Montoro, May 2, 2003, p. 156, and exhibits, e.g., p. 83 and 84. Montoro exhibit at 89. Montoro exhibits, e.g., INS letter and attached email.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 39  There are at least four cited instances evidencing damaged or malfunctioning dongles for which repair or replacement was not reasonably available. In one case a user paid $12,000 for a software that was protected by a dongle, but the program would not run due to a ""defective"" dongle. This user stated that the software company would not help remedy the problem and redirected the user to a dealer who did not answer the phone. In another case, an ambulance company running software that was protected by a dongle experienced crashes every time a dial-up session was initiated. Although both the software company and the dongle manufacturer acknowledged that the problem was known for approximately two years, no solution for this malfunction was provided. In another case, a U.S. business licensed software from a company in England that eventually ceased support, in the form of dongle drivers, for a DOS based program and only offered the sale of a program upgrade to the software at considerable cost without any significant increase in functionality for the business. Another person claimed that a supplied dongle did not function properly and that after three months, a replacement has not yet materialized. None of these examples were contradicted in the comments or testimony of opponents of an exemption.  After reviewing the record, the Register finds that the unavailability of dongle replacement or repair from the original vendor in and of itself is not sufficient to justify an exemption when the computer program and dongle are still providing access to the work. In this respect, the existing exemption is overbroad to the extent that it includes works ""protected by access control mechanisms that fail to permit access because of ... obsoleteness."" In considering obsoleteness, the Register is unable to think of any instances where the fact that a dongle is obsolete has caused the dongle to fail to permit access. Certainly, no evidence has been presented of such a phenomenon.68  68  See, however, section III.A.3. below.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 40  Nor does the Register believe that an exemption is warranted simply when a dongle is malfunctioning or damaged, but where a replacement is reasonably available. Based on the evidence produced in this proceeding, an exemption is warranted when both access is prevented as a result of damage or malfunction and the dongle is obsolete. As in the previous rulemaking, the Register believes that the definition of ""obsolete"" set forth in 17 U.S.C. 108(c) captures the circumstances under which an exemption is justified: ""a [dongle] shall be considered obsolete if [it] is no longer manufactured or is no longer reasonably available in the commercial marketplace."" For purposes of this exemption, a dongle would be considered ""obsolete"" if a replacement or repair are not reasonably available in the marketplace. This refinement of the previous exemption addresses concerns raised by both proponents and opponents of an exemption and comports with common sense. If the replacement or repair of a malfunctioning or damaged dongle is reasonably available in the marketplace, circumvention will generally not be necessary. In addition to encouraging reasonable support to be made available to users, the exemption will allow users who are denied access as a result of a damaged or malfunctioning dongle to circumvent when a reasonable alternative is unavailable. This exemption minimizes the adverse effects on noninfringing uses by users of software protected by these access control measures while also minimizing the adverse effects on copyright owners.  In applying the statutory factors to the record, the balance weighs in favor of this more narrowly tailored exemption. While the use of dongles, and the availability of legal remedies against those who unlawfully circumvent the protections offered by dongles, offers an incentive for software publishers (and, in particular, publishers of expensive software such as computer assisted design software) to make those works available, it is difficult to imagine that the limited exemption recommended here would adversely affect that incentive. No evidence has been presented with respect to the extent to which such works are available for nonprofit archival, preservation, or educational activity, or with respect to the effect of the prohibition on criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. However, in the case of damaged or malfunctioning   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 41  dongles for which there is no reasonable availability of replacement or repair, it is evident that the availability for nonprofit archival, preservation or educational activity will be adversely affected and the prohibition will adversely affect those users in possession of such damaged or malfunctioning measures who seek to use the work for criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship or research. While the second and third factor logically appear to favor the exemption, the absence of clear guidance in the record does not allow these factors to weigh heavily in this case. The fourth factor is more instructive. An exemption for all computer programs protected by dongles would adversely affect the market for and value of software. Similarly, an exemption for computer programs protected by dongles that may fail in the future or, alternatively, for which reasonable replacement or repair is available would have the potential of adversely affecting the market for and value of a significant portion of the market for computer programs protected by dongles at a point in time when adverse effects are not yet occurring or when reasonable alternatives exist. Both of these would weigh against an exemption. Yet the recommended class  computer programs protected by dongles that are obsolete and that prevent access due to malfunction or damage  minimizes the potential for adverse effects to the market for or value of these copyrighted works, thus weighing in favor of an exemption. Finally, the absence of evidence that the existing exemption has resulted in adverse effects further bolsters the evidence that this factor weighs in favor of an exemption in regard for this more narrowly tailored class. The Register recommends the exemption of this class for the next three-year period.  3.  Computer programs and video games distributed in formats that have become obsolete and which require the original media or hardware as a condition of access. For purposes of this exemption, ""formats that have become obsolete"" may refer to particular media or operating systems and shall have the same meaning as in 17 U.S.C. 108(c): A format shall be considered obsolete if the machine or system necessary to render perceptible a work stored in that format is no longer manufactured or is no longer reasonably available in the commercial marketplace.  The Internet Archive proposed an exemption for ""Literary and audiovisual works embodied in software whose access control systems prohibit access to replicas of the works.""   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 42  It submitted comments and testified about problems associated with gaining access to archived digital works. The Internet Archive describes itself as a non-profit library that maintains a collection of websites, software and other works in digital formats in a digital archive.69 It has been given collections of copyrighted works in digital formats or media that are degrading and becoming obsolete with time. Because ""[p]reservation of digital works poses a unique challenge because of the quick deterioration of digital media and the rapid obsolescence of digital formats,""70 the Internet Archive desires to migrate the works to modern storage systems (e.g., by transferring a computer program from a floppy diskette to a hard drive) that are more stable and that will ensure continuing access to the works. Once a work has been copied to the new storage system, the Internet Archive must be able to gain access to the resulting reproduction in order to verify that the integrity of the transfer and backup was successful, complete, and functional.  The Internet Archive stated that works distributed in digital formats on physical media (such as floppy diskettes, CD-ROMs, etc.) have sometimes been accompanied by technological measures that, while technically permitting copies to be made, prevent those copies from functioning (so that, for example, a copy of a computer program made from the original floppy diskette will not run, or a copy of an audiovisual game made from the original CD-ROM cannot be played). Because of this, it asserts that archives should be permitted to circumvent those technological measures in order not only to load copies of the works into their storage systems, but also to be able to use those copies as though they were still on the original medium. A copy of a computer program that will not run, or a copy of a video game that will not play, is a copy in name only.  69 70  T Brewster Kahle, May 14, 2003, p.84-85; C25. C25, p.2.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 43  The primary form of access control with which the Internet Archive is concerned is the ""original only"" access control. Long before the enactment of the DMCA, many works distributed in digital formats on physical media (such as floppy diskettes) were designed so that the original diskette must be inserted into the appropriate drive in the computer in order to enable access to the work. When these works have been migrated to digital archival systems, the ""original only"" protection measure built into the software or audiovisual work can no longer find the original diskette since the copy of the work being used is not on the original diskette. In some cases, the problem is that the software checks to see that an authorized CD-ROM or floppy diskette is installed in a particular drive. In other cases, the software may be checking for some features of the hardware for which it was designed., e.g., a floppy disk drive or a dongle to ensure that the copy is an authorized one. As a result of migrating these works to archival drives or media, the software's builtin security check will fail because, inter alia, the work is not on the original diskette or because the computer is trying to access the work from a different location than the one in which it was originally stored. Verification of the integrity of the reproduction is important to the archival process, and verification requires access to the work. Proponents of an exemption contend that in order to access the reproduction, circumvention of the original access protection measure is necessary. Circumvention is necessary to understand how the original access control operated so that it can be emulated to allow access to the reproduction of the work.  The problem is particularly compelling when the physical format in which the copy was originally marketed has become obsolete. If the Internet Archive is given computer software that was marketed on 5 1/4 inch floppy diskettes, it will not even be able to access the work in its original format on the typical computer sold in the marketplace today, because computers sold today are not equipped with 5 1/4 inch floppy drives. However, Internet Archive also desires an exemption that addresses the ""original only"" problem even when the medium on which the original copy was marketed (e.g., CD-ROM) is not yet obsolete, noting that it is crucial to archive digital works before they become inaccessible and before the information on the medium has degraded.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 44  This proposal raises a host of questions. Is the specified preservation activity a noninfringing use? Is the ""original only"" check a technological measure that protects access to a work? If it is, would an exemption restricted to obsolete formats resolve the problem? Should the exemption extend beyond obsolete media to encompass media that are ""becoming"" obsolete? Should the class encompass all literary and audiovisual works? Is the proposed exemption merely another way of requesting a use-based exemption for preservation that would be more appropriately resolved by Congress? 71  At the hearing on this issue and in the reply comments, there was a great deal of discussion of the nature of the technological protection measures involved. The Joint Reply Commenters stated that a ""technology which allows copying but which renders the resulting copies less than fully functional should be classified, in DMCA terms, as a copy control subject to section 1201(b), not an access control,"" and that it is ""far from clear"" that such technology is an access control.72 While it is true that the primary purpose of such technology appears to be to prevent copying, e.g., by allowing only nonfunctioning copies to be made, it does not follow that such a technology is not an access control.73 Indeed, the technology in question does allow copying. The problem is that the copy may be of limited or no use. From the point of view of the user, there is a copy, but the user cannot get  71 72 73  See R7 at 5. R23 at 41.  Even the Joint Reply Commenters allowed that it is possible that it would be considered an access control. T Steve Metalitz, May 14, 2003, p. 149. See also R23 at 41 (""The submitter asserts that these are access controls, not copy controls, but that is far from clear,"" an assertion that appears to allow the possibility that the technological measures in question are indeed access controls).   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 45  access to it.74 It therefore appears that the primary purpose of a protection system does not necessarily determine whether it is an access control, or a copy control, or both.  Therefore, the Internet Archive appears to have identified technological measures that control access to works and that the Internet Archive claims have prevented it from engaging in noninfringing preservation activities. Before examining whether the Internet Archive has actually identified noninfringing activities affected by those access controls, however, we turn to whether it has identified a ""particular class of works.""  On its face, the Internet Archive's proposal relates to ""literary and audiovisual works,"" two major categories of works enumerated in section 102. While a ""particular class of works"" may include works from more than one section 102 category, designating such a class creates some tension with Congress' instruction that a ""particular class"" be ""a narrow and focused subset of the broad categories of works of authorship"" identified in section 102. The starting point in determining a ""class of works"" may be a category of works, but usually the next step will be to narrow the class to some subset of that category. And although a ""particular class"" might also include works from more than one section 102 category, it probably would not include two categories in their entirety. 75  By analogy, a CSS-encrypted DVD may be copied, yet in most situations, the copy of the DVD will not play in a DVD CCA-licensed DVD player. Were the reasoning of the reply comment applied to the CSS situation (if it allows copying, but not access to the copies, the measure is not an access control in DMCA terms), one might have to conclude that a CSSencrypted DVD is not a technological measure that controls access, but rather was designed to prevent unauthorized duplication. While preventing unauthorized duplication may be the primary goal of such a technological scheme, the courts have held that CSS is a technological measure that ""effectively controls access to a work."" See, e.g., Universal City Studios v. Corley, 273 F.3d 429 (2d. Cir. 2001); Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Reimerdes, 111 F.

In fact, the class proposed by the Internet Archive appears dangerously close to being an indirect way of attempting to achieve a ""use-based"" exemption for preservation activity. Although, as a matter of policy, there may be merit to the notion that exemptions from the prohibition on circumvention should be based on the circumventor's intended use, that is not an option that Congress has given to the Librarian in this rulemaking. The statute requires that exemptions relate to ""a particular class of copyrighted works,""76 and as the Register concluded in the previous rulemaking, ""[b]ased on a review of the statutory language and the legislative history, the view that a `class' of works can be defined in terms of the status of the user or the nature of the intended use appears to be untenable.""77 While, as discussed below in the discussion of the ""other factors"" that the Librarian may consider, consideration should be given to creating a statutory exemption permitting libraries and archives to circumvent access controls in particular circumstances for purposes of archiving and preservation, any exemption resulting from this rulemaking must relate to a ""particular class"" of works, and will be available to anyone engaging in a noninfringing use.  In any event, the Internet Archive has not made the case for a broad class of works encompassing two section 102 categories in their entirety. Rather, it has made the case for a class of works that is narrower in several respects: the class includes only works that are in formats that require the original media or hardware as a condition of access, that consists only of computer programs and video games, and only when they are in obsolete formats. The first two conditions are the consequences of the proof submitted by Internet Archive in making its case for an exemption;  76 77  1201(a)(1)(C). 65 FR at 64559.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 47  the final condition is the result of the Register's analysis of the noninfringing uses the Internet Archive has been prevented from making.  One of these limitations was suggested by the Internet Archive in its submissions to the Register, although not in so many words. The proposed class consisted of ""Literary and audiovisual works embodied in software whose access control systems prohibit access to replicas of the works."" (Emphasis added). In proposing such a class, the Internet Archive appears to have been guided by the Register's recommendation in the previous rulemaking, which stated that in determining the contours of a particular class of works, ""the section 102 categories of works are, at the very least, the starting point for any determination of what a `particular class of work' might be,"" and that ""[s]uch a classification would begin by reference to attributes of the works themselves, but could then be narrowed by reference to the medium on which the works are distributed, or even to the access control measures applied to them."" 78  The Register believes that a class defined, in part, by reference to ""software whose access control systems prohibit access to replicas of the works"" is ambiguous. Indeed, the Register can fathom what the proposed class consists of only because the Internet Archive, in its comments, testimony and post-hearing responses, has elaborated on the nature of the access controls that have prevented it from making usable replacement copies. The principal form of access control identified by the Internet Archive, as described above, is the ""original-only"" access control which requires use of the original, authorized copy obtained by the user. The Internet Archive also identifies two other forms of access control that may prohibit access to archival copies: dongles and the ""Lenslok lensbased access protection.""  78  65 FR at 64560.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 48  Dongles are discussed above, in connection with the second exemption recommended by the Register. For archives, however, dongles present a problem not only when they are damaged or malfunction, but also when ""the peripheral ports to plug in the dongle do not exist on new computer models."" 79  Lenslok is described by the Internet Archive as ""an exotic access protection system for  Sinclair Spectrum systems"" that ""works by holding a plastic lens up to the screen to decode a password that allows the user to access the title."" Internet Archive alleges that the password is ""impossible to read"" on modern equipment and that ""it is very difficult to locate the Lenslock plastic lens."" 80  The Register believes that a class delimited, in part, by a requirement that the covered works were distributed in formats that ""require the original media or hardware as a condition of access"" addresses precisely the types of access controls that have created difficulties for the Internet Archive. While this exemption is crafted with original-only access controls in mind, it also happens to cover the situations described by the Internet Archive relating to dongles and Lenslok when the work is in an obsolete format. The dongle and the Lenslok can fairly be described as ""original hardware"" that accompanied the original copy of the software and that must be used in order to gain access to the software. Thus, subject to the limitation to computer programs and video games and the requirement that the software be in an obsolete format, the recommended exemption addresses  PHR Brewster Kahle, The Internet Archive, p. 2. The Internet Archives also asserts that ""hardware dongles are difficult to find."" Id. While the Register would hesitate before recommending an exemption based only on the assertion that dongles are hard to find, just as she refrained from recommending an exemption in 2000 that would extend to ""lost"" dongles, see 65 FR at 64566, the additional difficulties Internet Archive has encountered with dongles, as well as the additional requirements included in the recommended exemption, make it unnecessary to decide whether difficulty in finding the appropriate dongle would by itself justify an exemption. 80  79  Id., p. 2.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 49  the works for which Internet Archive has sought an exemption.  The Register recommends limiting the types of works exempted to computer programs and video games, rather than the Internet Archive's requested class of literary and audiovisual works, because the evidence in the record of this rulemaking does not support such a broad class of works. The Internet Archive presented a great deal of evidence relating to computer programs.81 There is also evidence in the record showing that a significant number of computer and video games are available only in obsolete formats, a characteristic that, for reasons discussed below, is important for purposes of this exemption.82 The case for other types of literary or audiovisual works is far less clear. The Internet Archive has made passing references to works like ""Shogun"" and to ""Ephemeral Films,"" the ""Voyager Archive,"" and the ""Macromedia Archive,"" but there is virtually no explanation of how these references apply to the argument, the classes of works involved, the quantity of works for which there is a problem, or the technological protection measure applied to these works. For example, ""Exhibit A"" to the Internet Archive's post-hearing response to questions is a list of numerous titles stated to be in the Voyager Archive, but no information is provided beyond the titles.83 A title such as ""Beethoven: Symphony No. 9"" suggests a sound recording, but its relevance is completely undecipherable. The lack of meaningful information about the nature of these works, the formats that they are on, or the technological measures preventing noninfringing uses frustrates the ability to evaluate these works and the need for an exemption for such works. Similarly, although one early computerized book was mentioned in the testimony,84 the scope of any problem relating to digital books is unknown; one example is insufficient to exempt an entire class of copyrighted works  C25, R15, T Brewster Kahle, May 14, 2003, p. 88-90 and 124-39, and PHR Brewster Kahle, The Internet Archive. 82 83 84  81  Id.

T Brewster Kahle, May 14, 2003, p. 88 (""Shogun"").   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 50  even if that class is limited to obsolete formats. Accordingly, because Internet Archive was able to demonstrate more than de minimis problems only with respect to computer programs and video games, the Register recommends that the exempted class of works be limited to those two types of works.  The final limitation recommended by the Register is that the works must have been ""distributed in formats that have become obsolete."" Obsolete formats include particular media, as well as operating systems, that are no longer manufactured or reasonably available in the marketplace. A likely example of an obsolete medium is the 5 1/4 inch floppy diskette;85 a likely example of an obsolete operating system is the Commodore Amiga operating system. As with the exemption for computer programs protected by dongles, which is limited to damaged or malfunctioning dongles that are obsolete, the definition of ""obsolete"" is taken from 17 U.S.C. 108(c). 86  Adapted to the context of this exemption, a format shall be considered obsolete if the  machine or system necessary to render perceptible a work stored in that format is no longer  Whether 5 1/4 inch floppy diskettes actually are obsolete today is unclear. No commenters or witnesses have stated whether they are obsolete; it seems to have been tacitly assumed that they are. While the Register can take administrative notice that computers are not typically sold today with 5 1/4 inch floppy disk drives, see Nat'l Classification Comm. v. United States, 779 F.2d 687, 695 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (""[i]t is beyond dispute that an agency may provide the factual predicate for a finding by taking `official notice' of matters of common knowledge""), nevertheless it may be that floppy disk drives are still manufactured or are still reasonably available in the commercial marketplace. In any dispute in which a library or archive relies on the exemption recommended herein to justify circumvention of access controls on software fixed on a 5 1/4 inch floppy diskette, it would be a matter of proof whether 5 1/4 inch drives are indeed obsolete. ""For purposes of this subsection, a format shall be considered obsolete if the machine or device necessary to render perceptible a work stored in that format is no longer manufactured or is no longer reasonably available in the commercial marketplace."" 86  85   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 51  manufactured or is no longer reasonably available in the commercial marketplace. A work is not considered ""reasonably available"" if it can only be purchased in second-hand stores. 87  This final limitation to works distributed in formats that have become obsolete is based on the Register's analysis of the noninfringing uses that original-only access controls have adversely affected. The Internet Archive asserts that its preservation activity is a noninfringing use under sections 107, 108, and 117(a)(2) of the Copyright Act. Section 117(a)(2) addresses the reproduction and adaptation of a copy of a computer program by its owner for archival purposes. Section 108 specifically deals with recurring operations that are necessary for the certain preservation and other activities of libraries and archives. Section 107 is the codification of the fair use defense.  Because 108 was enacted specifically to address reproduction by libraries and archives, and was amended by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to address certain digital issues,88 analysis of noninfringing archival and preservation activities logically begins with that section. Since the proposed noninfringing use of these works relates to the making of replacement copies of published works for preservation and use by libraries and archives, the particular subsection of section 108 that would govern such activity is 108(c). Section 108(c) allows three copies or phonorecords of published works to be duplicated solely for the purpose of replacement of a copy or phonorecord that is damaged, deteriorating, lost, or stolen, or if the existing format in which the work is stored has become obsolete, if  (1) the library or archives has, after a reasonable effort, determined that an unused replacement cannot be obtained at a fair price; and  87 88  S. Rep. No. 105-190 at 62. (1998). See also House Manager's Report 48. Pub. L. No. 105-304, 404 (1998).   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 52  (2) any such copy or phonorecord that is reproduced in digital format is not made available to the public in that format outside the premises of the library or archives in lawful possession of such copy. Section 108(c) does not authorize generalized preservation activities; it is limited by its terms. While the Internet Archive appears to be in lawful possession of the digital copies of the works it seeks to preserve, the safe harbor of 108(c) does not encompass all of the works sought to be archived. The Internet Archive has not suggested that the original copies or phonorecords of the works it intends to reproduce have been damaged, lost or stolen. While it may be asserted that some of these works are ""deteriorating,"" that is a factual question that would have to be determined on a copy-by-copy basis. It would not be reasonable to interpret this term in the extremely broad sense that all works are, to a certain extent, deteriorating or in the process of becoming obsolete from the moment of creation, since this would be an interpretation that would swallow the rule. Some meaningful evidence of specific deterioration would appear to be necessary. The Internet Archive has not asserted that any work is deteriorating (apart from the broad sense discussed above), but rather that the formats are or are becoming obsolete. In its 1998 amendments to 108, Congress chose to exempt formats that have ""become obsolete,"" not to exempt formats that are becoming obsolete. Therefore, the only digital reproduction of published works that would be noninfringing under 108 relates to copies or phonorecords that are damaged, deteriorating, lost, or stolen, or those works distributed on formats that have already become obsolete. Based on the record in this rulemaking, only the last condition has been put before the Register in relation to preservation activity  works stored on existing formats that have become obsolete. 89  Even in cases where the format is obsolete, 108(c) imposes two additional requirements before a library or archive is permitted to make copies: (1) the library or archives must have  Proposals and evidence for malfunctioning and damaged access controls (as opposed to works) on computer programs are dealt with separately. See discussion supra, Section III.A.2.  89   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 53  determined that an unused replacement cannot be obtained at a fair price and (2) the digital reproduction of a copy or phonorecord may not be made available to the public ""outside the premises of the library or archives in lawful possession of such copy.""90 For purposes of the inquiry in this rulemaking, the first condition is an important one for determining whether or not such activity is a noninfringing use.91 The proponents of the exemption have produced no evidence on this question, but this is understandable because even if a reasonably priced replacement were available, it would not satisfy the intended use by the Internet Archive  migration to a different medium, e.g, a hard drive. Still, to fall within the scope of permitted uses under 108(c), a library or archive must have determined that an unused replacement cannot be obtained at a fair price.  Even though a library or archive must have determined that an unused replacement cannot be obtained at a fair price in order to qualify for the  108(c) exemption, it can safely be assumed that there will be many occasions when an unused replacement will not be ""reasonably available."" For example, it is very likely that many early video games that were produced in now-obsolete formats are not available today. Similarly, twenty year old computer programs are highly unlikely to be available, in their original versions, in the marketplace. Indeed, the Internet Archive's testimony indicated that in many cases, the original producers of software no longer have any copies of old versions of the software that the Internet Archive has. 92  90 91  17 U.S.C. 108(c).  The latter condition is, of course, important to a determination of whether the circumvention was limited to a noninfringing use, e.g., on site use. The proponent of the exemption, the Internet Archive, has stated that it limits access to its archive in conformance with this requirement. A library or archive that made copies of the archived material available to the public outside its premises would be exceeding the privilege afforded by 108 and, unless some other defense to infringement were available, would be unable to avail itself of the recommended exemption that would permit it to circumvent the ""original-only"" access control when engaging in noninfringing uses. 92  T Brewster Kahle, May 14, 2003, p. 152.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 54  In addition, it must be acknowledged that in enacting the DMCA, Congress specifically amended section 108 (c) to provide for the digital reproduction of works for certain preservation and use purposes. As the Senate Judiciary Committee's report on the DMCA states: The amendment to subsection (c) also broadens its coverage to allow the updating of obsolete formats. It permits the making of such copies or phonorecords of a work ""if the existing format in which the work is stored has become obsolete."" This provision is intended to permit libraries and archives to ensure that copies of works in their collections continue to be accessible and useful to their patrons. In order to ensure that the provision does not inadvertently result in the suppression of ongoing commercial offerings of works in still-usable formats, the amendment explicitly provides that, for purposes of this subsection, a format will be considered obsolete only if the machine or device necessary to render perceptible a work stored in that format is no longer manufactured or reasonably available in a commercial marketplace. Under this language, if the needed machine or device can only be purchased in second-hand stores, it should not be considered ""reasonably available.""93 This statement in the legislative history supports the view that Congress' amendment was intended to allow digital reproduction of works in obsolete formats.  Although 108(c) could reasonably suffice to qualify the preservation of obsolete formats of works as a noninfringing use, the Internet Archive seeks a broader exemption that would extend to formats that are not yet obsolete. For that reason, it is necessary to examine the other bases relied on by Internet Archive in support of its contention that such archival activity is noninfringing: sections 107 and 117(a)(2).  The Register does not recommend broadening the exemption based on fair use, which is codified in 107. In determining whether libraries and archives may circumvent access controls for the purpose of systematic preservation of digital works, the Register believes that reliance on 107 is inappropriate. While it is true that some preservation activity beyond the scope of 108 may well  93  S. Rep. No. 105-190 at 62. (1998). See also House Manager's Report at 48.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 55  constitute a fair use, it is improper in this context to generalize about the parameters of 107. Fair use involves a case-by-case analysis94 that requires the application of the four mandatory factors to the particular facts of each particular use.95 Since disparate works may be involved in the preservation activity and the effect on the potential market for the work may vary, sweeping generalizations are unfounded. Also, the fact that Congress specifically addressed the making of preservation copies by libraries and archives when it amended 108  a section that contains express limitations on the exemption that were an important ingredient in the balance achieved, e.g., digital reproductions may not be made available beyond the premises of the library or archives, and, as noted above, an unused replacement at a fair price must be unavailable  necessitates caution before resorting to 107 for broader uses.96 This is particularly true in light of the fact that Congress enacted the amendment to 108 as part of the DMCA, the same legislation that enacted 1201. Unless particular facts about the use of particular works are presented to reveal that the 108(c) exemption is insufficient, and unless these particular facts could be analyzed under 107 to establish a likelihood that fair use is applicable, it would be improper in this rulemaking to go beyond the express congressional parameters contained in the DMCA amendments to 108.  The Register reaches a similar conclusion with respect to 117(a)(2). The limitation on the exclusive rights of copyright owners contained in 117(a)(2) is limited to ""computer programs."" The term ""computer programs"" is defined in the Copyright Act as ""a set of statements or instructions to  H.R. Rep. No. 94-1476, at 66 (1976); Campbell v.

In explaining why the proposed exemption would not harm the interests of copyright owners the Internet Archive itself pointed out that ""We're regulated just like everybody else within the sort of 108 work. [Sic.]We are a library. So the use is protected.""

While a superficial reading of 117(a)(2) might lead to the conclusion that activities such as those of the Internet Archive fall within its scope, case law construing 117(a)(2) requires caution in applying the exemption, and the leading treatises confirm that the construction of this exemption may be narrow. The Internet Archive states that ""[s]ection 117(a)(2) allows software owners to make reproductions for archival use"" and asserts that it is engaging in archival use; therefore, its activity is covered by this exemption. But the bulk of the authority construing 117(a)(2) suggests that the actual scope of that exemption does not extend to the systematic migration to modern storage systems98 of a wide variety of works by, in the Internet Archive's own words, a nonprofit library that provides free access to an enormous and wide-ranging collection of web pages, movies, books, sound recordings and software in order to provide an historical record to future generations. As one appellate court recently stated, "" Under the Copyright Act, the phrase `copy for archival purposes' has established meaning with reference to computer programs: to make a backup copy to guard against the risk of damage to or destruction of the original caused by mechanical or electrical failure. See 17 U.S.C.  117(a)(2)."" 100 99  The major treatises are in accord.

Rather, the primary purpose of the Internet Archive's activity appears to be, in the words of its [director], that ""formats become obsolete and the platforms change.""103 At least in part, Internet Archive wishes to create archival copies of computer programs due to the ""rapid obsolescence of digital formats.""104 Thus, to the extent that case law and treatises suggest that archiving of computer programs for other purposes is not permitted under 117, it is questionable whether that section applies to such archival activity. To be sure, the Internet Archive also states that it wishes to migrate digital works to its modern storage system because they are on media that are ""degrading,"" and that this ""must be done before the formats or media become obsolete or damaged."" 105  Thus, it appears  that the Internet Archive's systematic reproductions have a dual purpose: to ensure that the works are accessible on modern equipment and to ensure that intact reproductions of the work will be available in the event that the original copy is damaged.  101 102  II P.

The copies that are migrated to the Internet Archive's modern storage system are, in fact, the copies that will be used  and not only by the Internet Archive, but also by members of the general public. ""The Internet Archive and all of its collections are open to the public either directly or through a straightforward registration process."" 106  ""The Archive now  provides free access to an enormous and wide-ranging collection of web pages, movies, books, sound recordings and software."" 107  Thus, the activity which is the basis for the Internet Archive's  requested exemption is not simply archival activity. See Allen-Myland, Inc. v. International Business Machs. Corp., 746 F. Supp. 520, 537 & fn. 19 (E.D. Pa. 1990) (117(a)(2) ""protects solely those copies used ""for archival purposes only"", and not copies made for use). As the statute states, the exemption applies to copies made ""for archival purposes only."" 108  Because it seems unlikely at best that the activities asserted by the Internet Archive as a justification for exempting a class of works fall within the scope of 117(a)(2), the Register cannot conclude that that provision would justify exempting a class of works broader than that which is justified based on an application of 108(c). Moreover, the fact that the activity for which an exemption is sought fits far more comfortably within the scope of 108 than that of 117 persuades that Register that reliance on 117 to exempt a potentially broader class than could be supported under 108 would be unjustified. The fact that 117 was not created to enable libraries and archives to perform their important public functions  that is the purpose of 108  leads to the 106 107  C 25, p. 7.  Id., p. 1. See also Internet Archives post-hearing response, p. 2 (""Like a paper library the Archive also provides free access to researchers, historians, scholars and the general public""). The restriction to ""archival purposes only"" also suggests that when, as discussed above, the reproductions are made only in part to guard against mechanical or electrical failure, the reproduction is not within the scope of the exemption. 108   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 59  conclusion that any exemption designed to address the concerns raised by the Internet Archive should be limited to the congressionally-chosen parameters of section 108, especially when Congress redefined those parameters as part of the DMCA.  A review of the mandatory statutory factors of  1201(a)(1)(C) to assess the proper balance based on the record confirms the Register's judgment that an exemption should be granted for computer programs and video games distributed in formats that have become obsolete and which require the original media or hardware as a condition of access.  The availability for use of copyrighted works. Works in the proposed class of literary and audiovisual works are, broadly speaking, available for use in a number of unprotected formats. This is not true, however, with respect to certain kinds of works, i.e., many works produced solely in digital formats, such as computer programs and video games, for which there is obviously no alternative analog substitute. Many such works are accompanied by access controls, and the proponents of an exemption have demonstrated that many computer programs and video games have been protected by ""original-only"" access controls. Such controls do, in theory, limit the availability for use of such works, but the only circumstances under which the proponents have shown that use has actually been restricted relate to preservation activity (discussed below) where the access controls require the use of physical or software formats that are not available to the user. The constraints on availability for use that are created by such access controls militate in favor of an exemption.  An evaluation of the availability for use of copyrighted works must also consider whether, in the context of the particular class of works in question, access control measures are increasing or   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 60  restricting the availability of works to the public in general.109 Because many providers of software and video games have elected to use ""original-only"" access controls to ensure that unauthorized copies of their works may not be disseminated and displace the market for legitimate copies, care must be taken, in fashioning any exemption, to limit the scope of the exemption so that it does not serve as a disincentive to continue to make such works available. Restricting the exemption to software and videogames that are (1) protected by such access controls and (2) in obsolete formats, serves this end while permitting noninfringing uses in the cases where users have no other (or, at best, very limited) options if they wish to gain access to the works. The restriction to obsolete formats also helps ensure that use of the exemption will likely be made only or at least largely by some libraries and archives, since consumers are less likely than libraries and archives to have an interest in using and copying out-of-date software and video games.  The availability for use of works for nonprofit archival, preservation, and educational purposes. When the focus is shifted from availability for general use to availability for nonprofit archival, preservation, and educational purposes, the core concerns of the proponents of this exemption are apparent. ""Original-only"" access controls necessarily affect preservation activities. Works that are ""born digital,"" such as computer programs and video games, can best be preserved in digital formats, and as hardware and software formats fall out of use, preservation can best be accomplished by migrating the works to modern storage media and in formats that modern devices can access. Even for works that exist in both analog and digital formats, the archivist has a legitimate interest in preserving all editions, including the electronic editions, for posterity. The archivist confronted with access controls that prevent preservation of digital works must either circumvent those access controls or refrain from making a usable copy of the digital work. The latter option obviously does not serve the interests that the second statutory factor is intended to advance. 109  See 65 FR at 64564.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 61  The interest in making works available for preservation purposes is highest when the work can no longer be accessed in its original digital format. For works that can still be accessed in that format (such as new versions of software distributed on CD-ROMS with original-only access controls that require that the original CD-ROM be in the computer's CD-ROM drive), the interest in preservation is not so great, or at least not so urgent. Moreover, as noted above, the provision of the copyright law specifically intended to address the needs of nonprofit libraries and archives, 108, limits its permission to make digital copies of published works to situations where the existing format in which the work is stored has become obsolete (or to replacement of copies or phonorecords that are damaged, deteriorating, lost or stolen), and imposes the additional prerequisite that an unused replacement cannot be obtained at a fair price.  In principle, these considerations apply to a wide variety of works, but proponents of an exemption have provided sufficient facts to justify only the narrower class recommended herein. Moreover, to the extent that this factor warrants exempting all works (or all works in digital formats) from the prohibition of 1201(a)(1) in order to enable preservation activities, it actually would warrant rejection of the exemption since the purpose of this rulemaking is to determine whether there are ""particular class[es] of works"" which should be exempted  not whether particular uses should be exempted. Paradoxically, the failure of the proponents of this exemption to justify the need to circumvent access controls for all the types of works they proposed to be exempted may have salvaged what otherwise would have been an overly broad proposal that failed to identify the ""particular class of works"" that the statute requires.  The impact that the prohibition on the circumvention of technological measures applied to copyrighted works has on criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. If works are not preserved, but are instead lost from the cultural history of our society, there will be an adverse effect on all of the uses on which this factor focuses: criticism, comment, news   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 62  reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. However, it is equally important to consider that preservation activity such as the work of the Internet Archive is not the sole means of enabling these fundamental uses. As long as access to works is currently possible, their use for criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research will generally be available. Access to a work may be available in alternative, unprotective formats, or the protected version may be readily available for these uses. Criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research on computer programs and video games are not hindered with respect to much of the class consisting of computer programs and video games. The primary problem arises with obsolete formats that are not available on the market. In such a case, libraries and archives may be the only resort for access to these historical works. Therefore, it appears that criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research are likely to be adversely affected only with respect to the subset of computer programs and video games that are obsolete.  The effect of circumvention of technological measures on the market for or value of copyrighted works. Circumvention of all literary or audiovisual works or even of all computer programs and video games could cause significant harm without some limiting principle. Of course, 1201(a)(1)(D) has the effect of limiting the scope of any exemption to noninfringing uses, yet the evidence of likely adverse effects in the record before the Register suggests that a more carefully tailored class would more appropriately remedy the adverse effects on established noninfringing uses while also minimizing the potential adverse effects on the market for or value of these works. Such a decision to tailor the class carefully is supported by clear evidence in the marketplace that computer programs and video games are a significant part of the works distributed unlawfully over the Internet and through the reproduction and distribution of unauthorized copies. Sensitivity to such widespread illegal trafficking is obviously critical to this rulemaking process, since these concerns formed the impetus for providing copyright owners with the protections afforded by the DMCA.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 63  Such other factors as the Librarian considers appropriate. The Register recognizes that many of the important concerns that libraries and archivists have about the preservation of our digital heritage may not be satisfied by the scope of this class. The exemption for this tailored class is intended to prevent the loss of digital works that have been distributed in formats that have become obsolete, but not to permit preemptive archival activity to preserve works before they become obsolete. While this may be important to libraries and archivists in a digital age, particularly as works are increasingly ""born digital,"" the resolution of that issue is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. Since preemptive archival activity is not currently exempted under 108, it is not categorically a noninfringing use. To the extent that such activity might qualify as a noninfringing use under some other exemption, such as fair use, it could apply to all categories of works and presumably would be engaged in on an ongoing basis. In essence, the problem confronting archival activity in the digital age is a ""use-based"" concern that is more appropriate for congressional consideration and properly crafted legislative amendment than it is for this rulemaking. Since certain forms of protection technology such as ""original-only"" measures are inconsistent with reproduction of works for purposes of preservation because they prevent use of reproductions, there is a tension created by the DMCA that is likely to grow and that should be considered by Congress in a comprehensive fashion. Although the remedy is beyond the scope of this rulemaking since it is a problem that relates to all digital works and is a problem that is not resolved by three-year exemptions, the potential adverse consequences raise serious concerns. As works are increasingly created and distributed exclusively in digital formats, the likelihood that rapid technological change will render the formats of today obsolete tomorrow is a problem that is likely to increase. At present, the Register has received evidence of a problem that may well increase in the future. In the absence of congressional action, the problems could well exceed the scope of this rulemaking and create a tension between evidence of harm to noninfringing uses and the insufficient authority to remedy the problem found. At present, and due to the limitations of the 1201 rulemaking process, the Register finds that the problem established in the record can best be addressed in this rulemaking by exempting the recommended class.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 64  4.  Literary works distributed in ebook format when all existing ebook editions of the work (including digital text editions made available by authorized entities) contain access controls that prevent the enabling of the ebook's read-aloud function and that prevent the enabling of screen readers to render the text into a ""specialized format."" For purposes of this exemption, ""specialized format,"" ""digital text"" and ""authorized entities"" shall have the same meaning as in 17 U.S.C. 121.  Electronic books (""ebooks"") are books that are distributed electronically over the Internet and downloaded by users to their personal computers or other electronic reading devices. The public's reception of ebooks has been tentative, and currently a small percentage of all works published are distributed in ebook formats, e.g., Microsoft Reader, Adobe Reader or Palm Reader. Although this is still a nascent market, ebooks offer tremendous new opportunities for the blind and the visually impaired. When a book is in electronic format, it has the potential to offer accessibility to the blind and the visually impaired that is otherwise not available from a print version First, ebooks may allow the user to activate a ""read-aloud"" function offered by certain ebook readers, e.g., the Adobe Reader (renamed in the current version 6.0, but formerly known as the Adobe Ebook Reader) and the Microsoft Reader (currently available in version 2.0). Both of these ebook readers contain read-aloud functionality that can render 110  the written text of the book into audible, synthetic  speech. Ebooks may also permit accessibility to the work by means of screen reader software (e.g., JAWS by Freedom Scientific), a separate program for the blind and visually impaired that interacts with an ebook reader and that is capable of converting the text into either synthesized speech or braille. In addition to the audible and tactile rendering of text works, screen readers also allow the text and layout of a text screen to be conveyed spatially so that a blind or visually impaired user can perceive the organization of a page on the screen or even the organization of a work as a whole.  In this context, and throughout this memorandum, ""render"" means the process by which the digital representation of sounds and/or images is converted back into those sounds and/or images. See DMCA Section 104 Report 108 fn.330 (2001).  110   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 65  This read-aloud functionality of the ebook reader and the text-to-speech (TTS) or text-tobraille (TTB) functions of the screen reader software create tremendous potential for accessibility to works that might otherwise be unavailable to the blind and visually impaired. But these forms of accessibility to ebooks by the blind and visually impaired are not available for all ebooks. The readaloud function of the ebook reader may be disabled by the copyright owner of the work and the ebook may be set to technologically prevent access to the work by means of screen reader software. Disabling these accessibility features may be accomplished in different ways, but it appears that generally, these uses are restricted by digital rights management tools. Digital rights management (DRM) may be employed in various ebook formats to set permissions or restrictions on uses of the work by the user. Typically, these DRM permissions are ""wrapped"" or bound to the copies of the work by means of an access control. For instance, after creating a document, the creator may decide to make it publicly accessible through the Adobe Reader software that is widely used on the Internet. The creator can convert the document into the Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) with the Adobe Acrobat program and may also use that program to restrict or permit particular uses that will be available to users of copies of the work that are distributed. After these permissions or restrictions are set, the creator or other copyright owner, or his or her agent, may bind these security settings to the file by means of a password or some other technological measure that protects access, thereby wrapping the usage rights within the overall access control. In order to alter the usage settings of the document, a user would have to circumvent the access control.  The information submitted has shown that a substantial number of ebooks have been distributed to the public with the read-aloud function and the screen reader accessibility function disabled. Since it is claimed that ebooks may be the only existing format of a book that is potentially accessible to the blind and visually impaired, commenters have proposed an exemption for literary works, including ebooks, which are protected by technological measures that block or inhibit   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 66  perception via a ""screen reader"" or similar text-to-speech or text-to-braille device utilized by a person who is blind or visually impaired. 111  The primary proponent of this exemption was the American Foundation for the Blind (AFB).112 Other commenters 113  have supported this exemption and have noted that fewer than ten  percent of published books are ever provided to the blind and visually impaired in accessible formats.114 The disabling of the ""read-aloud"" function on ebooks or the disabling of accessibility to screen reader software that provides accessibility to the blind and visually impaired is alleged to prevent these users from engaging in particular noninfringing uses such as private performance. Even more significant, the disabling of these functions is alleged to prevent access to these works by blind and visually impaired users altogether.  In her analysis of this proposal, the Register concludes that technological measures that control access to copyrighted works have a role in the disabling of the read-aloud function and of screen reader accessibility. She then determines that the uses that the proponents seek to enable are noninfringing uses. The Register then proposes a particular class of works that should be exempted from the prohibition on circumvention in order to enable the noninfringing uses, and determines that an exemption for that particular class of works is warranted based on a review of the factors set forth in 1201(a)(1)(C).  This formulation of the proposal is a close restatement of the class proposed by the Library Associations in Comment 33, which more precisely states a class related to the evidence of adverse effects on noninfringing uses demonstrated by the American Foundation for the Blind. 112 113 114  111  C26 C9, C13 and C33. C33 at 7.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 67  As a preliminary matter, however, it is necessary to address an issue raised by opponents of the proposed exemption: whether the issue presented by the proponents of an exemption is one of access or of accessibility. As the Association of American Publishers (AAP) put it, ""`access' ... refers only to a person's ability to obtain a sufficient level of contact with or proximity to a copy of copyrighted work for that person to be able to make some `use' of it,"" while ""`accessibility' ... describes both a specific need and goal of persons with disabilities to overcome those disabilities in order to make the same or comparable use of something as could a person without those disabilities."" 115  Moreover, to the extent that ""accessibility"" is an issue, AAP argued that the  enactment of the ""Chafee Amendment"" in 1997, adding 121 to the Copyright Act, was Congress's specific response to concerns about accessibility for the blind and visually impaired. Therefore, it would be inappropriate for the Librarian to use this rulemaking as a means to address such ""accessibility"" concerns, especially if to do so would go beyond the solutions offered by Congress when it enacted 121.116  Section 121 provides that it is not an infringement of copyright for an authorized entity to reproduce or distribute copies or phonorecords of published nondramatic literary works in specialized formats exclusively for use by blind or other persons with disabilities. ""Authorized entities"" are nonprofit organizations and governmental agencies with a primary mission to provide specialized services relating to training, education, or adaptive reading or information access needs of blind or other persons with disabilities. ""Specialized formats"" means ""braille, audio, or digital text which is exclusively for use by blind or other persons with disabilities."" 117  R 25, p. 13. See also T Allan Adler, May 1, 2003, p. 22 (""the access issue that is dealt with in Section 1201 is not the same as the accessibility issue that is dealt with under the Chafee Amendment""). 116 117  115  R25, pp. 13-15. 17 U.S.C. 121(c).   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 68  While the Register understands the distinction made by AAP between ""access"" and ""accessibility,"" that distinction has little impact on the Register's recommendation. In determining whether to exempt a particular class of works in this rulemaking, the Register is not required to ascertain whether users of that particular class of works are able to gain access to those works. Rather, the question is whether the prohibition on circumvention has had a substantial adverse effect on users' ability to make noninfringing uses of the works. ""Access"" may be relevant when the noninfringing use consists of gaining access, but other noninfringing uses are also relevant to the inquiry. The real relevance of ""access"" is based on the requirement that the prohibition against circumventing technological measures that control access to copyrighted works be adversely affecting the ability of users to make those noninfringing uses. The threshold issue in evaluating that requirement is whether there are any access controls. If there are, and if the inability to circumvent them without running afoul of 1201(a)(1) is preventing noninfringing uses, then it is appropriate to determine whether, considering the factors set forth in 1201(a)(1)(C), the affected class of works should be exempted. In making that analysis, the existence and effect of 121 are certainly relevant, but the fact that 121 exists does not disqualify blind and visually impaired persons from seeking an appropriate exemption in this rulemaking, even if that exemption permits acts not expressly included within the scope of 121.  Thus, the alleged distinction between ""access"" and ""accessibility"" is a red herring. To say that a blind person technically has ""access"" to a work that he cannot perceive does not assist in resolving whether to recommend an exemption. Moreover, to return to AAP's definition of ""access""  "" a person's ability to obtain a sufficient level of contact with or proximity to a copy of copyrighted work for that person to be able to make some `use' of it""  it is far from apparent that a blind person does have ""access"" to an work in an ebook format that can be perceived only by viewing it on the ebook's screen. Nor does the blind person necessarily have access to the book just because it may be available in traditional print formats. The potential availability of mechanisms to   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 69  make works ""accessible"" under 121 hardly ensures that any particular work will in fact be made available in a way that is usable for the blind and visually impaired.  As noted above, a threshold issue in considering the proposed exemption is whether the works in question are protected by access controls. The record in this rulemaking proceeding is less clear than desirable on that point. However, there appears to be consensus among the relevant participants in the rulemaking that access controls are involved.118 The specific technology that enables and disables the read-aloud function or the accessibility to screen reader software does not appear to be, in itself, an access control measure. Rather, it appears to be a measure that controls particular uses of the work. However it also appears that an access control measure serves to protect the integrity of the use control measures, e.g., a password that protects the security features of the file. The publisher of an ebook would decide whether to enable the ""read-aloud"" function and screen reader accessibility  perhaps by checking a box on a password-controlled menu controlling the document's security settings.119 As a representative of a major publisher stated, ""If you look at the Acrobat approach, you set the permissions in advance and one of the permissions is text-to-  The representatives of AFB and of McGraw-Hill, a leading publisher, expressly stated that the inability to convert text to speech is because of a technological measure that controls access. T Paul Schroeder, May 1, 2003, p. 49; T Robert Bolick, May 1, 2003, p. 51. The other witnesses at the hearing on this issue appear to have implicitly agreed. See the Transcript of the May 1, 2003 hearing, at 51 et seq. [Question: ""Everyone agrees that what we're talking about here, the circumstances when you're not able to use that screen reader to convert text to speech, for example, the reason you can't do it is because in fact there is a technological measure that is controlling access. Is that the problem? Because if it isn't, of course, there's no reason to talking to it. I just want to make sure it's understood."" Mr. Schroeder and Mr. Bolick responded in the affirmative; none of the remaining witnesses expressed any disagreement.] In addition, the AAP representative stated that the proposed exemption ""would allow for the ability to circumvent specific access controls that are used in the context of e-book simply because those access controls do not enable the use of text-tospeech software."" T Allan Adler, May 1, 2003, p. 47. See Adobe Acrobat 6.0 Professional Help, pp. 390-01 (""Adding passwords and setting security options"" and ""Security options""). 119  118   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 70  speech. Then the encryption of DRM is applied and wraps the package.""  120  To enable the read-aloud  function or the accessibility to screen reader software, a user would have to circumvent the access control that protects these functions. The prohibition on circumvention, therefore, may under certain circumstances prohibit activation of these DRM functions (screen reader accessibility and the readaloud function) of the ebook.  Having concluded that the prohibition is preventing the desired uses by persons with disabilities, the Register must consider whether the desired uses are noninfringing. When a blind person activates the ""read-aloud"" function on an ebook, or uses a screen reader to ""read"" the text to himself or herself, such a use typically will be a noninfringing use. A private performance of a work for which one has obtained lawful access will always be noninfringing, since the exclusive rights of the copyright owner do not extend to private performances. See 17 U.S.C. 106(4). Use of a screen reader to convert the text of a lawfully obtained ebook into braille may pose a more complicated question, since it implicates the copyright owner's exclusive right of reproduction. Because an individual user of screen reader software is not an ""authorized entity,""  121 does not apply to this conduct. Nevertheless, if such an intermediate reproduction is for the purpose of the private rendering of an lawful copy of the work into a ""specialized format"" in order to permit a blind person to perceive the work, purely for personal use, and does not include any distribution of the work that could harm the potential market for the work, such conduct clearly would be within the spirit of 121 and most likely would, in such circumstances, appear to constitute a fair use of the work. The Register believes that the intended uses of the work by the blind and visually impaired are noninfringing uses.  Opponents of the exemption argued that the 121 was the congressional expression of the scope of limitations on copyright owner's exclusive rights in relation to noninfringing uses by the 120  T Robert Bolick, May 1, 2003, p. 50.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 71  blind and visually impaired. While it is true that Congress enacted 121 to enable certain nonprofit organizations and government agencies to make copies of nondramatic literary works in specialized formats and distribute them to the blind and disabled, there is no indication that Congress intended to strip an individual who is blind or visually impaired of traditional defenses, such as fair use, when that individual takes actions to make such a work perceptible to himself for his own personal use. The Register considers it highly unlikely that a publisher would even consider accusing such a person of copyright infringement, and even more unlikely that a court would find such conduct to be infringing. 121  It is also significant to note that the purpose of  121 to exempt certain conduct for making otherwise inaccessible versions of published copyrighted works accessible. The question before the Register in relation to ebooks is entirely different. The digital format of books needs no adaptation in order to be accessible to the blind and visually impaired. Unlike the works addressed in 121, the digital text format of ebooks enhances accessibility, with built-in features that benefit the blind and visually impaired, unless the technology that enables such accessibility has been disabled. There is no reason to believe that in enacting 121, Congress foresaw that publishers or authors would act affirmatively to prevent accessibility from an otherwise accessible format, and no reason to believe that Congress intended to give its blessing to such conduct. This is not to say that there are not legitimate reasons for disabling accessibility, e.g., concern that such accessibility will allow circumvention by other devices or the desire to prevent an ebook from competing with an audio version of the same work, but such concerns do not eliminate the legitimate nature of the intended use by the blind and visually impaired. Similarly, 121 cannot be read as a statement that Congress did not intend accessibility for the blind and visually impaired to extend to ebooks. Section 121  Indeed, there is no indication that in enacting 121, Congress was even considering works already in digital formats, such as ebooks, which perhaps for the first time offer an individual blind person the possibility of ""self-help"" in making a copy of a literary work perceptible.  121   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 72  addresses accessibility for works that were published but not accessible due to the nature of the format in which they were published. The proposed exemption to the prohibition addresses published works in formats for which there is no inherent obstacle to accessibility except for the choice to deploy a technological restriction on accessibility. Section 121 therefore offers little guidance for the present analysis.  The proponents of an exemption have, therefore, made the case that the prohibition on circumvention is adversely affecting noninfringing uses. But is there a particular class of works with respect to which noninfringing uses have been adversely affected? AFB requests that the class of works be designated as ""literary."" Such a class clearly is overbroad. The joint comments of the library associations proposes a more narrowly tailored class: ""Literary works, including eBooks, which are protected by technological measures that fail to permit access, via a ""screen reader"" or similar text-to-speech or text-to-braille device, by an otherwise authorized person with a visual or print disability.""  The Register finds that the class proposed by the library associations is closer to the mark. Unlike the class proposed by the AFB, which consists of an entire section 102 category of works, the library associations' proposed class commences with a section 102 category but, drawing on the guidance offered in the previous rulemaking, 65 FR at 64561, narrows it by reference to attributes of the technological measures that control access to the works.  The Register recommends exempting a class of works that takes the library associations' proposal as its starting point, but with some additional refinements. First, the Register cannot recommend a class of ""literary works, including ebooks"" (emphasis added), since that class of works includes literary works other than ebooks. A class of works must be determined based on a factual showing of substantial adverse effects on noninfringing uses, and the only facts submitted by   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003 122  Page 73  proponents of an exemption related to ebooks.  Accordingly, the class should be defined initially  as consisting of ""Literary works distributed in ebook format."" But a class of ""literary works distributed in ebook format,"" without further refinement, would be too broad. It would include ebooks which are accessible to screen readers or which have the ""read-aloud"" feature enabled. There is no reason to permit circumvention of access controls on such ebooks, because the noninfringing use is already permitted. Moreover, although a class of works cannot be defined by reference to particular uses or users, 123  the class should be defined in a manner that is calculated to benefit the  types of users and uses for which a showing of harm has been made, and that is calculated not to benefit other uses for which no showing has been made. Because the case has not been made for a cognizable adverse effect outside the context of use by the blind and visually impaired, it is appropriate to further tailor the class to that particular harm. The optimal designation appears to be ""literary works distributed in ebook format when all existing ebook editions of the work (including digital text 124  editions made available by authorized entities125) contain access controls that prevent  122 123  See, e.g., C 26 , pp. 3-6, PHR Janina Sajka, AFB, pp. 1-2.  For this reason, the library associations' proposal to further define the class of works by reference to ""an otherwise authorized person with a visual or print disability"" cannot be accepted. As AAP pointed out, ""the intended use or users of the work"" is ""an unacceptable measure for an exempt `class.'"" R26, p. 15. To acknowledge that, however, is not to say that in determining how to define a ""particular class of works,"" the noninfringing uses that are adversely affected by the prohibition on circumvention may not be taken into account. Indeed, to the extent that the statutory scheme permits, the Register attempts to define an exempted class of works in a way that will not overbroadly include works for which there has been no showing that the prohibition is hindering noninfringing uses. ""Digital text"" is the specialized format referred to in 121(c)(3): ""digital text which is exclusively for use by blind or other persons with disabilities."" ""Authorized entities,"" defined in 121(c)(1), are nonprofit organizations and governmental agencies with a primary mission to provide specialized services relating to training, education, or adaptive reading or information access needs of blind or other persons with disabilities. 125 124   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 74  the enabling of the read-aloud function and the enabling of screen readers to render the text into a specialized format.""126  Such an exemption is closely tailored to the noninfringing uses which have been prevented by the pertinent access controls. For example, the only ebooks whose access controls could be circumvented are those that prevent both use of the read-aloud function and accessibility to screen reader software. If an ebook enables either of these features, the Register believes that it would represent meaningful accessibility for the blind and visually impaired. It is conceivable that copyright owners might have legitimate reasons for disabling one of these features, and while there may well be legitimate reasons for disabling both, the Register believes that the evidence of harm outweighs any justification for disabling both of these features that has been put forward in the record in this rulemaking.  Another important component of the exemption is that it would not apply to a work if, at the time of circumvention, an ebook version is on the market for which either the read-aloud function or screen readers are enabled. Should publishers make accessible formats of a particular work available by enabling either of these functions, the exemption would no longer be applicable to that particular work. Additionally, if the ebook or an accessible ""digital text"" is available through an ""authorized entity"" under 121, such as Bookshare.org,127 the exemption to the prohibition will not apply.  ""Specialized format"" is defined in121(c)(3): ""braille, audio, or digital text which is exclusively for use by blind or other persons with disabilities."" Bookshare.org is an arm of a California not-for-profit organization known as the Benetech Group that allows persons and organizations qualified under the provisions of 17 U.S.C  121 to download digital text and contribute scanned versions of books and certain printed material to the program. Those digital versions are made available to blind and disabled persons. As of March 2003, Bookshare.org was reported to have over 11,000 titles available on its service. See http://www.bookshare.org/web/PressReleaseC.html. 127  126   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 75  Formulating the exempted class as recommended would also ensure that it addresses harm that is not limited to isolated occurrences or mere inconveniences. The evidence suggests that the problem of accessibility is an adverse effect that would likely affect the vast majority of blind and visually impaired persons. Also, under the recommended formulation of the class, circumvention is not a matter of convenience or simply a question of the preferred means of accessibility. Although, as opponents of the exemption have pointed out, organizations like Bookshare.org exist to facilitate the conversion of books into digitized text for accessibility to the blind and visually impaired, the exemption specifically addresses whether such digital text versions of a work currently exist for use. If an accessible ebook edition of a work is available in the marketplace or a digital text is available through a 121 authorized entity, then the exemption does not apply. As the exempted class is framed, affected users are likely to consider circumvention only as a last resort and only where the work is unavailable for the intended noninfringing use. The exemption also serves to encourage publishers to make accessible versions available: when such a version is available, the publisher need not worry that users may lawfully circumvent access controls applied to the work. Thus, the recommended exemption gives the publisher ultimate control over whether any user can ever take advantage of the exemption with respect to that publisher's work.  The evidence in the rulemaking suggests that a significant number of ebook titles are not accessible to the blind and visually impaired. Although follow-up questions were asked of the witnesses testifying both in support of and in opposition to the proposed exemption for more precise data, the record on the precise number of works that prevent accessibility, such as the read-aloud function, is far from clear. Neither proponents or opponents of the exemption provided the Register with definitive details on the number of works or the particular works that prevented accessibility. 128  AFB's post-hearing response offers some statistics from www.ebooks.com indicating that the percentage of ebook titles with the read-aloud function enabled was 62% of the titles in Adobe ""Ebook"" format, 28% of the titles in Microsoft Reader format and 0% of the titles in Mobipocket and Palm format. PHR Janina Sajka, AFB, p. 2. The reason for the last statistic  128   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 76  Despite the difficulty in establishing the exact scope of the problem, the evidence that has been submitted by both proponents and opponents of the exemption establishes that a significant number of ebook titles are currently offered to the public for which accessibility to the blind and visually impaired has been disabled.129 The compelling nature of the noninfringing use that such users seek  the ability to perceive the works  as well as the established scope of the problem weigh in favor of an exemption.  In considering whether an exemption is necessary, the availability of alternative formats must also be addressed. There was no evidence introduced that titles available in ebook format are not also available in traditional book form as well. In addition, some titles available in ebook form that have the accessibility features disabled also exist in audio book format, although the record is vague on the extent to which this is true. It is necessary to consider whether the availability of these alternative formats eliminates the need for an exemption. Although the traditional book format is ""available"" in the marketplace, books in that format nevertheless are not necessaraily available for use by the blind and visually impaired. In order for a hard copy of a book to be accessible, it must be converted into some other form that is perceptible to the blind and visually impaired. While 121 allows authorized entities to undertake such a process, there is no question that this process has not kept pace with the publication of works in general and there is no evidence that such authorized entities have provided accessible formats of all of the works that are published in ebook format.  would seem to be that the devices on which these formats are most often used often do not contain audio output. The post-hearing response refers to ebooks.com as an ""Australian on line bookseller,"" but the company's contact information on its website also lists a U.S. corporate address and the website appears to have separate sections serving different regions, including the United States, so it is not entirely clear to what extent these percentages relate to U.S. editions of ebooks. In any event, it is probably reasonable to assume that statistics for the United States are similar to or the same as those for Australia. AFB post-hearing response at p. 2 (ebook.com statistics); AAP post-hearing response at 2 (one publisher whose default setting for Adobe Reader is ""read-aloud off"" has 1650 titles available). 129   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 77  Bookshare.org, an entity that expressly operates under the auspices of  121,130 uses volunteers who scan books into digital formats and makes those digital texts available to qualified members, who must be blind or disabled. It has been argued by opponents of the exemption that entities such as Bookshare.org can make text versions of all books accessible to the blind and visually impaired since anyone can scan a book and submit it to Bookshare.org. However, the fact that any book might conceivably be made available does not mean that all books are or will be made available through such organizations. Resources are limited, and, as noted above, as of March 2003, Bookshare.org was reported to have over 12,000 titles available on its service  a fraction even of the number of ebook titles (not to mention all book titles) in circulation. In contrast, 280,590 ebook titles are reportedly on sale.131 The Register's recommended exemption addresses whether the work is currently available in a format accessible to the blind and visually impaired. To the extent that the digital text, with the read-aloud function or screen readers enabled, is available in the commercial or noncommercial marketplace, the Register agrees that the exemption is not appropriate. To the extent that it is not available, but when ebooks without those functions enabled are available, the blind and disabled should be permitted to circumvent the access controls that prevent them from making the texts perceptible to them. Since a significant percentage of the ebooks on the market deny access to the blind and visually impaired by deactivating the read-aloud function and accessibility through screen readers, access to this significant segment of the population is, for practical purposes, unavailable for a large number of works.  Audio books or books-on-tape are another form of books on the market that are accessible to the blind and visually impaired. Despite questions by the Copyright Office that attempted to clarify the extent to which commercially distributed audio books are available for the same titles in ebook 130 131  http://www.bookshare.org/web/Legalities.html.  ""OeBF Releases eBook Sales Statistics,"" EContent, Sept. 19, 2003 [http://www.econtentmag.com/Articles/ArticleReader.aspx?ArticleID=5495 ].   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 78 132  format that deny accessibility to the blind and visually impaired, the record remains unclear.  Nevertheless, there is sufficient information to conclude that the availability of audio book formats does not resolve the problem. For instance, AAP's post-hearing response stated that one of its publisher members who generally disables the read-aloud function on ebooks publishes ""roughly one-half"" of its ebook titles in audio book format as well.133 Therefore, there are some significant number of ""inaccessible"" ebooks on the market for which there is no audio book substitute.  In addition, AFB noted in its post-hearing response to the same question that while these audio books are useful for certain types of works, e.g., best sellers and novels, they are not available or useful for many other types of books. For instance, textbooks, scientific books or reference books are generally used in a manner that requires the content to be accessed at specific places within the work, and these works are not generally read from beginning to end. 134  It also may be legitimately assumed that to the extent that an audio book version of a work exists, it is unlikely that a user will opt for the synthesized speech of the read-aloud feature that is available in an ebook reader or a screen reader unless there is a purpose of the use that is not compatible with an audio book. While opponents have stated that the read-aloud feature is sometimes deactivated in order to avoid competition for the same title that is marketed in an audio book format, it appears very unlikely that the former is a marketplace substitute for the latter.135 In  AAP's post-hearing response stated that it could not obtain specific statistics on the number of ebooks that have the read-aloud function deactivated, and therefore was unable to determine how many of these unquantifiable titles were also available in audio book format. PHR Allan Adler, AAP, p. 1-3. 133 134 135  132  Id at 2. PHR Janina Sajka, AFB, p. 1.  See T Jonathan Band, May 1, 2003, p. 13 (""Screen readers do not compete with books on tape because of the synthetic quality of the sound"").   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 79  any case, the issue is not determinative since there is evidence that a substantial number of ebooks that disable accessibility functions are not available in audio book format.  Before turning to the consideration of the statutory factors, one marketplace development that was raised late in the rulemaking warrants some additional discussion. AFB's post-hearing response added some important, albeit cryptic, information. This response noted that the new version of the Adobe Reader 6.0 ""incorporates access and read-aloud functionality"" and that ""[o]ur issues with the Adobe Ebook Reader itself appear to have been substantially resolved with this new release."" 136  This appeared to be a significant marketplace development, but the extent to which it had resolved the root of the problem was unknown. Does this mean that Adobe Reader 6.0 necessarily provides access? Can read-aloud functionality or accessibility to screen readers still be disabled? Were the responses in the AAP post-hearing response on default settings related to Abobe Reader 6.0 or some earlier version? What is the significance in the context of the overall ebook market?  Rather than move forward with incomplete information, the answers were sought in the Adobe Acrobat 6.0 software itself, which packages the work and allows digital rights management preferences to be chosen. A review of this software revealed that the default setting for documents saved in this format is that accessibility is enabled, thereby allowing both read-aloud functionality and accessibility by screen reader software. These defaults can be disabled, however, such that both accessibility options will be disabled. It therefore appears that although the default setting is favorable to accessibility and would make it unlikely that a publisher would inadvertently disable the read-aloud and screen reader functions, the fact remains that accessibility can still be denied if a  136  PHR Janina Sajka, AFB, p. 1.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 80  publisher chooses to disable those functions. Thus, AFB's statement that its ""issues with the Adobe Ebook Reader itself appear to have been substantially resolved"" (emphasis added) cannot be read as admitting that its ""issues"" with ebooks in general have been resolved. In addition, there was no evidence that any changes had occurred in other ebook reader formats that would warrant an assumption that the market has abruptly changed course. Therefore, the Register does not find that the problems raised have been resolved by the market. The evidence weighs in favor of an exemption during the next three-year period, and a review of the statutory factors applied to the class of works recommended supports this view.  Under the first factor  the availability for use  the record is clear that a significant number of ebook titles are distributed only in formats that are not perceptible to the blind and visually impaired.137 Not only does the evidence introduced by proponents support this conclusion, but the statements by the opponents of an exemption corroborate this fact. 138  These ebook versions of this  work are therefore unavailable for use by the blind and visually impaired. Although other formats of these works are ""available"" in the marketplace, they are nevertheless unavailable for use to the blind and visually impaired. The existence of a statutory exemption that allows works to be converted into accessible formats is relevant to this inquiry, but it is not determinative. This factor addresses the current availability for use rather than the potential availability for use. At present, this potential is  AAP points out that it has taken many steps that have assisted in making literary works more available to the blind and visually impaired. R26, at 12-13. The Register recognizes those efforts and commends AAP for its continuing activity in this area. However, the fact remains that for the blind and visually impaired, a substantial proportion of literary works remain, as a practical matter, unavailable. Based on AAP's own submissions, it is clear that a substantial number of ebooks are not ""accessible"" to the blind. AAP reports, for example, that ""One such publisher, which indicated that its own default setting for Adobe Reader at this time is `read-aloud off,' stated that it currently has about 1650 ebook titles available and that about 25% of those titles are also available for purchase as an audiobook."" AAP post-hearing response, at 2. Thus, there appear to be at least 1650 ebooks (from one publisher alone) that have ""read-aloud off."" 138  137   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 81  all that 121 provides. The analysis must, however, consider the extent to which particular works are currently available in other accessible formats. To that end, the class has been tailored to encompass only the works that are unavailable in any ebook or digital text format that would allow accessibility to the blind and visually impaired.  The second factor looks more particularly to the availability for use of works for nonprofit archival, preservation, and educational purposes. The two considerations dealing with archival or preservation purposes have not been specifically addressed at all in this rulemaking. Although the availability for educational purposes has not been expansively addressed in the record, it may be noted that the Library Associations' comments and testimony have cited concerns for accessibility to required readings by blind and visually impaired students. of this problem, this factor is of limited value. 139  Without a clearer record on the nature  The third factor requires consideration of the impact that the prohibition on circumvention of technological protection measures applied to copyrighted works has on criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. While there is little specific evidence of an adverse effect on these uses, it is apparent that to the extent that ebooks exist in the market but are not accessible to the blind and visually impaired and cannot be made accessible to them as a result of the prohibition, the prohibition will have an adverse impact on all of these uses by the blind and visually impaired. The record indicates that some significant number of works that exist in ebook format are not currently available in accessible formats. Therefore, but for the prohibition, these works might be available for such uses.  139  C33, p. 11.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 82  The fourth factor analyzes the effect of circumvention of technological measures on the market for or value of copyrighted works. While a broad exemption on ebooks generally could create significant harm to this emerging market by facilitating Napster-like distribution of ebooks over the Internet, a refinement of the class will serve to minimize or even eliminate likely adverse effects. As discussed above, by limiting the class to ""literary works distributed in ebook format when all existing ebook editions of the work (including ""digital text"" editions made available by authorized entities) contain access controls that prevent the enabling of the read-aloud function and the enabling of screen readers to render the text into a `specialized format,'"" the exemption gives publishers control over whether users will be able lawfully to circumvent access controls on ebooks. Publishers, while opposing an exemption, have made no concrete showing that such an exemption would deter them from distributing literary works in ebook form, and it is difficult to imagine that the recommended exemption would provoke such a reaction. To the extent that the exemption may be used, its scope is restricted to a manner which minimizes the potential for unintended consequences.  B.  Other Exemptions Considered, But Not Recommended  A number of other proposed exemptions were considered, but for the reasons set forth below, the Register does not recommend that any of them be adopted. In most cases, proponents failed to propose a true ""particular class of copyrighted works"" and failed to demonstrate that users of such works have been or will be adversely affected in their ability to make noninfringing uses of those works.  1.  Proposed class: All works should be exempt for noninfringing uses, e.g., fair use and private uses, and other use-based proposals140.  140  C7, C8, C43, and C44.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 83  Many commenters proposed classes of works that were defined primarily or solely by reference to the uses that are made of the works. As noted above and in the 2000 rulemaking, the Register cannot read 1201 as permitting the exemption of a class of works that is based on attributes of the users of those works or uses made of those works. Rather, a class must be defined initially by reference to common attributes relating to the works themselves.  A number of comments declined to specify a ""class of works"" and instead designated the class to be exempted as ""all works."" Some of these comments cited facts which offered anecdotal support for a much narrower class, but did not factually buttress the claim to show the rationale for such a broad classification, except to the extent that the comments were critical of the DMCA generally. Such comments were considered by the Office as support for a narrower class to the extent that they cited any particular evidence of present or likely harm.  In the last rulemaking, after an extensive review of the statutory language and the legislative history, the Register reached the conclusion that the term ""class of works,"" as applied to this rulemaking process in section 1201, refers to some subset of the section 102 categories of works. The section 102 categories are a ""starting point"" for any determination of what a particular class of works might be.141 Determining the precise contour of the scope of a ""particular class,"" so that it is neither too broad or too narrow, is one of the principal functions of the rulemaking process. The factual record established in the rulemaking process creates the means for appropriately tailoring the scope of the class. It is therefore incumbent upon commenters to create a factual record to support a  141  65 FR at 64560.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 84  proposed exemption. The factual evidence of present or likely adverse effects on noninfringing uses will generally dictate the scope of the exemption. On the other hand, the lack of an evidentiary foundation will undermine the legitimacy of any proposal for an exemption in this process.  Because the proponents of an exemption for ""all works"" have utterly failed to propose ""a particular class of copyrighted works,"" but have simply asked, in effect, for a blanket exemption for all works  in effect, an administrative abrogation of 1201(a)(1)  these proposals must be rejected.  2.  Proposed classes: Several, including ""Per se Educational Fair Use Works"" and ""Fair Use Works.""142 Another group of proposals defined the class of works primarily by reference to the type of  use of works or the nature of the users, e.g., fair use works. A ""use-based"" or ""user-based"" classification was rejected by the Register in the last rulemaking, because the statutory language and the legislative history did not provide support for classification on this basis.143 Defining a class in such a manner would make it applicable to all works and would not provide any distinctions between varying types of works or the measures protecting them. If an exemption encompassing all works is to be granted, it is more appropriately a matter for Congressional action. This ""use-based"" or ""user-based"" classification is inconsistent with the narrowly tailored authority provided to the Librarian of Congress to exempt particular classes of adversely affected works in this rulemaking process. Had Congress wished to exempt all circumvention when it is for the purpose of  142 143  C28, C30(7), C37(2), and C43. 65 FR at 64560.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 85  ""noninfringing use,"" or ""fair use,"" it could easily have done so. Giving the Librarian authority to exempt ""a particular class of copyrighted works"" is not designed to accomplish that end, or even to accommodate such an end.  The statutory exemptions in section 1201 contain carefully crafted, use-based and user-based exemptions. Importantly, Congress considered and declined to enact certain use-based exemptions virtually identical to some of the proposals raised in this rulemaking. The statutory text and the legislative history provide no evidence that Congress intended this rulemaking to second-guess congressional determinations. Rather, Congress created this rulemaking as a ""fail-safe"" mechanism to focus on evidence of adverse effects in particular sub-categories of works that could be ameliorated by appropriately crafted, short-term exemptions.144 By their nature, use-based exemptions are not limited in time and would require recurring remedial treatment  a scenario at odds with the three-year term of exemptions in this rulemaking. It is also of note that several bills currently before Congress incorporate use-based revisions of section 1201. If Congress finds that an expansion to the existing statutory exemptions is warranted, it will accomplish that through legislation.  Some commenters have packaged their proposed use-based exemptions by referring to certain types of works in an attempt to transform an essentially use-based exemption into a class of works more consistent with the requirements identified in the last rulemaking proceeding. For example, the comment on behalf of Association of American Universities (""AAU"")and other  144  Commerce Comm. Report at 36.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 86  educational organizations (C28), while critical of the Register's determination that a ""class of works"" must, as a starting point, be based on attributes of the works themselves, simply lists several subcategories (e.g., scientific and social science databases, textbooks, law reports, and educational audiovisual works) of virtually every section 102 category of works (""the following subcategories of literary works, musical works, pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works, audiovisual works, and sound recordings""). These types of works are proposed as a class of ""Per se Educational Fair Use Works.""145 One of the fatal flaws in this designation becomes obvious when the types of works listed are matched with this broad use-based proposal. While there might be certain instances in which the unauthorized reproduction or adaptation of a textbook in an educational setting could be a fair use, such a determination would be unusual since the primary market for textbooks consists of students and teachers. The comment assumes that, but fails to show why, the unauthorized use of these types of works will be ""per se"" fair use. Indeed, the comment sets forth no facts regarding the proposed class of works, the technological measures that are applied to them, or the ways in which the use of those technological measures has adversely affected users of those works or is likely to adversely affect those users. The complete absence of any factual showing precludes serious consideration of this proposal. The same analysis applies to each of the ""classes"" proposed by AAU.  3.  Proposed classes: (1) Musical recordings and audiovisual works protected by access control mechanisms whose circumvention is reasonably necessary to carry out a legitimate research project where the granted exemption applies only to acts of circumvention whose primary purpose is to further a legitimate research project.146  145 146  A similar class was proposed and rejected in 2000. See 65 FR at 64571-72. C27; R23, pp. 46-47; R28, p. 4.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 87  (2) Musical recordings and audiovisual works protected by access control mechanisms whose circumvention is reasonably necessary to carry out a legitimate research project. We discuss these two related classes together. Both were proposed by Professor Edward  147  Felten, who proposed the second class as an alternative to the first, in the event that ""Class 1 does not constitute a valid `class of works' as defined in the Notice of Inquiry."" Professor Felten also observed that although he believes his second proposed class ""likely is a viable `class of works,' ... I recognize that the Librarian may find otherwise."" This observation was perspicacious.  Each of Professor Felten's two proposed classes consist of broad categories of works named in section 102 of the Copyright Act, subject to a condition relating to the intended use by the person circumventing the access control. While it is appropriate in determining a ""class of works"" to begin with the categories of works set forth in section 102, it is unlikely that a class of works could consist of an entire section 102 category, not to mention large portions of three categories. Here, each of the two proposed classes consists of ""musical recordings and audiovisual works,"" apparently occupying virtually the entire field of works in the category of audiovisual works (102(6)) and a substantial part of the categories of sound recordings (102(7)) and musical works (102(2)). 148  Thus, unless  147 148  Id.  Musical works are necessarily included because all musical recordings will be recordings of musical works. In fact, it is difficult to understand in principle why Professor Felten has chosen to limit his proposed class to these three section 102 categories of works. Because his concern is with the ability to engage in legitimate research on technological measures that control access to copyrighted works, his proposed exemption logically should include all section 102 categories of works, subject to the further use-based conditions set forth in his descriptions of the proposed class.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 88  the remainder of the defining characteristics of the proposed classes of works reduces the scope of the classes to that which is required to comprise a ""particular class of works,"" Professor Felten's proposal must be rejected at the outset. Professor Felten does attempt to further delimit each class, but in each case, the proposed class is further narrowed only by reference to the necessary or intended use by persons wishing to circumvent the access controls. In one case, the intended use is to ""carry out a legitimate research project,"" and the exemption would be available only when the person engaging in circumvention did so primarily in order to carry out such a legitimate research project. Professor Felten appears to recognize that the Librarian may not have the power to restrict the benefit of an exemption only to persons engaging in certain kinds of activity  and he is correct in recognizing that problem. As a result, his alternative proposal removes the condition that the exemption is available only to persons engaging in circumvention primarily in order to carry out a legitimate research project, but retains the restriction that the musical recordings and audiovisual works in the class must be protected by access controls whose circumvention is reasonably necessary in order to carry out a legitimate research project. The difference between the two proposals appears to be that the second applies an objective standard to determine whether intended uses (legitimate research) are likely to be necessary, while the first adds a subjective standard requiring that anybody taking advantage of the exemption actually have such a purpose.  Because each of these proposed classes is defined largely in terms of the purpose of the circumvention, they cannot be considered. They are simply variants of the type of use-based class that is beyond the scope of this proceeding. The purpose or necessity of carrying out a legitimate research project is not an attribute of the works themselves. Nor, contrary to Professor Felten's assertion, is it even an attribute of the access controls. Presumably, every technological measure that   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 89  controls access to copyrighted works is a legitimate subject of research, and presumably circumvention of the access control measure would be a reasonably necessary part of such research.  For purposes of analysis, the Register can accept Professor Felten's assertion that legitimate research such as his own research on the Secure Digital Music Initiative (SDMI) involves noninfringing uses of copyrighted works. The Register also acknowledges Professor Felten's belief that ""research on access control technologies provides many benefits to the public and to copyright holders"" and his belief that the existing statutory exemptions in 1201 are insufficient to permit researchers such as Professor Felten to engage in their research.149 The problem is that this rulemaking is not intended to be a vehicle for creation of new exemptions (or expansion of existing exemptions) for particular uses, no matter how beneficial they might be.  4.  Proposed class: Any work to which the user had lawful initial access (and variations) Some comments repeated or modified the class proposed three years ago by the Digital  Future Coalition.  150  Although the Register fully explained why this proposed exemption does not 151  constitute an appropriate class within the context of this rulemaking three years ago,  commenters  sought to re-assert this proposal without providing any factual support whatsoever. Even assuming that the proponents have crafted a proper ""class"" for purposes of this rulemaking, it is impossible to assess such a proposal without evidence of any harm (or even any attempt to produce evidence of  149 150 151  Professor Felten did not even address 1201(j), which covers security testing. C28(5), C30(7) 65 FR at 64572 - 64573 (October 27, 2000).   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 90  insubstantial harm or harm that rises beyond mere speculation and conjecture). Moreover, it appears (from the absence even of any assertions to the contrary) that the speculative fear of harm that was the impetus for this proposal three years ago has, in the ensuing period, failed to materialize in the marketplace. Had the fears been justified, it is quite evident that such examples would have been brought to the Copyright Office's attention in this second rulemaking.  While the Register's ""assessment of adverse impacts on particular categories of works is to be determined de novo,"" 152  that does not mean that decisions as to legal interpretation made in the  previous rulemaking are to be ignored. The requirement of a de novo determination means that the Register's evaluation of the facts relating to adverse impacts on particular categories of works must be based on facts presented to the Register in the current rulemaking proceeding, regardless of what facts might have been presented to and found by the Register in previous proceedings. But the decisions made in the previous rulemaking on such fundamental matters as the requirement of (and definition of) a ""particular class of works"" and the burden of proof that proponents of exemptions must bear are precedential decisions, and they continue to guide the Register in her analysis of proposed class and ought to guide participants in the rulemaking process. That is not to say that the Register will not reconsider such previous intepretations of law in the face of a persuasive legal argument, but no such arguments have been presented to the Register in this proceeding.  The proponents of this exemption appear to have overlooked the fact that an assertion that noninfringing uses have been or will be adversely affected by the prohibition is only the starting  152  Commerce Comm. Report at 37.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 91  point for the relevant analysis. Identifying what specific noninfringing uses are prevented in relation to which specific class of works is necessary in order to determine either the appropriate scope of the class or whether such use could have been accomplished without the necessity of circumvention. Similarly, the identification of the particular technological measure to which the prohibition applies is necessary to examine whether the use was in fact prevented by the technological measure protecting access or whether such use was prevented by something unrelated to the prohibition, e.g., a measure protecting use or a contractual agreement. Proponents of this exemption also overlooked other required considerations, such as the nature or scope of the adverse effect or the effect of an exemption on the market for such works.  Although one derivation of the proposed exemption argues for an exemption only ""during the period of lawful access,"" 153  others are not so limited.  154  These expansive derivations would preclude  copyright owners from pursuing ""use-facilitating"" distribution models that would replicate shortterm loan or rental of works at a less expensive price than outright sale of the entire work. As the House Manager's Report stated, ""[i]n assessing the impact of the implementation of technological measures, and of the law against their circumvention, the rulemaking proceedings should consider the positive as well as the adverse effects of these technologies on the availability of copyrighted materials. . . . These technological measures may make more works more widely available, and the process of obtaining permission easier."" The Report noted that, for example, ""[t]echnological measures are also essential to a distribution strategy that allows a consumer to purchase a copy of a  153 154  C28(5)(i) C30(7)   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 92  single article from an electronic database, rather than having to pay more for a subscription to a journal containing many articles the consumer does not want."" 155  Not only would the proposed exemption invariably limit the alternatives available to users and consumers of copyrighted works, but it would also most likely increase the prices. No longer could a copyright owner allow time-limited or scope-limited access to works at a portion of the sale price. All loans, rentals, or conditional access would be required to be priced the same as the full sale price of the work, since users would be free to circumvent the access controls that enforced the limitations as to time or scope.  In the final analysis, however, the requested exemption must be denied because proponents of this exemption have failed to identify a ""particular class of works,""156 have failed to specify  155 156  House Manager's Report at 6-7.  As the Register concluded in the previous rulemaking with respect to the same proposed class, in an analysis equally applicable to the current proposal: ""First, none of the proposals adequately define a `class' of the type this rulemaking allows the Librarian to exempt. As discussed above in Section III.A.3, `a particular class of work' must be determined primarily by reference to qualities of the work itself. It cannot be defined by reference to the class of users or uses of the work, as these proposals suggest. Second, although the commenters have persuasively articulated their fears about how these business models will develop and affect their ability to engage in noninfringing uses, they have not made the case that these fears are now being realized, or that they are likely be realized in the next three years."" 65 FR at 64573.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 93  particular access controls that have caused adverse effects on noninfringing uses, and have failed to describe what noninfringing uses have been adversely affected. This rulemaking proceeding is not a forum for arguments of pure policy. Any exemption must be based on a factual showing by its proponents. Proponents of this ""class"" did not even make the attempt. 5. Proposed class: Copies of audiovisual works, including motion pictures, and phonorecords of musical sound recordings that have been previously licensed for reproduction but can no longer be reproduced for private performance after the lawful conditions for prior reproduction have been met. In contrast to most of the proponents of an exemption for ""any work to which the user had lawful initial access"" and its variations, one proponent did provide some specificity, and at least arguably formulated a ""particular class of works."" The class, identified above, was proposed by a commenter seeking an exemption to permit persons who have obtained digital copies of motion pictures or sound recordings, under agreements that limit the circumstances (typically, a time limitation) under which they may view or hear them, to circumvent access controls that enforce those agreements.157  The examples cited by the commenter relate primarily to online services that deliver music or movies to subscribers under an agreement that permits the subscriber to obtain access to the work only so long as the subscriber continues to subscribe to the service. 158  The commenter also refers to  an announced new product that would permit time-limited access to motion pictures on DVDs by  157 158  C30(1). See C30, pp. 3-4 (citing pressplay, Musicnet, and Movielink).   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 94  treating the DVD with a ""Reading Inhibit Agent"" that is activated when the DVD is first removed from its package and that causes the DVD to be unplayable after a certain period of time. 159  The proponent of this exemption states the question as follows: ""The fundamental question here is whether the Copyright Act gives copyright holders the right to destroy or render unusable lawfully made copies or phonorecords belonging to others. The answer, clearly, is `no'."" 160  The  commenter seeks to exempt such works from the prohibition on circumvention so that users of such works would be able to continue to play them even when the agreed-on conditions for their use no longer apply.  In reality, this proposal appears to be a variation on the proposed class of ""any work to which the user had lawful initial access,"" reworked in an attempt to comply with the requirements for stating a ""particular class"" and supported by some examples of actual instances where technological measures have cut off access to works for which access was initially granted.  The Register is skeptical whether the commenter has in fact stated a ""particular class of copyrighted works."" In an effort to meet the requirements of a ""particular class,"" he has limited the proposed class to audiovisual works and sound recordings, two section 102 categories of works, that have access controls that are activated under certain circumstances. However, the fact that the class  159 160  Id., p. 4. C 30(1), p. 4.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 95  appears in reality to be defined by the use that (1) is intended by the user and (2) activates the access control, is troublesome and raises the question whether this is, in reality, a use-based exemption. Moreover, although the proponent has chosen to limit the proposed class to a subset of two section 102 categories, the situation that his proposal addresses is one that in principle can occur, and most likely in reality does occur, with respect to most or all categories of works. Just as the proposal to exempt ""any work to which the user had lawful initial access"" failed to state a ""particular class,"" in substance if not in form this reformulation may suffer from the same shortcomings.  Because there are other grounds to reject this class, the Register declines to determine whether a ""particular class"" has in fact been proposed in this case.  The proponent asserts that an exemption for this class is necessary in order to permit the noninfringing use of private performance. It is, of course, true that a private performance is, in general, noninfringing. What the proponent appears to ignore is that it appears that in the cases which the proponent has raised, the performance probably would be unlawful, since it appears that in each case the user would be performing the work in violation of a term of the agreement he entered into in order to gain access to the work in the first place. Although the version of 1201 approved by the House Commerce Committee would have permitted an exemption from the prohibition on circumvention only in order to permit ""lawful uses"" 161   and therefore probably would  have required rejection of this proposed exemption because it seeks to enable unlawful, albeit  161  Commerce Committee Report at 3.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 96  noninfringing, uses  1201 as enacted requires that the inquiry focus on ""noninfringing uses."" Therefore, it appears that the proposal has passed this threshold.  The Register reaches a different conclusion, however, with respect to the substantiality of the adverse effect on noninfringing uses. The Register cannot place a high value  or, indeed, any value at all  on the desire of someone to get more than he bargained for. A consumer who enters into an agreement to pay a particular sum for the right to listen to or view a copyrighted work for a limited period of time can have no reasonable expectation of continued access once that time has expired. Just as a person who rents a video has no right to continue possession and use of that video once the rental period has expired, a person who knowingly purchases a DVD that is designed  and priced  to last for only a few days (perhaps as long as the typical video rental) cannot complain when the DVD is no longer viewable after that time has expired. A person who subscribes to an internet music service and agrees that he will have access to the digital phonorecords he receives only as long as his subscription is current has no right to complain if he no longer has access once the subscription expires.  The calculus might be different if there were evidence that we are living in a ""pay-per-use"" world. But the record in this proceeding does not offer any indication that we are approaching such a world.162 To the contrary, the works that are the subject of this proposed exemption  motion  In this respect, the situation does not seem to have changed significantly since the last rulemaking, where the Register observed that ""The record in this proceeding does not reveal that `pay-per-use' business models have, thus far, created the adverse impacts on the ability of users to make noninfringing uses of copyrighted works that would justify any exemptions from the prohibition on circumvention. If such adverse impacts occur in the future,  162   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 97  pictures and sound recordings  are widely available for purchase in formats (CDs, DVDs, videocassettes and, recently, downloads of phonorecords) that have no time restrictions on use.  In fact, as noted in the immediately preceding section, the types of services that are the targets of this proposed exemption are exactly the type of ""use-facilitating"" services that the DMCA was enacted, in part, to encourage. As the legislative history relates, ""an access control technology under section 1201(a) would not necessarily prevent access to a work altogether, but could be designed to allow access during a limited time period, such as during a period of library borrowing. Technological measures are also essential to a distribution strategy that allows a consumer to purchase a copy of a single article from an electronic database, rather than having to pay more for a subscription to a journal containing many articles the consumer does not want.""163  The Register cannot see how users of copyrighted works could be adversely affected by the offering of differentiated services. On-line service offerings do not place users in a ""take-it-orleave-it"" negotiating position, but add to the users' options in ways that were not available at the time the DMCA was enacted.  The Register's recommendation is consistent with, and based on, the factors in 1201(a)(1)(C). First, with respect to the exemption's impact on availability for use, motion pictures and sound recordings are widely available in a variety of formats. It is likely that the  they can be addressed in a future rulemaking proceeding."" 65 FR at 64564. 163  House Manager's Report, at 7.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 98  proposed exemption would actually decrease the variety of means in which these works are made available. Copyright owners would hesitate to continue offering such works for transmission on the Internet if they could not be assured that they could rely on the technological measures used to protect various business models. No impact on nonprofit archival, preservation, and educational uses or criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research has been alleged. The proposed exemption probably would have an adverse effect on the market for or value of copyrighted works, for the reasons outlined above. It could easily eliminate the market for conditional downloads and thus would negatively affect the variety of options in the market for copyrighted works.  6.  Proposed class: ""Thin copyright"" works As in the previous rulemaking, the AAU proposed an exemption of a class of works  consisting of ""thin copyright works.""  164  This proposal suffers from the same flaws as the proposals  to exempt classes such as ""fair use works."" Although it was stated that these ""thin copyright"" works contain ""limited copyrighted subject material,"" there was no showing of any present or likely harm to users wishing to engage in noninfringing uses. While the ""class"" of works was narrowed, in one derivation, to certain types of works ""most often"" used in the educational environment, there was no showing that any such works were unavailable in an alternative, unprotected format. In fact, it seems likely that many of these works are currently available in unprotected formats, e.g., encyclopedias, dictionaries and newspapers. Without any allegation of an adverse effect during the relevant threeyear period, any specific allegation of any particular technological measure protecting access to  164  C28(3) &(4).   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 99  works, or any discussion of the unavailability of the material cited in unprotected formats, there is little basis for consideration of this proposal by the Register. Circumstantially, it is informative to note that no evidence was presented that the fears anticipated during the previous three-year period have materialized.  7.  Proposed class: Public domain works or works distributed without restriction. This formulation of the proposed class takes into consideration several comments which  made essentially the same proposal, seeking an exemption for works that are either public domain, open source or ""open access,"" but to which access controls are applied.165 Aside from the proposal relating to public domain material on DVDs (discussed below), there was a paucity of information related to other public domain works. The commenters addressing open source and open access works provided absolutely no information in support of their requests. Of the few commenters addressing public domain works, only one cited even a few ebooks, e.g., Robert Lewis Stevenson's Treasure Island and collected poems of Keats and Whitman, that contained some use restrictions. 166  What the comments relating to public domain works appear to have overlooked is that if a work that is entirely in the public domain is protected by an access control measure, the prohibition on circumvention will not be applicable. Section 1201 only applies to ""a work protected under this title"" [title 17]. A wholly public domain work is, therefore, no longer protected under title 17 and any protection measures on such a work do not implicate section 1201(a)(1). While a wholly public  165 166  C2, C3, C14(1), C22, and C35(4). C14(1).   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 100  domain work is not protected by copyright and also, therefore, is not protected by section 1201, there is nothing that precludes one from placing a technological access or use control on a public domain work. When a work enters the public domain, there is no affirmative obligation for an author, publisher or distributor to offer free access to that public domain work. The author, publisher or distributor is simply precluded from claiming copyright on a public domain work and is precluded from using section 1201(a)(1) from prevent circumvention of technological protection measures placed on a public domain work. If the works at issue are, as the commenter states, public domain works without any new original authorship, then neither section 106 nor section 1201 apply and no exemption is necessary.  Moreover, there is considerable doubt whether the Librarian has the power to grant an exemption the sole purpose of which is to enable ""noninfringing"" uses of public domain works. The purpose of this rulemaking is to determine whether the prohibition on circumvention has adversely affected users ""in their ability to make noninfringing uses under this title of a particular class of copyrighted works."" (Emphasis added.) Because public domain works are not copyrighted works, it does not appear that adverse effects on users' abilities to use public domain works can be considered. 167  Even if such adverse effects could be considered, however, proponents of an exemption have not made their case. It is, of course, possible that a public domain work may exist side-by-side with copyrighted material, e.g., on a CD-ROM, and that access controls may be applied to all the content Of course, since a public domain work cannot be infringed, all uses of such works will be noninfringing. 167   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 101  on the medium. But outside of the context of motion pictures on DVDs, (discussed below), the proponents of a ""public domain"" exemption did not address that scenario, and if an exemption had been sought for that scenario, further information would be required. For example, is an access control preventing these uses? Are the public domain works in question available in other nonprotected formats? Even assuming that the cases cited in support of a ""public domain"" exemption were to establish that the cited works were bundled with copyrighted works and protected by access controls, the works of Stevenson, Whitman and Keats are all currently available in alternative nonprotected formats. As long as this is the case, noninfringing uses appear to be unaffected by the prohibition on circumvention. Although the ""digital"" version of a work may prevent certain noninfringing uses of that particular copy, that fact alone does not justify an exemption if other versions are unrestricted. Unless one can show that a particular noninfringing use can only be accomplished by using the digital version, the existence of a public domain or other work in alternative, unprotected formats provides a safety valve for noninfringing uses. Users should recognize that works in digital formats may be protected by the copyright owner differently than hard copy or analog versions of the same works and should consider this in making their purchasing decisions.  In the DVD context, proponent Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) provided a series of lists of audiovisual works that EFF contended are in the public domain, some of which EFF alleged are distributed bundled with copyrighted material. 168  However, opponents of the proposed exception  indicated that many if not all the works named by the proponent are available in unencrypted (VHS)  168  C35(4), TGwen Hinze, May 15, 2003, p. 155-56, PHR Gwen Hinze, EFF.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 102  format, are not bundled with copyrighted material, are themselves still subject to copyright protection, or are not encrypted by the Content Scrambling System (""CSS"") or otherwise subject to an access control.169  Thus, in the final analysis, as with the other categories of works, proponents have provided virtually no examples of public domain audiovisual works that are protected by access controls and not otherwise available. There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that any problem exists and at most, to the extent that any problem might exist, the record leads to the conclusion that it is not more than de minimis.  8.  Proposed class: Musical works, sound recordings, and audiovisual works embodied in media that are or may become inaccessible by possessors of lawfully-made copies due to malfunction, damage, or obsoleteness. Most of the commenters proposing this class or some variant of it concentrated their factual  discussion on musical works and/or sound recordings.  170  However, two commenters  171  specifically  addressed backup copies of audiovisual works on DVDs subject to access controls.  With respect to musical works and sound recordings, the comments indicate that the proponents of the exception want to be able to transfer sound recordings and musical works from  R23, T Steven Metalitz, May 15, 2003, p. 187; PHR Steve Metalitz, Joint Reply Commenters. 170 171  169  C4, C6, C39(1), C48, and C49. C47 and R21.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 103  one medium to another. Some commenters also believe that they should be able to convert these works to new or different formats or to back up the works for archival purposes, e.g., to ""refresh"" the media from time to time to ensure that the works are available both for their use and for future generations.172  However, these proponents have not clearly stated or demonstrated that access controls are preventing these activities. Compact discs rarely if ever are protected by access controls. 173  Concerns about the practical difficulties or the copyright implications of copying works in order to achieve interoperability with new devices are not within the scope of this rulemaking unless there is a technological measure protecting access to the work. Because many commenters failed to identify any particular work protected by an access control, it is impossible to determine how the alleged problem fits into this rulemaking.  The case made for audiovisual works on DVDs is entirely different. The Content Scrambling System, commonly known as CSS, has been identified as the particular access control protected by the prohibition against circumvention. This encryption renders DVDs unplayable in a device without corresponding decryption technology.174 172 173  See C4, C6, C48, and C49.  See the discussion below of rejected class no. 18 (""Published sound recordings of musical works on compact discs that use technological measures that prevent access on certain playback devices""). In Universal City Studios v. Corley, 273 F.3d 429 (2d. Cir. 2001), the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit described CSS as follows: ""The movie studios were reluctant to release movies in digital 174   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 104  form until they were confident they had in place adequate safeguards against piracy of their copyrighted movies. The studios took several steps to minimize the piracy threat. First, they settled on the DVD as the standard digital medium for home distribution of movies. The studios then sought an encryption scheme to protect movies on DVDs. They enlisted the help of members of the consumer electronics and computer industries, who in mid-1996 developed the Content Scramble System (`CSS'). CSS is an encryption scheme that employs an algorithm configured by a set of `keys' to encrypt a DVD's contents. The algorithm is a type of mathematical formula for transforming the contents of the movie file into gibberish; the `keys' are in actuality strings of 0's and 1's that serve as values for the mathematical formula. Decryption in the case of CSS requires a set of `player keys' contained in compliant DVD players, as well as an understanding of the CSS encryption algorithm. Without the player keys and the algorithm, a DVD player cannot access the contents of a DVD. With the player keys and the algorithm, a DVD player can display the movie on a television or a computer screen, but does not give a viewer the ability to use the copy function of the computer to copy the movie or to manipulate the digital content of the DVD. ""The studios developed a licensing scheme for distributing the technology to manufacturers of DVD players. Player keys and other information necessary to the CSS scheme were given to manufacturers of DVD players for an administrative fee. In exchange for the licenses, manufacturers were obliged to keep the player keys confidential. Manufacturers were also required in the licensing agreement to prevent the transmission of `CSS data' (a term undefined in the licensing agreement) from a DVD drive to any `internal recording device,' including, presumably, a computer hard drive. ""With encryption technology and licensing agreements in hand, the studios began releasing movies on DVDs in 1997, and DVDs quickly gained in popularity, becoming a significant source of studio revenue. [Footnote: By the end of 1997, most if not all DVDs that were released were encrypted with CSS. Moreover, DVD players were projected to be in ten percent of United States homes by the end of 2000. In fact, as of 2000, about thirty-five percent of one studio's worldwide revenue from movie distribution was attributable to DVD sales and rentals.] In 1998, the studios   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 105  The proponents of this exemption desire to make backup copies of their DVDs for a variety of purposes: they claim that DVDs are inherently fragile and subject to damage; they are concerned about loss or theft of the original during travel; they wish to duplicate collections to avoid the burdens and risks of transporting DVDs; they assert that some titles are out of print and cannot be replaced in case of damage; and they claim that the duration of a DVD's lifespan is limited. 175  Since there is no question that many DVDs are currently distributed with CSS as a technological measure protecting access to the works contained on the medium and because the comments and testimony have established that a significant number of users say they have been experiencing problems with DVDs, the inquiry must examine the nature of these problems to determine whether the prohibition is adversely affecting noninfringing uses. The common denominator in all of the comments endorsing an exemption for DVDs appears to be the need to make backups of the original copy due to the alleged fragility of the medium. The question therefore becomes whether making a backup copy of a DVD is a noninfringing use.  secured added protection against DVD piracy when Congress passed the DMCA, which prohibits the development or use of technology designed to circumvent a technological protection measure, such as CSS. The pertinent provisions of the DMCA are examined in greater detail below."" 273 F.3d at 436-37. 175  See R21 and T Robert Moore, May 2, 2003, p. 18 et seq.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 106  The creation of a backup copy of a work implicates the reproduction right. While the Copyright Act contains an exception for the making of backup copies of computer programs in 117, it contains no comparable exemption for motion pictures and other audiovisual works. In addition, the Register is aware of only one court decision that has held that reproducing a copyrighted motion picture is a fair use: where an over-the-air broadcast was taped for purposes of time-shifting the user's viewing of the work.176 In the time-shifting case, the Court explicitly did not address the issue of librarying such a work, and this rulemaking is not the forum in which to break new ground on the scope of fair use. The proponents of an exemption bear the burden of proving that their intended use is a noninfringing one. No proponent has offered a fair use analysis or supporting authority which would allow the Register to consider such a basis for the exemption, and the Register is skeptical of the merits of such an argument.  DVDs, of course, are not indestructible. Neither were traditional phonograph records; nor are CDs, videotapes, paperback books, or any other medium in which copyrighted works may be distributed. The Register is not persuaded that proponents of this exemption have shown that DVDs are so susceptible to damage and deterioration that a convincing case could be made that the practice of making preventive backup copies of audiovisual works on DVDs should be noninfringing.  The proposed exemption is not simply to permit remedial measures for disks which become damaged, but rather to allow reproduction of the works as a precautionary measure. While an analogy might be made to the basis for the backup exemption for computer programs that was  176  Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.S. 417 (1984).   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 107  enacted in the days of corruptible floppy diskettes, there are important differences. Congress carefully addressed the 117 exemption for backups of computer programs with restrictive conditions. One day Congress may choose to consider a carefully tailored exception for backing up motion pictures if it is persuaded that one is necessary, but the Register sees no authority under current law that would justify an exemption to enable the making of backup copies of motion pictures on DVDs. Given the tremendous commercial appeal of the DVD format at a time when alternative analog formats still exist, it seems unlikely that now is the time. And while it may well be true that analog formats are headed for ultimate extinction, the market is already beginning to see evidence of alternative forms of digital delivery over the Internet. The decision to purchase a DVD format entails advantages and, perhaps, disadvantages for some. The purchase of a work in that particular format is not, at present, a necessity and DVDs are unlikely to become the only format in which motion pictures may be purchased. The record in this rulemaking does not establish that the potential for possible future harm to individual disks outweighs the potential harm to the market for or value of these works that would result if an exemption were granted. The unauthorized reproduction of DVDs is already a critical problem facing the motion picture industry. Creating an exemption to satisfy the concern that a DVD may become damaged would sanction widespread circumvention to facilitate reproduction for works that are currently functioning properly. As presented in this rulemaking, the exemption would be based on speculation of future failure. Even though certain copies of DVDs may be damaged, given the ready availability of replacements in the market at reasonable costs, on balance, an exemption is not warranted on the current record.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 108  The opponents have provided strong evidence of the increasing popularity of the DVD format.177 The Register finds it difficult to imagine that a format that is fundamentally flawed would become so popular. Similarly, it is difficult to imagine how a business model of renting DVDs, which also appears to be thriving, could be viable if the medium were so fragile. Further, it is significant that the scope of the problem the proponents describe is limited to movies on DVDs and does not address other types of works which commonly employ DVDs, such as video games. All these facts lead to the conclusion that, on the current record, DVDs are not unusually subject to damage in the ordinary course of their use. To the extent that some commenters found it more convenient to travel with backups or keep backups of their works in multiple locations, e.g., vacation homes or cars, the prevention of such uses appears to represent an inconvenience rather than an adverse effect on noninfringing uses. Indeed, the Register is aware of no authority that such uses are noninfringing. To endorse such uses as noninfringing would be tantamount to sanctioning reproductions of all works in every physical location where a user would like to use the work, e.g., the purchase of one book would entitle the user to reproduce copies for multiple locations. Except where a case-by-case analysis reveals such reproduction to be noninfringing under 107 or some other specific exemption, such reproductions of convenience are infringing under the Copyright Act. Neither the fear of malfunction or damage nor the conveniences enabled by backups satisfy the requirement that the intended use be a noninfringing one.  177  See, T Shira Perlmutter, May 2, 2003, p. 52; T Dean Marks, May 15, 2003, p. 42.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 109  9.  Proposed class: Audiovisual works released on DVD that contain access control measures that interfere with the ability to defeat technology that prevents users from skipping promotional materials. This class as put forth by its proponent would encompass all access controls that interfere  with private performance, including the ability to skip promotional material,178 but the substance of the comment addresses only unskippable promotional materials. As the proponent succinctly states the problem, ""Movie studios are able to make certain DVD content `unskippable' during playback. Some studios have abused this feature by preventing the skipping of advertising shown prior to the start of the feature presentation.""179  Since no one asserts that the technology which deactivates the fast-forward function of DVD players (UOP  or user operation  blocking) is an access control (and, therefore, the 1201(a)(1) prohibition would not extend to circumvention of the UOP blocking feature)  the only measure which might implicate the prohibition is CSS. Therefore, the central question is: must CSS be circumvented in order to disable the UOP blocking on a DVD or on the player?  Although the disabling of the fast forward function is clearly upsetting to some consumers, it is not, on its own, an access control within the meaning of subsection 1201(a). The users gain access to the work without the application of any information, process, or treatment they simply  178 179  C35(3). C35, p. 25.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 110  have to wait for the promotional material to run its course.  180  However, the proponents argue that  defeating the UOP block cannot be accomplished without the prerequisite step of circumventing CSS. Thus, they would require an exception to circumvent CSS in order to reactivate the fast forwarding function of their DVD players.  Of course, if the UOP block can be defeated without circumventing CSS, no exemption is needed as the UOP block is not an access control protected by 1201(a)(1). On the record established, the Register must conclude that it is not necessary to circumvent CSS in order to disable or bypass the technology that prevents fast forwarding through the promotional material on DVDs. No one has proved that circumvention is necessary and from the evidence in the record it appears that it is technologically possible to re-enable the fast forwarding functions of a player without circumventing CSS. 181  Section 1201(a)(3)(B) provides: ""a technological measure `effectively controls access to a work' if the measure, in the ordinary course of its operation, requires the application of information, or a process or a treatment, with the authority of the copyright owner, to gain access to the work."" One commenter asserts that ""for all practical purposes"" one must circumvent the CSS, but also admits that the controls on the player may be bypassed without circumventing CSS (PHR Robert Moore, 321 Studios). Two other witnesses assert that CSS need not be circumvented (PHR Bruce Turnbull, DVD CCA; PHR Dean Marks, AOL Time Warner), and the chief proponent of the exception admits uncertainty on this point (PHR Gwen Hinze, EFF). 181  180   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 111  In response to a post-hearing question on this issue,  182  there was generally unanimity that the  fast-forwarding function can be disabled without circumventing CSS. AOL Time Warner's response stated that while AOL Time Warner's works do not limit fast forwarding, it is their understanding that this functionality can be restored without circumventing CSS. Association's (DVD CCA) reply to a related question 184 183  The DVD Copy Control  stated that the CSS license has no  requirement that relates to this particular function and that it is the understanding of the DVD CCA that ""there would be no effect on the CSS-related performance of a DVD playback system or DVD disc due to modification of a playback system to ignore the UOP blocking commands.""185 The Joint Reply Commenters' answer to the latter question was similar,186 stating that, to the best of the commenters' knowledge, it was technologically possible to modify a licensed DVD player to ignore the UOP functions. The reply added that because the navigational functions of a DVD are not encrypted and are unrelated to the CSS license, they are not aware of any way in which such enabling of the UOP functionality would impact the performance of a CSS-encrypted DVD other  ""Can the disabling of the fast-forward function or the UOP blocking commands of a DVD be reversed or altered, thus reactivating the fast-forward function, without decrypting CSS?"" 183 184  182  PHR Dean Marks, AOL Time Warner, p. 2.

Please explain fully."" 185 186  PHR Bruce Turnbull, DVD CCA, p. 5.

The Joint Reply Commenters also stated that in their view, such a modification would have no effect on the legal status of the performance of a motion picture on a DVD under either  1201(a)(1) or under  106. 187  The post-hearing response from the  Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) stated that even if the UOP function were not encrypted, it would not be possible to alter these functions on the DVD since such discs are distributed as ""read only."" Yet, EFF stated that it is possible to modify a DVD player to ignore the fast-forwarding restriction without violating  1201(a)(1) as long as this restriction was not encrypted within CSS. Since it has been unrebutted in the record that UOP blocking is not encrypted within CSS and that enabling navigational functionality in a player does not violate the prohibition on circumvention, it appears that the intended use can be accomplished without circumvention of CSS.  321 Studios' post hearing response provides additional, albeit qualified, support for the conclusion that it is technologically possible to enable the fast-forwarding capability by modifying a DVD player. 188  While 321 Studios corroborated EFF's statement that the DVD disc itself cannot be  modified (without the additional act of reproducing the disc and deleting the UOP directive on the copy  a function performed by software marketed by 321 Studios), 321 Studios agreed that it is theoretically possible to modify a DVD player to ignore the UOP blocking. 321 Studios added, however, that this is not practical for users since ""such a modification would require a substantial reverse engineering effort.""189  187 188 189  Id. PHR Robert Moore, 321 Studios, p. 5-6.  Id. It is worth noting that 321 Studios has an interest in asserting that users have to copy the DVD itself, and circumvent CSS in doing so, rather than modify their players,   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 113  While the record in this rulemaking is not as clear as the Register would like it to be, the Register concludes that technological modification of a DVD player to ignore or bypass navigational blocks such as fast forwarding can be accomplished without circumventing CSS. Since this noninfringing use can be accommodated without an exemption and is therefore not adversely affected by the prohibition, the Register finds that an exemption is unwarranted.  Even if it were not possible to disable the UOP block without also circumventing CSS, an exemption for this particular use would not be warranted. Even though a quantitatively substantial number of commenters (over 20 percent of those submitting comments) expressed annoyance with being prevented from fast forwarding through advertising material, it did not amount to a qualitatively significant adverse effect. At most, being forced to play (not necessarily watch) the promotional material constituted no more than a mere inconvenience for users in possession of such works. 190  While such fast forwarding could be reasonably assumed to be a noninfringing use, simply  showing that any noninfringing use is adversely affected is not determinative. At a minimum, the adverse effect on the noninfringing use must be more than de minimis and more than a mere inconvenience.  because the software marketed by 321 Studios (potentially in violation of 1201(a)(2) or 1201(b)), or both) facilitates the former act. It is also relevant to note that there was no evidence produced what percentage of DVDs contain this UOP blocking function, but proponents certainly failed to indicate that the practice is widespread or even common. At least one studio asserted that it has never used this function on any release. The scope of the use of this function by other studios is unclear, but to the extent that consumers dislike this feature, the market is likely to affect its continued implementation. 190   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 114  Although the Register understands the proponents' objections to DVDs which have the fast forward feature disabled, she will not recommend an exemption based on a showing of de minimis inconvenience. This decision is reinforced by an application of the four 1201(a)(1)(C) factors. Because the only access control alleged to be involved is CSS, granting an exemption presumably would permit circumvention of CSS.191 The Register has rejected exemptions that would permit circumvention of CSS in the past 192  and, elsewhere in this recommendation, she continues to reject  such exemptions. Granting an exemption in this context would not in any way increase the availability of copyrighted works. The Register can discern no impact on nonprofit archival, preservation, and educational uses or on criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. And motion picture studios were willing to distribute copies of motion pictures in the DVD format in part because of the protection offered by CSS. 193  Permitting circumvention of CSS  could, therefore, have a negative impact on the market for or value of motion pictures on DVDs, since motion picture studios might have a reduced incentive to utilize that format.  In sum, the adverse effects on the noninfringing use must be balanced with the effect of circumvention on the market for or value of the copyrighted works. Where the harm is a mere inconvenience experienced with an unknown  but apparently small  quantity of available DVD titles and an exemption might entail allowing circumvention of the access control contained on a  This, of course, is not necessarily the case, since it has not been established that it is necessary to circumvent CSS to disable UOP blocking. But for purposes of the following analysis, the Register assumes that is the case. 192 193  191  65 FR at 64567-70.

The benefit to users is the avoidance of a mere inconvenience. The harm, on the other hand, would be to threaten the security of the DVD format. This would seem to be an instance far better suited to a marketplace solution than an exception to broad statutory protection. Finally, as noted above, it appears likely, although not certain, that it is not necessary to violate the prohibition against circumvention in order to disable UOP blocking. For these reasons, the Register does not recommend an exemption.  10.  Proposed class: Ancillary audiovisual works distributed on DVDs encrypted by CSS. This is a slight rewording of an exception proposed and advanced primarily by one  commenter,194 although at least one other commenter proposed a somewhat similar class.  195  As discussed above, CSS is an access control as that term is defined in subsection 1201(a). In addition to the evidence presented, it is virtually uncontested that there are ancillary works on DVDs that are not available in another, unprotected format. 196  As the Register explained in the  previous rulemaking, such ancillary material includes ""matter that is available along with the motion picture in DVD format but not available in videotape format, such as outtakes, interviews with actors and directors, additional language features, etc.""197  194 195 196 197  C21.

C21 and R23. 65 FR at 64568 n.13.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 116  The proponent of an ""ancillary works"" exemption asserts that the use of CSS on DVDs reduces the availability of ancillary audiovisual works for nonprofit archival, preservation and educational purposes, but offers no facts to support the assertion. His primary point, however, is that CSS prevents ""quotation, for purposes of commentary and criticism, of ancillary audiovisual works."" 198  ""Quotation"" in this context means reproduction of portions of the ancillary audiovisual  material, in particular by reviewers who post their reviews of motion pictures and ancillary materials on websites.199  There is little doubt that the desired use for comment and criticism by weblog critics can be within the fair use exception.200 It is conceded by the key proponent of this exception that users, nonetheless, have the ability to make copies of these works by circumventing the Macrovision copy control protection to record the analog output of DVD players.201 The record also indicates that analog copies can be made by using digital camcorders to record the rendering of these works on an ordinary television screen.202 Because users already have access to an analog copy of the work, they have the ability to engage in the desired activity. Nonetheless, the proponents of this exception seek the ability to circumvent CSS so as to be able to use direct digital-to-digital copies of the work for  198 199 200  C21, p. 9. See C21, p. 14.  Of course, the specifics of each case, such as the length of the portion of the work that is copied and the need to copy that amount in relation to the purpose, can alter the outcome of the fair use analysis. 201 202  C21.

They assert that the improved quality of the picture and sound is constitutionally mandated and is particularly desirable for connoisseurs of motion pictures.203  Existing case law is clear that there is ""no authority for the proposition that fair use, as protected by the Copyright Act, much less the Constitution, guarantees copying by the optimum method or in the identical format of the original."" 204  That is not to say that the proposed use is  necessarily infringing. Indeed, the use of direct digital-to-digital copies described in these comments may well constitute fair use.  In the three years since the last rulemaking, the availability of DVDs and their ancillary audiovisual works has increased dramatically. 205  Many factors are likely to have combined to  generate that trend. There is little doubt that the prohibition on circumvention has contributed to rightholders' confidence in the security of the DVD format and that such confidence has been a factor in the increased availability of works in that format. Fears of piracy of works in digital format are not hypothetical  the scope of that problem is the subject of extensive public discussion and is frequently reported in major media.  The balance of interests pits the incremental benefit of improved sound and picture quality of ancillary material for purposes of comment and criticism against the risks of increased unauthorized  203 204 205  T Ernest Miller, May 15, 2003, p. 170, 201 et seq.

R23.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 118  reproduction and distribution of all of the material on DVDs. In addition, there was little specific evidence of why this material was required to be reproduced in enhanced digital format in order to comment or criticize. Without such a showing of verifiable need for this format and the specific types of works for which such comment or criticism is needed, the commenters present a balance of interests with little substance. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has concluded, ""Fair use has never been held to be a guarantee of access to copyrighted material in order to copy it by the fair user's preferred technique or in the format of the original."" 206  Fair use allows  reproduction of an amount, both quantitatively and qualitatively, necessary to achieve the purpose of the use. While it is true that CSS prevents digital reproduction through a digital output and therefore may prevent some fair uses, without specific information about why this digital content is necessary for the purpose, without information about what type of audiovisual or ancillary work is needed for this purpose, and without specific information about the purpose and character of the use, it is impossible to assess the merits of the proposal. Even with that information, the harm to the potential market for or value of these works would have to be considered. Given the risks of unauthorized reproduction and distribution over the Internet, it is obvious that a compelling case would have to be made in order to outweigh the potential adverse effects.  A review of the factors set forth in 1201(a)(1)(C) confirms that the case has not been made for an exemption. While it appears to be true that many of the ancillary works in question are available only in the DVD format, they likely would not exist at all but for that format, due both to  206  Corley, 273 F.3d at 459.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 119  its greater storage capacity over VHS tapes and the greater security it offers. As the Register noted in the previous rulemaking:  [T]his ancillary material traditionally has not been available in copies for distribution to the general public, and it appears that it is only with the advent of the DVD format that motion picture producers have been willing or able to include such material along with copies of the motion pictures themselves. Because of this and because motion picture producers are generally unwilling to release their works in DVD format unless they are protected by access control measures, it cannot be said that enforcing section 1201(a)(1) would, in the words of the Commerce Committee, result ""in less access, rather than more, to copyrighted materials that are important to education, scholarship, and other socially vital endeavors."" See Commerce Comm. Report, at 35. Thus, it appears that the availability of access control measures has resulted in greater availability of these materials.207 As noted, apart from a bald assertion of harm, no case has been made that the availability for use of ancillary works for nonprofit archival, preservation, and educational purposes has been adversely affected. While the proponents have demonstrated inconvenience with respect to some uses involving criticism and comment, the Register's analysis has shown that acceptable alternatives exist to permit ""quotation"" by those who wish to review such material. Finally, permitting circumvention of CSS in order to enable digital ""quotation"" would be likely to have an adverse effect on the availability of such works on DVDs to the public. As noted above, the motion picture industry's willingness to make audiovisual works available in digital form on DVDs is based in part on the confidence it has that CSS will protect it against massive infringement. Encouraging circumvention of CSS even for laudable goals threatens to undermine that confidence.  207  65 FR at 64568 fn. 13.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 120  Given the vague benefit and the much clearer large potential harm, the Register believes that the equities weigh against the proposed exemption.  11.  Proposed class: Audiovisual works stored on DVDs that are not available in Region 1 DVD format and access to which is prevented by technological measures. An exemption for this class of works was proposed by several commenters,208 although this  particular formulation, which articulated the issue presented by the comments collectively, was proposed by a single commenter.209 Additionally, there were over one hundred reply comments received in this rulemaking in support of the proposed exception. 210  Implicit in the proposed class is either the assumption that region coding is an access control or the assumption that it is necessary to circumvent an access control (CSS) in order to disable the region coding. Since the Register previously concluded that region coding is an access control, 211  and since motion picture studios who use region coding and oppose the exemption appear to agree that it is an access control 212   there is no reason to consider whether access to the region coding  function itself is blocked by CSS.  208 209 210 211 212  See C15(1), C17, C35(2), and C36. See C35(2). See C83-203. 65 FR at 64569. See R23, pp. 25-27, R19, p.10.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 121  There are two components to the region coding system  the region code flag on a DVD and the region code check conducted by a licensed DVD player. The region code check performed by a licensed player is designed to prevent the player from rendering the content of a DVD unless the correct region code flag is found on that DVD. In the ordinary course of its operation, the process of applying the flag to the region code check results in access being granted where the region of the disc matches the region of the player. 213  It is uncontested that merely watching a lawfully obtained copy of a non-region 1 DVD is a noninfringing use.214 So, the next step in the analysis is to consider whether the proponents have demonstrated that the prohibition is adversely affecting this noninfringing use.  The comments contain reference to a new type of region coding, namely enhanced region coding. The evidence is that to the limited extent this technology is used to protect DVDs, it is only used on region 1 DVDs, which U.S. viewers need not circumvent to have access to the work, as licensed players sold in the U.S. are set to region 1. Therefore, it does not appear to be relevant to this rulemaking, which is concerned only with impacts in the United States. Moreover, the purpose of enhanced region coding is to prevent the playback of single region coded DVDs on multi-region players. Persons with multi-region players are able to watch non-region 1 DVDs, but multi-region players appear to violate the prohibition on circumvention. They are, however, widely available in the online marketplace, and there is no indication that copyright owners or others have made any efforts to stop their distribution or use. Persons who use multi-region players to watch non-region 1 DVDs probably would be circumventing a technological protection measure that prevents access. When enhanced region coding is employed, a person with a multi-region player would not be able to view region 1 DVDs. See PHR Steve Metalitz, Joint Reply Commenters., Aug. 5, 2003; PHR Bruce Turnbull, DVD CCA. Those comments note that a public performance of the work could be infringing. This is not the type of activity in which the proponents have asserted an adverse effect. Accordingly, the analysis of this proposed exception is based upon a model of private viewing. 214  213   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 122  In the course of this rulemaking, the Office received more comments on this proposed exception than any other. As already noted, over one hundred of those comments were in support of the proposed exception. The overwhelming majority of those comments were from individuals who had acquired DVDs from a region outside the U.S. and then encountered difficulty in playing those DVDs on devices purchased in the U.S.  In the previous rulemaking, the Register determined that region coding did not adversely affect noninfringing uses because of the options available to those who wish to play foreign content, such as VHS versions of the works, non-region 1 DVD players, and the ability to reset the region code setting of DVD-ROM drives in computers. 215  If VHS substitutes are still available today, it is  reasonable to presume that they will be substantially less so in the next three years.216 However, while the option of analog alternatives may diminish, there continue to be options available to consumers who wish to view non-region 1 DVDs. A user may still obtain DVD players for other regions from which the user wishes to watch DVDs. 217  A more practical approach is the ready  availability of DVD-ROM drives for computers218 which can be switched from one region to another  215 216  65 FR at 64569.  See, T Shira Perlmutter, May 2, 2003, p. 72; T Dean Marks, May 15, 2003, p. 7273; T Steven Metalitz, May 15, 2003, p. 71-72. 217 218  PHR Steve Metalitz, Joint Reply Commenters, August 5, 2003.  While it is likely that not every person who wishes to view non-region 1 DVDs has a computer, there has been no showing to what extent the likely limited number of foreign DVD connoisseurs own only stand-alone DVD players. All of the commenters and reply commenters in this rulemaking commented via computer and therefore it can be assumed that their concerns could be addressed with a computer hardware solution.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 123  for a limited number of times.219 The record indicates that those DVD drives are available for as little as $19.95. 220  Those users who prefer to view DVD content on their television screens rather  than their computer monitor may connect their computers or laptops to most recently manufactured television sets via S-Video, Composite Video or standard RCA jacks. These options allow the content of non-region 1 discs to be accessed and render allegations of adverse effects mere inconveniences. Therefore, it is not true that the prohibition against circumvention of region coding prevents access to any motion picture on DVDs from any region.  While the prohibition may prevent a potentially more convenient means of accessing nonregion 1 encoded DVDs,221 it is uncontested that non-region 1 DVDs may be accessed by other available means. As long as such relatively inexpensive options remain available to those users who seek to view foreign DVDs, it does not appear that an exemption is necessary to preserve this noninfringing use.  An analysis of the 1201(a)(1)(C) factors might well militate in favor of an exemption if one who wanted to view a non-region 1 DVD had no choice other than to circumvent the region coding.  Indeed, this ability provides more to users than was stated in the previous rulemaking. Not only can the drive be set to different regions five times, but we now understand that the drive can be reset so that the user may switch regions up to a total of twenty-five times with the assistance of an authorized dealer or service representative. See T Dean Marks, May 15, 2003, p. 288. 220 221  219  T Bruce Turnbull, May 2, 2003, p. 48.  How convenient that means would be, however, is questionable, since it may not be likely that most users would be able to circumvent the region coding except with a multi-region player.   Recommendation of the Register of Copyrights  October 27, 2003  Page 124  However, in light of the fact that there are a number of ways to view non-region 1 DVDs in the United States, there is no reason to grant an exemption in this case.  12.

SIMPSON aka ""KARL LEA"" :  RULING ON MOTION TO SUPPRESS Defendant Richard S. Markey moved to suppress all evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant issued by a United States magistrate judge on July 16, 1999. The search warrant authorized the search of the defendant's residence at 12 Kerr Farm Road, Simsbury, Connecticut and the seizure of records and other items relating to a scheme to defraud Markey is alleged to have conducted using the name Marquis International Holdings. The warrant was executed that night by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Postal Inspection Service. Markey attacked the search warrant claiming (i) that there was no probable cause to search his residence; (ii) that the affidavit contained a false statement and he was entitled to a Franks hearing; (iii) that the search warrant was defective because it was overly broad; and (iv) that the agents exceeded the scope of the warrant in seizing certain property. For the reasons that follow, the motion was denied. I. Factual Background On July 12, 1999, a complaint was received by the Federal Bureau of Investigation from the Simsbury Police Department concerning a suspected fraudulent telemarketing scheme, operating under the name Marquis International Holdings (""Marquis International""). The principal suspect in this scheme was Richard S. Markey, who resided at 12 Kerr Farm Road,   Simsbury, Connecticut. Markey was already known to the FBI and Postal Inspectors in connection with an active investigation into telemarketing schemes utilizing the names Northcoast Telecom and Northstar Direct International. A preliminary investigation revealed that Markey was representing to investors that Marquis International would conduct ""trades"" pursuant to which investors would earn interest of 70% or more each month, that the returns were ""all guaranteed by contract and placed with major financial institutions throughout the world,"" and that the ""original principal investment never leaves the bank."" The investigation also revealed that, similar to a classic Ponzi scheme, Markey encouraged investors to recruit other individuals to invest money with Marquis International by promising them that they would receive higher rates of return on their own investment as the number of investors increased and that they would receive payment equal to 5% of the money invested by the new people they recruited. Investors, who appeared to number in the thousands, were instructed to mail their application forms with ""certified bank checks or money orders"" to the private mail box of Marquis International, 542 Hopmeadow Street, PMB 149, Simsbury, Connecticut, 06070. The investigators also learned that Markey participated in telephone conference calls where potential investors would call a specified telephone number at a designated time and receive answers to questions they might have about the Marquis International investment program. These conference calls involved large numbers of callers from across the United States. Postal Inspectors learned that the private mail box to which the application forms and checks or money orders were being sent had been rented from Mail Boxes, Etc. by Richard Markey. In renting that box, Markey used his home address of 12 Kerr Farm Road, Simsbury, 2   Connecticut and provided a copy of his Connecticut drivers license confirming that address was his residence. The address of the private mail box, i.e., 542 Hopmeadow Street, PMB 149, Simsbury, Connecticut, 06070, was used by Markey as the address for Marquis International. Fleet Bank records showed that Markey had deposited $1,457,563.00 into a Marquis International account over a three-day period from June 30 to July 2, 1999, and that he had wire transferred $1.25 million of those funds out of the country on July 13, 1999. Richard Markey was listed as the president and owner of Marquis International on this account and Carol A. Mallon was listed as its treasurer. Postal Inspector Robert Bova went to Mail Boxes, Etc., on July 14, 1999, and again on July 15, 1999, and observed there several hundred pieces of express mail addressed to Marquis International. On July 15, 1999, a postal letter carrier who delivered mail to Markey's residence informed Inspector Bova that he had observed a bunch of telephones and other gadgets on a table in the garage at that residence. Also on July 15, 1999, FBI Special Agent Joseph Nates interviewed an individual who acknowledged sending money to Marquis International at its address in Simsbury, i.e., the private mail box. This individual stated, among other things, that he had participated in a telephone conference call with Karl Lea, who was an associate of Markey. This individual had been told that the money sent to Marquis International would be traded in discount bonds and that he could expect a return of ""six figures"" on a thousand dollar investment in a year. This investor had been told that there would be monthly trades and that each investor would receive 50% of the monthly profits. This information was the same, or consistent with the, information contained in Marquis 3   International's written solicitations that had been obtained by the investigators. Agent Nates listened to a Marquis International conference call for investors on July 15, 1999. The person representing Marquis International refused to give his last name, but stated he was ""Tom from Wisconsin."" This representative was evasive when asked to identify the specific instruments in which Marquis International would invest. He stated only that they were ""international bank debentures."" He claimed Markey was connected to the six wealthiest families in the world and that was how he was able to obtain such phenomenal returns. All of the ""investors"" were instructed not to release this information to anyone they did not know. Also, during the evening of July 15, 1999, Inspector Bova, who had seen Markey's photograph on the copy of the driver's license Markey provided to Mail Boxes, Etc. and from a copy of Markey's driver's license photo which had been faxed to him from the Department of Motor Vehicles, observed a person he believed to be Markey sitting in a gray Chrysler automobile in the driveway at 12 Kerr Farm Road. A check on the license plate of the automobile showed that the car was registered to Richard S. Markey at that address. On July 16, 1999, Agent Nates spoke with bank personnel from Fleet Bank who advised him that on that day, at approximately 10:30 a.m., a deposit had been made to the account of Marquis International. The deposit consisted of approximately 200 checks in the aggregate amount of $717,930.00. Also, on July 16, 1999, Agent Nates spoke with Sidney A. Igdalsky, a supervisory examiner in the Securities and Business Investment Division of the Connecticut Department of Banking. Igdalsky's office had recently received an inquiry which led him to open an investigation of Marquis International. Igdalsky advised that he had reviewed Marquis  4   International documents forwarded to Agent Nates by the Simsbury Police Department, as well as the documents provided by another Marquis International investor; Igdalsky advised that the pitch used was very typical of fraudulent investment schemes involving bank instruments. Igdalsky also informed Agent Nates that he had listened to a Marquis International conference call on July 15, 1999 and heard a person who identified himself as ""Rick Marquis"" on the telephone. Igdalsky stated that he had investigated several similar cases involving this type of fraud and had extensively researched this area of fraud, and he advised that, based on his experience and expertise, there was no such investment instrument as that being described by Marquis International. During the course of their investigation, the Postal Inspectors and the FBI found no indication that Markey had any office outside his home. To the contrary, all indications were that he was conducting the alleged scheme from his residence. Consequently, the agents applied for and obtained a search warrant for 12 Kerr Farm Road, Simsbury, Connecticut, which was issued at 6:20 p.m. on July 16, 1999. The search authorized the search for and seizure of evidence relating to the telemarketing scheme being operated by Markey from his residence at 12 Kerr Farm Road, Simsbury, Connecticut. The search warrant was executed late that same day. Markey was not present at the outset, but was reached by his wife on his cellular telephone and returned home within two hours. The agents did not have an arrest warrant. When Markey returned home, he agreed to talk to the agents and was advised of his Miranda rights, even though he was not in custody. He stated he was willing to answer questions and talked to the agents for about one-half hour. After Markey admitted that he had in fact made false statements to investors to induce them to send money to Marquis  5   International, he was placed under arrest. Although the defendant was under investigation for his conduct relating to Northstar Direct International and Northcoast Telecom, the agents limited their search to Marquis International documents only. The only records seized relating to Northstar Direct International or Northcoast Telecom were records that were intermingled in stacks of Marquis International papers or in Markey's briefcase (which is discussed below) and inadvertently seized, or telephone records that potentially reflected calls made on behalf of Marquis International. Those documents constituted roughly one percent of the documents seized. The team of law enforcement officers who conducted the search met twice before executing the search warrant. At the initial meeting, at the offices of the U.S. Attorney, drafts of Agent Nates' affidavit and the search warrant were distributed. Then, just prior to the execution of the search warrant, the group met again for a final briefing as to the scope of the search warrant. The agents were explicitly instructed by Inspector Bova that, although Mr. Markey had also been operating Northstar Direct International and Northcoast Telecom, the search was to be limited to documents related to Marquis International. The agents seized eleven boxes of documents relating to Marquis International; had they seized the documents they identified as relating to Northstar Direct International, those documents would have filled about four additional boxes. Although the members of the search team were made familiar with the contents of Agent Nates' affidavit, that affidavit was not made an attachment to the search warrant. At one point during the search, some of the agents came across numerous documents related to Northstar Direct International and Northcoast Telecom, which were clearly identifiable as such. Those agents were concerned that those documents were evidence of illegal activity and  6   double-checked with Agent Nates and Inspector Bova as to whether those documents should be seized. They were told that they could not seize those documents. The agents also seized Mr. Markey's briefcase. One of the other agents brought the briefcase to the attention of Agent Nates when he determined that it contained certain correspondence between Markey and Carol Mallon, who was not only the Treasurer of Marquis International but Markey's girlfriend. The briefcase contained a myriad of documents relating not only to Marquis International but to a number of other matters, such as Northstar Direct International, Northern Telecom, and personal correspondence and sexually explicit materials. It was only apparent in hindsight that some of the records, such as telephone records, did not relate to Marquis International. The briefcase was so full that it could barely be closed. The agents decided to seize the entire briefcase and sort through the contents later. It took Agent Nates and Agent Bova one to one and a half hours to do so. They found over one hundred documents that related to Marquis International; these documents ranged in size from small receipts to two- and three-page documents. Approximately 50 of those items were marked as exhibits for trial. However, the clear majority of the documents did not relate to Marquis International, and after the relevant material was removed, the briefcase was still very full. The briefcase was produced for examination by the court. Computerized records and computer equipment were covered by the search warrant, and the agents also seized Markey's computer. Agent Nates' affidavit described in detail the procedure that would be followed if an on-site analysis of the data contained in the computer was not practical or feasible. When the agent who was the computer specialist arrived at the scene, it was about 9 p.m. He concluded that, assuming no problems, it would have taken at least several  7   hours for him to perform the complicated procedures involved in imaging and forensically processing the computer. Although the postal letter carrier had reported to Inspector Bova that he had observed a bunch of telephones and other gadgets on a table in the garage at Markey's residence and that statement had been included in the affidavit in support of the application for the search warrant, the agents found only a single telephone and a caller identification box when they executed the search warrant. II. Discussion A. Probable Cause to Search 12 Kerr Farm Road  Markey argues that the application for the search warrant failed to set forth probable cause to believe that evidence relating to Marquis International would be found in his residence at 12 Kerr Farm Road, Simsbury, Connecticut. The Fourth Amendment provides that ""no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause."" Const. Amend. IV. The task of determining probable cause requires the magistrate judge ""simply to make a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before her, including the `veracity' and `basis of knowledge' of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place."" Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238 (1983). See also United States v. Diaz, 176 F.3d 52, 110 (2d Cir. 1999) (probable cause for a search warrant is established if the `totality of the circumstances' indicate a probability of criminal activity); United States v. Travisano, 724 F.2d 341, 345 (2d Cir. 1983)(there should exist a ""fair probability that the premises will yield the objects specified in the search warrant""). A defendant who argues that a warrant was issued on less than probable cause faces a very  8   heavy burden. Rivera v. United States, 928 F.2d 592, 602 (2d Cir. 1991). Once a warrant has been issued, the magistrate judge's finding of probable cause is entitled to substantial deference by the reviewing court. United States v. Rosa, 11 F.3d 315, 326 (2d Cir. 1993); United States v. Ventresca, 380 U.S. 102, 109 (1965); Travisano, 724 F.2d at 345; United States v. Zucco, 694 F.2d 44, 46 (2d Cir. 1982). The reviewing court is not to review the issue of probable cause de novo. Gates, 462 U.S. at 236; Rosa, 11 F.3d at 326; Travisano, 724 F.2d at 345. ""A reviewing court should not interpret supporting affidavits in a hypertechnical, rather than a commonsense manner."" United States v. Martin, 157 F.3d 46, 52 (2d Cir.1998). ""Any doubt regarding the existence of probable cause must be resolved in favor of upholding the warrant."" United States v. Salameh, 152 F.3d 88, 113 (2d Cir.1996); Rosa, 11 F.3d at 326. Markey claims that the search warrant application was defective because it did not establish that Marquis International had any connection with Markey's residence at 12 Kerr Farm Road. The court concludes, however, that the affidavit in support of the search warrant does establish a sufficient connection. The affidavit stated that investors were instructed to mail checks or money orders to Marquis International's postal mail box with Mail Boxes, Etc. in Simsbury. It also stated that the investigators had determined that that mail box was opened by Markey using his home address of 12 Kerr Farm Road, Simsbury. The affidavit stated further that ""Markey has no known office outside the home and appears to work exclusively from this location."" [Affid.,  6]. Markey contends that this statement was the agent's own summary conclusion. Markey points to the fact that no mail for Marquis International had been sent to 12 Kerr Farm Road, and that nowhere in the bank records or records of Mail Boxes, Etc. was 12 Kerr Farm Road listed as the address for  9   Marquis International. A commonsense reading of Agent Nates' affidavit is that the conclusion by the investigators that Markey had no known office outside his home and appeared to work exclusively from his residence at 12 Kerr Farm Road was based not only on the information obtained from Mail Boxes, Etc. and the additional observations of the investigators during their inquiry into Marquis International, but also on the knowledge acquired by investigators in connection with their inquiries into Northcoast Telecom and Northstar Direct International. The record shows that there was a more than sufficient basis for this statement in the affidavit and that it was not a mere summary conclusion on the part of Agent Nates. It was true, as stated in the affidavit, that Markey had been the subject of an open investigation in relation to Northcoast Telecom and Northstar Direct International since February 1998. It was also the case that Marquis International was required to furnish its ""business address"" on the application for the postal mail box with Mail Boxes, Etc. The address it gave was Postal Mail Box 149 itself, and the only other address given on that application by Richard Markey was 12 Kerr Farm Road; on the agreement with Mail Boxes, Etc., Markey gave as his address a second postal mail box, i.e., PMB 324 with Mail Boxes, Etc. in Avon, Connecticut. It was not possible that any substantial part of the records of Marquis International were being stored in either of these postal mail boxes. Also, the only address known to the investigators for the ""members"" of Marquis International whose mail was to be received at PMB 149 (i.e., Markey and ""Damien Marquis"") was 12 Kerr Farm Road, which was given as Markey's address. Moreover, the investigators had also reviewed records from Fleet Bank as to Marquis International. Finally, even though the postal letter carrier's report of having seen a bunch of telephones and other gadgets on a table in the  10   garage at 12 Kerr Farm Road was most likely an erroneous report, it was accurately reflected in the search warrant affidavit, which attributed to the letter carrier a statement that he had seen a large number of telephones set up in the garage. Given all of the circumstances set forth in the affidavit that was submitted to the magistrate judge, there was probable cause to believe that the business of Marquis International was being conducted at least in part from 12 Kerr Farm Road and that records relating to Marquis International would be found there. B. Franks Hearing  The defendant moved for a Franks hearing on the grounds that the affidavit in support of the search warrant application states that the affiant, Agent Nates, was informed by Inspector Bova that Bova was told by a postal letter carrier that the letter carrier observed a large number of telephones set up in the garage at 12 Kerr Farm Road, when, in fact, at the time of the search there was only one telephone there. The defendant contends that no letter carrier could have observed and reported to Inspector Bova the presence of a large number of telephones in the garage. The postal letter carrier conceded, at the suppression hearing, that what he actually saw in the garage was one telephone, possibly a second telephone, and some gadgets on the tables with the telephone(s). However, the letter carrier also confirmed that he told Inspector Bova that he observed a bunch of telephones and other gadgets on a table in the garage. In Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978), the Supreme Court held that where a defendant makes a substantial preliminary showing that (1) the affidavit upon which a search warrant was granted contained a false statement that was made knowingly and intentionally, or  11   with reckless disregard for the truth, and 2) the allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause, he is entitled to a hearing. Id. at 170-72; See also Rivera v. United States, 928 F.2d 592, 604 (2d Cir. 1991); United States v. Levasseur, 816 F.2d 37 (2d Cir. 1987). Allegations that amount to negligence or innocent mistake do not constitute the required showing. The focus is not on whether a mistake was made, but rather on the intention behind the mistake. Beard v. City of Northglenn, 24 F.3d 110, 116 (10th Cir. 1994). See United States v. Trzaska, 111 F.3d 1019, 1028 (2d Cir. 1997) (""Whether a person acted deliberately or recklessly is a factual question of intent.""). Franks does not require that all statements in an affidavit be true; it simply requires that the statements be `believed or appropriately accepted by the affiant as true.'"" United States v. Campino, 890 F.2d 588, 592 (2d Cir. 1989), citing Franks, 438 U.S. at 165. To demonstrate recklessness, a defendant must show that the officer ""`in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his allegations . . . and [a] fact finder may infer reckless disregard from circumstances evincing `obvious reasons to doubt the veracity' of the allegations."" Beard, 24 F.3d at 116 (quoting United States v. Williams, 737 F.2d 594, 602 (7th Cir. 1984), quoting St. Amant v. Thompson, 390 U.S. 727, 731 (1968)). See United States v. Millar, 79 F.3d 338, 342-3 (2d Cir. 1996) (defendant failed to show deliberate falsehood or recklessness where no evidence of ""deliberate prevarication""). Markey has failed to make the substantial preliminary showing required to warrant a Franks hearing. To the extent that he relies on the fact that there was only a single telephone in the garage and not a bunch of telephones, as was reported to Inspector Bova, his argument fails because this discrepancy does not reflect on the truthfulness of the affiant, Agent Nates, or  12   Inspector Bova, his fellow law enforcement official who was the source of the information. The agents were simply relating to the court information that was provided by the postal letter carrier. Franks is implicated only when the false statement is made by, or the reckless disregard is that of, the affiant. There is no right to a hearing when the challenge is to information provided by an informant or other source. Franks, 438 U.S. at 171. To the extent the defendant relies on the fact that the postal letter carrier referred to a bunch of telephones and other gadgets, while the affidavit referred to a large number of telephones, his argument also fails. While the affidavit does not recite precisely what the postal letter carrier reported to Inspector Bova, there is no indication that the variance between the language used by the postal letter carrier and that used in the affidavit was an intentional or knowing misstatement, or the result of a reckless disregard for the truth, and even if the specific language used by the letter carrier had been included in the affidavit, the issuance of the search warrant would still have been justified. See United States v. Mankani, 738 F.2d 538, 545-546 (2d Cir. 1984). C. Particularity of the Search Warrant; Good Faith Exception  Markey also contends that the search warrant was defective because it was overly broad. The particularity requirement of the Fourth Amendment is intended to restrict the scope of searches conducted pursuant to lawful search authority. Stanford v. Texas, 379 U.S. 476, 481-86 (1965). ""[T]he specific evil is the general warrant abhorred by the colonists, and the problem is not that of the intrusion per se, but of a general, exploratory rummaging of a person's belongings."" Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 467 (1971). In Marron v. United States, 275 U.S. 192, 196 (1927), one of the earliest and most  13   frequently quoted opinions addressing the particularity requirement, the Court observed: The requirement that warrants shall particularly describe the things to be seized makes general searches under them impossible and prevents the seizure of one thing under a warrant describing another. As to what is taken, nothing is left to the discretion of the officer executing the warrant. However, as the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has noted: Although often cited, this passage from Marron has not always been applied literally. Courts tend to tolerate a greater degree of ambiguity where law enforcement agents have done the best that could reasonably be expected under the circumstances, have acquired all the descriptive facts which a reasonable investigation could be expected to cover, and have insured that all those facts were included in the warrant. See Andersen v. Maryland, 427 U.S. 462 (1967). (Additional citations omitted) United States v. Young, 745 F.2d 733, 759 (2d Cir. 1984) (citations omitted). A warrant which describes ""in both specific and inclusive generic terms what is to be seized....[such as] `all folders...all checks...all general ledgers [and] all correspondence'"" relating to a specific suspected crime is proper since in some circumstances a more precise description is not feasible. United States v. Christine, 687 F.2d 749, 753, 760 (3rd Cir. 1982). Furthermore, the general clause in the warrant at issue in Christine, which authorized the seizure of ""all other documents, papers, instrumentalities and fruits of the crime,"" was found not to constitute a general search. Id. at 753. In United States v. Riley, 906 F.2d 841, 844-5 (2d Cir. 1990), the court upheld the seizure of evidence against particularity challenges, observing that ""[i]n upholding broadly worded categories of items available for seizure, we have noted that the language of a warrant is to be construed in light of an illustrative list of seizable items."" Specifically, the court held that: Once a category of seizable papers has been adequately described, 14   with the description delineated in part by an illustrative list of seizable items, the Fourth Amendment is not violated because the officers executing the warrant must exercise some minimal judgment as to whether a particular document falls within the described category. Id. 906 F.2d at 845. In short, a search warrant is sufficiently particular where it enables the agents executing the warrant to ascertain and identify with reasonable certainty those items which the judicial officer has authorized them to seize. United States v. George, 975 F.2d 72, 75 (2d Cir. 1987). Markey contends that the search warrant permitted a general search. He points to the fact that the warrant authorized, inter alia, the seizure of specific categories of books, records and other documents ""relating to Marquis International, Marquis International Holdings and/or Richard Markey and[/]or Carol A. Mallon."" It also authorized, inter alia, the seizure of ""telephone and telegram records, including, but not limited to, faxes, telephone logs and telephone messages."" He notes that the warrant therefore authorized the seizure of any book, record or other document relating to Richard Markey, and the seizure of any telephone and telegram record on the premises, even if it had nothing to do with the scheme alleged in the search warrant application. While the points Markey makes as to certain aspects of the search warrant appear to have merit, the court need not resolve each of these issues because it concludes that, assuming arguendo that the search warrant was not sufficiently particular, the ""good faith"" exception to the exclusionary rule is applicable here. Evidence is still admissible at trial even if seized pursuant to a defective warrant if ""an officer acting with objective good faith . . . obtained a search warrant from a judge or a magistrate and acted within its scope."" United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 920 (1984). ""The test of 15   objective good faith is `whether a reasonably well trained officer would have known that the search was illegal despite the magistrate's authorization.'"" United States v. Moore, 968 F.2d 216, 222 (2d Cir. 1992) (quoting Leon, 468 U.S. at 922, n.23) ""[S]uppression of evidence obtained pursuant to a warrant should be ordered only on a case-by-case basis and only in those unusual cases in which exclusion will further the purposes of the exclusionary rule."" Leon, 468 U.S. at 918. There are certain situations where the good faith exception does not apply, namely, (1) where the issuing magistrate has been knowingly misled; (2) where the issuing magistrate wholly abandoned his or her judicial role; (3) where the application for the search warrant is so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render reliance upon it unreasonable; and (4) where the warrant is so facially deficient that reliance upon it is unreasonable. Id. at 923. The only one of these four limitations on the ""good faith"" exception that requires discussion here is the last of the four. In Leon, the court stated: Finally, depending on the circumstances of the particular case, a warrant may be so facially deficient -- i.e., in failing to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seized -- that the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid. Id. at 923. The circumstances of this case are not such that the executing officers could not reasonably presume the warrant to be valid notwithstanding any deficiencies that may have been apparent on the face of the warrant. First, this is not an instance where deficient language in a portion of the warrant authorizes a ""wide-ranging exploratory search."" United States v. George, 975 F.2d 72, 75 (2d Cir. 1992) (quoting Maryland v. Garrison, 480 U.S. 79, 84 (1987)). In George, for example, the deficient language, which was tacked on at the end of a specific list, was 16   ""any other evidence relating to the commission of a crime."" George, 975 F.2d 74. Second, this was a situation where the ""all records"" exception to the particularity requirement was applicable. Agent Nate's affidavit provided adequate support for a finding of probable cause that Marquis International's entire business operation was illegal. ""When the criminal activity pervades that entire business, seizure of all records of the business is appropriate, and broad language used in warrants will not offend the particularity requirements. U.S. Postal Service v. C.E.C. Services, 869 F.2d 184, 187 (2d Cir. 1988). Third, the agents were instructed that there was to be a limited search for items related to Marquis International, and they took care to follow those instructions. Fourth, none of the items seized during the search was authorized to be seized only pursuant to any deficient language in the search warrant. Finally, although Agent Nate's affidavit was not an attachment to the search warrant, it was specifically reviewed by the agent who served as the evidence custodian for the purpose of familiarizing herself with the contents and the general nature of the allegations; this was in addition to the instructions given by Agent Nates and Inspector Bova to the search team. Cf. George, 975 F.2d at 76 (""Resort to an affidavit to remedy a warrant's lack of particularity is available only when it is incorporated by reference in the warrant itself and attached to it.""). The court concludes that under these circumstances the agents executing the search warrant reasonably perceived it to be valid, and the agents conducted the search in good faith reliance on the magistrate judge's issuance of the warrant. D. Seizure of Items Not Specified in the Warrant  Finally, Markey argues that the agents exceeded the authorized scope of the warrant by seizing documents related to Northstar Direct International and Northcoast Telecom, by seizing  17   Markey's briefcase, which contained not only documents related to Northstar Direct International and Northcoast Telecom but also documents of a purely personal nature, and by seizing Markey's computer. As discussed above, the agents attempted to limit the documents seized to ones related to Marquis International, and took care to avoid seizing papers they identified as relating to Northstar Direct International and Northcoast Telecom. Any records of Northstar Direct International or Northcoast Telecom that were seized were taken because the agents believed those documents related directly to Marquis International (i.e., telephone records) or because they were inadvertently seized as part of a large group of seized documents related to Marquis International. As to the briefcase, Markey contends that the agents should have given Markey the choice of either consenting to the agents taking the entire briefcase and sorting through it later, or having the agents stay at Markey's home that night until a document-by-document examination was completed. Markey makes a comparable argument as to the computer that was seized. This was a situation where the principal in the business enterprise kept all his receipts and other documents in a very disorganized fashion; receipts for one enterprise were not segregated from those for others. As to the briefcase specifically, it was clear to the agents that it contained a significant amount of material that should be seized but was haphazardly intermingled with other materials. While the agents were able to review the contents of the briefcase in one to one and a half hours subsequently, this was with the benefit of the knowledge gained by virtue of the search, and it appears it would have taken significantly longer to review the contents at the scene of the search. Although it may have been preferable to give Markey the choice he articulates, the agents acted in  18   good faith in seizing the briefcase, rather than prolonging the search into the middle of the night. This is not a situation where there was such flagrant disregard for the terms of the warrant that all seized evidence, not just any improperly seized evidence, should be suppressed. See United States v. Medlin, 798 F.2d 407, 411 (10th Cir. 1986) (""The rule is that only the improperly seized evidence, not all of the evidence, must be suppressed, unless there was a flagrant disregard for the terms of the warrant."" (citing Waller v. Georgia, 467 U.S. 39, 44 n.3 (1984)). As to the computer, the search warrant authorized the seizure of the computer, and the procedures that the computer specialist would follow were spelled out in Agent Nates' affidavit, which specifically made refer to the possibility of an off-site review. Even assuming, arguendo, that the seizure of the computer was not authorized, the ""good faith"" exception to the exclusionary rule would be applicable. VI. Conclusion For the reasons set forth above, defendant Markey's motion to suppress (doc. #43) was denied. It is so ordered.

COLLINS, Debtor.  No. 94 B 12125 Substantively consolidated Honorable Susan Pierson Sonderby  MEMORANDUM OPINION The matters before the Court arise from the Chapter 7 Trustee's objections to claims filed in these consolidated cases and from the responses of certain claimants to the Trustee's objections.1 BACKGROUND It appears that in 1984, Thomas Collins (""Collins"") incorporated Lake States Commodities, Inc. (""Lake States"") for the alleged purpose of trading commodity futures. It has been alleged that neither he nor the corporation were registered with the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (""CFTC"") and never did any legitimate business. Sometime between 1984 and 1986, Collins purportedly began receiving funds from investors and pooling those funds for the purpose of trading commodity futures. It has also been alleged that Collins' failure to register the corporation or any of its employees with the CFTC made the pooling of investor funds illegal. Nevertheless, Collins and Lake States 1. The responses filed that addressed the issue that this Court will resolve were filed by attorney John J. Kakacek on behalf of Arthur Spietz, as trustee of the Marc Chemical Products Corp. Profit Sharing Trust and James E. Philbin; and a response filed by attorney Joel S. Corwin on behalf of Wesley P. Bork, Jr., individually and as executor under the will of Wesley P. Bork, Sr.   traded pooled investor funds with accounts at Geldermann Inc. (""Geldermann""), a registered futures commodity merchant. It is further alleged that in June 1994 it was discovered that Collins had been running a Ponzi scheme whereby he fraudulently induced hundreds of people to invest money with him, that he had been reporting false profits to investors as a means of inducing new investments, and that he then disappeared. Involuntary bankruptcy petitions were filed against Collins and Lake States on June 16, 1994. On June 28, 1994 the cases were administratively consolidated. Orders for relief were entered on July 13, 1994. Lawrence Fisher is the duly elected Trustee. Investors' proofs of claims were filed in the debtors' estates. The Trustee filed objections to the claims of approximately 350 claimants raising primarily three issues. First, the Trustee objected to duplicate claims being filed, when one was filed in each of the two cases. This issue was resolved on May 5, 1998 when this Court ordered that the cases be substantively consolidated. Second, the Trustee objected to allowing any claim that was greater than the investor's net cash loss. Many investors sought to include interest and consequential damages such as lost profits or lost opportunities in their claims. The Trustee's omnibus objection was sustained by this Court in an oral ruling on July 9, 1998. Third, the Trustee seeks to reduce the amount of the estates' payments to those investors who received compensation from a settlement in an independent lawsuit that some of the investors brought against Geldermann and others. The Trustee would like to reduce the estates' distributions by the amounts received by these particular investors in their settlement. Strenuous objections were made to these proposed reductions. This issue is resolved herein. The Apostolou Case 3   On June 24, 1994, Louis Apostolou and thirty-five other individuals filed a complaint in District Court against Geldermann and six individuals alleging violations of the Commodities Exchange Act, violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, violations of the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act, violations of the Illinois Consumer Fraud Act and for common law fraud (""Apostolou Case"").2 On July 28, 1994 an interim trustee in this case filed an adversary complaint (""Injunction Adversary"") seeking an order declaring that the prosecution of the Apostolou Case violated the automatic stay. Alternatively, he sought an order enjoining any further prosecution of the Apostolou Case pursuant to 11 U.S.C.  105. The plaintiffs in the Apostolou Case responded with a motion to dismiss the Injunction Adversary and to deny the injunction motion. In an oral ruling on October 12, 1994, this Court denied the motion to dismiss the Injunction Adversary and granted the issuance of an injunction against further prosecution of the Apostolou Case. On November 8, 1994 this Court entered an order clarifying that its ruling was applicable to the seventy plaintiffs who had since joined the Apostolou Case. The October 12, 1994 ruling was appealed to the District Court. The District Court reversed this Court's decision, dissolved the injunction and dismissed the Injunction Adversary. The Trustee appealed the District Court judgment. The Seventh Circuit ruled on September 9, 1998. It found that the Apostolou Plaintiffs' causes of action are not property of the bankruptcy estate and can therefore be litigated outside the bankruptcy case. It also found that  2. Subsequent to the filing of the Apostolou Case, actions seeking similar relief were filed against Geldermann and others in the District Court by other investors in Lake States. These actions were consolidated with the Apostolou Case for the purpose of discovery and pre-trial motions. All of these actions are collectively referred to hereinafter as the ""Apostolou Case"" and the plaintiffs who brought the lawsuits or joined thereafter as the ""Apostolou Plaintiffs."" 4   the causes of action are sufficiently related to the bankruptcy case that this Court's injunction against pursuing the Apostolou Case should be reinstated until an adversary proceeding brought by the Trustee against Geldermann and others has been resolved. While these appeals were pending, the Apostolou Case was settled. Compensation was provided to the Apostolou Plaintiffs. The Trustee's Adversary Proceeding Against Geldermann, et al. On June 14, 1996, the Trustee commenced an adversary proceeding against Geldermann, ConAgra, Inc., which is Geldermann's parent corporation and six individuals (""Geldermann Adversary"") alleging violations of the Commodities Exchange Act, violations of the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act, violations of the Illinois Consumer Fraud Act, common law fraud and fraudulent transfers under the Bankruptcy Code. The Geldermann Adversary was withdrawn to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on September 11, 1996 and sent back to this Court on March 10, 1998. In the interim, on or about July 16, 1997 a settlement agreement was entered into between and among Geldermann, ConAgra and the Trustee providing compensation to the estates' unsecured investor-creditors. The order authorizing the settlement was entered September 11, 1997. The Issue Once the Trustee settled the Geldermann Adversary with Geldermann and ConAgra, he sought to begin making distributions. The three issues discussed above arose and were briefed by some of the creditors and the Trustee. The only issue that remains is whether the Trustee should reduce the amount of the estates' payments to those investor-creditors who received compensation from the Apostolou Case by the amounts they received in their independent settlement. After the 5   parties briefed these issues, the Seventh Circuit issued its September 9, 1998 opinion in the Injunction Adversary. This Court must therefore now consider whether and how that ruling bears on the instant question given the settlements of both the Apostolou Case and the Geldermann Adversary. DISCUSSION The objecting investor-creditors argue that Illinois' collateral source rule precludes the Trustee from withholding a portion of their distributions based on the funds they received from the settlement of the Apostolou Case. This Court must also consider the relevance of the Seventh Circuit's opinion in the Injunction Adversary. The Collateral Source Rule Generally, in contested claim objection matters, state law must be consulted to determine the incidents of the claim, while allowability remains a federal question governed by the policies and provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. In re Johnson, 960 F.2d 396, 404 (4th Cir. 1992). Accordingly, the creditors argue that Illinois' collateral source rule applies here. ""Illinois recognizes the collateral-source rule, under which the amount of damages for a plaintiff in a civil action is not decreased by the amount of benefits received by the plaintiff injured-party from a source wholly independent and collateral to the wrongdoer. [Citation omitted]. The entire theory behind this rule is to keep the jury from learning anything about collateral income which could influence the decision of the jury. [Citation omitted]."" Boden v. Crawford, 196 Ill.App.3d 71, 76, 552 N.E.2d 1287, 1291 (4th Dist. 1990). The Trustee argues that the collateral source rule does not apply here because Geldermann is not a collateral source of funds. He states that the investors' claims against the estate are identical to the claims asserted in their actions against Geldermann. He points out that the investors' initial 6   complaint named Thomas Collins as a defendant but that he was later omitted in an amended complaint because of the bankruptcy. Therefore, he argues, state law requires reduction of the claims by the amounts of the settlement proceeds from the Apostolou Case. The Trustee further argues that the Bankruptcy Code supports this result. In North Atlantic Fishing, Inc. v. Geremia, 153 B.R. 607 (D.R.I. 1993), the Court held that a compensatory damage award against a boat seller had to be reduced by the amount of a settlement previously received from a marine mechanic found to be a joint tortfeasor. The Court explained that ""[t]ypically, the [collateral source] doctrine applies to such independent sources as insurance policies maintained by plaintiff or an innocent third party, employment wages and benefits, gratuities, social security benefits, and welfare payments. ... however this rule does not apply to payments made by `a tortfeasor or by a person acting for him' or to `payments made by another who is ... subject to the same tort liability ..."" Id. at 611 (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts,  920A). With respect to federal law, the creditors argue that the Trustee is trying to do indirectly what the District Court ruled he could not do directly. They contend that he wants to reduce claims by the gross recovery creditors received outside of the bankruptcy from a third party in settlement of their action against that third party. They assert that he is trying to equalize recoveries in and out of bankruptcy by adjusting the distributions from the estate. They argue that their causes of action against Geldermann and others are not property of the estate and that ""the purpose of the collateral source rule is not to prevent the plaintiff from being overcompensated but rather to prevent the tortfeasor from paying twice ..."" Perry v. Larson, 794 F.2d 279, 286 (7th Cir. 1986). Here, Geldermann was a tortfeasor who had potential liability for causing injury to the investor-creditors. The funds provided by the settlement of the Apostolou Case are not funds from 7   what would typically be considered a collateral source such as employment or social security benefits. Even in the case cited by the investor-creditors, Perry v. Larson, the collateral source was unemployment compensation. According to the allegations in the causes of action against  Geldermann, Geldermann was either a joint tortfeasor or subject to the same tort liability as the debtors. Therefore, the Court will not apply the collateral source rule to this situation. The Court of Appeals Decision In the Injunction Adversary this Court found that the Trustee had standing to pursue the individual investors' causes of action and stayed the Apostolou Case. The District Court found that the Trustee did not have standing to assert those causes of action because they were not property of the estate and that therefore the causes of action were not subject to either the automatic stay or the  105 injunction that this Court had imposed. The Court of Appeals decided that the standing issue was ""irrelevant"" to the resolution of the matter - it concluded that the investors' causes of action are not property of the estate but that they are related to the bankruptcy and that therefore this Court's exercise of ""its injunctive power ... was not an abuse of discretion."" Fisher v. Apostolou (In re Lake States Commodities, Inc.), 155 F.3d 876, 882 (7th Cir. 1998). The Court began its analysis with a review of the kinds of causes of action that a trustee may initiate. First, the trustee is the only party who has the responsibility to bring actions to marshal assets for the benefit of creditors. Second, the trustee is the only party who can sue to represent the interests of the creditors as a class. The trustee has no standing however to bring ""personal claims of creditors ... in which the claimant is harmed and `no other claimant or creditor has an interest ...'"". Id. at 879 (quoting Koch Refining v. Farmers Union Central Exchange, Inc., 831 F.2d 1339, 1348 (7th Cir. 1987)). 8   Relying on the Second Circuit's decision in Bankers Trust Co. v. Rhoades, 859 F.2d 1096 (2d Cir. 1988), the Court opined that For purposes of determining whether a suit must be brought by the trustee on behalf of the creditor class as a whole or may be brought by an individual creditor, the claims available to the trustee are not the same as those the Apostolou Plaintiffs are trying to bring under the Commodities Exchange Act, the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and RICO, and for common law fraud. Fisher v. Apostolou, 155 F.3d at 880. In Bankers Trust Co., two of the corporate debtor's owners agreed to conceal a major asset from the debtor's creditors. Relying on the misrepresentations, Bankers Trust Co., the largest creditor, agreed to a plan in which it was to receive only 17.5% of its claim. When Bankers Trust discovered the deception, it successfully moved to revoke the plan and then brought an independent action against the debtor's owners under RICO. The corporate debtor's trustee claimed that Bankers Trust did not have standing to sue the individuals. The trustee argued that if Bankers Trust was permitted to pursue its RICO cause of action, there might be nothing left for the debtor (and hence other creditors) to recover from the individual defendants. The Second Circuit decided that ""if Bankers was injured by defendants' acts, as its complaint adequately alleges in this case ... it has standing to bring a RICO claim, regardless of the fact that a bankrupt [debtor] might also have suffered an identical injury for which it has a similar right of recovery."" Bankers Trust Co., 859 F.2d at 1101. ""Bankers, the court emphasized, was not seeking recovery for injuries suffered by [the debtor], but instead wanted a remedy for injuries it suffered directly as a result of the defendants' bribery, perjury, fraud, and bankruptcy fraud."" Fisher v. Apostolou, 155 F.3d at 881. Nevertheless, the Second Circuit recognized that there was an overlap between the trustee's causes of action and Banker's Trust's causes of action because the injuries resulted from the same 9   transactions. To the extent that the trustee could recover for the debtor's injury, the portion of Bankers Trust's ""injury stemming from its status as a creditor would be reduced."" Id. ""Because the trustee's efforts had the potential to reduce Bankers' injury, the court held that it was impossible to determine the measure of damages Bankers suffered on its own before the conclusion of the bankruptcy proceeding. It therefore ordered those claims dismissed without prejudice to re-filing after the bankruptcy court resolved the trustee's claims."" Id. Relying on Bankers Trust Co. the Seventh Circuit decided that the Apostolou Plaintiffs stand in a position analogous to that of Bankers Trust and that ""[a]s creditors with claims so closely related to [the claims of] the Lake States estate, the Apostolou Plaintiffs must wait their turn behind the trustee, who has the responsibility to recover assets for the estate on behalf of the creditors as a whole ..."" Id. The Seventh Circuit concluded that the Apostolou Plaintiffs' causes of action are not property of the Lake States estate because their causes of action are not identical to the causes of action of the estate. However, the Court also concluded that ""it is difficult to imagine how those claims could be more closely `related to' it. They are claims to the same limited pool of money, in the possession of the same defendants, as a result of the same acts, performed by the same individuals, as part of the same conspiracy."" Id. at 882. Accordingly, the Court saw ""no conflict between affirming the power ... of the bankruptcy court to preliminarily enjoin `suits to which the debtor need not be a party but which may affect the amount of property in the bankrupt estate,' ... and recognizing the freedom ... of creditors to bring suits that are `only nominally against the debtor because the only relief sought is against his insurer,' guarantor, or other similarly situated party. [Citation omitted]."" Id. at 883. The Effect of the Settlements and the Distribution of Settlement Funds 10   As discussed earlier, both of the cases against Geldermann settled prior to the Seventh Circuit's decision. This Court is now in the peculiar position of determining how or whether to apply Fisher v. Apostolou (In re Lake States Commodities, Inc.), 155 F.3d 876 to the question of whether the estate's distributions to investor-creditors should be offset by funds they received from their independent lawsuits against Geldermann. As also discussed supra the Court of Appeals concluded that the Apostolou Plaintiffs' causes of action are not property of the Lake States estate because their causes of action are not identical to the causes of action that are property of the estate. Id. at 882. In this regard, the Court of Appeals also discussed the portion of the Bankers Trust case that found an overlap between the trustee's causes of action and Bankers Trust's causes of action. Analyzing the Second Circuit case, the Seventh Circuit explained that ""[b]ecause the trustee's efforts had the potential to reduce Bankers' injury, the court held that it was impossible to determine the measure of damages Bankers suffered on its own before the conclusion of the bankruptcy proceeding."" Id. at 881. There is in this analysis a clear message that an injured party is not to collect twice on the same causes of action, once in his independent action and then through the bankruptcy trustee. To the extent that the trustee's action reduces the injured party's damages he is not to collect twice for the same cause of action. To apply this principle to the situation here, the Court has carefully examined the complaint in the Apostolou Case and the complaint in the Geldermann Adversary. The Apostolou Plaintiffs pleaded four causes of action against Geldermann which contained the same allegations as five of the causes of action against Geldermann pleaded by the Trustee. These were causes of action for violations of the Commodities Exchange Act, the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, the Illinois Consumer Fraud Act and common law fraud. The Apostolou Plaintiffs pleaded five 11   causes of action against Geldermann which did not overlap with the Trustee's complaint at all. Those pleaded causes of action for additional violations of the Commodities Exchange Act, for breach of a National Futures Association membership agreement and for violations of the Securities Exchange Act. The Trustee pleaded eight fraudulent transfer causes of action against Geldermann under several sections of the Bankruptcy Code. The settlement that the Apostolou Plaintiffs entered into with Geldermann compensated them for the causes of action against Geldermann contained in their complaint. It also compensated them for the five causes of action in the Trustee's complaint with which the Apostolou complaint overlaps. The Trustee has obtained a settlement from Geldermann which reduced the creditors' damages and addressed eight causes of action not contained in the Apostolou complaint. Under the Seventh Circuit's reasoning, the Apostolou Plaintiffs are not to be compensated twice for the same causes of action brought on their behalf by the Trustee. Unfortunately, it is impossible to place a value on each cause of action once a case has settled. In order to proceed, this Court will treat the settlement funds as though they were evenly apportioned among the causes of action. The four causes of action in the Apostolou complaint against Geldermann that plead the same causes of action as the Trustee's complaint against Geldermann comprise 44% (forty-four percent) of the Apostolou complaint causes of action (four causes of action out of a total of nine causes of action against Geldermann). The allegations in the four causes of action in the Apostolou complaint are the same as the allegations in the five causes of action in the Trustee's complaint. In order to prevent the Apostolou Plaintiffs from collecting twice on these claims, the Trustee is directed to offset the distributions he makes to the Apostolou Plaintiffs by 44% (forty-four percent) of what each of them received from the Apostolou case settlement. 12   CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, this Court finds that the Trustee's objection is granted to the extent that when the Trustee distributes the proceeds of the estates' settlement with Geldermann to the Apostolou Plaintiffs he shall offset the funds received by the Apostolou Plaintiffs by 44% (forty-four percent) of the amount that each of them received in an independent settlement with Geldermann. This ruling does not apply to the distribution of any other funds from the bankruptcy estates. ENTERED: Date: ____________________________ SUSAN PIERSON SONDERBY United States Bankruptcy Judge  13"

Collins, Plaintiff, v. PRIME TABLE RESTAURANT & LOUNGE, INC., Defendant.  Adv. No. 96 A 00760  FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW I. FINDINGS OF FACT This cause comes to be heard upon the conclusion of the plaintiff's case-in-chief at the joint trial on common issues; whether the debtor Lake States Commodities, Inc. a/k/a Lake States, Inc.   (""Lake States"") was insolvent at the relevant time pursuant to statute and whether Lake States was operated as a Ponzi scheme. For the reasons stated herein, judgment in favor of the defendant Prime Table Restaurant & Lounge, Inc. (""Prime Table"") is entered pursuant to Rule 7052(c) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure (the ""Bankruptcy Rules""). A. 1. Background On June 16, 1994 (the ""Petition Date""), involuntary petitions for relief under chapter 7  of title 11 of the United States Code (the ""Code"") were filed against Lake States and Thomas W. Collins (""Collins""). Lake States and Collins are sometimes collectively referred to as the ""Debtors."" Orders for relief under chapter 7 of the Code were entered in both cases. On July 13, 1994, this Court ordered the substantive consolidation of the estates pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 1015. 2. Lakes States, an Illinois corporation, whose principal place of business was located in  Rolling Meadows, Illinois, was in the business of soliciting investors for commodity futures trading and participating in commodity pools. Collins, who is now deceased, was a resident of Illinois and was president and a shareholder of Lake States. Collins' brother, Edward Collins, was a vice-president of Lake States. 3. William A. Brandt, Jr. was appointed to serve as interim chapter 7 trustee on July 14,  1994 (the ""Interim Trustee""). Lawrence Fisher (the ""Trustee"") was elected to serve as chapter 7 trustee on October 26, 1994, and continues to serve in that capacity. 4. During his brief tenure, the Interim Trustee retained KPMG Peat Marwick, LLP  (""KPMG"") to render accounting services on behalf of the estates. Upon his election, the Trustee continued the retention of KPMG. KPMG disbanded and the Trustee continued the retention of the 6   former KPMG accountants who became employed by Ernst & Young. 5. On June 14, 1996, the Trustee filed a number of adversary complaints against investors  in Lake States, seeking to recover payments made by Lake States to the defendants as fraudulent conveyances under Sections 548(a)(1)(A) and (a)(1)(B) of the Code and Sections 5(a)(1), 5(a)(2) and (6) of the Illinois Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, 740 ILCS 160/1, et seq. (""UFTA""), applicable here by reason of the Trustee's avoiding powers under Section 544(b) of the Code. Many of the fraudulent transfer adversary proceedings were settled, leaving 21 proceedings, including this adversary proceeding, remaining (the ""Remaining Adversary Proceedings""). 6. On January 25, 2001, this Court ordered that a joint trial of the issues common to the  Remaining Adversary Proceedings be conducted on May 7, 2001. The central issues at trial were whether Lake States was insolvent at the relevant time and whether Lake States was operated as a Ponzi scheme. 7. Dean Gournis, Brian L. Shaw and Robert M. Fishman (collectively, ""Counsel"") filed  appearances on behalf of Prime Table and Prime Table filed an answer to the complaint on October 25, 1996. Shaw and Fishman were given leave to withdraw their appearances on March 21, 2000. 8. Prime Table did not attend the joint trial. The defendants who participated in the joint  trial are collectively referred to as the ""Defendants."" B. Evidence at the Trial 9. At the trial, the Trustee attempted to introduce evidence during his case-in-chief via the  following means: the testimony of the Trustee; four documents; the testimony of the Trustee's expert Kenneth J. Malek (""Malek""); and the expert's report. The four documents, which are defined and 7   discussed in detail below, are the KPMG Report, the Net Cash Report, and the Indictment and Criminal Docket from the criminal proceedings against Edward Collins. (i) 10. The Trustee's Testimony At the trial, the Trustee testified regarding Lake States' business operations, particularly  the details concerning Lake States' solicitation of investors and the manner in which Lake States paid its investors. 11. The Court sustained the Defendants' objections and excluded the Trustee's testimony  under Rule 602 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (F.R.E.) because the Trustee lacked personal knowledge of Lake States' business operations. (ii) 12. The KPMG Report and the Net Cash Report During his testimony, the Trustee discussed the following documents: (i) certain of Lake States' financial documents, including: (a) canceled checks; (b)  cash receipts; (c) cash disbursements; (d) cash ledgers; (e) bank statements; (f) investor files1 containing: promissory notes, participation certificates for commodity pools, monthly roll-forward statements detailing cash balances, correspondence, and ledger sheets; (g) a report titled ""Net Cash Position Roll-Forward,"" which purported to summarize each investor's investment activity (the ""Net Cash Report""); and (h) account statements with the Iowa Grain and Geldermann, Inc. clearing firms (the ""Clearing Firm  1  The Trustee testified that there are 310 claims against the estates in the aggregate amount of $48.6 million filed by persons who characterize themselves as investors. The Trustee could not verify that there was an investor file for every Lake States investor.  8   Account Statements"") (items (a) through (h) are collectively referred to as the ""Business Records""); and (ii) a report prepared by Ford Phillips (""Phillips""), an employee of KPMG, which  summarized the Clearing Firm Account Statements and other Business Records (the ""KPMG Report""). 13. The Interim Trustee delivered the Business Records to the Trustee, who in turn delivered  the Business Records to KPMG for review and analysis. The Trustee had no personal knowledge of and did not assist in any way in the preparation or maintenance of the Business Records. 14. The Trustee testified regarding the results of KPMG's review and analysis of the  Business Records and the contents of the KPMG Report. The Court sustained the Defendants' objections and excluded the Trustee's testimony under F.R.E. 602 because the Trustee lacked personal knowledge of these matters. 15. evidence. 16. In this regard, on cross-examination, the Trustee noted that he did not cause the The Trustee sought the introduction of the KPMG Report and the Net Cash Report into  issuance of subpoenas directed to any of the several former employees of Lake States who may have had personal knowledge of Lake States' business or who could have laid a foundation for the introduction of the Business Records. The Trustee confirmed that he did not receive any affirmative indication that any of the former employees would refuse to testify in response to a subpoena, although he doubted that they would testify. 17. The Trustee did not call Phillips or any other former employee of KPMG to testify about 9   the KPMG Report or KPMG's review of the Business Records. The Trustee did not call any bank or clearing-account firm employees to lay a foundation for the Clearing Firm Accounts or bank records. 18. During the direct examination of the Trustee and in the face of continuing objections by  the Defendants to the admission of the KPMG Report and the Net Cash Reports into evidence, the Trustee's counsel indicated that he would attempt to lay the foundation for the admission of the KPMG Report and the Net Cash Report through the Trustee's expert witness. 19. Rather than using the expert witness, however, the Trustee was recalled to the witness  stand to try to lay the foundation for the KPMG Report and Net Cash Report. Again, foundation objections were raised by the Defendants and sustained by the Court. As a result, the KPMG Report and the Net Cash Report were not admitted into evidence. (iii) 20. The Expert's Testimony and Report Malek was retained by the Trustee as an expert to provide opinions regarding whether  a Ponzi scheme existed and whether Lake States was insolvent. At the trial, Malek tendered his report which contained statements of his opinions, a description of the sources and basis of his opinions, and his curriculum vitae (the ""Malek Report""). 21. Malek is a certified public accountant and a certified insolvency and restructuring advisor  with over 20 years of experience specializing in insolvency, restructuring, and workout situations. Malek is a director of Navigant Consulting, Inc. (""Navigant""), an international, publicly traded consulting firm with offices in more than fifty cities nationwide and seventeen offices located overseas. Malek is a Fellow of the American College of Bankruptcy and he, at the time of the trial, was the immediate past president of the Association of Insolvency and Restructuring Advisors. Malek has testified in numerous 10   bankruptcy cases, primarily in this District, as an expert giving opinions on such issues as insolvency; valuations of real estate, stock interests, and business enterprises; and plan feasibility. Malek was retained in prior cases to render opinions involving three separate Ponzi schemes. 22. In the Malek Report, Malek opined about the accuracy of the KPMG Report: ""The KPMG Peat Marwick data base contains over 11,598 transactions, obtained from prepetition bank records, check registers, investor rollforwards maintained by Lake States personnel and other records analyzed by KPMG Peat Marwick. Navigant tested the accuracy of the KPMG Peat Marwick data base by tracing and agreeing a sample of cash transactions reported therein to and from the bank statements and other records. The only exception noted in this testing was that an aggregate $202,000 deposit of funds received from three investors on February 27, 1999, was shown as a $102,000 deposit from only two of such investors. The effect of this one error was to understate the liability to investors derived from the KPMG Peat Marwick data base. No other errors were detected. Based on the extent of additional testing conducted, and the fact that no further errors were detected, Kenneth Malek concludes that the KPMG Peat Marwick [sic] is accurate for purposes of using it to calculate the solvency (insolvency) analysis herein."" Malek Report, Exhibit I, page 2. 23. Malek reported that the sources of the insolvency calculations that he made based on  KPMG's work were (i) monthly calculations of prepetition amounts owed under investor loan payables, which were calculated by summing all deposits from investors and subtracting all disbursements to such investors; (ii) monthly accumulations of cash balances as reported on prepetition bank statements; and (iii) prepetition commodity investments, which reflected month-end cash-account and open-position balances obtained from Clearing Firm Account Statements. 24. Malek testified that the Business Records and the KPMG Report are the type of  information customarily relied upon by experts in the accounting field. Specifically, Malek stated that  11   it was his opinion that KPMG prepared the KPMG Report in the same method as he would have instructed Navigant employees to utilize. 25. In preparing the Malek Report, Malek consulted with (i) the Trustee; (ii) Phillips; (iii)  Valencia Thompson, Malek's assistant; and (iv) Michael Koeningsknecht, one of the attorneys for the Trustee. 26. Malek did not consult with any former employees, directors, or officers of Lake States.  Malek spoke with only one investor in Lake States, but only in the context of mediating a dispute unrelated to Malek's investigation and preparation of the Malek Report. 27. Malek does not know who prepared the Business Records upon which he relied to  form his opinions. 28. Malek spent 20 to 30 hours reviewing the Business Records and the KPMG Report  and preparing the Malek Report. Malek testified that someone at Navigant tested one to 2 percent of the 11,589 transactions reflected in the KPMG Report. Any further testing, according to Malek, would have been cost prohibitive. 29. Malek admitted that he did not provide any analysis relating to either insolvency or a  Ponzi scheme for the period of 1984 to 1989 and that his analysis started in 1989. 30. Based on a review of (i) the Business Records that were included in the KPMG Report  and (ii) the documents relating to the assets recovered by the Trustee in his ""recovery action,"" Malek determined that the monies coming into Lake States were used to personally enrich Collins and to continue the Ponzi scheme by funding payouts to earlier investors. This conclusion was based in part on Malek's determination from the Clearing Firm Accounts that Lake States procured approximately 12   $117 million from investors, and of that amount, no more than a maximum of $23 million was invested in the accounts. In addition, Malek determined that, exclusive of the new cash invested, Lake States had no other source of income to repay investors. Therefore, Malek concluded that Lake States used new investor funds to pay old investors, which is indicative of a Ponzi scheme operation. 31. Malek determined, based on a review of the Business Records and the KPMG Report,  that the sum of Lake State's debts exceeded its assets during the relevant time period. Malek stated that Lake States incurred in the aggregate a net loss of approximately $8 million from its trading activities during this time. Therefore, Malek concluded that Lake States was insolvent from June 1989 through May 19942. Malek opined that he believed it impossible that Lake States was ever solvent at any point in time. 32. The Malek Report was admitted into evidence without an objection. The Defendants,  in conceding the admissibility of the Malek Report, restated their hearsay objections with respect to the admission of the KPMG Report and the Net Cash Report. (iv) The Certified Copies of the Indictment and Docket of Criminal Case Against Edward Collins The Trustee initially offered two other items into evidence: certified copies of a criminal  33.  indictment issued against Edward Collins (the ""Indictment"") and the criminal case docket maintained by the Clerk of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois for the case of United  2  Malek defines insolvency as ""the excess of liabilities over the fair value of assets of the debtor, excluding from those assets any that were transferred or concealed with a view to defrauding creditors of consolidated Lake States. And by ""consolidated Lake States"", I mean the substantively consolidated bankruptcy estates of Thomas Collins, the individual debtor, and Lake States Commodities, the corporate debtor."" Transcript of Proceedings, p. 46.  13   States of America v. Edward Collins, case no. 99 CR 311, which indicated the entry of judgment against Edward Collins (the ""Criminal Docket""). 34. The Indictment contains numerous mail fraud and money laundering charges against  Edward Collins arising from the operation of Lake States. In Count I of the Indictment, the operation of Lake States is discussed in detail. 35. The Defendants questioned the relevance of the Indictment and the Criminal Docket  in the Remaining Adversary Proceedings. The Defendants also noted that they were disadvantaged because they did not have an opportunity to review the Indictment and Criminal Docket, as the Trustee gave no previous indication that he was going to seek their introduction. 36. 3  The Trustee's counsel indicated that he was seeking the introduction of these documents  to prove that the Trustee was unable to call Edward Collins to lay a foundation for or authenticate the KPMG Report and Net Cash Report. Presumably, the Trustee is arguing that because Edward Collins could not testify, the Trustee could not lay the foundation for the KPMG Report sand Net Cash Report through normal means. 37. At the trial, the Defendants questioned whether the Trustee failed to supplement his  discovery responses to include those documents that the federal government used in its prosecution of Edward Collins and that may have been relevant in the Remaining Adversary Proceedings. The Defendants argue in their Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law that after their concerns  3  The Clerk's certifications of the Indictment and the Criminal Docket are dated the date of this trial, May 7, 2001. Moreover, by letter dated May 4, 2001, addressed to the Court by the Trustee with carbon copies to counsel for the Defendants, the Trustee advised that he would only be seeking the introduction of the Malek Report at the trial.  14   about the disclosure of the government's documents were addressed, the Trustee dropped his request to admit the Indictment and the Criminal Docket into the record. This characterization of events is consistent with the fact that the Trustee did not include a discussion of the Indictment and Criminal Docket in his post-trial brief and completely ignored them in his closing argument. 38. Consequently, the Indictment and Criminal Docket are not in evidence to establish any  facts or to demonstrate the unavailability of Edward Collins to lay a foundation for the KPMG Report and the Net Cash Report. C. Conclusion of the Trial 39. After Malek's testimony, the Trustee rested his case. Rather than present evidence, the  Defendants moved for judgment on partial findings pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 7052(c) on the issues of the Ponzi scheme and insolvency. 40. The Court directed the parties to prepare proposed findings of fact and conclusions of  law on the issues of a Ponzi scheme and insolvency. 41. Defendants John Sellis, John Sellas, William G. Cook, William E. Cook, Michael Cook,  Peter Cook, Susan Cook and William Cook Buick Company filed proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. The Defendants adopted these findings and conclusions as their own. 42. Prime Table did not move for entry of judgment under Bankruptcy Rule 7052(c) nor  did it file proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. II. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW A. Jurisdiction and Venue 15   43.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  157(a), 28 U.S.C.  1334(b) and  Internal Operating Procedure 15 of the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. 44. 45. B. This matter is a core proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  157(b)(2)(A), (H), and (O). Venue lies in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1409.  Proof of Fraudulent Transfer in the Context of a Ponzi Scheme 46. The Trustee brings the Complaints under section 548 of the Code and comparable  sections of the UFTA. 47. Section 548 of the Code provides, in relevant part:  (a) (1) The trustee may avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property, or any obligation incurred by the debtor, that was made or incurred on or within one year before the date of the filing of the petition, if the debtor voluntarily, or involuntarily (A) made such transfer or incurred such obligation with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any entity to which the debtor was or became, on or after the date that such transfer was made or such obligation was incurred, indebted; or (B) (i) received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such transfer or obligation; and (ii) (I) was insolvent on the date that such transfer was made or such obligation was incurred, or became insolvent as a result of such transfer or obligation; (II) was engaged in business or a transaction, or was about to engage in business or a transaction, for which any property remaining with the debtor was an unreasonably small capital; or (III) intended to incur, or believed that the debtor would incur, debts that would be beyond the debtor's ability to pay as such debts matured. 11 U.S.C. 548. 16   The comparable section of UFTA provides, in part: (a) A transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor, whether the creditor's claim arose before or after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred, if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation: with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor of the debtor; or without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or obligation, and the debtor: (A) was engaged or was about to engage in a business or a transaction for which the remaining assets of the debtor were unreasonably small in relation to the business or transaction; or intended to incur, or believed or reasonably should have believed that he would incur, debts beyond his ability to pay as they became due.  (1) (2)  (B)  740 ILCS 160/4 (West 2001). 48. ""In a Ponzi scheme, an enterprise makes payments to investors with monies received  from newly attracted investors, rather than from profits of a legitimate business venture. Generally, investors are promised large returns on their investments, and initial investors are in fact paid sizeable returns. The fact of those payments helps to attract new investors, giving the impression that a legitimate business opportunity exists, even though there is no underlying business venture. All the while, promoters draw off money from the scheme, often to finance lavish lifestyles. Ultimately the scheme collapses, as more and more investors need to be attracted into the scheme so that the growing number of investors on top can get paid."" Lake States Commodities, Inc., 253 B.R. 866, 869 n. 2 (citations omitted). 49. Once the enterprise is in bankruptcy, funds obtained by investors from the enterprise  can be recovered for the estate as fraudulent transfers. In re Ramirez Rodriguez, 209 B.R. 424, 431 17   (Bankr.S.D.Tex. 1997) (citations omitted). 50. Section 548(a)(1)(A) requires a showing of fraudulent intent. Some courts have held  that where a bankruptcy trustee relies upon Section 548(a)(1)(A) to recover transfers made by a debtor who allegedly operated a Ponzi scheme, courts will infer intent to defraud on the part of the debtor upon proof that the debtor was indeed operating a Ponzi scheme. Id. at 433 (citations omitted). 51. Section 548(a)(1)(B) requires a showing of constructive intent, by demonstrating inter  alia that the debtor was insolvent. The cases generally concur that if a Ponzi scheme is proven, then the debtor is presumed insolvent from the time of its inception. See id. at 432 (citations omitted); In re Randy, 189 B.R. 425, 441 (N.D.Ill. 1995). 52. The Trustee bears the burden of proof at trial, In re FBN Food Service, Inc., 175 B.R.  671, 678 (Bankr.N.D.Ill. 1994), by preponderance of the evidence, In re Quality Health Care, 215 B.R. 543, 548 (Bankr.N.D.Ind. 1997), appeal denied 2 Gouveia v. I.R.S., 228 B.R. 412 (N.D.Ind. 1998). 53. In order to prove the existence of a Ponzi scheme, the Trustee must establish by a  preponderance of the evidence that (a) (b) deposits were made by investors; the Ponzi scheme operator conducted no legitimate business as represented to investors; (c) the purported business of the Ponzi operator produces no profits or earnings, the source of the funds being new investments by subsequent investors; and (d) payments to new investors were made from the prior investors' funds. 18   Ramirez Rodriguez, 209 B.R. at 431. 54. Because the Trustee's testimony concerning the operations of Lake States, the KPMG  Report and the Net Cash Report were excluded, the only remaining evidence that could serve as proof of the Ponzi scheme and therefore support an inference of actual intent and a presumption of insolvency are Malek's testimony and the Malek Report. 55. The Court must therefore assess the evidentiary weight to give the Malek Report and  Malek's testimony. In this regard, the Court will first consider the weight to ascribe to the Malek Report and testimony given the lack of any other evidence in the record. The Court will next consider the weight to give the Malek Report and testimony in light of the testing of the information forming the basis of the Malek Report and the validation of the underlying sources for the Malek Report. C. Assessing the Evidentiary Weight of the Malek Report (i) 56. Preliminary Considerations Concerning Expert Testimony F.R.E. 702 provides that if the trier of fact needs the assistance of specialized  knowledge, a qualified expert can testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise. 57. First, the Court determines if the proposed expert qualifies as an expert. In the absence  of any objection in this regard and in light of Malek's impressive training and experience, Malek qualifies as an expert. 58. Next, the Court examines the expert's opinion and its efficacy in assisting the litigant in  meeting the applicable burden of proof. As an initial matter, an expert can rely on inadmissable hearsay evidence such as another expert's report, in arriving at an opinion. See e.g., Grant v. Chemrex, Inc., 1997 WL 223071, at *7-8 (N.D.Ill.) (allowing expert witnesses under F.R.E. 703 to rely on hearsay, 19   including other expert's opinions, to form an opinion). The expert cannot, however, certify the truth of a prior expert's opinion. Matter of James Wilson Assoc, 965 F.2d 160, 173 (7th Cir. 1992). 59. Moreover, the inadmissable evidence relied on by the expert is not somehow  transmogrified into admissible evidence simply because an expert relies on it. Id. (""The fact that inadmissable evidence is the (permissible) premise of the expert's opinions does not make that evidence admissible for other purposes, purposes independent of the opinion."") Rather, the hearsay is admitted solely to explain the basis of the expert's opinion, not as proof of the underlying matter. Paddack v. Dave Christensen, Inc., 745 F.2d 1254, 1261-62 (9th Cir. 1984); Engebretsen v. Fairchild Aircraft Corporation, 21 F.3d 721, 728-29 (6th Cir. 1994). 60. Though an expert's opinion may be admissible, the admissibility of the expert's opinion  does not equate with its utility in satisfying a burden of proof. Mid-State Fertilizer Co. v. Exchange Nat. Bank of Chicago , 877 F.2d 1333, 1338 (7th Cir. 1989). The fact finder must still consider the credibility of the expert and determine the weight to be accorded to his or her testimony and report. City of Tuscaloosa v. Harcros Chemicals, Inc., 158 F.3d 548, 564 (11th Cir. 1998) (""As expert evidence, the testimony need only assist the trier of fact, through the application of scientific, technical or specialized expertise, to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. As circumstantial evidence, [the expert's] data and testimony need not prove the plaintiffs' case by themselves; they must merely constitute one piece of the puzzle that the plaintiffs endeavor to assemble before the jury."") (emphasis in original); TK-7 Corp. v. Estate of Barbouti, 993 F.2d 722, 732 (10th Cir. 1993) (""The fact that [the expert] relied upon the report in performing his calculation of lost profits did not relieve the plaintiffs from their burden of proving the underlying assumptions contained in the report.""); Ambrosini 20   v. Labarraque , 101 F.3d 129, 135-36 (D.C.Cir. 1996), cert. dismissed 520 U.S. 1205 (1997) (stressing that expert testimony is used to assist the trier of fact, ""not whether the testimony satisfies the plaintiff's burden on the ultimate issue at trial.""). 61. In this case, given the lack of any other evidence in the record, the Court must consider  whether the Malek Report and his testimony standing alone, carries enough weight to satisfy the Trustee's burden of proof. (ii) The Weight to Be Given the Malek Report in Light of the Absence of Other Evidence in the Record Under F.R.E. 704, the expert's testimony may embrace an ultimate issue to be decided  62.  by the trier of fact. It is clear from the rule's wording that the fact-finding remains with the jury or, in a bench trial, the court. That is why it is unusual, at least to this Court, that the only evidence in this case to prove a fact is expert evidence. Usually, the Court has direct testimonial evidence and business records containing a number of complex facts that the Court requires the expert to summarize into a cogent form and offer an opinion as to what the facts indicate. The Court then considers what credence to give to the expert's opinion and makes the finding of fact in light thereof. This is not to say that a case can categorically never be proven solely with expert testimony. For example, see In re Lollipop, Inc., 205 B.R. 682 (Bankr.E.D.N.Y. 1997), and Ramirez Rodriguez, 209 B.R. 424, where it appears that the only evidence before the courts may have been expert opinion. But, as pointed out by Defendants, the Lollipop and Ramirez Rodriguez opinions were decided on motions for summary judgment, where the analysis was on whether an issue of material fact existed for trial, and the court's function was not to assess the weight or credibility of the evidence. Ortiz v. Ciba-Geigy Corp., 87 F.R.D. 723 (N.D.Ill.  21   1980). There was also no discussion in these cases about whether expert testimony standing alone can satisfy a burden of proof. 63. When there is a dearth of other fact evidence in the record, some courts give the expert  testimony or report little or no evidentiary weight. For example, in the case of In re CSI Enterprises, Inc., 220 B.R. 687 (Bankr.D.Colo. 1998), aff'd, 203 F.3d 834 (10th Cir. 2000), the court found that the chapter 11 trustee failed to satisfy the burden of showing that the debtor was insolvent at the time of the purportedly preferential transfer. The valuation expert in that case prepared a report and advised that to arrive at the conclusions in the report, the expert used a financial statement and other information that he determined to be reliable but that were not in the record. There was no evidence before the court to validate the information contained in the financial statement. As a result, the court disregarded the expert's testimony: Again, while it is appropriate for an expert to testify and formulate his opinion based on hearsay evidence, in this case the Court is being asked to accept [the expert's] hearsay testimony and his value judgment as evidence of the ultimate fact and in lieu of any proof of the actual indebtedness owed by [the debtor] to [the creditor]. On the other hand, [the expert] has testified that he relied on [the financial statement] because he believed that it was probably accurate. There is no reason whatsoever for the Court to accept [the expert's] evaluation as to the amount of the debt. Clearly, it is not an opinion formulated by him after an audit or any search for the truth of the actual amount of the indebtedness. An expert's testimony cannot be used to subvert rules of evidence. Id. at 696 citing Matter of James Wilson Associates, 965 F.2d at 173; see also In re MiniScribe Corp., 241 B.R. 729, 742-43 (Bankr.D.Colo. 1999)(unsubstantiated expert testimony is neither helpful nor persuasive); Sears Roebuck and Co. v. Savoy Reinsurance Co. Ltd., 1991 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16329 at *20 (N.D.Ill.) (""An expert's opinion carries no weight unless the facts he relies on to reach his conclusions are also proven.""); Grant, 1997 WL 223071, at *8; Donnelly v. Ford Motor Co., 80 22   F.Supp.2d 45, 51 (E.D.N.Y. 1999). 64. If there are no facts in evidence, it is difficult to discern how an expert can assist the trier  of fact. There being no other evidence in this record, the Court gives no weight to the Malek Report and therefore cannot accept his conclusion as to insolvency and the existence of a Ponzi scheme. (iii) 65. The Effect of Deficiencies in the Expert Report on its Evidentiary Weight Putting aside the issue of the weight to ascribe the report in the absence of other  evidence, the Malek Report carries no weight due to the lack of meaningful testing of the information upon which it is based and the insufficient validation of the underlying sources. In the CSI case, the court noted that the expert did not conduct an audit of the underlying information he relied upon. CSI Enterprises, 220 B.R. at 696. The expert did not interview the debtor or its employees who were familiar with the financial statement upon which he based his opinion. These factors, along with the absence of the financial statement in the record, lead the court to give no weight to the expert's opinion. Id.; see also Saad v. Shimano American Corp., 2000 WL 1036253, at *21 (N.D.Ill.)(The expert's testimony was admissible, but the court noted that credibility and evidentiary-weight concerns raised by the expert's failure to test certain aspects of his analysis ""is certainly ample fodder for cross examination.""); Noble v. Sheahan, 116 F.Supp.2d 966 (N.D.Ill. 2000)(expert's reliance on another expert's hearsay opinion is a question of weight, not admissibility, and whether the expert's reliance on the first expert's opinion was reasonable is an issue for the trier of fact to be decided at trial). 66. In this matter, Malek, a very well-qualified expert, offered honest and forthright  testimony in good faith. In Malek's opinion, the KPMG Report was accurate and was useful in arriving at his opinion. On the other hand, Malek admitted on cross-examination that he did not perform a 23   statistical sampling of the 11,589 transactions reflected in the KPMG Report. Neither did Malek perform a forensic investigation on whether any other bank accounts or assets existed to determine solvency. In his opinion, a statistical sampling and forensic examination would have cost too much to the estate. Moreover, Malek did not interview any former employees of Lake States. Instead, Malek relied on what the Trustee told him and the KPMG Report stated about the extent of the bank accounts and assets. Malek admits that the KPMG Report is not a complete report, but doubted whether any further work on the KPMG Report would affect his opinion that Lake States was operating a Ponzi scheme. All of these shortcomings are exacerbated by the fact that the KPMG Report or the underlying Business Records upon which it relied were not in evidence. 67. Had the parties requested that the Court exercise its gatekeeping function under F.R.E.  104 and 702. Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993) and Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999), it is conceivable that the Malek Report and testimony might have been excluded. See In re Bonham, 251 B.R. 113 (Bankr.D.Alaska 2000) (court excluded expert testimony because of the lack of substantial factual foundation for his conclusions.) The parties here, however, consented to the admission of the Malek Report. As a result, the evidentiary weight to ascribe to the expert opinions (not the admissibility of the opinions) is the issue. 68. Even though it is clear that Malek is a recognized expert in these type of matters, given  the inadequate showing of meaningful testing and the insufficient validation of the underlying sources, the Court gives the Malek Report no weight. III. 24   ENTRY OF JUDGMENT UNDER BANKRUPTCY RULE 7052(c) A. The Trustee has not Satisfied his Burden of Proof, Therefore, Defendants are Entitled to Judgment Under Bankruptcy Rule 7052(c) 69. Bankruptcy Rule 7052 provides, in part, ""If during a trial without a jury a party has been  fully heard on an issue and the court finds against the party on that issue, the court may enter judgment as a matter of law against that party with respect to a claim or defense that cannot under the controlling law be maintained or defeated without a favorable finding on that issue, or the court may decline to render any judgment until the close of all the evidence."" ""Unlike with a motion for directed verdict, the court makes no special inferences in the plaintiff's favor `nor concerns itself with whether the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case. Instead, the court is to weigh the evidence, resolve any conflicts in it, and decide for itself where the preponderance lies'."" In re Kids Creek Partners, L.P., 212 B.R. 898, 927 (Bankr.N.D.Ill. 1997), aff'd Herzog v. Leighton Holdings, Ltd., 239 B.R. 497 (N.D.Ill. 1999) citing Sanders v. General Services Admin. , 707 F.2d 969, 971 (7th Cir. 1986). 70. As stated above, the Malek Report and Malek's testimony are the only items in  evidence upon the conclusion of the Trustee's case-in-chief. The Court has decided to give no weight to the Malek Report or the Malek testimony because of the lack of underlying admissible evidence, the inadequate showing of meaningful testing of the information forming the basis of the Malek Report and the insufficient validation of underlying sources of the Malek Report. 71. As a result, the Trustee has failed to demonstrate that the Debtors operated a Ponzi  scheme and were therefore insolvent. Consequently, the Trustee is unable to maintain a claim under Sectio ns 548(a)(1)(A) and (a)(1)(B) of the Code and the comparable sections of UFTA and the  25   Defendants are entitled to judgment under Bankruptcy Rule 7052(c). 72. The Court need not address whether it should draw a negative inference from the  absence of the Business Records from the record. B. Entry of Judgment Under Bankruptcy Rule 7052(c) in Favor of Defendant Absent from Trial 73. Prime Table did not attend the trial nor did it join the Defendants in moving for the entry  of judgment under Bankruptcy Rule 7052(c). The question under these circumstances is whether the Court can sua sponte enter judgment on partial findings in favor of Prime Table on the same grounds it entered such a judgment in favor of the Defendants who did participate in the trial and moved under Bankruptcy Rule 7052(c). 74. Courts have inherent powers to sua sponte enter orders in the interest of promoting  judicial efficiency and managing their dockets. See e.g. Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 43; 111 S.Ct. 2123, 2132; 115 L.Ed.2d 27 (1991) (inherent power to enter sanctions); Link v. Wabash Railroad Co., 370 U.S. 626, 629-32; 82 S.Ct. 1386, 1388-89; 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962) (inherent power to dismiss for want of prosecution); Simpson v. Merchants Recovery Bureau, Inc., 171 F.3d 546, 549 (7th Cir. 1999) (inherent power to enter summary judgment under certain circumstances); In re Anthem Communities/RBG, L.L.C., 267 B.R. 867, 876-77 (Bankr.D.Colo. 2001) (inherent power to enter judgment on partial findings). 75. Bankruptcy Rule 7052 is based upon former Rule 41(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil  Procedure which provided, in part: After the plaintiff . . . has completed the presentation of his evidence, the defendant . . . may move for dismissal . . . The court as trier of the facts may then determine them and render 26   judgment against the plaintiff or may decline to render any judgment until the close of all the evidence. 76. The mention in Rule 41(b) of the defendant moving to dismiss did not carry over to  Bankruptcy Rule 7052. Anthem Communities, 267 B.R. at 876. Rule 7052(c) does not mention a requirement for a motion. Moreover, ""[t]he fact . . . that the federal rules do not specifically authorize or describe a particular judicial procedure does not give rise to prohibition of that procedure by negative implication."" Landau & Cleary, Ltd. v. Hribar Trucking, Inc., 867 F.2d 996, 1002 (7th Cir. 1989) citing Link v. Wabash R.R. , 370 U.S. 626, 628, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 1388, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962). 77. Accordingly, there is no prohibition for the Court to exercise its inherent power and sua  sponte enter judgment under Bankruptcy Rule 7052(c). Courts, however, are cautioned to exercise their inherent powers with restraint and discretion. Chambers, 501 U.S. at 44, 111 S.Ct. at 2132. 78. Here, the Trustee put on and rested his case as to the two issues which were identical  to all defendants, including Prime Table, in the joint trial. The Trustee responded to the Defendants' arguments for entry of judgment on partial findings. In addition, the Trustee proceeded with the trial, including this adversary proceeding, and did not move to default the absent Prime Table and has not done so to date. Under the circumstances, the Court in the interest of judicial efficiency and in light of there being no express requirement for a motion under Rule 7052(c), will enter judgment on the merits, notwithstanding Prime Table's absence from the trial. See Silberman v. Wigod, 1988 WL 105305 (N.D.Ill. Oct. 5, 1988) aff'd Silberman v. Wigod, 914 F.2d 260 (7th Cir. 1990) (district court entered judgment against defendant who did not appear at trial not on a default basis but upon the uncontested facts and evidence presented by the plaintiff).  27   IV. CONCLUSION 79. For the reasons stated herein, judgment on partial findings in favor of Prime Table will  be entered by separate order.

Contact Bob Brammer - 515-281-6699.                                                                                           State Sues Initiators of Alleged Illegal Pyramid Scheme                  Defendants are ""responsible for introducing into Iowa an illegal pyramid scheme that has caused incalculable damage to Iowans,"" the suit alleges.                       DES MOINES.    The Attorney General's Office filed a lawsuit today in Polk County District Court alleging that Judy Kelley and Ann Kelley violated the Iowa Consumer Fraud Act by introducing into Iowa ""an illegal pyramid scheme that has caused incalculable damage to Iowans.""     The lawsuit describes a financial recruitment program that went by various names in Iowa, including ""Seasons of Sharing,"" ""Women Empowering Women,"" ""The Original Dinner Party,"" ""Friends Helping Friends,"" and ""The Gifting Board.""  The program claimed to be based on a ""private gifting"" concept.  People recruited to join typically made a so-called ""gift"" of $5,000 and then recruited others to make similar ""gifts"" and recruit still more participants.  The pay-out to early participants after a few rounds of recruitment was as much as $40,000.     ""When this pyramid was raging last year and earlier this year, we felt obligated to take strong measures to discourage it in part because it required such a high entrance fee of $5,000,"" Attorney General Tom Miller said today.  ""We always stated that the pyramid was illegal and outlawed for good reason - because any program that relies entirely on constantly multiplying the number of participants is doomed to failure.  Some people are big winners, but pyramids inevitably leave a pool of losers, and, at $5,000 apiece, we think losses were enormous here in Iowa,"" he said.     ""In this case, we have the unusual circumstance that we are able to file consumer fraud charges naming the persons we allege introduced this pyramid to our state,"" Miller said.             Defendants in the suit are Ann Kelley of Ft. Wayne, Indiana, and Judy          Kelley of West Des Moines, mother-in-law of Ann Kelley. Miller did not          rule out consumer fraud suits naming others.     The lawsuit alleges that Ann Kelley was an active participant in a ""gifting pyramid"" involving people in Indiana and other states, and that Ann expanded the activity into Iowa by recruiting her mother-in-law, Judy Kelley, to become active in the pyramid.  The suit alleges that Ann Kelley was sent thousands of dollars by Iowa residents who were recruited as a direct result of Ann's recruitment of Judy Kelley.     A person entering the pyramid - usually depicted as an inverted triangle in promotional materials -- paid $5,000.  Further recruitment would push the person to the pay-out position to receive as much as $40,000, or $5,000 from eight new recruits.  The time from entry to pay-out was often a matter of weeks, but sometimes a matters of days or even less, the suit alleged.     ""This program gained enormous momentum in Iowa,"" Miller said.  Hundreds and perhaps thousands of Iowans paid as much as $5,000 to enter.       Miller said the program may still be operating at a reduced and concealed level in the Des Moines area, and that it appears to be active in other pockets of the state, most recently in parts of northern Iowa.     ""The lynch-pin for promoters was the claim that the payments were gifts,"" Miller said.  ""They claimed the so-called 'gifting' avoided violation of pyramid laws and made the program legal, and they claimed the so-called gifts people received were not taxable and did not need to be reported as income.  We allege these all were misrepresentations, and we have said so repeatedly.""     Miller was joined in a news conference at his office by Michael C. Loughran of the Internal Revenue Service and Don Cooper of the Iowa Department of Revenue and Finance.  Loughran and Cooper said that federal and state revenue departments have determined and stated publicly that such proceeds are not ""gifts"" under the law and also must be reported as income.  (Loughran is Iowa Territory manager for Taxpayer Education and Communication for the IRS, and Cooper is Administrator of the Compliance Division for the Iowa Dept. of Revenue and Finance.)     ""Our suit alleges the gifting angle was a ruse,"" Miller said.  ""The payments wouldn't have been made except that they were embedded in an elaborate pyramid scheme.  In fact, this was the rawest form of pyramid, where there was no pretense of marketing a product.  Money simply flowed from new recruits to people at the apex of the pyramid.""     Miller emphasized that the alleged pyramid has harmed Iowans.  ""There was enormous financial damage, and untold emotional damage as well,"" he said.  ""People who lost money were left blaming friends, relatives, neighbors and co-workers who got them into it.  In addition, this has taxed the scarce resources of law enforcement authorities and the court system as they worked to minimize the harm and undo the damage.""     The lawsuit asks the court to enter an injunction, order restitution of funds, and assess civil penalties up to $40,000 for each violation of the Consumer Fraud Act.                  - 30          -"

Gerling, Chief U.S. Bankruptcy Judge MEMORANDUM-DECISION, FINDINGS OF FACT CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND ORDER In this adversary proceeding, the chapter 11 trustee, Richard C. Breeden (""Trustee""), seeks to avoid and recover as fraudulent transfers certain pre-petition payments made to Nelson Fernandes (""Defendant"") by Aloha Leasing, a Division of The Bennett Funding Group, Inc. ROBERT LIDDELL, ESQ. Of Counsel ADV. PRO. NO. 98-41254A CASE NO. 96-61376 Chapter 11 Substantively Consolidated   2 (""BFG"").1 On August 28, 2001, Defendant filed a motion in the form of a letter brief for summary judgment, seeking amendment or vacatur of an Order of this Court, dated November 13, 1998 (""Vacatur Motion""). Defendant also filed a separate motion on August 28, 2001, seeking dismissal of the adversary proceeding and requesting sanctions against the Trustee pursuant to Rule 9011(b) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure (""Fed.R.Bank.P."") (""Dismissal Motion""). The Trustee filed opposition to the motions on September 10, 2001. Both motions were heard at the Court's motion term on September 13, 2001, in Utica, New York. Following oral argument, the parties were afforded an opportunity to file memoranda of law, and the matter was submitted for decision on October 9, 2001.  JURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT  The Court has jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter of the adversary proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1334 and 157(a), (b)(1), (b)(2)(A), and (H).  FACTS  On or about August 30, 1989, the Defendant was issued an assignment of a purported lease of equipment between Aloha Leasing, as lessor, and the State of New Jersey, as lessee. See  1  The Trustee serves as the chapter 11 trustee of the consolidated estates of BFG, Bennett Receivables Corporation, Bennett Receivables Corporation II, Bennett Management and Development Corporation, The Processing Center, Inc., Resort Service Company, Inc., American Marine International, Ltd. and Aloha Capital Corporation (collectively, the ""Debtors"").   3 Exhibit A, attached to the Dismissal Motion. Under the terms of the assignment, Defendant was assigned as to the financial ability of the Lessee to pay its entire right, title and interest in and to the annexed above named lease (the Lease), including all rental and other payments due and to become due thereunder . . . . See id. At the time of the assignment, the alleged aggregate unpaid rentals totaled $18,720. See id. The amount of investment listed in the Statement of Purchased Leases, identifying the Defendant as the assignee, totaled $16,472.62, with a monthly payment of $520 over 36 months. See Exhibit D, attached to the Dismissal Motion. The Trustee commenced the adversary proceeding by the filing of a complaint (""Complaint"") on February 12, 1998. Relevant to the motion herein, the Trustee's second cause of action brought pursuant to Code  544(b) and  271-276 of the New York Debtor and Creditor Law (""NYD&CL""), seeks a determination that payments made to the Defendant by BFG within six years of March 29, 1996, are voidable. See  32 of the Complaint. According to Exhibit A, attached to the Complaint, the Trustee sought to recover $2,247.38, the difference between the initial investment of $16,472.62 and the amount of the payments made to the Defendant of $18,720. However, Trustee allegedly notified Defendant that he had withdrawn any claims for recovery of payments made to the Defendant prior to March 29, 1990.2 On March 13, 1998, the Defendant filed his Answer to the Complaint and also asserted 2  According to the Settlement Package sent to the Defendant on or about March 14, 2001, the amount invested was $14,009.44 and payments received between March 30, 1990 and August 30, 1992, totaled $15,600. Trustee seeks to recover $1,590.56 representing the interest received on the initial investment. See Exhibit G, attached to Defendant's Dismissal Motion. Under the settlement formula, Trustee sought payment from the Defendant of $118.11 if made by July 12, 2001. See Exhibit C of Affidavit of Mark D. Sonnelitter, sworn to on August 3, 2001, and filed on August 6, 2001, in support of the Trustee's Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendant's Motion.   4 a counterclaim to which the Trustee filed an answer on June 23, 1998. The counterclaim, labeled as a ""Cross-claim,"" seeks $10,000 in damages for intentional emotional distress, as well as costs and attorney's fees as a result of the Trustee's ""fallacious claims."" As factual background in his Complaint, the Trustee alleges that the Debtors had ""engaged in the apparent business of equipment leasing and financing through which the Debtors conducted a Ponzi scheme . . . The Debtors financed their capital and cash flow needs through a Ponzi scheme accomplished by, among other things, (i) obtaining investments and leases by pledging the same lease multiple times to investors and pledging that same lease to a financial institution and (ii) pledging to investors fictitious leases.""3 See Complaint at  9. The Complaint further alleges that the Defendant acquired one or more of these investments, receiving payments in excess of the investment amount. The Trustee seeks to recover either the total amount of the payments or, in the alternative, the excess of the amount invested, as fraudulent transfers. On November 13, 1998, the Court signed an Order staying the adversary proceedings commenced against the former investor defendants, including the Defendant herein, ""until further order of the Court."" (""Stay Order"")  DISCUSSION  Vacatur Motion  3  In the Trustee's Supplemental Memorandum of Law, filed October 9, 2001, it is alleged that the lease assigned to the Defendant was fictitious.   5 Defendant asserts that the Complaint fails to state a cause of action and even if it were determined to be valid, it is unfair to him and others similarly situated not to be able to present a position and have the matter decided. Defendant contends that the settlement offers made by the Trustee arguably violate the Stay Order. The Trustee argues that it was the settlement process that was the basis for the Trustee seeking the Stay Order in the first place. The Trustee estimates that within 30-60 days of the hearing on Defendant's motion (September 13, 2001), any extensions granted to the defendants will have run out and at that point, the Trustee could ""deal with what's left."" Given that almost 180 days have elapsed since said hearing, the Court will grant the Defendant's Vacatur Motion and vacate that portion of its Stay Order which applies to him and other ""non-settled"" former investor defendants based on the representations made by the Trustee's counsel at the hearing that he needed at most 60 days to complete the settlement process. Dismissal Motion As an initial matter, the Defendant raises a question concerning the standing of the Trustee to file a complaint against him on behalf of Aloha Leasing, which is not named as one of the Debtors. Defendant points out that the assignment he received was executed in the name of ""Aloha Leasing."" However, as this Court has previously found, ""Aloha Leasing"" was simply the trade name used by BFG in many of its transactions. See In re The Bennett Funding Group, Inc., 203 B.R. 30, 37 (Bankr. N.D.N.Y. 1996). It is BFG which is the legal entity and a debtor herein, and it is BFG whose rights are being asserted by the Trustee. Indeed, the assignment given to the Defendant is captioned ""Aloha Leasing, A Division of The Bennett Funding Group,   6 Inc."" See Exhibit A, attached to the Dismissal Motion. Therefore, the Court concludes that the Trustee has standing to file the Complaint on behalf of BFG. Defendant also seeks to have the Trustee's Complaint dismissed on the basis that it fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.4 As a basis for his Dismissal Motion, the Defendant contends that there is a legal distinction between ""pledge"" and ""assignment."" The Defendant asserts that the lease was assigned to him and he owns it.5 Therefore, any payments received by the Trustee from the lessee were received as an agent or conduit. Under this theory, Defendant argues that the payments to the Defendant in no way diminished the Debtors' estate. The Defendant asserts that the Trustee's use of the word ""pledge"" in the Complaint, rather than ""assignment,"" is simply an attempt by the Trustee to place BFG in a position of having retained ownership of the lease. The Court interprets the Defendant's motion as one brought pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (""Fed.R.Civ.P.""), made applicable to this proceeding by Fed.R.Bankr.P. 7012. In considering such a motion, the Court must accept all of the nonmovant's allegations as true, and will grant the motion to dismiss ""only if it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that can be proved consistent with the allegations."" Hishon v. King & Spaulding, 467 U.S. 69, 73, 104 S.Ct. 2229, 2232, 81 L.Ed.2d (1984) (citation 4  The Trustee's first cause of action, based on Code  548, is appropriately dismissed since it applies only to transfers made one year prepetition. As the last payment to the Defendant was August 30, 1992, there is no factual basis for the Trustee to seek recovery from the Defendant on his first cause of action. See Exhibit G, attached to Defendant's Dismissal Motion. 5  Although a letter addressed to the Defendant from BFG references the enclosure of the ""municipal lease"" along with copies of the assignment, the Defendant acknowledges that he did not have either an original or a copy of the lease in his possession.   7 omitted). While Defendant takes exception to the Trustee's labeling the transaction as a ""pledge,"" pursuant to NYD&CL  270, ""pledge"" is included in the definition of ""conveyance,"" as is ""assignment"" and the ""payment of money."" In this case, the Trustee is seeking to avoid and recover payments made to the Defendant between March 30, 1990 and August 30, 1992. He is not seeking to avoid the underlying transaction, whether labeled as an ""assignment"" or ""pledge."" 6  In order to succeed with his second cause of action based on Code  544(b) and NYD&CL  273-275 for constructive fraud, the Trustee must prove (1) that the transfer or conveyance was made for less than fair consideration and (2) that at the time of the transaction, the transferor was either insolvent, a defendant in an action for money damages, engaged in a business with unreasonably small capital or about to incur debts beyond its ability to pay. See Breeden v. Thomas, Adv. Pro. 98-40892, slip op. at 8-9 (Bankr. N.D.N.Y. April 29, 1999) (citation omitted). Under NYD&CL  276, a transfer is avoidable if it is made ""with actual intent, as distinguished from intent presumed in law, to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors."" Id. at 7-8. The Defendant does not deny receiving the payments identified by the Trustee in his Complaint. He simply argues that the payments were rightfully his based on the assignment. This argument, of course, presupposes that a lease existed and that the payments  6  The Defendant also argues that since the Trustee cannot make a claim for as the owner of the leases, the Trustee's only alternative would have assignment itself. Defendant correctly points out that since the assignment than six years prepetition, the statute of limitations prevents the Trustee assignment as fraudulent pursuant to Code  544.  the lease payments been to attack the was executed more from avoiding the   8 were made by the lessee7 to BFG, which in turn made payments to the Defendant. As noted above, on a motion made pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), the Court must examine the Trustee's allegations and determine whether there is any set of facts which would warrant a finding in favor of the Trustee. At a minimum, if the Trustee is able to establish that no such lease existed, then it is conceivable that the Trustee will be able to prove a lack of fair consideration by BFG's payment of interest from its own assets to the Defendant and that either BFG was insolvent or perhaps about to incur debts beyond its ability to pay at the time the payments were made to the Defendants. Accordingly, at this stage of the proceeding, it would be inappropriate to dismiss the Complaint insofar as it asserts a claim for constructive fraud. With respect to the Trustee's claim for actual fraud pursuant to NYD&CL  276, it is the state of mind of the transferor (and not the actions or intent of the transferee) that are relevant. Assuming that the Trustee's allegations are true for purposes of this motion, including the allegation that the Defendant's lease did not exist, then the Trustee should have an opportunity to establish that the payments were made by BFG with the intent to defraud its creditors. Therefore, the Court will also deny Defendant's request for dismissal of the Complaint insofar as it alleges a cause of action based on actual fraud pursuant to NYD&CL  276. In the context of the Dismissal Motion, the Defendant also requests that the Court impose sanctions against the Trustee. Defendant argues that in claiming that the Debtors ""pledged"" the lease to the Defendant, the Trustee was well aware of the position taken by the Securities Exchange Commission that what was offered to investors such as the Defendant were ""lease  7  As noted above, according to the documents presented by the Defendant, the lessee was the State of New Jersey.   9 assignments."" Therefore, the Trustee had no legal basis for filing a Complaint against the Defendant alleging that the lease was ""pledged"" to him. Having found that the Trustee's second cause of action in his Complaint states a claim for which the possibility of relief exists, the Court must deny Plaintiff's request for sanctions. Whether the transaction between BFG and the Defendant involved a pledge or an assignment of leases is of no import if the Trustee is able to establish that the lease did not exist, as suggested in his Complaint and more specifically set forth in the affidavit of Frank T. Halligan, sworn to October 4, 2001. Based on the foregoing, it is hereby ORDERED that the Defendant's motion seeking vacatur of the Stay Order of November 13, 1998, as applicable to former investor defendants who have not agreed to the settlement offered by the Trustee, including the Defendant herein, is granted; it is further ORDERED that the Defendant's motion seeking dismissal of the Trustee's Complaint is granted with respect to the First Cause of Action, which is based on Code  548; it is further ORDERED that the Defendant's motion seeking dismissal of the Trustee's Complaint is denied with respect to the Second Cause of Action, which is based on Code  544(b) and NYD&CL  271-276, and it is finally ORDERED that the Defendant's motion requesting sanctions pursuant to Fed.R.Bankr.P. 9011 is denied.

GX238-66-15132710	"IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA  OFFICIAL COMMITTEE OF UNSECURED CREDITORS v. WILLIAM SHAPIRO, et al.  : : : : : : MEMORANDUM  CIVIL ACTION1  No. 99-526  Ludwig, J.  January 7, 2000 By order of November 2, 1999, the parties were directed sua sponte  to show cause why the claims against defendants Cogen, Sklar, L.L.P. and R.F. Lafferty & Co., Inc. should not be severed from plaintiff's remaining claims. Plaintiff's claims against Cogen, Sklar, L.L.P. and R.F. Lafferty & Co., Inc. had been dismissed for reasons inapplicable to the other defendants. Order, Sept. 8, 1999. In addition to moving for reconsideration of the dismissal, plaintiff moved, in the alternative, that the order of dismissal be certified for appeal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). The motion was denied. Order, Nov. 2, 1999. In the meantime, on  The Clerk is directed to send a copy of this memorandum and order to the Bankruptcy Court -- In re Walnut Leasing Co., Inc. and Equipment Leasing Corp. of America, Inc., Bankr. No. 97-19699.  1   October 4, 1999, the other defendants2 filed a third-party complaint against Cogen, Sklar3 under Fed. R. Civ. P. 14(a).4 To simplify this litigation and in the interests of judicial economy, plaintiff's dismissed claims against Cogen, Sklar and Lafferty will be severed and transferred to a separate, new action. Fed. R. Civ. P. 21. Defendants' third-party claim will remain in the original action.  Background The facts of this case are set forth in prior opinions. See mem., Sept. 8, 1999, at 2. The Shapiros and the other defendants are alleged to have operated Equipment Leasing Company of America, Inc. (ELCOA) and Walnut Leasing Company, Inc. (Walnut) as a ""de facto Ponzi scheme."" Compl.  66. The issuance of a large amount of debt certificates ultimately resulted in Walnut and ELCOA obtaining Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on August 8, 1997.5 The other defendants are William Shapiro, Kenneth Shapiro, Deljean Shapiro, Lester Shapiro, Nathan Tattar, Adam Varrenti, Jr., John Orr, Philip Bagley, Welco Securities, Inc., The Law Offices of William Shapiro, Esquire, P.C., Financial Data, Inc., and Walnut Associates, Inc. 3 2  Only Cogen, Sklar was named in the third-party complaint for  contribution. In response to the show-cause order, these defendants opposed severance on the ground of the third-party joinder. Plaintiff and the dismissed defendants do not oppose severance. The debt certificates are the subject of a related securities fraud class action by the certificate holders. See Neuberger v. Shapiro, Civ. A. No. 97-7947 (E.D. Pa.). A third, related action is Baker v. Summit Bank, Civ. A. (continued...) 2 5 4   On August 21, 1997, an Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors was appointed by the United States Trustee. On January 19, 1999 Bankruptcy Judge Sigmund approved a stipulation between the debtors and the Committee authorizing the Committee to file suit on behalf of the two bankrupt debtor corporations. See In re Walnut Leasing Company, Inc. and Equipment Leasing Company of America, Inc., Bankr. No. 97-19699 (Bankr. E.D. Pa.)(order, Jan. 19, 1999). According to the complaint that followed, the corporations' officers and directors, led by the Shapiro defendants, were responsible for the debtors' fraudulent issuance of debt certificates ""past the point of insolvency and thus without the ability to repay their obligations to investors."" Compl.  53. Prior to filing for bankruptcy protection, the debtors owed principal balances on debt certificates in excess of $51,317,000. See Baker v. Summit Bank, Civ. A. No. 992010 (E.D. Pa.)(compl. at 15). The Committee also sued the debtors' auditor -- Cogen, Sklar, L.L.P. -- and their underwriter -- R.F. Lafferty & Co. -- as professionals who had facilitated the fraudulentscheme. However, on Rule 12 motions, these defendants were dismissed from the complaint based on the doctrine of in pari delicto. ""Since it is pleaded that the debtors, acting through the Shapiros, perpetrated the Ponzi scheme with the assistance of Cogen, Sklar and Lafferty, the doctrine of in pari delicto . . . bars plaintiff from suing these defendants for claims arising out of the  (...continued) No. 99-2010 (E.D. Pa.)(class action against the indentured trustee). Although not formally consolidated, the three actions have been case-managed jointly. 3  5   fraud."" Order, Sept. 8, 1999, at 11. The dismissal motion of the other defendants was denied. Id.  Analysis Two types of severances or separations of claims are contemplated by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure -- one within the action itself, the other resulting in a second, or new, action. Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 21: ""Parties may be dropped or added by order of the court on motion of any party or of its own initiative at any stage of the action and on such terms as are just. Any claim against a party may be severed and proceeded with separately."" Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b): The court, in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive to expedition and economy, may order a separate trial of any claim, cross-claim, counterclaim, or third-party claim, or of any separate issue or of any number of claims, cross-claims, counterclaims, third-party claims, or issues, always preserving inviolate the right of trial by jury as declared by the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution or as given by a statute of the United States. Under Rule 42(b), there may simply be a separate trial or trials. Under Rule 21, there may be a separate action. See 8 James Wm. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice  42.20(2) (3d ed. 1999)(""The creation of new cases provides the key distinction between Rule 42(b) bifurcation and Rule 21 severance.""). Determinations of claims that are severed pursuant to Rule 21 are final and appealable without the need for certification under Rule 54(b) -- unlike claims that are bifurcated under Rule 42(b). See U.S. ex rel. LaCorte v. Smithkline 4   Beechum, 149 F.3d 227, 231 (3d Cir. 1998)(""severed claim proceeds as a discrete suit and results in its own final judgment from which appeal may be taken""); Sidag Aktiengesellschaft v. Smoked Food Prods. Co., 813 F.2d 81, 84 (5th Cir. 1987)(""[T]he . . . severed claim becomes an entirely separate judicial unit, so that a final adjudication of it is appealable, notwithstanding that there remain unresolved claims pending in the original action from which the severance was granted and that no Rule 54(b) certificate has been issued.""); United States v. O'Neil, 709 F.2d 361, 368 (5th Cir. 1983)(""Where a single claim is severed out of a suit, it proceeds as a discrete, independent action, and a court may render final, appealable judgment in either one of the resulting two actions notwithstanding the existence of unresolved claims in the other.""); 4 James Wm. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice  21.06(1) (3d ed. 1999). Rule 21 is titled ""Misjoinder and Non-Joinder of Parties."" However, it may be used to organize problematical issues other than joinder problems. 4 Moore's Federal Practice  21.02(1) (""The courts have properly concluded that they may issue orders under Rule 21 even in the absence of misjoinder and non-joinder of parties, to construct a case for the efficient administration of justice.""). In addition, the Rule explicitly provides authority to sever parties sua sponte ""on such terms as are just."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 21; see Stark v. Indep. Sch. Distr. No. 640, 163 F.R.D. 557, 564 (D. Minn. 1995)(""the underlying purpose of Rules 19, 20 and 21 is to allow the district court itself to exercise its power to align the  5   parties and the issues presented in a single lawsuit in a way that will foster judicial efficiency, while protecting parties against prejudice.""). Whether severance is warranted requires balancing of several considerations, including ""the convenience of the parties, avoidance of prejudice to either party, and promotion of the expeditious resolution of the litigation."" German v. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., 896 F.2d 1385, 1400 n.6 (2d Cir. 1995), citing Sutton Hill Assocs. v. Landes, Civ. A. No. 87-8452, 1988 WL 56710, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 25, 1988)(distinguishing between the effects of Rule 21 and Rule 42(b), though ""the same concerns are considered by the court""). Specific factors are ""(1) whether the issues sought to be tried separately are significantly different from one another, (2) whether the separable issues require the testimony of different witnesses and different documentary proof, (3) whether the party opposing the severance will be prejudiced if it is granted, and (4) whether the party requesting the severance will be prejudiced if it is not granted."" Germanv.Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., 896 F.2d at 1400; see Fanning v. Black & Decker, Civ. A. No. 98-6141, 1999 WL 163628, at *3 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 18, 1999). In the present instance, that analysis favors severing the claims of the plaintiff Committee against Cogen, Sklar and Lafferty from those against the other defendants and transferring them to a new action. The third-party claim against Cogen, Sklar will remain in the original action. The progress toward trial that has occurred in this triad of complex cases and the distinctiveness of the dismissal  6   issues on appeal tip the balance toward finality as to the dismissed claims.  6  Plaintiff advocates severance -- so that ""any potential recoveries can be made and distributed as soon as possible and the entire matter brought to a close."" Pl. response at 3. As against this request for prompt disposition, the sole prejudice asserted by the other defendants is the presence of the third-party contribution claim. See Freedom Int'l Trucks, Inc. of New Jersey v. Eagle Enters., Inc., Civ. A. No. 97-4237, 1998 WL 695397, at *4 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 5, 1998)(""I find that the prejudice to [plaintiff] if the proceedings are stalled further, combined with the lack of any clear showing of prejudice to [defendants], outweighs the potential inefficiencies in discovery or multiple trials.""). Third-party defendant Cogen, Sklar is not a necessary or indispensable party to the original claim that would render severance inconvenient or prejudicial. Fed. R. Civ. P. 19. ""A motion to sever pursuant to Rule 21  necessarily requires the Court to consider whether the party is `indispensable' to the litigation . . . ."" Fanning v. Black & Decker, 1999 WL 163628, at *1 (citing Provident Tradesmens Bank & Trust Co. v. Patterson, 390 U.S. 102, 119 (1968)). Indispensability is determined under Fed. R. Civ. P. 19, using a two-step inquiry. Under 19(a) 7  is the party necessary?  If so, under 19(b), is the party  Once severed, the appeal of the dismissal would not result in the removal of jurisdiction over the original action. Satisfaction of Rule 19(a) requires a showing that 1) relief cannot be accorded without the third party; 2) an adjudication of the parties' rights ""would impair or impede an absent party's ability to protect its interests in the (continued...) 7 7  6   indispensable? See Janney Montgomery Scott, Inc. v. Shepard Niles, Inc., 11 F.3d 399, 404-05 (3d Cir. 1993); Fanning, 1999 WL 163628, at *2. A third party that is sued for contribution is not a necessary party without whom complete relief is unaffordable. See Janney Montgomery Scott, Inc., 11 F.3d at 412; Bank of  America v. Rittenhouse Assocs., 844 F.2d 1050, 1054-55 (3d Cir. 1988); Rodin Properties-Shore Mall N.V. v. Cushman & Wakefield of Pa., Inc., 49 F.Supp.2d 709, 720 (D.N.J. 1999); Hershock v. Fiascki, Civ. A. No. 90-0497, 1992 WL 310525, at *2 (E.D. Pa. Oct. 22, 1992). Plaintiff's claims against the other defendants do not require the presence of Cogen, Sklar or Lafferty as parties, although their employees may be called upon to participate as witnesses. Moreover, Cogen, Sklar's interests as a third party are not implicated by waiting until resolution of the main action. If defendants prevail at trial, Cogen, Sklar will not be subject to contribution; if plaintiff prevails, the contribution claims would still have to be proved. In any case, none of the parties will be subject to multiple or inconsistent liability if the action against Cogen, Sklar and Lafferty is tried separately -- Cogen, Sklar and Lafferty have no claims against the other parties, and the contribution claim is precluded only if liability is not established against the other defendants.  (...continued) subject matter of the litigation""; and 3) there would otherwise be a substantial risk of multiple or inconsistent obligations. Janney Montgomery Scott, Inc. v. Shepard Niles, Inc., 11 F.3d at 405-11; Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a). 8  7   Conclusion On motion, plaintiff's claims against defendants Cogen, Sklar and Lafferty were dismissed. Order, Sept. 8, 1999. On October 4, 1999 Cogen, Sklar was brought back into the case as a third-party defendant. Thereafter, plaintiff's motion for reconsideration of the dismissal or for certification for appellate appeal was denied. Order, Nov. 2, 1999. A severance of the dismissed claims is justified, feasible, and a sensible approach to appealability that is not vitiated by other considerations. An order accompanies this memorandum.  Edmund V.

(Mich Dept of Attorney General Web Site - www.ag.state.mi.us)   STATE OF MICHIGAN   FRANK J. KELLEY, ATTORNEY GENERAL     Opinion No. 5994   September 30, 1981    CONSTITUTIONAL LAW:     Const 1963, art 3, Sec. 2--separation of powers    GOVERNOR:     Executive privilege    LEGISLATURE:     Advice and consent function of Senate     The Governor, in invoking the doctrine of executive privilege, is not an absolute sovereign, nor is the Senate, in requesting documents from persons appointed to public office subject to advice and consent of the Senate, permitted to conduct an unfettered inquisition.  Both branches of state government are subject to restraint and responsible to the people.  The third branch of government, the judiciary, may, if necessary, balance the competing interests after an  in camera  review of the documents.     The Senate, in exercising its advice and consent power as to appointments to the head of a principal department, may subpoena documents of a department head addressed to the Governor or his principal advisors.  If the Governor, in response to the subpoena, invokes the doctrine of executive privilege which is his right and, in the event the Senate seeks enforcement of the subpoena before an appropriate court, the court will balance the interest of the Governor to maintain confidentiality as to all documents relating to the shaping of policies and the making of decisions by the Governor and the right of the Senate to have information about the qualifications of a person appointed to the head of a principal department.    Honorable William G. Milliken   Governor   The Capitol   Lansing, Michigan    Honorable William Faust   State Senator   The Capitol   Lansing, Michigan     You have requested my opinion on questions concerning the authority of the Committee on Senate Administration and Rules to require a newly appointed director of a principal state department to produce copies of official correspondence issued under his or her signature.  (1)   The material was requested during the 60 session days following the director's appointment as the head of such department.  (2)   Your questions relate to the Senate's responsibility to render advice and consent to gubernatorial appointments.     Your questions may be summarized as follows:       1.  May the Committee require, over objections of the Governor, that an appointee who has been serving as director of a state department provide copies of communications from the appointee to: (a) the Governor, and (b) principal advisors to the Governor?     2.  If so, may the appointee refuse to disclose such communications which contain the appointee's opinions or recommendations or requests for executive action or approval?       These relate to the role of the Senate with regard to the appointment of the head of a principal department.     Const 1963, art 5, Sec. 6 provides:       'Appointment by and with the advice and consent of the senate when used in this constitution or laws in effect or hereafter enacted means subject to disapproval by a majority vote of the members elected to and serving in the senate if such action is taken within 60 session days after the date of such appointment.  Any appointment not disapproved within such period shall stand confirmed.'       In Const 1963, art 5, Sec. 3, in pertinent part, the people have provided:       'When a single executive is the head of a principal department, unless elected or appointed as otherwise provided in this constitution, he shall be appointed by the governor by and with the advice and consent of the senate.  . . .'       The Executive Organization Act of 1965, 1965 PA 380, Sec. 508, MCLA 16.608; MSA 3.29(508), also provides:       'When a single executive is the head of a principal department, unless elected as provided in the Constitution, he shall be appointed by the Governor by and with the advice and consent of the senate . . .'       Const 1963, art 5, Sec. 6 prescribes neither standards for the Senate to follow nor guidelines to be adhered to when a nomination by the Governor is under review.  In fact, past practice has been that when nominations are rejected no formal reasons are necessarily given and no justifications for the decision presented.     It is within the sole prerogative of the Governor to select individuals deemed most suitable to occupy such office.  That prerogative is limited only insofar as necessary to assure that the candidate meets the specific legal qualifications for the position.   People ex rel Attorney General  v Galbraith, 163 Mich 47; 127 NW 771 (1910).     Once the appointment is laid before the Senate, that body may disapprove it or allow the appointment to stand by inaction extending over 60 session days.  The Senate has absolute authority to disapprove an appointment for any reason whatsoever.  Its decision is purely a legislative one.   Attorney General ex rel McKenzie  v Warner, 299 Mich 172; 300 NW 63 (1941);  People ex rel Clay  v Stuart, 74 Mich 411; 41 NW 1091 (1889); Attorney General ex rel Dust v Oakman, 126 Mich 717; 86 NW 151 (1901); OAG, 1965-1966, No 4531, p 393, 412 (December 27, 1966).     In performing its duty to give advice and consent to gubernatorial appointments, the Senate may quite properly seek all available information relevant to the ability and likelihood of an appointee to effectively administer a state department in the public interest, as well as under the constitutional power of the Senate, to give advice and consent.     It should be noted that both questions are premised on the objections to disclosure having been based upon the Freedom of Information Act, 1976 PA 442, MCLA 15.231  et seq ; MSA 4.1801(1)  et seq , and the Governor's assertion of executive privilege.     The doctrine of executive privilege is found in no statute.  Moreover, efforts to locate any reported Michigan case which is based upon the doctrine of 'executive privilege' have proved fruitless.  President George Washington's cabinet is credited with first articulating the principle denoted by that term, though the actual assertion of executive privilege came later.  41-42 University of Missouri Kansas City Law Review, 374, 383 (1974),  Executive Privilege to Withhold Information From Congress: Constitutional or Political Doctrine?   The consitutional foundation for the doctrine is said to be the separation of powers among the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government.  24 Emory Law J, 405, 406,  Comments:  United States  v  Nixon and the Freedom of Information Act:  New Impetus for Agency Disclosure?      The United States Supreme Court confronted the issue of executive privilege in  United States  v Nixon, 418 US 683; 41 L Ed 2d 1039; 94 S Ct 3090 (1974).  A grand jury issued an indictment against several individuals charging various offenses including conspiracy to defraud the United States and to obstruct justice.  The President of the United States was named as an unindicted coconspirator.  At the request of the special prosecutor, the district court issued a third-party subpoena  duces tecum  directing the President to produce, for the use at the pending criminal trial, certain tape recordings and documents relating to his conversations with aides and advisors.  The President moved to quash the subpoena on the grounds that the materials were within his executive privilege against disclosure of confidential communications.  The court unanimously upheld the constitutional validity of the doctrine of executive privilege.     In Nixon, supra, 418 US 705, 706, the court stated:       'Whatever the nature of the privilege of confidentiality of Presidential communications in the exercise of Art II powers, the privilege can be said to derive from the supremacy of each branch within its own assigned area of constitutional duties.  Certain powers and privileges flow from the nature of enumerated powers; the protection of the confidentiality of Presidential communications has similar constitutional underpinnings.'       Tracing the practical need and the constitutional foundation for the doctrine of executive privilege, the court held:       'The expectation of a President to the confidentiality of his conversations and correspondence, like the claim of confidentiality of judicial deliberations, for example, has all the values to which we accord deference for the privacy of all citizens and, added to those values, is the necessity for protection of the public interest in candid, objective, and even blunt or harsh opinions in Presidential decision making.  A President and those who assist him must be free to explore alternatives in the process of shaping policies and making decisions and to do so in a way many would be unwilling to express except privately.  . . .'  Nixon, supra, 418 US 683, 708       Yet, the court rejected the argument that the executive privilege is absolute, unfettered by countervailing values:       '. . . neither the doctrine of separation of powers, nor the need for confidentiality of high-level communications, without more, can sustain an absolute, unqualified Presidential privilege of immunity from judicial process under all circumstances.  The President's need for complete candor and objectivity from advisers calls for great deference from the courts.  However, when the privilege depends solely on the broad, undifferentiated claim of public interest in the confidentiality of such conversations, a confrontation with other values arises.'  Nixon, supra, 418 US 683, 706       Deciding between the opposing constitutional interests of two equal branches of government was held to require a balancing of the respective interests and the court determined that the subpoena  duces tecum  would be enforced.      United States  v Nixon, supra, applied the doctrine of executive privilege to circumstances in which the judicial branch sought disclosure of information for a pending criminal case, not a congressional inquiry.   United States  v Nixon, supra, 418 US at 712, fn 19.  However, the doctrine of executive privilege has also been applied to a senate committee effort to obtain enforcement of a subpoena  duces tecum  directed to the President.   Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities  v Nixon, 498 F2d 725 (1974).  (3)     The relative authority of the Michigan Legislature and Governor must be examined to determine whether, or to what extent, the principles of  United States  v  Nixon, supra , and Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities v  Nixon, supra , are applicable under Michigan law.     Const 1963, art 3, Sec. 2 allocated the powers of government among the three branches as follows:       'The powers of government are divided into three branches; legislative, executive and judicial.  No person exercising powers of one branch shall exercise powers properly belonging to another brach except as expressly provided in this constitution.'       In  People ex rel Sutherland  v Governor, 29 Mich 320 (1874), the Michigan Supreme Court explained the nature of that separation of powers, stating:       'Our government is one whose powers have been carefully apportioned between three distinct departments, which emanate alike from the people, have their powers alike limited and defined by the constitution, are of equal dignity, and within their respective spheres of action equally independent.  One makes the laws, another applies the laws in contested cases, while the third must see that the laws are executed.  This division is accepted as a necessity in all free governments, and the very apportionment of power to one department is understood to be a prohibition of its exercise by either of the others.  The executive is forbidden to exercise judicial power by the same implication which forbids the courts to take upon themselves his duties.     'It is true that neither of the departments can operate in all respects independently of the others, and that what are called the checks and balances of government constitute each a restraint upon the rest.  The Legislature prescribes rules of action for the courts, and in many particulars may increase or diminish their jurisdiction; it also, in many cases, may prescribe rules for executive action, and impose duties upon, or take powers from the governor; while in turn the governor may veto legislative acts, and the courts may declare them void where they conflict with the constitution, notwithstanding, after having been passed by the Legislature, they have received the governor's approval.  But in each of these cases the action of the department which controls, modifies, or in any manner influences that of another, is had strictly within its own sphere, and for that reason gives no occasion for conflict, controversy or jealously.     '. . . the exemption of the one department from the control of the other is not only implied in the framework of government, but is indispensably necessary if any useful apportionment of power is to exist.'  Sutherland, supra, 29 Mich 230, 324-325       Thus, though the powers of government are distinct, they are, to a degree, interdependent and are conjoined to form a functional governmental entity.   Local 311, State, County & Municipal Workers of America  v Dearborn, 311 Mich 674; 19 NW2d 140 (1945).  The powers of one branch of government should not be exercised so as to encroach upon the powers, or hinder the independent prerogatives, of a coordinate branch.   Michigan Civil Rights Commission  v Clark, 390 Mich 717, 726; 212 NW2d 912 (1973);  Cooley's Constitutional Limitations , 8th Ed (1927), p 213.     With specific respect to the Legislature, certain principles may be acknowledged as firmly established.     The Legislature is the repository of all legislative powers subject only to limitations and restrictions imposed by the Constitution.  The Constitution is not a grant, but is a limitation on the exercise of legislative power.  Attorney General v Preston, 56 Mich 177, 179; 22 NW 261 (1885);  Toy ex rel Elliott  v Voelker, 273 Mich 205, 216; 262 NW 881 (1935);  Romano  v  Auditor General , 323 Mich 533, 536-537; 35 NW2d 701 (1949);  Oakland County Taxpayers' League  v Oakland County Supervisors, 355 Mich 305, 323; 94 NW2d 875 (1959).     The power to conduct investigations, including investigations of the executive branch of government, has long been deemed to be an incident of legislative power necessary to the enactment of effective and wise laws.  (4)   The Flint & Fentonville Plank-Road Co  v Woodhull, 25 Mich 99, 102 (1872); OAG, 1967-1968, No 4606, p 102 (September 20, 1967);  McGrain  v Daugherty, 273 US 135; 47 S Ct 319; 71 L Ed 580 (1927).  However, that power of investigation has been limited to the extent necessary to avoid encroachment on other constitutionally independent prerogatives.     OAG, 1967-1968, No 4606,  supra , considered the authority of a special senate committee to investigate the faculty-administration relationships at Central Michigan University based upon the Legislature's constitutional duty to appropriate money for universities and concluded that:       '. . . the legislature has authority to conduct investigations into all matters relating to the financial requirements of institutions of higher education in this state . . .'  OAG, 1967-1968, No 4606,  supra , at 109       However, OAG, 1967-1968, No 4606,  supra , also concluded that the Legislature may not use that investigatory process 'for such irrelevant purposes as the airing of personal disputes or individual grievances, . . .'  Also see OAG, 1975-1976, No 4873, p 77 (May 2, 1975).     To implement the Legislature's authority to secure information, a standing or select committee has statutory authority to issue subpoenas.  1952 PA 46, MCLA 4.541; MSA 2.185, Sec. 1 provides:       'Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, any standing or select committee of the senate or the house of representatives, and any joint select committee of the senate and house of representatives, shall be authorized to subpoena and have produced before any such committee, or inspect the records and files of any state department, board, institution or agency; and it shall be the duty of any state department, board, institution or agency to produce before the committee as required by the subpoena, or permit the members of any such committee to inspect its records and files.  Such records and files shall be subpoenaed, examined or used only in connection with the jurisdiction and purposes for which the committee was created.'       That subpoena power is available to the Committee on Senate Administration and Rules.  (5)     OAG, 1975-1976, No 4998, p 418 (April 22, 1976), addressed the question whether, in response to such a subpoena, the Department of Public Health was required to supply the names, addresses and clinical data on citizen participants in a study conducted by the department concerning PBB contaminated foods.  Each participant in the study had executed a release to the Department of Public Health which provided that the test would be kept confidential.  The release further provided that no information in which the citizen participant was identified would be released except to the individual or his or her physician.  Nonetheless, based on the inherent legislative authority to conduct investigations and obtain pertinent information for legislative purposes, it was concluded that the department must provide the committee with the names, addresses and clinical data demanded by subpoena issued by the committee, but members of the committee have a duty to respect the right of privacy enjoyed by the participants in the study.     The legislative and executive branches of government 'are of equal dignity, and within their respective spheres of action equally independent.'  (6)   The freedom of one branch 'from the control of the other is not only implied in the framework of government, but is indispensably necessary if any useful apportionment of power is to exist.'  (7)   A legislative investigation may pursue its legitimate course, but 'recognition must also be given to the reverse side of the coin.'  The legislative power to compel disclosure of information by the executive branch may not be used for 'irrelevant purposes' but must respect the 'traditional independence' of another 'constitutionally established'  (8)  entity.  The theory of separate governemtnal powers applies to the state as well as to the United States.   Attorney General, ex rel Cook  v O'Neill, 280 Mich 649, 653; 274 NW 445 (1937).     Although there are few cases on the subject, a Governor's claim to a privilege of confidentiality has been accepted as a valid state constitutional law doctrine.  (9)   Thompson  v German R Co, 22 NJ Eq 111 (1871);  Appeal of Hartranft , 85 Pa St 433 (1877).  More recently, the Maryland Supreme Court in  Hamilton  v Verdow, 287 Md 544, 561; 414 A2d 914, 924 (1980), the court acting upon a question certified by a federal district court whether the doctrine of executive privilege prevents the discovery and the  in camera  inspection of a confidential report as to the handling of a patient at a state hospital, prepared for and at the request of the Governor, ruled that the doctrine of executive privilege derived from the Maryland Constitution, separation of powers, Article 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, noting:       '. . . the cases throughout the country, both federal and state, have recognized the doctrine of executive privilege which, in addition to state and military secrets, gives a measure of protection to the deliberative and mental processes of decision-makers.  . . .'       The claim of executive privilege was subject to judicial review based upon an  in camera  inspection of the document and the balancing of the competing interests.     In essence, what the cases seem to say is that the Governor is not an absolute sovereign, nor is the Senate permitted to conduct an unfettered inquisition within its role of advice and consent.  Both branches are, therefore, subject to restraint and must be responsible to the people.  The third branch of government, the judiciary, may, if necessary, balance the competing interests through an  in camera  review of the documents in question.     The foregoing principles and authorities, in context of the questions posed involving two co-equal branches of government, lead me to conclude, and it is my opinion, that as a matter of Michigan constitutional law, the Michigan courts would hold that the doctrine of executive privilege applies to communications, from a department head to the Governor and his principal advisors, which have to do with alternatives in the shaping of policies and the making of decisions by the Governor.  However, the invocation of the doctrine may be subject to judicial  in camera  review in an appropriate court proceeding.     It is further my opinion that a determination as to whether a particular communication must be disclosed requires a balancing of the following factors:  (a) the Governor's need for confidentiality, (b) the objectives of the Committee on Senate Administration and Rules, and (c) the necessity for obtaining the information in light of the objectives of the Committee.     Whether the doctrine of executive privilege has been appropriately invoked in this instance may not be determined without an examination of the documents withheld.     It is incumbent, therefore, on both branches of government to seek out means by which the Senate may acquire the greatest amount of information possible about a department head's performance consistent with the Governor's need for confidentiality.   United States  v American Telephone & Telegraph Co, 551 F2d 384, 394 (1976), 567 F2d 121, 130 (1977).  88 Harvard Law Rev 13, 38-39,  The Supreme Court, 1973 Term, Forward:  On Presidential Privilege .  If deemed necessary to obtain any documents, a subpoena may be issued pursuant to 1952 PA 46,  supra .  The subpoena must be as specific as possible as to the documents it wishes to secure.  Should the dispute remain unresolved, and in the event the Senate seeks enforcement of the subpoena, the courts will determine the matter.     Finally, I am advised that in determining which correspondence to release to the Committee on Senate Administration and Rules, the Governor and the department directors were guided by the standards set forth in the Freedom of Information Act,  supra .  However, the Legislature has chosen to exclude itself from that statute by its definition of a 'person', Freedom of Information Act,  supra , section 2(a).  That statute grants rights, and imposes limitations, in connection with the statutorily defined 'person' obtaining access to public records.  A legislative committee would not constitute such a 'person'.  See OAG, 1979-1980, No 5500, p 255 (July 23, 1979).  Accordingly, it is not necessary to discuss the applicability of the exemption provisions set forth in the Freedom of Information Act,  supra .    Frank J. Kelley    Attorney General      (1)  This opinion considers the extent to which the Committee on Senate Administration and Rules may demand that a department director produce copies of correspondence in his possession which went out under his or her signature.   The underlying facts are that the newly appointed director of the Department of Commerce was asked by the Committee on Senate Administration and Rules:  'Please provide copies of all outgoing correspondence sent out in your name as Director.'  He responded: 'Attached are copies of outgoing correspondence, other than to employees of the Department of Commerce and the Governor and principle [sic] advisors to the Governor which would be exempt under the Freedom of Information Act and which the Governor and I believe would be inappropriate for disclosure.'   The Committee asked the newly appointed director of the Department of Licensing and Requlation:  'Please provide copies of all outgoing correspondence, both internal and external, sent out in your name as Director.'  She responded:  'Copies are attached.  However, at Goveror Milliken's request, I have not included copies of memos to principle [sic] advisors of the Governor which contain my recommendations or opinions.'    (2)  Once appointed to office the appointee became the director subject to defeasance by negative vote of the Senate within 60 session days.  OAG, 1965-1966, No 4531, p 393 (December 27, 1966).      (3)  After balancing the competing interests the court declined to enforce the subpoena duces tecum.

INTRODUCTION     The adversarial, often confrontational, and sometimes high profile nature of congressional investigations sets it apart from the more routine, accommodative facets of the oversight process experienced in authorization, appropriations or confirmation exercises. (1)   While all aspects of legislative oversight share the common goals of informing Congress so as to best accomplish its tasks of developing legislation, monitoring the implementation of public policy, and of disclosing to the public how its government is performing, the inquisitorial process also sustains and vindicates Congress' role in our constitutional scheme of separated powers and checks and balances.  The rich history of congressional investigations from the failed St. Clair expedition in 1792 through Teapot Dome, Watergate, Iran-Contra and Whitewater has established, in law and practice, the nature and contours of congressional prerogatives necessary to maintain the integrity of the legislative role in that constitutional scheme.    This report will provide an overview of some of the more common legal, procedural and practical issues, questions, and problems that committees have faced in the course of an investigation.  Following a summary of the case law developing the scope and limitations of the power of inquiry, the essential tools of investigative oversight--subpoenas, staff interviews and depositions, grants of immunity, and the contempt power -- are described.  Next, some of the special problems of investigating the executive are detailed, with particular emphasis on claims of presidential executive privilege, the problems raised by attempts to access information with respect to open or closed civil or criminal investigative matters, or to obtain information that is part of the agency deliberative process, and the effect on congressional access of statutory prohibitions on public disclosure.  The discussion then focuses on various procedural and legal requirements that accompany the preparation for, and conduct of, an investigative hearing, including matters concerning jurisdiction, particular rules and requirements for the conduct of such proceedings, and the nature, applicability and scope of certain constitutional and common law testimonial privileges that may be claimed by witnesses.  The case law and practice respecting the rights of minority party members during the investigative process is also reviewed.  The report concludes with a description of the roles played by the offices of House General Counsel and Senate Legal Counsel in such investigations.    II.  THE LEGAL BASIS FOR OVERSIGHT     Numerous Supreme Court precedents establish and support a broad and encompassing power in the Congress to engage in oversight and investigation that reaches all sources of information that enable it to carry out its legislative function.  In the absence of a countervailing constitutional privilege or a self-imposed statutory restriction upon its authority, Congress and its committees, have virtually, plenary power to compel information needed to discharge its legislative function from executive agencies, private persons and organizations, and within certain constraints, the information so obtained may be made public.    More particularly, although there is no express provision of the Constitution which specifically authorizes the Congress to conduct investigations and take testimony for the purposes of performing its legitimate functions, numerous decisions of the Supreme Court have firmly established that the investigatory power of Congress is so essential to the legislative function as to be implicit in the general vesting of legislative power in Congress. (2)   Thus, in  Eastland v. United States Servicemen's Fund  the Court explained that ""[t]he scope of its power of inquiry ... is as penetrating and far-reaching as the potential power to enact and appropriate under the Constitution."" (3)   In  Watkins v. United States  the Court further described the breadth of the power of inquiry:  ""The power of the Congress to conduct investigations is inherent in the legislative process.  That power is broad.  It encompasses inquiries concerning the administration of existing laws as well as proposed or possibly needed statues."" (4)   The Court went on to emphasize that Congress' investigative power is at its peak when the subject is alleged waste, fraud, abuse, or maladministration within a government department.  The investigative power, it stated, ""comprehends probes into departments of the Federal Government to expose corruption, inefficiency, or waste."" (5)   ""[T]he first Congresses"", it continued, held ""inquiries dealing with suspected corruption or mismanagement of government officials"" (6)  and subsequently, in a series of decisions, ""[t]he Court recognized the danger to effective and honest conduct of the Government if the legislative power to probe corruption in the Executive Branch were unduly hampered."" (7)   Accordingly, the Court stated, it recognizes ""the power of the Congress to inquire into and publicize corruption, maladministration, or inefficiencies in the agencies of Government."" (8)     But while the congressional power of inquiry is broad, it is not unlimited.  The Supreme Court has admonished that the power to investigate may be exercised only ""in aid of the legislative function"" (9)  and cannot be used to expose for the sake of exposure alone.  The  Watkins  Court underlined these limitations:  ""There is no general authority to expose the private affairs of individuals without justification in terms of the functions of the Congress ... nor is the Congress a law enforcement or trial agency.  These are functions of the executive and judicial departments of government.  No inquiry is an end in itself, it must be related to, and in furtherance of, a legitimate task of the Congress."" (10)   Moreover, an investigating committee has only the power to inquire into matters within the scope of the authority delegated to it by its parent body. (11)   But once having established its jurisdiction and authority, and the pertinence of the matter under inquiry to its area of authority, a committee's investigative purview is substantial and wide-ranging. (12)     The foundation cases establishing Congress' broad power to probe are illustrative and illuminating.  They arose out of the Teapot Dome investigations, the 1920's scandal regarding oil company payoffs to officials in the Harding Administration.  A major concern of the congressional oversight investigation was the failure of Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty's Justice Department to prosecute the alleged government malefactors.  When congressional committees attempting to investigate came up against refusals by subpoenaed witnesses to provide information, the issue went to the Supreme Court and provided it with the opportunity to issue a seminal decision describing the constitutional basis and reach of congressional oversight.  In  McGrain v. Daugherty, (13)  the Supreme Court focused specifically on Congress' authority to study ""charges of misfeasance and nonfeasance in the Department of Justice.""  The Court noted with approval that ""the subject to be investigated"" by the congressional committee ""was the administration of the Department of Justice -- whether its functions were being properly discharged or were being neglected or misdirected, and particularly whether the Attorney General and his assistants were performing or neglecting their duties in respect of the institution and prosecution of proceedings to punish crimes ...."" (14)   In its decision, the Court sustained the contempt arrest of the Attorney General's brother for withholding information from Congress, since Congress ""would be materially aided by the information which the investigation was calculated to elicit."" (15)   Thus, the Supreme Court unequivocally precluded any blanket claim by the Executive that oversight could be barred regarding ""whether the Attorney General and his assistants were performing or neglecting their duties in respect of the institution and prosecution of proceedings."" (16)     In another Teapot Dome case that reached the Supreme Court,  Sinclair v. United States, (17)  a different witness at the congressional hearings refused to provide answers, and was prosecuted for contempt of Congress.  The witness had noted that a lawsuit had been commenced between the government and the Mammoth Oil Company, and declared, ""I shall reserve any evidence I may be able to give for those courts. . . and shall respectfully decline to answer any questions propounded by your committee."" (18)   The Supreme Court upheld the witness's conviction for contempt of Congress.  The Court considered and rejected in unequivocal terms the witness's contention that the pendency of lawsuits gave an excuse for withholding information.  Neither the laws directing that such lawsuits be instituted, nor the lawsuits themselves, ""operated to divest the Senate, or the committee, of power further to investigate the actual administration of the land laws."" (19)     The Court further explained:  ""It may be conceded that Congress is without authority to compel disclosures for the purpose of aiding the prosecution of pending suits; but the authority of that body, directly or through its committees, to require pertinent disclosures in aid of its own constitutional power is not abridged because the information sought to be elicited may also be of use in such suits."" (20)   In other words, those persons having evidence in their possession, including officers and employees of executive agencies, can not lawfully assert that because lawsuits are pending involving the government, ""the authority of [the Congress], directly or through its committees, to require pertinent disclosures"" is somehow ""abridged.""    The Supreme Court in the Teapot Dome cases therefore enunciated in the clearest manner the independence of Congress' power to probe.  The coincidental focus on the Justice Department and the ability of committees to look deeply into all aspects of its sensitive law enforcement function underlines the potential breadth of that power with respect to other Executive Branch agencies and private sector entities as well.    III.  THE TOOLS OF OVERSIGHT            A. The Subpoena Power     The power of inquiry, with the accompanying process to enforce it, has been deemed ""an essential and appropriate auxiliary to the legislative function."" (21)   A properly authorized subpoena issued by a committee or subcommittee has the some force or effect as a subpoena issued by the parent House itself. (22)   To validly issue a subpoena, individual committees or subcommittees must be delegated this authority.  Both Senate (23)  and House (24)  rules presently empower all standing committees and subcommittee to require the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of documents.  Special or select committees must be specifically delegated that authority by Senate or House resolution. (25)   The rules or practices of standing committees may restrict the issuance of subpoenas only to full committees or in certain instances allow issuance by a committee chairman alone, with or without the concurrence of the ranking minority member.    As previously indicated, committees may issue subpoenas in furtherance of an investigation within their subject matter jurisdiction as defined by Senate (26)  and House (27)  rules which confer both legislative and oversight jurisdiction.  Subpoenas may be issued on the basis of either source of authority.   Congressional subpoenas are most frequently served by the U.S. Marshal's office or by committee staff, or less frequently by the Senate or House Sergeants-at-Arms.  Service may be effected anywhere in the United States.  The subpoena power reaches aliens present in the United States. (28)   Securing compliance of United States nationals and aliens residing in foreign countries presents more complex problems. (29)     A witness seeking to challenge the legal sufficiency of a subpoena,  i.e.,  the committee's authority, alleged constitutional rights violations, subpoena breadth, has only limited remedies available to raise such objections.  The Supreme Court has ruled that courts may not enjoin the issuance of a congressional subpoena, holding that the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution (30)  provides ""an absolute bar to judicial interference"" with such compulsory process. (31)   As a consequence, a witness' sole remedy generally is to refuse to comply, risk being cited for contempt, and then raise objections as a defense in a contempt prosecution.    Challenges to the legal sufficiency of subpoenas must overcome formidable judicial obstacles.  The standard to be applied in determining whether the congressional investigating power has been properly asserted was articulated in  Wilkinson  v.  United States :  (1)  the committee's investigation of the broad subject matter area must be authorized by Congress; (2) the investigation must be pursuant to ""a valid legislative purpose""; and (3) the specific inquiries must be pertinent to the broad subject matter areas which have been authorized by the Congress. (32)     With respect to authorization, a committee's authority derives from the enabling rule or resolution of its parent body.  In construing the scope of such authorizations, the Supreme Court has adopted a mode of analysis not unlike that ordinarily followed in determining the meaning of a statute:  it looks first to the words of the authorizing rule or resolution itself, and then, if necessary, to the usual sources of legislative history, including floor statements, reports and past committee practice. (33)     As to the requirement of ""valid legislative purpose,"" the Supreme Court has made it clear that Congress does not have to state explicitly what it intends to do as a result of an investigation. (34)    When the purpose asserted is supported by reference to specific problems which in the past have been, or in the future may be, the subject of appropriate legislation, it has been held that a court cannot say that a committee of Congress exceeds its power when it seeks information in such areas. (35)     Finally, in determining the pertinency of questions to the subject matter under investigation, the courts have required only that the specific inquiries be reasonably related to the subject matter under investigation. (36)   An argument that pertinence must be shown ""with the degree of explicitness and clarity required by the Due Process Clause"" has been held to confuse the standard applicable in those rare cases when the constitutional rights of individuals are implicated by congressional investigations with the far more common situation of the exercise of legislative oversight over the administration of the law which does not involve an individual constitutional right or prerogative.  It is, of course, well established that the courts will intervene to protect constitutional rights from infringement by Congress, including its committees and members. (37)   But ""[w]here constitutional rights are not violated, there is no warrant to interfere with the internal procedures of Congress."" (38)     B.      Staff Depositions     Committees normally rely on informal staff interviews to gather information preparatory to investigatory hearings.  However, with more frequency in recent years, congressional committees have utilized staff conducted depositions as a tool in exercising the investigatory power. (39)   Staff depositions afford a number of advantages for committees engaged in complex investigations.  Staff depositions may assist committees in obtaining sworn testimony quickly and confidentially without the necessity of Members devoting time to lengthy hearings which may be unproductive because witnesses do not have the facts needed by the committee or refuse to cooperate.  Depositions are conducted in private and may be more conducive to candid responses than would be the case at a public hearing.  Statements made by witnesses that might defame or even tend to incriminate third parties can be verified before they are repeated in an open hearing.  Depositions can enable a committee to prepare for the questioning of witnesses at a hearing or provide a screening process which can obviate the need to call some witnesses.  The deposition process also allows questioning of witnesses outside of Washington thereby avoiding the inconvenience of conducting field hearings requiring the presence of Members.    Certain disadvantages may also inhere.  Unrestrained staff may be tempted to engage in tangential inquiries.  Also depositions present a ""cold record"" of a witness's testimony and may not be as useful for Members as in person presentations.  Finally, in the current absence of any definitive case law precedent, legal questions may be raised concerning the ability to enforce a subpoena for a staff deposition by means of contempt sanctions, and to the applicability to such a deposition of various statutes that proscribe false material statements. (40)     At present neither House has rules that expressly authorize staff depositions.  On a number of occasions such specific authority has been granted pursuant to Senate and House resolutions. (41)   When granted, a committee will normally adopt procedures for taking depositions, including provisions for notice (with or without a subpoena), transcription of the deposition, the right to be accompanied by counsel, and the manner in which objections to questions are to be resolved. (42)     C.      Congressional Grants of Immunity     The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution provides in part that ""no person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself ... ""  The privilege against self-incrimination is available to a witness in a congressional investigation. (43)   When a witness before a committee asserts his constitutional privilege, the committee may obtain a court order which compels him to testify and grants him immunity against the use of his testimony and information derived from that testimony in a subsequent criminal prosecution.  He may still be prosecuted on the basis of other evidence.    The privilege against self-incrimination is an exception to the public's right to every person's evidence.  However, a witness' Fifth Amendment privilege can be restricted if the government chooses to grant him immunity.  Immunity is considered to provide the witness with the constitutional equivalent of his Fifth Amendment privilege. (44)   Immunity grants may be required in the course of an investigation because ""many offenses are of such a character that the only persons capable of giving useful testimony are those implicated in the crime."" (45)   Such grants may be militated when a committee is convinced that the testimony elicited will produce new or vital facts that would otherwise be unavailable or to allow a witness to implicate persons of greater rank or authority.  Grants of immunity have figured prominently in a number of major congressional investigations, including Watergate (John Dean and Jeb Magruder) and Iran-Contra (Oliver North and John Poindexter).   The scope of the immunity which is granted, and the procedure to be employed, are outlined in 18 U.S.C. §§ 6002, 6005.  If a witness before the House or Senate or a committee or subcommittee of either body asserts his privilege, or if a witness who has not yet been called is expected to assert his privilege, an authorized representative of the House or of the committee may apply to a federal district court for an order directing the individual to testify or provide other information sought by the Congress. (46)   If the testimony is to be before the full House or Senate, the request for the court order must be approved by an affirmative vote of a majority of the Members present of the House or Senate.  If the testimony is to be given before a committee or subcommittee, the request for the order must be approved by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Members of the full committee. (47)     At least ten days prior to applying to the court for the order, the Attorney General (48)  must be notified of the Congress' intent to seek the order, (49)  and issuance of the order will be delayed by the court for as much as twenty additional days at the request of the Attorney General. (50)  Notice to the Attorney General is required so that he can identify in his files any information which would provide an independent basis for prosecuting the witness, and place that information under seal.  Neither the Attorney General nor an independent counsel would have a right to veto a committee's application for immunity. (51)  The role of the court in issuing the order is ministerial and therefore, if the procedural requirements under the statutes are met, the court may not refuse to issue the order or impose conditions on the grant of immunity. (52)   However, although the court lacks power to review the advisability of granting immunity, it might be able to consider the jurisdiction of Congress and the committee over the subject area and the relevance of the information that is sought to the committee's inquiry. (53)     After an immunity order has been issued by the court and communicated to the witness by the chairman, the witness can no longer decline to testify on the basis of his privilege, ""but no testimony or other information compelled under the order (or any information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony or other information) may be used against the witness in any criminal case, except a prosecution for perjury, giving a false statement, or otherwise failing to comply with the order."" (54)   The immunity that is granted is ""use"" immunity, not ""transactional"" immunity. (55)   That is, neither the immunized testimony that the witness gives to the committee, nor information derived from that testimony, may be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution, except one for falsely testifying to the committee or for contempt.  However, he may be convicted of the crime (the ""transaction"") on the basis of evidence independently obtained by the prosecution and sealed before his congressional testimony, and/or on the basis of information obtained after his congressional appearance but which was not derived, either directly or indirectly, from his congressional testimony.    In determining whether to grant immunity to a witness, a committee may consider, on the one hand, its need for his testimony in order to perform its legislative, oversight, and informing functions, and on the other, the possibility that the witness' immunized congressional testimony could jeopardize a successful criminal prosecution against him.  If a witness is prosecuted after giving immunized testimony, the burden is on the prosecutor to establish that the case was not based on the witness' previous testimony or evidence derived therefrom. (56)     Recent appellate court decisions reversing the convictions of key Iran-Contra figures Lt. Colonel Oliver North (57)  and Rear Admiral John Poindexter (58)  appear to make the prosecutorial burden substantially more difficult, if not insurmountable, in high profile cases.  Despite extraordinary efforts by the Independent Counsel and his staff to avoid being exposed to any of North's or Poindexter's immunized congressional testimony, and the submission of sealed packets of evidence to the district court to show that the material was obtained independently of any immunized testimony to Congress, the appeals court in both cases remanded the cases for a further determination whether the prosecution had directly or indirectly used immunized testimony.    The court of appeals in  North  emphasized that the insulation of the prosecution from exposure to the immunized congressional testimony does not automatically prove that this testimony was not used against the defendant. (59)  The court held that "" Kastigar  is instead violated whenever the prosecution puts on a witness whose testimony is shaped, directly or indirectly, by compelled testimony, regardless of how or by whom he was exposed to that compelled testimony."" (60)  From this the court reasoned that ""the use of immunized testimony . . . to augment or refresh recollection is an evidentiary use"" and must therefore be strictly scrutinized under the  Kastigar  standard. (61)   Thus, the court of appeals held that the presentation of ""testimony of grand jury or trial witnesses that has been derived from or influenced by the [defendant's] immunized testimony"" was a forbidden use of the compelled testimony under both the Fifth Amendment and  Kastigar . (62)     Upon remanding the case to the district court, the court of appeals insisted that a strict application of the  Kastigar  test be applied to the government's evidence if the prosecution of  North  was to continue.  The lower court was required to hold a full  Kastigar  hearing that would:    inquire into the content as well as the sources of the grand jury and trial witnesses' testimony.  That inquiry must proceed witness-by-witness; if necessary, it will proceed line-by-line and item-by-item.  For each grand jury and trial witness, the prosecution must show by a preponderance of the evidence that no use whatsoever was made of any of the immunized testimony either by the witness or by the Office of Independent Counsel in questioning the witness.  This burden may be met by establishing that the witness was never exposed to North's immunized testimony, or that the allegedly tainted testimony contains no evidence not ""canned"" by the prosecution before such exposure occurred. (63)     Similarly, in  Poindexter , the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed all five of Poindexter's convictions because the Independent Counsel failed to show that Poindexter's compelled testimony was not used against him at his trial, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 6002 and the Fifth Amendment. (64)   Relying on the  North  standards outlined above, the appeals court held that the testimony of many of the prosecution's key witnesses, including that of Oliver North himself, was impermissibly influenced by the witnesses' exposure to Poindexter's immunized testimony for purposes of refreshment. (65)   Upon remand in both cases, the Independent Counsel moved to dismiss the prosecutions upon his determination that he could not meet the strict standards set by the appeals court in its decisions.    While the  North  and  Poindexter  rulings in no way diminish a committee's authority to immunize testimony or the manner in which it secures immunity pursuant to the statute, it does alter the calculus as to whether to seek such immunity.  Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh observed that ""[t]he legislative branch has the power to decide whether it is more important perhaps even to destroy a prosecution than to hold back testimony they need.  They make that decision.  It is not a judicial decision or a legal decision but a political decision of the highest importance."" (66)   It has been argued that the constitutional dimensions of the crisis created by the Iran-Contra affair required the type of quick, decisive disclosures that could result from a congressional investigation but not from the slower, more deliberate criminal investigation and prosecution process. (67)   Under this view, the demands of a national crisis may justify sacrificing the criminal prosecution of those involved in order to allow Congress to uncover and make public the truth of the matter at issue.  The role of Congress as overseer, informer, and legislator arguably warrants this sacrifice.  The question becomes more difficult as the sense of national crisis in a particular circumstance is less acute, and the object is, for example, to trade-off a lesser figure in order to reach someone higher up in a matter involving ""simple"" fraud, abuse or maladministration at an agency.  In the end, case-by-case assessments by congressional investigators will be needed, guided by the sensitivity that these are political judgments.    IV.  ENFORCEMENT OF THE INVESTIGATIVE POWER            A. The Contempt Power      While the threat or actual issuance of a subpoena often provides sufficient leverage for effective compliance with investigative information demands, it is through the contempt power that Congress may act with ultimate force in response to actions which obstruct the legislative process in order to punish the contemnor and/or to remove the obstruction.  The Supreme Court early recognized the power as an inherent attribute of Congress' legislative authority, reasoning that if it did not possess this power, it ""would be exposed to every indignity and interruption that rudeness, caprice or even conspiracy may mediate against it."" (68)     There are three different kinds of contempt proceedings available.  Both the House and Senate may cite a witness for contempt under their inherent contempt power or under a statutory criminal contempt procedure.  The Senate also has a third option, enforcement by means of a statutory civil contempt procedure.  The three proceedings may be briefly described. (69)                   (1)       Inherent Contempt          Under the inherent contempt power, the individual is brought before the House or Senate by the Sergeant-at-Arms, tried at the bar of the body, and can be imprisoned in the Capitol jail.  The purpose of the imprisonment or other sanction may be either punitive or coercive.  Thus, the witness can be imprisoned for a specified period of time as punishment, or for an indefinite period (but not, at least in the case of the House, beyond the end of the Congress) until he agrees to comply.  When a witness is cited for contempt under the inherent contempt process, prompt judicial review is available by means of a petition for a writ of  habeas corpus.   In an inherent contempt proceeding, although Congress would not have to afford the contemnor the whole panoply of procedural rights available to a defendant in a criminal case, notice and an opportunity to be heard would have to be granted.  Also, some of the requirements imposed by the courts under the statutory criminal contempt procedure might be mandated by the due process clause in the case of inherent contempt proceedings. (70)          The inherent contempt power has not been exercised by either House in over sixty years because it has been considered to be too cumbersome and time consuming for a modern Congress with a heavy legislative workload that would be interrupted by a trial at the bar.                  (2)       Statutory Contempt          Recognizing the problems with use of the inherent contempt process, a statutory criminal contempt procedure was enacted in 1857 which, with only minor amendments, is codified today at 2 U.S.C. §§192 and 194.  Under 2 U.S.C. § 192, a person who has been subpoenaed to testify or produce documents before the House or Senate or a committee and who fails to do so, or who appears but refuses to respond to questions, is guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 and imprisonment for up to one year.  Section 194 establishes the procedure to be followed if the House or Senate refers a witness to the courts for criminal prosecution.  A contempt citation must be approved by the subcommittee, the full committee, and the full House or Senate (or by the presiding officer if Congress is not in session).   The criminal procedure is punitive in nature.  It is not coercive because a witness generally will not be able to purge himself by testifying or supplying subpoenaed documents after he has been voted in contempt by the committee and the House or the Senate.  Under the statute, after a contempt has been certified by the President of the Senate or the Speaker of the House, it is the ""duty"" of the U.S. Attorney ""to bring the matter before the grand jury for its action.""  It remains unclear whether the ""duty"" of the U.S. Attorney to present the contempt to the grand jury is mandatory or discretionary, since the sparse case law that is relevant to the question provides conflicting guidance. (71)     This potential conflict between the statutory language of §194 and the U.S. Attorney's prosecutorial discretion was highlighted by the inability of the House of Representatives in 1982 to secure a contempt prosecution against the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Ann Burford.  Burford, at the direction of President Reagan, had asserted executive privilege as grounds for refusing to respond to a subpoena demand for documents.  She was cited for contempt by the full House and the contempt resolution was certified by the Speaker and forwarded to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia for presentment to the grand jury.  Relying on his prosecutorial discretion he deferred doing so.         The Burford controversy may be seen as unusual, involving highly sensitive political issues of the time.  In the vast majority of cases there is likely to be no conflict between the interests of the two political branches, and the U.S. Attorney can be expected to initiate prosecution in accordance with § 194.                  (3)       Civil Contempt          As an alternative to both the inherent contempt power of each House and criminal contempt, Congress enacted a civil contempt procedure which is applicable only to the Senate. (72)   Upon application of the Senate, (73)  the federal district court is to issue an order to a  person refusing, or threatening to refuse, to comply with a Senate subpoena.  If the individual still refuses to comply, he may be tried by the court in summary proceedings for contempt of court, with sanctions being imposed to coerce his compliance.  Civil contempt might be employed when the Senate is more concerned with securing compliance with the subpoena or with clarifying legal issues than with punishing the contemnor.  Civil contempt can be more expeditious than a criminal proceeding and it also provides an element of flexibility, allowing the subpoenaed party to test his legal defenses in court without necessarily risking a criminal prosecution.  Civil contempt is not authorized for use against executive branch officials refusing to comply with a subpoena.                  (4)       Alternatives to Contempt          When an executive branch official refuses to comply with a congressional subpoena and the dispute cannot be resolved by negotiation and compromise, none of the three types of contempt proceedings may be completely satisfactory.  The statutory civil contempt procedure in the Senate is inapplicable in the case of a subpoena to an executive branch official.  Inherent contempt has been described as ""unseemly"" and cumbersome.  And if the criminal contempt method is utilized, the U.S. Attorney, who is an executive branch appointee may, as occurred in the Burford case, rely on the doctrine of prosecutorial discretion as grounds for deferring seeking an indictment.  There are, however, various alternatives to the three modes of contempt in the case of an executive branch official.  (1)  The contemnor could be cited for criminal contempt and be prosecuted by an independent counsel, rather than by the U.S. Attorney, if the standards under the law governing the appointment of such counsels are satisfied; (2)  the committee can seek declaratory or other relief in the courts; (3)  the appropriations for the agency or department involved can be cut off or reduced when requested information has not been supplied; and (4) in an exceptional case, the official might be impeached.          B. Perjury and False Statements Prosecutions                   (1)  Testimony Under Oath                 A witness under oath before a congressional committee who willfully gives false testimony is subject to prosecution for perjury under 18 U.S.C. 1621 of the United States Code.  The essential elements for such prosecution are:  (1)  a false statement, (2)  ""willfully"" made, (3)  before a ""competent tribunal"", (4)  involving a ""material matter.""  The requirement of a competent tribunal is important to note because it is an element of the offense within the particular control of committees.         For a legislative committee to be competent for perjury purposes a quorum must be present. (74)   The problem has been ameliorated in recent years with the adoption of rules establishing less than a majority of Members as a quorum for taking testimony, normally two members for House committees (75)  and one member for Senate committees. (76)   The requisite quorum must be present at the time the alleged perjurious statement is made, not merely at the time the session convenes.  No prosecution for perjury will lie for statements made only in the presence of committee staff unless the committee has deposition authority and has taken formal action to allow it.                  (2)       Unsworn Statements          Most statements made before Congress, at both the investigatory and hearing phases of oversight, are unsworn.  The practice of swearing in all witnesses at hearings is a rare practice.  But prosecutions may be brought to punish congressional witnesses for giving willfully false testimony not under oath.  Under 18 U.S.C. 1001 false statements before a ""department or agency of the United States"" are punishable by a fine of up to $10,000 or imprisonment up to five years, or both.  The courts have held that section 1001 is applicable to false statements made to congressional committees. (77)          Until recently it was thought that 18 U.S.C. 1505, which proscribes attempts to obstruct congressional proceedings, was applicable to unsworn false statements.  However, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in 1991 that section 1505 applies only to corrupt efforts to obstruct congressional inquiries by subverting witnesses, not to false statements by the defendant himself in such proceedings. (78)     V.       INVESTIGATING THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH          When Congress directs its investigatory powers at Executive Branch departments and agencies, and at times at the White House itself, such probes have often become contentious, provoking the Executive to assert rights to shield from disclosure information Congress deems essential to carry out its oversight functions.  The variety of grounds proffered are often lumped in an undifferentiated manner under the rubric ""executive privilege"".  However, in order to evaluate and assess the weight of such withholding claims, it is more useful, and accurate, to distinguish between claims that have a constitutional basis and those that do not, and then to separate out amongst the non-constitutional claims those based on law from those resting on executive policy preferences.          A. Presidential Claims of Executive Privilege          In some, rare, instances the executive response to a congressional demand to produce information may be an assertion of presidential executive privilege, a doctrine which, like Congress' powers to investigate and cite for contempt, has constitutional roots.  No decision of the Supreme Court has yet resolved the question whether there are any circumstances in which the Executive Branch can refuse to provide information sought by the Congress on the basis of executive privilege.  Indeed, most such disputes are settled short of litigation through employment of the political process and negotiations, (79)  and the few that reach a judicial forum find the courts highly reluctant to rule on the merits. (80)   However, in  United States v. Nixon , (81)  involving a judicial subpoena issued to the President at the request of the Watergate Special Prosecutor, (82)  the Supreme Court found a constitutional basis for the doctrine of executive privilege in ""the supremacy of each branch within its own assigned area of constitutional duties"" and in the separation of powers, (83)  and although it considered presidential communications with close advisors to be ""presumptively privileged,"" the Court rejected the President's contention that the privilege was absolute, precluding judicial review whenever it is asserted. (84)          Having concluded that in the case before it the claim of privilege was not absolute, the Court resolved the ""competing interests"" (the President's need for confidentiality vs. the judiciary's need for the materials in a criminal proceeding) ""in a manner that preserves the essential functions of each branch,"" (85)  and held that the judicial need for the tapes outweighed the President's ""generalized interest in confidentiality ...""  (86)   The Court was careful to limit the scope of its decision, noting that ""we are not here concerned with the balance between the President's generalized interest in confidentiality ... and congressional demands for information"". (87)          Although  United States v. Nixon  did not involve a presidential claim of executive privilege in response to a congressional subpoena, in  Senate   Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities v. Nixon, (88)  the court of appeals, prior to the  Nixon  ruling, reviewed the President's assertion of executive privilege as grounds for not complying with a Senate committee subpoena for tape recordings. (89)   The appeals court found that ""the presumption that the public interest favors confidentiality [in presidential communications] can be defeated only by a strong showing of need by another institution of government--a showing that the responsibilities of that institution cannot responsibly be fulfilled without access to records of the President's deliberations . . . .""  According to the court, ""the showing required to overcome the presumption favoring confidentiality"" rests ""on the nature and appropriateness of the function in the performance of which the material [is] sought, and the degree to which the material [is] necessary to its fulfillment . . . . [T]he sufficiency of the committee's showing must depend solely on whether the subpoenaed evidence is demonstrably critical to the responsible fulfillment of the committee's functions."" (90)   The court found that, in the circumstances of that case, the need for the tapes was ""merely cumulative"" in light of the fact that the House Judiciary Committee had begun an inquiry, with express constitutional authority, into impeachment of the President, and the fact that the Judiciary Committee already had copies of the tapes subpoenaed by the Senate Committee. (91)          Since the Kennedy Administration it has been established by executive policy directives that presidential executive privilege may be asserted only by the President personally.  The latest such directive, issued by President Reagan in November 1982, (92)  and still in effect, requires that when an agency head believes that a congressional information request raises substantial questions of executive privilege he is to notify and consult with the Attorney General and the Counsel to the President.  If the matter is deemed to justify invocation of the privilege, it is reported to the President who makes his decision.  If the President invokes the privilege, the agency head advises the requesting committee.         There has been only one instance in which the full House or Senate has voted a contempt citation against the head of an executive department or agency, that of Anne Gorsuch Burford, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in 1982. (93)   Several cabinet members have been found in contempt by committees or subcommittees, although these disputes were resolved before contempt votes by the parent body.  In two instances, cabinet members were cited for contempt by full committees. (94)   Five other cabinet secretaries have been cited for contempt by subcommittees. (95)             B.      Effect of Statutory Prohibitions on Public Disclosure on Congressional Access          Upon occasion Congress has found it necessary and appropriate to limit its access to information it would normally be able to obtain by exercise of its constitutional oversight prerogatives. (96)   But where a statutory confidentiality or non-disclosure provision barring public disclosure of information is not explicitly applicable to the Congress, the courts have consistently held that agencies and private parties may not deny Congress access to such information on the basis of such provisions.  (97)  Release to a congressional requestor is not deemed to be disclosure to the public generally. (98)  Moreover, courts may not require agencies to delay the surrender of documents to Congress in order to give advance notice to affected parties, ""for the judiciary must refrain from slowing or otherwise interfering with the legitimate investigating functions of Congress"". (99)   Once documents are in congressional hands, the courts have held they must presume that the committees of Congress will exercise their powers responsibly and with due regard for the rights of affected parties. (100)  Nor may a court block congressional disclosure of information obtained from an agency or private party, at least when disclosure would serve a valid legislative purpose. (101)   Finally, the legal obligation to surrender requested documents has been held to arise from the official request (102)          Executive agencies have in the past unsuccessfully raised several statutes of general applicability as potential barriers to the disclosure of information to congressional committees.  Agencies have attempted to withhold documents on the basis of the deliberative process exemption incorporated by Exemption 5 of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). (103)  But the courts have made it plain that the agency privileges made applicable to public requesters by Exemption 5, as well as all the other exemptions of the FOIA, are expressly inapplicable to the legislature:  ""This section is not authority to withhold information from Congress."" (104)  In  Murphy  v.  Department of the Army  an appeals court explained that FOIA exemptions were no basis for withholding from Congress because of ""the obvious purpose of the Congress to carve out for itself a special right of access to privileged information not shared by others.  Congress, whether as a body, through committees, or otherwise, must have the widest possible access to executive branch information, if it is to perform its manifold responsibilities effectively.  If one consequence of the facilitation of such access is that some information will be disclosed to congressional authorities but not to private persons, that is but an incidental consequence of the need for informed and effective lawmakers"". (105)   A similar provision in the Privacy Act also prevents its use as a withholding vehicle against Congress. (106)          A frequently cited statute used to justify non-disclosure is the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905, a criminal provision which generally proscribes the disclosure of trade secrets and confidential business information by a federal officer or employee ""unless otherwise authorized by law.""  There is no indication in the legislative history of its revision and codification that it was intended to prevent agency disclosures to committees or to have it apply to Congress and its employees or any other legislative branch support agency or its employees, (107)  and as a matter of statutory construction it would have been unusual for Congress to have subjected,  sub silento , its staff to criminal sanctions for such disclosures, particularly in light of its well-established oversight and investigative prerogatives, and its speech or debate privilege.  In any event, there appears little doubt that disclosure to Congress of proprietary information covered by § 1905 would be deemed to be ""authorized by law"".  The Supreme Court in  Chrysler v. Brown (108)  held that disclosure authorization can stem from both congressional enactments and agency regulations.  In this instance, there are at least two potential sources of disclosure authorization.  The first is 2 U.S.C. 190d, which directs all standing committees of the Congress to engage in continuous legislative oversight of the administration and application of laws within their respective jurisdictions, and ""may require a Government agency"" to assist in doing so.  In 1955, the Attorney General of the United States opined that the authorization required by the Trade Secrets Act was ""reasonably implied"" under § 190d. (109)   A second source is the rules of each House authorizing committee oversight.          C. Accessing Information in Open and Closed Civil and Criminal Cases:  The Special Problem of Overseeing the Justice Department           Congressional oversight of the conduct of civil and criminal enforcement matters by agencies, and most particularly the Department of Justice (DOJ), has raised sensitive questions respecting the exercise of prosecutorial discretion by the executive and interference with protected rights of individuals who may be the subject of such enforcement actions.  However, a review of congressional investigations that have implicated DOJ or DOJ investigations over the past 70 years, from the Palmer Raids and Teapot Dome to Watergate and through Iran-Contra and Rocky Flats, (110)  demonstrates that DOJ has been consistently obliged to submit to congressional oversight, regardless of whether litigation is pending, so that Congress is not delayed unduly in investigating misfeasance, malfeasance, or maladministration in DOJ or elsewhere.  A number of these inquiries spawned seminal Supreme Court rulings that today provide the legal foundation for the broad congressional power of inquiry. (111)   All were contentious and involved Executive claims that committee demands for agency documents and testimony were precluded on the basis of constitutional or common law privilege or policy.                       In the majority of instances reviewed, the testimony of subordinate DOJ employees, such as line attorneys and FBI field agents, was taken formally or informally, and included detailed testimony about specific instances of the Department's failure to prosecute alleged meritorious cases.  In all instances, investigating committees were provided with documents respecting open or closed cases that included prosecutorial memoranda, FBI investigative reports, summaries of FBI interviews, memoranda and correspondence prepared during the pendency of cases, confidential instructions outlining the procedures or guidelines to be followed for undercover operations and the surveillance and arrests of suspects, and documents presented to grand juries not protected from disclosure by Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, among other similar ""sensitive"" materials.         The reasons advanced by the Executive for declining to provide information to Congress about civil proceedings have included avoiding prejudicial pre-trial publicity, protecting the rights of innocent third parties, protecting the identity of confidential informants, preventing disclosure of the government's strategy in anticipated or pending judicial proceedings, the potentially chilling effect on the exercise of prosecutorial discretion by DOJ attorneys, and precluding interference with the President's constitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws. (112)          As has been recounted previously, the Supreme Court has repeatedly reaffirmed the breadth of Congress' right to investigate the government's conduct of criminal and civil litigation. (113)   The courts have also explicitly held that agencies may not deny Congress access to agency documents, even in situations where the inquiry may result in the exposure of criminal corruption or maladministration of agency officials.  The Supreme Court has noted, ""[B]ut surely a congressional committee which is engaged in a legitimate legislative investigation need not grind to a halt whenever responses to its inquiries might potentially be harmful to a witness in some distinct proceeding . . . or when crime or wrongdoing is exposed."" (114)   Nor does the actual pendency of litigation disable Congress from the investigation of facts which have a bearing on that litigation, where the information sought is needed to determine what, if any, legislation should be enacted to prevent further ills. (115)          Although several lower court decisions have recognized that congressional hearings may have the result of generating prejudicial pre-trial publicity, they have not suggested that there are any constitutional or legal limitations on Congress' right to conduct an investigation during the pendency of judicial proceedings.  Instead, the cases have suggested approaches, such as granting a continuance or a change of venue, to deal with the publicity problem. (116)   For example, the court in one of the leading cases,  Delaney v. United States,  entertained ""no doubt that the committee acted lawfully, within the constitutional powers of Congress duly delegated to it"" but went on to describe the possible consequences of concurrent executive and congressional investigations:    We think that the United States is put to a choice in this matter:  If the United States, through its legislative department, acting conscientiously pursuant to its conception of the public interest, chooses to hold a public hearing inevitably resulting in such damaging publicity prejudicial to a person awaiting trial on a pending indictment, then the United States must accept the consequences that the judicial department, charged with the duty of assuring the defendant a fair trial before an impartial jury, may find it necessary to postpone the trial until by lapse of time the danger of the prejudice may reasonably be thought to have been substantially removed. (117)          The  Delaney  court distinguished the case of a congressional hearing generating publicity relating to an individual not under indictment at the time (as was Delaney):    Such a situation may present important differences from the instant case.  In such a situation the investigative function of Congress has its greatest utility:  Congress it is informing itself so that it may take appropriate legislative action; it is informing the Executive so that existing laws may be enforced; and it is informing the public so that democratic processes may be brought to bear to correct any disclosed executive laxity.  Also, if as a result of such legislative hearing an indictment is eventually procured against the public official, then in the normal case there would be a much greater lapse of time between the publicity accompanying the public hearing and the trial of the subsequently indicted official than would be the case if the legislative hearing were held while the accused is awaiting trial on a pending indictment. (118)          The absence of indictment and the length of time between congressional hearing and criminal trial have been factors in courts rejecting claims that congressionally generated publicity prejudiced defendants. (119)   Finally, in the context of adjudicatory administrative proceedings, courts on occasion have held that pressures emanating from questioning of agency decisionmakers by Members of Congress may be sufficient to undermine the impartiality of the proceeding.  (120)   But the courts have also made clear that mere inquiry and oversight of agency actions, including agency proceedings that are quasi-adjudicatory in nature, will not be held to rise to the level of political pressure designed to influence particular proceedings that would require judicial condemnation. (121)          Thus, the courts have recognized the potentially prejudicial effect congressional hearings can have on pending cases.  While not questioning the prerogatives of Congress with respect to oversight and investigation, the cases pose a choice for the Congress:  congressionally generated publicity may result in harming the prosecutorial effort of the Executive; but access to information under secure conditions can fulfill the congressional power of investigation and at the same time need not be inconsistent with the authority of the Executive to pursue its case.  Nonetheless, it remains a choice that is solely within Congress' discretion to make irrespective of the consequences. (122)          In the past the executive frequently has made a broader claim that prosecution is an inherently executive function and that congressional access to information related to the exercise of that function is thereby limited.  Prosecutorial discretion is seen as off-limits to congressional inquiry and access demands are viewed as interfering with the discretion traditionally enjoyed by the prosecutor with respect to pursuing criminal cases.         Initially, it must be noted that the Supreme Court has rejected the notion that prosecutorial discretion in criminal matters is an inherent or core executive function.  Rather, the Court noted in  Morrison v. Olson,  (123)  sustaining the validity of the appointment and removal conditions for independent counsels under the Ethics in Government Act, that the independent counsel's prosecutorial powers are executive in that they have ""typically"" been performed by Executive Branch officials, but held that the exercise of prosecutorial discretion is in no way ""central"" to the functioning of the Executive Branch. (124)   The Court therefore rejected a claim that insulating the independent counsel from at-will presidential removal interfered with the President's duty to ""take care"" that the laws be faithfully executed.  Interestingly, the  Morrison  Court took the occasion to reiterate the fundamental nature of Congress' oversight function ("" . . . receiving reports or other information and oversight of the independent counsel's activities . . . [are] functions that we have recognized as generally incidental to the legislative function of Congress,"" citing  McGrain v. Daugherty .) (125)          The breadth of  Morrison's  ruling that the prosecutorial function is not an exclusive function of the Executive was made clear in a recent decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in United States ex rel Kelly v. The Boeing Co., (126)  which upheld, against a broad based separation of powers attack, the constitutionality of the  qui tam  provisions of the False Claims Act vesting enforcement functions against agencies by private parties. (127)          Prosecution, not being a core or exclusive function of the Executive, cannot claim the constitutional stature of Congress' oversight prerogative.  In the absence of a credible claim of encroachment or aggrandizement by the legislature of essential Executive powers, the Supreme Court has held the appropriate judicial test is one that determines whether the challenged legislative action ""`prevents the Executive Branch from accomplishing its assigned functions',"" and, if so, ""`whether that impact is justified by an overriding need to promote objectives within the constitutional authority of Congress'.""  (128)          Congressional oversight and access to documents and testimony, unlike the action of a court, cannot stop a prosecution or set limits on the management of a particular case.  Access to information by itself would not seem to disturb the authority and discretion of the Executive Branch to decide whether to prosecute a case.  The assertion of prosecutorial discretion in the face of a congressional demand for information is arguably akin to the ""generalized"" claim of confidentiality made in the Watergate executive privilege cases.  That general claim -- lacking in specific demonstration of disruption of Executive functions -- was held to be overcome by the more focused demonstration of need for information by a coordinate branch of government. (129)          Given the legitimacy of congressional oversight and investigation of the law enforcement agencies of government, and the need for access to information pursuant to such activities, a claim of prosecutorial discretion by itself would not seem to be sufficient to defeat a congressional need for information.  The congressional action itself does not and cannot dictate prosecutorial policy or decisions in particular cases.  Congress may enact statutes that influence prosecutorial policy and information relating to enforcement of the laws would seem necessary to perform that legislative function.  Thus, under the standard enunciated in   Morrison v. Olson  and  Nixon v. Administrator of General Services,  the fact that information is sought on the Executive's enforcement of criminal laws would not in itself seem to preclude congressional inquiry.         In light of the Supreme Court's consistent support of the power of legislative inquiry, and in the absence of a countervailing constitutional prerogative of the Executive, it is likely that a court will be ""sensitive to the legislative importance of congressional committees on oversight and investigations and recognize that their interest in the objective and efficient operation of ... agencies serves a legitimate and wholesome function with which we should not lightly interfere."" (130)             D. Access to Grand Jury Materials          Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that members of the grand jury and those who attend the grand jury in its proceedings may not ""disclose matters occurring before the grand jury, except as otherwise provided in these rules."" (131)   The prohibition does not ordinarily extend to witnesses.  (132)  Violations are punishable as contempt of court.  (133)           There is some authority for the proposition that Rule 6(e), promulgated as an exercise of congressionally delegated authority and reflecting pre-existing practices, is not intended to address disclosures to Congress.  (134)  As a general rule, however, neither Congress nor the courts appear to have fully embraced the proposition.         But, not all matters presented to a grand jury are embraced by the secrecy rule.  Thus, ""when testimony or data is sought for its own sake - for its intrinsic value in the furtherance of a lawful investigation - rather than to learn what took place before the grand jury, it is not a valid defense to disclosure that the same information was revealed to a grand jury or that the same documents had been, or were presently being, examined by a grand jury."" (135)  Congressional committees have gained access to documents under this theory, the courts ruling that the committee's interest was in the documents themselves and not in the events that transpired before the grand jury. (136)   However, with respect to matters that ""reflect exactly what transpired in the grand jury,"" such as transcripts of witness testimony, Rule 6(e) has been held to be a bar to congressional access. (137)          The case law would appear to indicate that Rule 6(e) would not preclude disclosure of the following types of documents:     Documents within the possession of the Department of Justice concerning a particular case or investigation, other than transcripts of grand jury proceedings and material indicating ""the identities of witnesses or jurors, the substance of testimony, the strategy or direction of the investigation, the deliberations or questions of jurors, and the like.""  Material that would not otherwise be identifiable as grand jury material does not become secret by Department of Justice identification. (138)    Immunity letters, draft pleadings, target letters, and draft indictments. (139)    Plea agreements as long as particular grand jury matters are not expressly mentioned. (140)    Third party records which pre-exist the grand jury investigation even if they are in the possession of the Department of Justice as custodian for the grand jury. (141)    Memoranda, notes, investigative files, and other records of FBI agents or other government investigators except to the extent those documents internally identify or clearly define activities of the grand jury. (142)      VI.      INVESTIGATIVE OVERSIGHT HEARINGS           A.  Jurisdiction and Authority          A congressional committee is a creation of its parent House and only has the power to inquire into matters within the scope of the authority that has been delegated to it by that body.  Thus, the  enabling rule or resolution which gives the committee life is the charter which defines the grant and limitations of the committee's power. (143)  In construing the scope of a committee's authorizing charter, courts will look to the words of the rule or resolution itself, and then, if necessary to the usual sources of legislative history such as floor debate, legislative reports, past committee practice and interpretations. (144)  Jurisdictional authority for a ""special"" investigation may be given to a standing committee, (145)  a joint committee of both houses,  (146)  or a special subcommittee of a standing committee,  (147)  among other vehicles.  In view of the specificity with which Senate (148)  and House (149)  rules now confer jurisdiction on standing committees, as well as the care with which most authorizing resolutions for select committees have been drafted in recent years, sufficient models exist to avoid a successful judicial challenge by a witness that noncompliance was justified by a committee's overstepping its delegated scope of authority.          B.  Rules Applicable to Hearings          Rules of both Houses  (150)  require that committees adopt written rules of procedure and publish them in the Congressional Record.  The failure to publish has resulted in the invalidation of a perjury conviction. (151)   Once properly promulgated, such rules are judicially cognizable and must be ""strictly observed. (152)   The House (153)  and many individual Senate committees require that all witnesses by given a copy of the committee's rule.         Both the House and Senate have adopted rules permitting a reduced quorum for taking testimony and receiving evidence.  House hearings may be conducted if at least two members are present; (154)  the Senate permits hearings with one only member in attendance. (155)   Although most committees have adopted the minimum quorum requirement, some have not, while others require a higher quorum for sworn rather than unsworn testimony.  For perjury purposes, the quorum requirement must be met at the time the allegedly perjured testimony is given, not at the beginning of the session. (156)  Reduced quorum requirement rules do not apply to authorization for the issuance of subpoenas.  Senate rules require a one-third quorum of a committee or subcommittee and the House a quorum of a majority of the members, unless a committee delegates authority for issuance to its chairman. (157)          Senate and House rules limit the authority of their committees to meet in closed session. (158)   A House rule provides, however, that testimony ""shall"" be held in closed session if a majority of a committee or subcommittee determines it ""may tend to defame, degrade, or incriminate any person"". (159)   Such testimony taken in closed session is normally releasable only by a majority vote of the committee. (160)   Similarly, confidential material received in a closed session requires a majority vote for release. (161)   A release of confidential materials in accordance with applicable rules effectively minimizes objections by a submitting witness. (162)  Moreover, the Speech or Debate clause (163)  will protect a member who discloses such information on the floor from legal redress, although not from the possibility of internal discipline. (164)          House Rule XI(3)(e)  provides that the broadcast of open committee hearings may be permitted by a majority vote of the committee in accordance with written rules adopted by the committee.  Individual committees have adopted a variety of rules with respect to such coverage.   House Rule XI(3)(f)(2)  affords an absolute right to a subpoenaed witness to demand no broadcast or photographic coverage of his testimony.  There is comparable rule in the Senate, that body allowing each committee to adopt its own policy. (165)             C.  Conducting Hearings            The chairman of a committee or subcommittee, or in his or her absence, the ranking majority member present, normally presides over the conduct of a hearing.  An opening statement by the chair is usual, and in the case of an investigative hearing is an important means of defining the subject matter of the hearing and thereby establishing the pertinence of questions asked the witnesses.  Not all committees swear in their witnesses; some committees require that all witnesses be sworn.  Most leave it to the discretion of the chair.  If a committee wishes the potential sanction of perjury to apply, it should swear its witnesses, though false statements not under oath are subject to criminal sanctions. (166)          A witness does not have a right to make a statement before being questioned, (167)  but that opportunity is usually accorded.  Committee rules may prescribe the length of such statements and may also require that written statements be submitted in advance of the hearing.  Questioning of witnesses may be structured so that members alternate for specified length of time.  Questioning may also be done by staff.  Witnesses may be allowed to review a transcript of their testimony and to make non-substantive corrections.         The right of a witness to be accompanied by counsel is recognized by House rule (168)  and the rules of Senate committees.  The House rule limits the role of counsel as solely ""for the purpose of advising them [witnesses] concerning their constitutional rights.""  Some committees have adopted rules specifically prohibiting counsel from ""coaching"" witness during their testimony. (169)   A committee has complete authority to control the conduct of counsel.  Indeed,  House Rule XI(2)(k)(4)  provides that ""[t]he chairman may punish breaches of order and decorum, and of professional ethics on the part of counsel, by censure or exclusion from the hearings; and the committee may cite the offender for contempt.""  Some Senate committees have adopted similar rules. (170)   There is no right of cross-examination of adverse witnesses during an investigative hearing. (171)           D. Constitutional and Common Law Testimonial Privileges of                 Witnesses                   (1)       Constitutional Privileges          It is well established that the protections of the Bill of Rights extend to witnesses before a legislative inquiry. (172)  and thus may pose significant limitations on congressional investigations.  The scope of the protections of the  Fifth ,  First  and  Fourth amendments  and the manner of the their invocation are briefly reviewed.                             (a)      Fifth Amendment          The  Fifth Amendment  provides that ""no person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.""  The privilege is personal in nature, (173)  and may not be invoked on behalf of a corporation, (174)  small partnership, (175)  labor union, (176)  or other artificial entity. (177)   The privilege protects a witness against being compelled to testify but not against a subpoena for existing documentary evidence. (178)   However, where compliance with a subpoena  duces tecum  would constitute an implicit testimonial authentication of the documents produced, the privilege may apply. (179)          There is no particular formulation of words necessary to invoke the privilege.  All that is required is that the witness' objection be stated in a manner that the ""committee may be reasonably expected to understand as an attempt to invoke the privilege"". (180)   To the extent there is any doubt about the witness' intent, it is incumbent on the committee to ask the witness whether he or she is in fact invoking the privilege. (181)   But a witness before a congressional committee may not remain silent.  The privilege must be invoked in response to a specific question that might incriminate him.  Nor may a witness refuse to take the oath on Fifth Amendment grounds. (182)          A witness may plead the Fifth Amendment not only to questions whose answers would in themselves support a conviction, but also to those questions which, if answered, would serve as a ""link in the chain of evidence"" that would tend to incriminate him. (183)          The committee can review the assertion of the privilege by a witness to determine its validity, but the witness is not required to prove the precise hazard that he fears.  In regard to the assertion of the privilege in judicial proceedings, the Supreme Court has advised:    To sustain the privilege, it need only be evident, from the implications of the question, in the setting in which it is asked, that a responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result ....  To reject a claim, it should be perfectly clear from a careful consideration of all the circumstances of the case that the witness is mistaken and that the answers cannot possibly have a tendency' to incriminate. (184)          The basis for asserting the privilege was elaborated upon in a lower court decision:                        The privilege may only be asserted when there is reasonable apprehension on the part of the witness that his answer would furnish some evidence upon which he could be convicted of a criminal offense... or which would reveal sources from which evidence could be obtained that would lead to such conviction or to prosecution therefor.... Once it has become apparent that the answers to a question would expose a witness to the danger of conviction or prosecution, wider latitude is permitted the witness in refusing to answer other questions. (185)          The privilege against self-incrimination may be waived by declining to assert it, specifically disclaiming it, or testifying on the same matters as to which the privilege is later asserted.  However, because of the importance of the privilege, a court will not construe an ambiguous statement of a witness before a committee as a waiver. (186)          Finally it should be noted that the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment requires that ""the pertinency of the interrogation to the topic under the ...committee's inquiry must be brought home to the witness at the time the questions are put to him."" (187)   ""Unless the subject matter has been made to appear with undisputable clarity, it is the duty of the investigative body, upon objection of the witness on grounds of pertinency, to state for the record the subject under inquiry at that time and the manner in which the propounded questions are pertinent thereto."" (188)  Additionally, to satisfy both the requirement of due process as well as the statutory requirement that a refusal to answer be ""willful"", a witness should be informed of the committee's ruling on any objections he raises or privileges which he asserts. (189)                          ( b)  First Amendment          Although the  First Amendment , by its terms, is expressly applicable only to  legislation  that abridges freedom of speech, press, or assembly, the Court has held that the amendment also restricts Congress in conducting investigations. (190)   In the leading case involving the application of First Amendment rights in a congressional investigation,  Barenblatt v. United States , (191)  the Court held that ""where first amendment rights are asserted to bar government interrogation, resolution of the issue always involves a balancing by the courts of the competing private and public interests at stake in the particular circumstances shown.""  Thus, unlike the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, the First Amendment does not give a witness an absolute right to refuse to respond to congressional demands for information. (192)          The Court has held that in balancing the personal interest in privacy against the congressional need for information, ""the critical element is the existence of, and the weight to be ascribed to, the interest of the Congress in demanding disclosure from an unwilling witness."" (193)  In order to protect the rights of witnesses, in cases involving the First Amendment the courts have emphasized the requirements discussed above concerning authorization for the investigation, delegation of power to investigate to the committee involved, and the existence of a legislative purpose. (194)          The Supreme Court has recognized the application of the First Amendment to congressional investigations, and although the Amendment has frequently been asserted by witnesses as grounds for not complying with congressional demands for information, the Court has never relied on the First Amendment as grounds for reversing a criminal contempt of Congress conviction. (195)  However, the Court has narrowly construed the scope of a committee's authority so as to avoid reaching a First Amendment issue. (196)  And the Court has ruled in favor of a witness who invoked his First Amendment rights in response to questioning by a state legislative committee. (197)                           (c)  Fourth Amendment           Dicta  in opinions of the Supreme Court indicate that the  Fourth Amendment's  prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures is applicable to congressional committees. (198)   It appears that there must be probable cause for the issuance of a congressional subpoena. (199)   The Fourth Amendment protects a congressional witness against a subpoena which is unreasonably broad or burdensome. (200)  The Court has delineated the test be used in judging the reasonableness of a congressional subpoena:    Petitioner contends that the subpoena was so broad as to constitute an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment....  `Adequacy or excess in the breath of the subpoena are matters variable in relation to the nature, purposes, and scope of the inquiry' . . .  The subcommittee's inquiry here was a relatively broad one ... and the permissible scope of materials that could reasonably be sought was necessarily equally broad.  It was not reasonable to suppose that the subcommittee knew precisely what books and records were kept by the Civil Rights Congress, and therefore the subpoena could only `specify ... with reasonable particularity, the subjects to which the documents...relate....'  The call of the subpoena for `all records, correspondence and memoranda' of the Civil Rights Congress relating to the specified subject describes them `with all of the particularity the nature of the inquiry and the [subcommittee's] situation would permit' ....'  The description contained in the subpoena was sufficient to enable [petitioner] to know what particular documents were required and to select them accordingly.' (201)     If a witness has a legal objection to a subpoena  duces tecum  or is for some reason unable to comply with a demand for documents, he must give the grounds for his noncompliance upon the return of the subpoena.  As a court of appeals stated in one case:    If [the witness] felt he could refuse compliance because he considered the subpoena so broad as to constitute an unreasonable search and seizure within the prohibition of the Fourth Amendment, then to avoid contempt for complete noncompliance he was under [an] obligation to inform the subcommittee of his position.  The subcommittee would then have had the choice of adhering to the subpoena as formulated or of meeting the objection in light of any pertinent representations made by [the witness]. (202)          Similarly, if a subpoenaed party is in doubt as to what records are required by a subpoena or believes that it calls for documents not related to the investigation, he must inform the committee.  Where a witness is unable to produce documents he will not be held in contempt ""unless he is responsible for their unavailability... or is impeding justice by not explaining what happened to them . . ."" (203)          The application of the exclusionary rule to congressional committees is in some doubt and will depend on the precise facts of the situation.  It seems that documents which were unlawfully seized at the direction of a congressional investigating committee may not be admitted into evidence in a subsequent unrelated criminal prosecution because of the command of the exclusionary rule. (204)   In the absence of a Supreme Court ruling, it remains unclear whether the exclusionary rule bars the admission into evidence in a contempt prosecution of a congressional subpoena which was issued on the basis of documents obtained by the committee following their unlawful seizure by another investigating body (such as a state prosecutor). (205)                    (2)       The Common Law Attorney-Client and Work Product Privileges          The precedents of the Senate and the House of Representatives, which are founded on Congress' inherent constitutional prerogative to investigate, establish that the acceptance of a claim of attorney-client or work product privilege rests in the sound discretion of a congressional committee regardless of whether a court would uphold the claim in the context of litigation.  In practice, committee resolutions of claims of these privileges have involved a pragmatic assessment of the needs of the individual committee to accomplish its legislative mission and the potential burdens and harms that may be imposed on a claimant of the privilege if it is denied.         Thus the exercise of committee discretion whether to accept a claim of attorney-client work product privilege has turned on a ""weighing [of] the legislative need for disclosure against any possible resulting injury."" (206)   More particularly, the process of committee resolution of claims of privilege has traditionally been informed by weighing considerations of legislative need, public policy, and the statutory duty of congressional committees to engage in continuous oversight of the application, administration, and execution of laws that fall within its jurisdiction, (207)  against any possible injury to the witness.  In the particular circumstances of any situation, a committee may consider and evaluate the strength of a claimant's assertion in light of the pertinency of the documents or information sought to the subject of the investigation, the practical unavailability of the documents or information from any other source, the possible unavailability of the privilege to the claimant if it were to be raised in a judicial forum, and the committee's assessment of the cooperation of the witness in the matter, among other considerations.  A valid claim of privilege, free of any taint of waiver, exception or other mitigating circumstance, would merit substantial weight.  But any serious doubt as to the validity of the asserted claim would diminish its compelling character.         The discussion will begin with a brief overview of the constitutional origins and basis for Congress' discretionary control over such claims of privilege and recent examples of committee exercises of that discretion, followed by a review of the requirements for assertion of the attorney-client and work product privileges.  Next the law with respect to waiver of the privilege and exceptions to assertion of the privilege is detailed.                          (a)  The nature and development of Congress' discretionary control over witness' claims of privilege          As with the legislature's inherent authority to investigate, (208)  the discretion to entertain claims of privilege traces back to the model of the English Parliament.  Erskine May's Treatise on the Law, Privileges, Proceedings and Usage of Parliament, the definitive authority on English parliamentary procedure, specifically notes:         A witness is, however, bound to answer all questions which the committee sees fit to put to him, and cannot excuse himself, for example, on the ground that he may thereby subject himself to a civil action, or because he has taken an oath not to disclose the matter about which he is required to testify, or because the matter was a privileged communication to him, as where a solicitor is called upon to disclose the secrets of his client ... some of which would be sufficient grounds of excuse in a court of law. (209)          The rare instances of the exercise of the prerogative to deny use of the privileges have been consistent in the rejection of the applicability of the privileges.  In the nineteenth century, Charles W. Woolley, an attorney, was found in contempt of the House and imprisoned for refusal to answer questions about a scheme for bribing senators during Andrew Johnson's impeachment proceeding despite a claim of attorney-client privilege. (210)  Also, in the notable investigation into the financing of the Union Pacific Railroad and the activities of the Credit Mobilier, a House Committee held Joseph B. Stewart in contempt notwithstanding his assertion of attorney-client privilege. (211)   More recently, a Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee has on a number of occasions rejected claims of attorney-client privilege. (212)   No court has ever questioned the assertion of the prerogative, and both Houses of Congress have rejected opportunities to impose the attorney-client privilege as a binding rule for committee investigations. (213)   Contemporary congressional practice has, in fact, evolved a delicate balancing process to ensure its fair application.  Thus the exercise of committee discretion has been held to turn on a ""weighing [of] the legislative need against any possible injury"" to one asserting the privilege and the application of this test has involved painstaking examinations of potential detriment and relevant judicial precedents. (214)          Perhaps the most emphatic and authoritative assertion of the committee prerogative in this area is the 1986 House action holding Ralph and Joseph Bernstein in contempt for refusal to give the Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs requested information pertaining to their relations with Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos.  Their refusal rested primarily on the assertion of attorney-client privilege. (215)   The Subcommittee rejected these claims on two grounds:  ""That the claim of privilege would not be upheld even in a court, and that a congressional committee was obliged to decide whether to accept such claims of privilege apart from whether a court would uphold the claim."" (216)   The full Committee, bowing to the concerns and preferences of some members that it was not necessary under the circumstances of the matter to rely equally on the broader second ground, recommended that ""the U.S. attorney, in presenting this matter, proceed primarily and strongly with emphasis on the primary ground relied on by the Subcommittee that this claim of privilege would not have been upheld even in a court."" (217)   Thus it is clear that the recommendation to the full House, which was adopted by an overwhelming vote of 352-34, (218)  encompassed full recognition of the prerogative to deny assertions of attorney-client privilege.           Senate practice and precedent are in strong and complementary accord with that of the House.  Two denials by Senate committees of claims of privilege serve to illustrate.  In March of 1989, the Subcommittee on Nuclear Regulation of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works commenced investigating claims that settlement agreements were being entered between employers and employees of nuclear facilities which placed restrictions on an employee's ability to testify in Nuclear Regulatory Commission proceedings relating to licensing and safety matters with respect to such facilities.  The Subcommittee was seeking to determine the nature and extent of such restrictive agreements at a particular facility and the prevalence and potential impact of such agreements in the industry generally.  Subpoenas were issued and several were not complied with on the grounds of the attorney-client and work product privileges.  On July 19, 1989, the Subcommittee issued a formal opinion rejecting the claim of privilege.  The opinion asserted that    [W]e start with the jurisdictional proposition that this Subcommittee possesses the authority to determine the validity of any attorney-client privilege that is asserted before the Subcommittee.  A committee's or subcommittee's authority to receive or compel testimony derives from the constitutional authority of the Congress to conduct investigation and take testimony as necessary to carry out its legislative powers.  As an independent branch of government with such constitutional authority, the Congress must necessarily have the independent authority to determine the validity of non-constitutional evidentiary privileges that are asserted before the Congress.  (219)          The opinion continued by observing that while it recognized its ""independent authority to rule on an assertion of the attorney-client privilege...  the Subcommittee will nonetheless look to judicial and other rulings in this area to guide the Subcommittee's determination.""  (220)   Finding that the holder of the privilege (the employee in question) ""has made extensive disclosures concerning communications between himself and his attorneys [the claimants of the privilege] regarding the agreement, and has called the competence of his former attorneys into question,"" the Subcommittee ruled that the privilege would have been deemed waived by a court, denied the claim, and ordered the attorneys to testify.  (221)          More recently, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Governmental Affairs Committee denied a claim of attorney-client privilege under unusual circumstances.  The Subcommittee was investigating allegations that under the Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) program insurance companies, including Provident Life and Accident Company (Provident), had failed to comply with their obligations to pay certain claims as the primary payer with Medicare being the secondary payer, which resulted in sizeable overpayments by Medicare.  The Subcommittee subpoenaed many documents, including one from Provident which it refused to give upon the ground that it was cloaked by the attorney-client privilege.  Provident also argued that the Subcommittee was bound by a ruling to that effect made by a Federal district court in a pending civil suit.  In order to prevent the author of the document from testifying before the Subcommittee, Provident sought an injunction from the district court to prevent her testimony.  The court denied the injunction, ruling that Provident had failed to allege a case or controversy, that the issue was not ripe for judicial determination, and that Provident had failed to fulfill the equitable requirements for preliminary injunctive relief.  The court also noted that its earlier ruling on the attorney-client privilege ""which is not of constitutional dimensions, is certainly not binding on the Congress of the United States."" (222)   Subsequently, the Chairman heard testimony and arguments on the claim in executive session.  He noted that ""[t]he burden, then, as I see it, is on you as the party claiming the privilege to demonstrate that the privilege exists and to tell us why.""  On June 15, 1990 the Chairman ruled that Provident had waived any privilege that might have attached to the document in question when it provided the document to the Department of Justice. (223)          This historic congressional practice appears reflective of the widely divergent nature of the judicial and legislative forums.  The attorney-client privilege is a product of a judicially developed public policy designed to foster an effective and fair adversary system.  The courts view the privilege as a means to foster client confidence and encourage full disclosure to an attorney.  It is argued that free communication facilitates justice by promoting proper case preparation. (224)   It is also suggested that frivolous litigation is discouraged when, based on full factual disclosure, an attorney finds that his client's case is not a strong one. (225)   Of critical importance here is the understanding that the role of attorney-client privilege is designed for, and properly confined to, the adversary process:  the adjudicatory resolution of conflicting claims of individual obligations in a civil or criminal proceeding.  But the necessity to protect the individual interest in the adversary process is less compelling in an investigative setting where a legislative committee is not empowered to adjudicate the liberty or property interests of a witness.  This is the import of those cases which have recognized that ""only infrequently have witnesses ... [in congressional hearings] been afforded procedural rights normally associated with an adjudicative proceeding."" (226)           Indeed, the suggestion that the investigatory authority of the legislative branch of government is subject to non-constitutional, common law rules developed by the judicial branch to govern its proceedings is arguably contrary to the concept of separation of powers.  It would, in effect, permit the judiciary to determine congressional procedures and is therefore difficult to reconcile with the constitutional authority granted each House of Congress to determine its own rules. (227)   Moreover, importation of the privileges and procedures of the judicial forum is likely to have a paralyzing effect on the investigatory process of the legislature.  Such judicialization is antithetical to the consensus, interest oriented approach to policy development of the legislative process.         Finally, an assertion that the denial of the privilege in the congressional setting would destroy the privilege elsewhere appears neither supported by experience nor reason.  Parliament's rule has not impaired the practice of law in England nor has its limited use here inflicted any apparent damage on the practice of the profession.  Congressional investigations in the face of claims of executive privilege or the revelations of trade secrets have not diminished the general utility of these privileges nor undermined the reasons they continue to be recognized by the courts.  Moreover, the assertion implies that current law is an impregnable barrier to disclosure of confidential communications when in fact the privilege is, of course, an exception to the general rule of disclosure and, is riddled with qualifications and exceptions, and has been subject as well as to the significant current development of the waiver doctrine.  Thus, there can be no absolute certainty that communications with an attorney will not be revealed. (228)          Moreover, with respect to the work-product privilege, it has always been recognized that it is a qualified privilege which may be overcome by a sufficient showing of need.  The Supreme Court indicated, in the very case in which it created the doctrine, that ""[w]e do not mean to say that all [ ] materials obtained or prepared ... with an eye toward litigation are necessarily free from discovery in all cases."" (229)  Thus, the courts have repeatedly held that the work product privilege is not absolute, but rather is only a qualified protection against disclosure. (230)   As one court has indicated, ""its immunity retreats as necessity and good cause is shown for its production in a balance of competing interests."" (231)          In fact, because the work product doctrine is so readily overcome when production of material is important to the discovery of needed information, some courts have refused to call the doctrine a privilege.  For instance, in  City of Philadelphia v. Westinghouse Corp., (232)  the court stated that the work product principle ""is not a privilege at all; it is merely a requirement that very good cause be shown if the disclosure is made in the course of a lawyer's preparation of a case.""                          (b)  Requirements for Assertion of the Attorney-Client Privilege          In making the assessment whether to accept a claim of attorney-client privilege, committees often have reference to whether a court would accept the claim had it been in that forum.  This section and those that follow detail the judicial requirements for a proper assertion of the claim, how the privilege may be waived, and circumstances under which it may not be claimed at all.         Although the attorney-client privilege today is seen to rest on the theory that encouraging clients to make the fullest disclosure to their attorneys enables them to act more effectively, justly, and expeditiously, and that these benefits outweigh the risks posed by not allowing full disclosure in court, (233)  even its leading proponent, Dean Wigmore, concedes the unverifiability of the assumption and advises that its use be strictly limited.    Its benefits are all indirect and speculative, its obstruction is plain and concrete...It is worth preserving for the sake of a general policy, but it is nonetheless an obstacle to the investigation of truth.  It ought to be strictly confined within the narrowest possible limits consistent with the logic of its principle. (234)     The courts have heeded Wigmore's admonition. (235)           One important manifestation of the judicial policy of strict confinement is the universal recognition that the burden of establishing the existence of the privilege rests with the party asserting the privilege. (236)   Moreover, blanket assertions of the privilege have been deemed ""unacceptable"" (237) , and are ""strongly disfavored."" (238)   The proponent must conclusively prove each element of the privilege.  Thus a claimant must reveal specific facts which would establish that the relationship was one of attorney and client.  Conclusory assertions are insufficient.  And it must demonstrate that the privilege has not expressly or impliedly waived.         Finally, it should be noted that the assertion that the disclosure of privileged material to a congressional committee would waive the privilege in any future litigation was specifically considered, and rejected, by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in  Murphy v. Department of the Army . (239)   Indeed, there appears to be no case holding otherwise and several which have followed  Murphy . (240)                           (c)  Waiver of the Attorney-Client Privilege          Because of the privilege's inhibitory effect on the truth-finding process and its impairment of the public's ""right to every man's evidence,"" (241)  modern liberal discovery rules have taken a narrow view of the privilege. (242)   This tendency toward limiting the privilege is most clearly manifested in the strict standard of waiver. (243)   Thus the voluntary disclosure of privileged information, whether by the client or the attorney with the client's consent, waives the privilege (244)  because it destroys the confidentiality of a communication and thereby undermines the justification for preventing compelled disclosures. (245)   Waiver need not be express, (246)  nor is it necessary that the client waive the privilege knowingly. (247)   Waiver may be evidenced by word or act, (248)  but may be inferred from a failure to speak or act when words or action would be necessary to preserve confidentiality. (249)   Courts regularly hold that the privilege is waived as to the material disclosed when the client or his attorney deliberately discloses the contents of a privileged communication, such as when answering interrogatories, testifying in court or at examination before trial, submitting affidavits or pleadings to the Court, or in transacting business with a third party. (250)          Furthermore, the courts have held that less than full disclosure will often cause a waiver, not only as to disclosed communications, but also as to communications relating to the same subject matter that were not themselves disclosed. (251)   By partial disclosure, the client may be voluntarily waiving the privilege as to that which he considers favorable to his position, but attempting to invoke the privilege as to the remaining material, which he considers unfavorable. (252)   Selective assertion or disclosure usually involves a material issue in the proceeding, and there is a great likelihood that the information disclosed is false or intended to mislead the other party. (253)   Thus, pleading an ""advice of counsel"" defense, which puts the attorneys advice in issue, (254)  has been held to waive the privilege as to all communications relating to that advice.  The rationale for the subject matter waiver rule is one of fairness.  Professor Wigmore has stated the principle as follows:  ""[W]hen [the client's] conduct touches a certain point of disclosure, fairness requires that his privilege shall cease whether he intended that result or not.  He cannot be allowed, after disclosing as much as he pleases, to withhold the remainder.  It is therefore designed to prevent the client from using the attorney-client privilege offensively, as an additional weapon.""         The courts also have severely limited the attorney-client privilege through the development of an implied waiver doctrine.  Thus where a client shares his attorney-client communications with a third party, the communications between attorney and client are no longer strictly ""confidential"", and the client has waived his privilege over them. (255)   Even if the client attempts to keep communications confidential by having the third party agree not to disclose the communications to anyone else the courts will still consider ""confidentiality"" between attorney and client breached and the communication no longer privileged. (256)   Courts have applied this concept of confidentiality narrowly to prevent corporations from sharing an attorney-client communication with an ally and then shielding the communication from a grand jury or adversary. (257)   As a general rule, courts also apply the waiver rule to disclosures made to government agencies. (258)   Thus a person or corporation who voluntarily discloses confidential attorney-client communications to a government agency loses the right to later assert privilege for those communications.         While some lower courts have adopted a ""limited waiver"" rule, which allows corporations to share their confidential attorney-client communications with agencies such as the SEC without having to waive the privileged status of these documents against other parties, (259)  it is a distinctly minority view.  The prevailing view, enunciated in decisions of the Second (260) , Fourth (261) , and District of Columbia Circuits, (262)  hold that ""if a client communicates information to his attorney with the understanding that the information will be revealed to others, that information, as well as `the details underlying the data which was to be published', will not enjoy the privilege."" (263)          The facts and circumstances of  In re Martin Marietta Corporation (264)  illustrate the strict manner in which the courts have applied the waiver doctrine.  In that case a mail fraud defendant sought documents, and the underlying factual details for statements made in them, submitted by his former employer to the United States Attorney and the Department of Defense in its efforts to settle criminal and administrative proceedings then pending against it.  The court noted that in a Position Paper to the U.S. Attorney describing why the company should not be indicted, it was asserted:  ""of those consulted within the Company all will testify that any qualms they had about the arrangement had nothing to do with worries about fraud"" and ""there is no evidence, testimonial or documentary, that any company officials in the meeting [of November 17, 1983] except Mr. Pollard and his Maxim employees, understood that Maxim had departed from the strict procedures of its IVI contract."" (265)   The appeals court held that these, and similar disclosures made to the Defense Department in an Administrative Settlement Agreement, waived whatever privilege it had with respect to the submitted documents and their underlying details.                          (d)  Exceptions to the Attorney-Client Privilege          Absent waiver, the attorney-client privilege generally protects from disclosure communications from a client to his lawyer or his lawyer's agent relating to the lawyers rendering of legal advice which was made with the expectation of confidentiality, but not in furtherance of a future crime, fraud, or tort.  However, the courts have strictly confined the privilege and developed a number of important qualifications and exceptions.         First, the case law has consistently emphasized that one of the essential elements of the attorney-client privilege is that the attorney be acting as an attorney and that the communication be made for the purpose of securing legal services.  The privilege therefore does not attach to incidental legal advice given by an attorney acting outside the scope of his role as attorney.  ""`Acting as a lawyer' encompasses the whole orbit of legal functions.  When he acts as an advisor, the attorney must give  predominantly  legal advice to retain his client's privilege of non-disclosure, not solely, or even largely, business advice."" (266)             In order to ascertain whether an attorney is acting in a legal or business advisory capacity the courts have held it proper to question either the client or the attorney regarding the general nature of the attorney's services to his client, the scope of his authority as agent and the substance of matters which the attorney, as agent, is authorized to pass along to third parties. (267)   Indeed, invocation of the privilege may be predicated on revealing facts tending to establish the existence of an attorney-client relation.         A further manifestation of the judicial proclivity to confine the scope of the privilege is the general rule requiring disclosure of the fact of employment, the identity of the person employing him or the name of the real party in interest, the terms of the employment, and such related facts as the client's address, occupation or business and the amount of the fee and who paid it. (268)   The courts have reasoned that the existence of the relation of attorney and client is not a privileged communication.  The privilege pertains to the subject matter and not to the fact of the employment as attorney.         Another significant exception to the privilege occurs when a communication between client and attorney is for the purpose of committing a crime or perpetuating a fraud at some future time. (269)   The policy reasons for this exception are obvious.  Society has an interest in protecting the confidences of a client to his lawyer even concerning already committed crimes, frauds and torts.  The harm from nondisclosure is limited because the past event can no longer be prevented.  Society also has an interest in protecting the confidence of a client who seeks legal advice about neutral acts.  But society has no interest in facilitating the commission of contemplated but not yet committed crimes, torts or frauds.  On the contrary, society has every interest in forestalling such acts.  Therefore, the attorney-client privilege has been held not to attach to such acts.    VII. RIGHTS OF MINORITY PARTY MEMBERS IN THE     INVESTIGATORY PROCESS          The role of members of the minority party in the investigatory oversight process is governed by the rules of each House and its committees.  While minority members are specifically accorded some rights ( e.g.,  whenever a hearing is conducted on any measure or matter, the minority may, upon the written request of a majority of the minority members to the chairman before the completion of the hearing, call witnesses selected by the minority, and presumably request documents (270) ), no House or committee rules authorize ranking minority members or individual members on their own to institute official committee investigations, hold hearings or to issue subpoenas.  Individual members may seek the voluntary cooperation of agency officials or private persons.  But no judicial precedent has recognized a right in an individual member, other than the chair of a committee, (271)  to exercise the authority of a committee in the context of oversight without the permission of a majority of the committee or its chair.         The question of the nature and scope of the rights of minority party members in the investigatory process came into sharp focus in the 103d Congress.  Then, for the first time in over a decade, both Houses and the White House were in the control of one party, while at the same time the Whitewater matter began to emerge as a matter of serious political importance.  Principal jurisdiction over many of the areas of concern fell within mandates of the House and Senate Banking Committees.         The Ranking Minority Member of the House Banking Committee was particularly aggressive in seeking to obtain documents and testimony from the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) and the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC), the agencies handling the investigation of the failure of the Madison Guarantee Savings & Loan Association and related matters.  The agencies refused to turn over what were claimed by the Ranking Minority Member to be key documents and were supported by the chairman of the Banking Committee who directed the agencies not to cooperate on the grounds that no investigation had been authorized by the committee nor were hearings on the matter contemplated.  The Ranking Minority Member brought suit to compel disclosure of the documents. (272)          An obstacle to the suit was a 1983 court ruling in  Lee v. Kelley.  (273)  There a court held,  inter alia,  that an attempt by Senator Jesse Helms to intervene in the case in order to unseal FBI tapes and transcripts concerning Martin Luther King to enable him to utilize the information as part of the debate on legislation proposing to establish a national holiday commemorating King's birth, would be dismissed as an exercise of the courts ""equitable discretion"" because Senator Helms' action was an effort to enlist the court in his dispute with fellow legislators.  Helms had argued that because no committee hearings were being conducted to inform Senators of facts to justify or defeat the passage of the legislation, he was seeking to fill that void by performing the investigative function the Senate leadership had decided to forego. (274)  The district court ruled that ""[i]t is not for this court to review the adequacy of the deliberative process of the Senate leadership .... [T]o conclude otherwise would represent an obvious intrusion by the judiciary into the legislative arena.  In any event, the proper forum for this [dispute] is the Senate, `for [i]t would be unwise to permit the federal courts to become a higher legislature where a congressman who has failed to persuade his colleagues can always renew the battle.'"" (275)          In an attempt to avoid the adverse consequences of  Lee,  the Ranking Minority Member sought to compel disclosure of the documents under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), (276)  which explicitly exempts Congress from its withholding provisions,  (277)  and under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), (278)  alleging that the documents were arbitrarily and capriciously withheld.  It was not successful.  While finding the claims ""technically justiciable"", (279)  the district court held that it had to invoke the District of Columbia Circuit's doctrine of equitable or remedial discretion and dismiss the claims since this was a case ""in which a congressional plaintiff's dispute is primarily with his or her fellow legislators.""  The court concluded that ""[i]t is clear . . . that Representative Leach's complaint derives solely from his failure to persuade his colleagues to authorize his request for the documents in question, and that Plaintiff thus has a clear `collegial remedy' capable of affording him substantial relief."" (280)          Despite the apparent difficulty in obtaining judicial redress, some measure of practical success was achieved as a result of intense public pressure brought to bear by the minority and its supporters on the majority party and the White House.  A Justice Department investigation into the handling of the RTC recommendation to the United States Attorney's office for a further criminal investigation was commenced in November 1993; the White House in December, 1993 authorized turning over Whitewater documents to the Justice Department team investigating the handling of the matter; in January 1994 the White House agreed to the appointment by the Attorney General of an independent counsel with broad authority to investigate Whitewater matters; both Houses agreed in principle in March 1994 to hold hearings; and in July and August 1994 hearings were held by the House and Senate Banking Committees.  The legal challenge thus may be viewed as part the overall strategy to force public hearings by Congress, although in the long run the precedent established may have virtually foreclosed future resort to the courts under analogous circumstances.         The  Leach  court also suggested that the possibility of a ""collegial remedy"" for the minority exists, pointing to 5 U.S.C. 2954 under which small groups of members of the House Government Reform and Oversight and Senate Governmental Affairs Committees can request information from executive agencies without the need of formal committee action.  (281)  However, the precise scope and efficacy of this provision is uncertain.         5 U.S.C. 2954 is derived from section 2 of the Act of May 29, 1928, (282)  which originally referred not to the current committees generally overseeing government agency operations but their predecessors, the House and Senate Committees on Expenditures in the Executive Departments.  The principal purpose of the 1928 Act, embodied in its first section, was to repeal legislation which required the submission to the Congress of some 128 reports, many of which had become obsolete in part, and which, in any event, had no value, served no useful purpose, and were not printed by the House of Representatives. (283)            Section 2 of the 1928 Act contains the language which has been codified in 5 U.S.C. 2954.  The legislative history, however, indicates that the purpose of the 1928 Act was not to assert a sweeping right of Congress to obtain any information it might desire from the executive branch.  Rather, the aim of the section was far more limited.  Thus, the Senate Report stated that its purpose was to make ""it possible to require any report discontinued by the language of this bill to be resubmitted to either House upon its necessity becoming evident to the membership of either body."" (284)   Or, in the words of the House Report:  ""To save any question as to the right of the House of Representatives to have furnished any of the information contained in the reports proposed to be abolished, a provision has been added to the bill requiring such information to be furnished to the Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments or upon the request of any seven members thereof."" (285)          It would appear, then, that the scope of 5 U.S.C. 2954 is closely tied to the 128 reports abolished by section 1 of the 1928 legislation. (286)   Moreover, the provision lacks a compulsory component.  Agency refusals to comply would not be subject to existing contempt processes, and the outcome of a civil suit to compel production on the basis of the provision is problematic despite the  Leach  court's suggestion.  Further, the provision applies only to the named committees; thus members of all other committees would still face the  Leach  problem.  Finally, even members of the named Committees are still likely to have to persuade a court that their claim is no more than an intramural dispute.         The rules of the Senate provide substantially more effective means for individual minority party members to engage in ""self-help"" to support oversight objectives than their House counterparts.  Senate rules emphasize the rights and prerogative of individual Senators and, therefore, minority groups of Senators. (287)   The most important of these rules are those that effectively allow unlimited debate on a bill or amendment unless an extraordinary majority vote to invoke cloture. (288)   Senators can use their right to filibuster, or simply the threat of filibuster, to delay or prevent the Senate from engaging in legislative business.   The Senate's rules also are a source of other minority rights that can directly or indirectly aid the minority in gaining investigatory rights.  For example, the right of extended debate applies in committee as well as on the floor, with one crucial difference:  the Senate's cloture rule may not be invoked in committee.  Each Senate committee decides for itself how it will control debate, and therefore a filibuster opportunity in a committee may be even greater than on the floor.  Also,  Senate Rule XXVI   prohibits the reporting of any measure or matter from a committee unless a majority of the committee are present, another point of possible tactical leverage.  Even beyond the potent power to delay, Senators can promote their goals by taking advantage of other parliamentary rights and opportunities that are provided by the Senate's formal procedures and customary practices such as are afforded by the processes dealing with floor recognition, committee referrals, and the amending process.

ROLE OF THE OFFICES OF SENATE LEGAL COUNSEL AND HOUSE GENERAL COUNSEL          For almost two decades the offices of Senate Legal Counsel and House General Counsel have developed parallel yet distinctly unique and independent roles as institutional legal ""voices"" of the two bodies they represent.  Familiarity with the structure and operation of these offices and the nature of the support they may provide committees in the context of an investigative oversight proceeding is essential.           A.  Senate Legal Counsel          The Office of Senate Legal Counsel (290)  was created by Title VII of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 (291)  ""to serve the institution of congress rather than the partisan interests of one party or another."" (292)   The Counsel and Deputy Counsel are appointed by the President pro tempore of the Senate upon the recommendation of the Majority and Minority Leaders.  The appointment of each is made effective by a resolution of the Senate, and each may be removed from office by a resolution of the Senate.  The term of appointment of the Counsel and Deputy Counsel is two Congresses.  The appointment of the Counsel and Deputy Counsel and the Counsel's appointment of Assistant Senate Legal Counsel are required to be made without regard to political affiliation.  The office is responsible to a bipartisan Joint Leadership Group, which is comprised of the Majority and Minority Leaders, the President pro tempore, and the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committees on the Judiciary and on Rules and Administration. (293)          The Act specifies the activities of the office, two of which are of immediate interest to committee oversight concerns:  representing committees of the Senate in proceedings to aid them in investigations and advising committees and officers of the Senate. (294)                   (1)  Proceedings to Aid Investigations by Senate Committees           The Senate Legal Counsel may represent committees in proceedings to obtain evidence for Senate investigations.  Two specific proceedings are authorized.         18 U.S.C. § 6005 provides that a committee or subcommittee of either House of Congress may request an immunity order from a United States district court when the request has been approved by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Members of the full committee.  By the same vote, a Committee may direct the Senate Legal Counsel to represent it or any of its subcommittees in an application for an immunity order. (295)          The Senate Legal Counsel may also be directed to represent a committee or subcommittee of the Senate, and also the Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices, (296)  in a civil action to enforce a subpoena.  Prior to the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, subpoenas of the Senate could be enforced only through the cumbersome method of a contempt proceeding before the bar of the Senate or by a certification to the United States attorney and a prosecution for criminal contempt of Congress under 2 U.S.C. §§ 192, 194.  The Ethics Act authorizes a third method to enforce Senate subpoenas, through a civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. (297)   The House chose not to avail itself of this procedure and this enforcement method applies only to Senate subpoenas.  Senate subpoenas have been enforced in several civil actions.  See, for example proceedings to hold in contempt a recalcitrant witness in the impeachment proceedings against Judge Alcee L. Hastings (298)  and proceedings to enforce a subpoena  duces tecum  for the production of diaries of Senator Bob Packwood. (299)          The statute details the procedure for directing the Senate Legal Counsel to bring a civil action to enforce a subpoena.  In contrast to an application for an immunity order, which may be authorized by a committee, only the full Senate by resolution may authorize an action to enforce a subpoena. (300)  The Senate may not consider a resolution to direct the Counsel to bring an action unless the investigating committee reports the resolution by a majority vote.  The statute specifies the required contents of the committee report; among other matters, the committee must report on the extent to which the subpoenaed party has complied with the subpoena, the objections or privileges asserted by the witness, and the comparative effectiveness of a criminal and civil proceeding. (301)  A significant limitation on the civil enforcement remedy is that it excludes from its coverage actions against officers or employees of the federal government acting within their official capacities.  Its reach is limited to natural persons and to entities acting or purporting to act under the color of state law. (302)                   (2)  Advice to committees and officers of the Senate and other duties.          The Ethics Act details a number of advisory functions of the Office of Senate Legal Counsel.  Principal among these are the responsibility of advising officers of the Senate with respect to subpoenas or requests for the withdrawal of Senate documents, and the responsibility of advising committees about their promulgation and implementation of rules and procedures for congressional investigations.  The office also provides advice about legal questions that arise during the course of investigations. (303)          The Act also provides that the Counsel shall perform such other duties consistent with the non-partisan purposes and limitations of Title VII as the Senate my direct. (304)  Thus in 1980 the Office was used in the investigation relating to Billy Carter and Libya and worked under the direction of the chairman and vice-chairman of the subcommittee charged with the conduct of that investigation. (305)  Members of the Office have also undertaken special assignments such as the Senate's investigation of Abscam and other undercover activities, (306)  the impeachment proceedings of Judge Harry Claiborne, (307)  Judge Walter L. Nixon, Jr., (308)  and Judge Alcee L. Hastings, Jr.,  (309)  and the confirmation hearings of Justice Clarence E. Thomas.         In addition, the Counsel's office provides information and advice to Members, officers and employees on a wide range of legal and administrative matters relating to Senate business.  Unlike the House practice, the Senate Legal Counsel plays no formal role in the review and issuance of subpoenas.  However, since it may become involved civil enforcement proceedings, it has welcomed the opportunity to review proposed subpoenas for form and substance prior to their issuance by committees.           B.  House General Counsel           A non-statutory office, the House General Counsel has evolved in an ad hoc, incremental manner since the mid-1970's, from its historic role as a legal advisor to the Clerk of the House on a range of administrative matters that fell within the jurisdiction of the Clerk's office, to that of lawyer for the institution.  At the beginning of the 103d Congress it was made a separate House office, reporting directly to the Speaker, charged with the responsibility ""of providing legal assistance and representation to the House."" (310)   However, as a consequence of administrative restructuring at the start of the 104th Congress, the Office was again placed in the Clerk's Office.  While the function and role of the House General Counsel and the Senate Legal Counsel with respect to oversight assistance to committees and protection of institutional prerogatives are similar, (311)  there are significant differences that need be noted.         The General Counsel and the Deputy General Counsel are appointed by the Speaker and serve at his pleasure.  Traditionally the General Counsel has tendered his resignation to a new incoming Speaker.  Authorization for actions by the General Counsel to represent the interests of the House in court is often given by the Joint Leadership Group, consisting of the Speaker, Majority Leader, Majority Whip, Minority Leader and Minority Whip. (312)   On other occasions, the Office will act pursuant to the direction of the majority leadership or the Speaker alone. (313)          Unlike the Senate, subpoenas may only be issued over the seal of the Clerk of the House.  In practice, committees work closely with the General Counsel in drafting subpoenas and every subpoena issued by a committee or officer is reviewed by the Office for substance and form.  Similarly, in the absence of civil enforcement authority, committees often seek the assistance of the General Counsel in navigating the statutory contempt process in instances of witness non-compliance with a subpoena which may culminate in a floor proceeding to authorize a contempt citation.  For example, during a committee investigation into the real estate holdings in the United States of the Philippines President Ferdinand E. Marcos and his wife, two brothers who allegedly assisted the Marcos's in their dealings were called to testify.  They declined to answer numerous questions, claiming attorney-client privilege.  The General Counsel was called in to evaluate the claims and to render an opinion whether contempt proceedings would be appropriate.  His findings served as the basis for the resolution passed by the House holding the brothers in contempt. (314)          Like the Senate Legal Counsel's office, the House General Counsel's office devotes a large portion of its time rendering informal advice to individual members and committees.  Unlike its Senate counterpart, however, the General Counsel will often provide formal advice in the form of memorandum opinions (315)  and, at times, testimony at hearings. (316)          Finally, the Office also takes on special tasks as, for example, when the deputy general counsel served as special counsel to the joint committee investigation the Iran-Contra affair and played an active role in establishing procedures for the investigation.

U.S. House of Representatives,  556 F.2d 150, 152 (D.D.C. 1983), where the district court refused to enjoin transmission by the House of Representatives of a contempt citation of the Administrator of the EPA to the United States Attorney on grounds alleging constitutional executive privilege, stating that when ""constitutional disputes arise concerning the separation of powers of the legislative and executive branches, judicial intervention should be delayed until all possibilities for settlement have been exhausted . . . judicial restraint is essential to maintain the delicate balance of powers among the branches established by the Constitution."" In both instances negotiated resolutions ultimately ended the immediate disputes.  81.           418 U.S. 683 (1974).  82.           The subpoena was for certain tape recordings and documents relating to the President's conversations with aides and advisors.  The materials were sought for use in a criminal trial.  83.           418 U.S. at 705, 706.  See also  id.  at 708, 711.  84.            Id.  at 705, 708.  Citing  Marbury v.

The Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel lists 64 instances of presidential invocation of executive privilege in the face of congressional requests for information between 1792 and October 1981.  6 OLC 751 (1982).  President Reagan invoked the privilege in November 1982 in the EPA investigation.  See, ""Contempt of Congress"", H. Rept. No. 97-968, 97th Cong., 2d Sen. 1982.

The court did not fault the committee for holding public hearings, stating that if closed hearings were rejected ""because the legislative committee deemed that an open hearing at that time was required by overriding considerations of public interest, then the committee was of course free to go ahead with its hearing, merely accepting the consequence that the trial of Delaney on the pending indictment might have to be delayed.""  199 F.2d at 114-5.  It reversed Delaney's conviction because the trial court had denied his motion for a continuance until after the publicity generated by the hearing, at which Delaney and other trial witnesses were asked to testify, subsided.

United States,  369 U.S. 599, 613 (1962)(upholding contempt conviction of person who refused to answer committee questions relating to activities for which he had been indicted by a state grand jury, citing  Delaney. )   118.        199 F.2d at 115.  119.

Id.  at 694.  126.        9 F.3d 743 (9th Cir. 1993).   127.        Boeing argued,  inter alia , that Congress could not vest enforcement functions outside the Executive Branch in private parties.  Applying  Morrison  the appeals court emphatically rejected the contention.   Before comparing the  qui tam  provisions of the FCA to the independent counsel provisions of the Ethics in Government Act, we must address Boeing's contention that only the Executive Branch has the power to enforce laws, and therefore to prosecute violations of law.   It is clear to us that no such absolute rule   exists .   Morrison  itself indicates otherwise because that decision validated the independent counsel provisions of the Ethics in Government Act even though it recognized that ""it is undeniable that the Act reduces the amount of control or supervision that the Attorney General and, through him, the President exercises over the investigation and prosecution of a certain class of alleged criminal activity.""  487 U.S. at 695.  The Court also stated in  Morrison  that ""there is no real dispute that the functions performed by the independent counsel are `executive' in the sense that they are law enforcement functions that typically have been undertaken by officials within the Executive Branch.""  487 U.S. at 692 (emphasis added).  Use of the world ""typically"" in that sentence, considered in light of the Court's ultimate conclusion upholding the independent counsel provisions, must mean that prosecutorial functions need not always be undertaken by Executive Branch officials.  See Stephanie A.J. Dangel, Note, Is Prosecution a Core Executive Function?  Morrison v. Olson and the Framers' Intent, 99 Yale L.J. 1069, 1070 (1990)(Framers intended that prosecution would be undertaken by but not constitutionally assigned to executive officials, and that such officials would typically but not always prosecute).   Thus, we reject Boeing's assertion that all prosecutorial power of any kind belongs to the Executive Branch.    9 F.3d at 751 (emphasis supplied).   128.         Nixon v.

The purposes of the Speech or Debate Clause are to assure the independence of Congress in the exercise of its legislative functions and to reinforce the separation of powers established in the Constitution.   Eastland v. United States Servicemen's Fund , 421 U.S. 502-03 (1975).  The Supreme Court has read the Clause to broadly effectuate its purposes.   Id .;  United States v. Swindall , 971 F. 2d 1531, 1534 (11th Cir. 1992).  The Clause protects ""purely legislative activities"", including those inherent in the legislative process.   Chastain v. Lundquist , 833 F. 2d 311, 314 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (quoting  U.S.  v.  Brewster , 408 U.S. 501, 512 (1972),  cert. denied  487 U.S. 1240 (1988).  Actions protected under the provisions include those taken in the regular course of the legislative process and the motivations of the legislators for their actions.   United States  v.  Helstoski , 442 U.S. 477, 489 (1979).  In addition to shielding ""words spoken in debate"",  Kilbourn v. Thompson , 103 U.S. 168, 204 (1880), the Clause encompasses such activity integral to lawmaking as voting,  i d ., circulation of information to other members,  Doe v. McMillan  412 U.S. 306 (1973),  Gravel v. United States , 408 U.S. 606, 625 (1972), and participation in committee investigative proceedings, and reports.   Id., Eastland v. U.S. Servicemen's Fund, supra; Dombrowski v. Eastland , 387 U.S. 82 (1967);  Tenney v. Brandhove , 341 U.S. 367 (1951).        However, activities only casually or incidentally related to legislative affairs are outside the ambit of Speech or Debate protection.  Thus newsletter and press releases circulated by a member to the public are not shielded because they are ""primarily means of informing those outside the legislative forum"".  Hutchinson v. Proxmire , 443 U.S. 111 (1979).  Also a member may be prosecuted for accepting a bribe or for other unlawful conduct so long as the prosecution ""does not draw in question the legislative act of the defendent Member of Congress"".   United States v. Brewster, supra,  408 U.S. at 510 (quoting  United States v. Johnson , 383 U.S. at 185).  The key consideration is the act presented for examination, not the actor.  Activities integral to the legislative process may not be examined, but peripheral activities not closely connected to the business of legislating do not enjoy the protection of the Clause.

Hayes , 408 U.S. 665 (1972), the leading case on the issue of the claimed privilege of newsmen not to respond to demands of a grand jury for information.  In its 5-4 decision, the Court concluded that the need of the grand jury for the information outweighed First Amendment considerations, but there are indications in the opinion that ""the infringement of protected first amendment rights must be no broader than necessary to achieve a permissible governmental purpose,"" and that ""a State's interest must be `compelling' or `paramount' to justify even an indirect burden on first amendment rights.""   Id.  at 699-700.  For application of the compelling interest test in a legislative investigation, see  Gibson v. Florida Legislative Investigation Committee,  372 U.S. 539 (1963). See also, James J. Mangan, Contempt for the Fourth Estate: No Reporter's Privilege Before a Congressional Investigation, 83 Geo.

Although it was not in the criminal contempt context, one court of appeals has upheld a witness' First Amendment claim.  In  Stamler v. Willis,  415 F.2d 1365 (7th Cir. 1969),  cert. denied , 399 U.S. 929 (1970), the court ordered to trial a witness' suit for declaratory relief against the House Un-American Activities Committee in which it was alleged that the committee's authorizing resolution had a ""chilling effect"" on plaintiff's First Amendment rights.  In other cases for declaratory and injunctive relief brought against committees on First Amendment grounds, relief has been denied although the courts indicated that relief could be granted if the circumstances were more compelling.   Sanders v. McClellan , 463 F.2d 894 (D.C. Cir. 1972);  Davis v. Ichord,  442 F.2d 1207 (D.C. Cir. 1970);  Ansara v. Eastland , 442 F.2d 751 (D.C. Cir. 1971).  However, in  Eastland v. United States Servicemen's Fund,  421 U.S. 491 (1975), the Supreme Court held that the Constitution's Speech or Debate clause (art. I, sec. 6, cl. 1) generally bars suits challenging the validity of congressional subpoenas on First Amendment or other grounds.  Thus, a witness generally cannot raise his constitutional defenses until a subsequent criminal prosecution for contempt unless, in the case of a Senate committee, the statutory civil contempt procedure is employed.  See  United States v. House of Representatives,  556 F.Supp. 150 (D.D.C. 1983).         196.         United States v. Rumely,  345 U.S. 41 (1953).     197.         Gibson v. Florida Legislative Investigation Committee , 372 U.S. 539 (1963).  In the majority opinion, Justice Goldberg observed that ""an essential prerequisite to the validity of an investigation which intrudes into the area of constitutionally protected rights of speech, press, association and petition [is] that the State convincingly show a substantial relation [or nexus] between the information sought and a subject of overriding and compelling state interest"".

Fourth Amendment standards apply to subpoenas, such as those issued by committees, as well as to search warrants.  See  Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. v. Walling,  327 U.S. 186 (1946).  A congressional subpoena may not be used in a mere ""fishing expedition.""  See  Hearst v. Black,  87 F.2d 68, 71 (D.C. Cir. 1936), quoting,  Federal Trade Commission v. American Tobacco Co.,  264 U.S. 298, 306 (1924) (""It is contrary to the first principles of justice to allow a search through all the record, relevant or irrelevant, in the hope that something will turn up."").   Cf. United States v. Groves,  188 F.Supp. 314 (W.D. Pa. 1937)  (dicta) .  But see  Eastland v. United States Servicemen's Fund,  421 U.S. 491, 509 (1975), in which the Court recognized that an investigation may lead ""up some `blind alleys' and into nonproductive enterprises.  To be a valid legislative inquiry there need be no predictable end result"".    200.         McPhaul v. United States,  364 U.S. 372 (1960);  Shelton v. United States , 404 F.2d 1292 (D.C.

Packwood , 845 F.Supp. 17, 20-21 (D.D.C. 1994),  stay pending appeal denied , 114 S.Ct. 1036 (1994), the court rejected a claim of overbreadth with regard to a subpoena for a Senator's personal diaries, holding that committee's investigation was not limited in its investigatory scope to its original demands ""even though the diaries might prove compromising in respects the committee has not yet foreseen"".        201.

Nelson v. United States , 268 F. 2d 505 (D.C. Cir.), c ert denied , 346 U.S. 827 (1953)    205.        In  United States v. McSurely , 473 F.2d 1178, 1194 (D.C. Cir. 1972), the court of appeals reversed contempt convictions where the subcommittee subpoenas were based on information ""derived by the subcommittee through a previous unconstitutional search and seizure by [state] officials and the subcommittee's own investigator.""  The decision of the court of appeals in the contempt case was rendered in December, 1972.  In a civil case brought by the criminal defendants, Alan and Margaret McSurely, against Senator McClellan and the subcommittee staff for alleged violations of their constitutional rights by the transportation and use of the seized documents, the federal district court in June, 1973, denied the motion of the defendants for summary judgment.  While the appeal from the decision of the district court in the civil case was pending before the court of appeals, the Supreme Court held in  Calandra v. United States,  414 U.S. 338 (1974), that a grand jury is not precluded by the Fourth Amendment's exclusionary rule from questioning a witness on the basis of evidence that had been illegally seized.  A divided court of appeals subsequently held in  McSurely v. McClellan,  521 F.2d 1024, 1047 (D.C. Cir. 1975), that under  Calandra  ""a congressional committee has the right in its investigatory capacity to use the product of a past unlawful search and seizure.""        The decision of the three-judge panel in the civil case was vacated and on rehearing by the full District of Columbia Circuit, five judges were of the view that  Calandra  was applicable to the legislative sphere and another five judges found it unnecessary to decide whether  Calandra  applies to committees but indicated that, even if it does apply to the legislative branch, the exclusionary rule may restrict a committee's use of unlawfully seized documents if it does not make mere ""derivative use"" of them but commits an independent Fourth Amendment violation in obtaining them.   McSurely v. McClellan,  553 F.2d 1277, 1293-94, 1317-25 (D.C. Cir. 1976)  (en banc) .  The Supreme Court granted  certiorari  in the case, 434 U.S. 888 (1977), but subsequently dismissed  certiorari  as improvidently granted, with no explanation for this disposition of the case,  sub nom. McAdams v. McSurely , 438 U.S. 189 (1978).  Jury verdicts were eventually returned against the Senate defendants, but were reversed in part on appeal.  753 F.2d 88 (D.C. Cir. 1985),  cert. denied,  U.S. (1985).          More recently, in a contextually relevant situation, a district court quashed subpoenas issued on behalf of tobacco companies against two members of Congress for testimony and production of documents relating to a congressional investigation of the company's knowledge of the health hazards and addictiveness of tobacco.   Maddox v. Williams , 855 F. Supp. 406 (D.D.C. 1994),  appeal pending in the D.C. Circuit .  The companies had contended that the documents had been stolen and disclosed in violation of the attorney-client privilege.  The court held that ""use by a congressional committee of information that is gathered illegally is nevertheless protected by the Speech or Debate Clause, provided the use occurs in the course of a legitimate congressional investigation, and Congressmen were not personally involved in the criminal activity.""  855 F. Supp. at 411-12 (citing,  inter alia ,  Dombroski v. Eastland , 387 U.S. 82,85,87 (1967) and  Eastland v. United States Servicemen's Fund ,  supra , 421 U.S. at 501).  The court also rejected the companies' reliance on  McSurely  as ""misplaced"".  Its opinion described  McSurely  as ""holding that, even if material comes to a legislative committee by means that are unlawful, subsequent committee use of that material is nevertheless privileged"", 855 F.

Tillinghast, the Law Library led a somewhat nomadic existence in its early years.    In 1868, the original library association was disbanded and the collection was turned over to the State of Rhode Island and moved to the Old State House on Benefit Street.     From 1877 to 1933 the Law Library occupied quarters in the old Providence County Courthouse at the corner of College and Benefit Streets. Today the main library is located on the eighth floor of the Frank Licht Judicial Complex.    The four county libraries are located in their respective courthouses.    From a mere 50 volumes in 1830, the library now houses over 100,000 volumes as well as an expansive multi media collection, including    microfiche, audio, video cassettes, CD-ROMs and other computer assisted research tools.

GX029-42-5826711	"UNITED STATES V. NIXON (1974)    In November 1972, Richard Nixon won a second term as president, decisively defeating the Democratic candidate, George McGovern. But toward the end of the campaign a group of burglars broke into the Democratic Party campaign headquarters in Washington's Watergate complex. Thanks in large part to the determined investigative reporting of the Washington Post, what had been a small news story soon expanded, as reporters uncovered tracks leading to high government officials. The Nixon administration denied any wrongdoing, but it soon became clear that it had tried to cover up the burglary and connections to it, connections that might even include the president. Under congressional and public pressure, Nixon appointed a special prosecutor. When it was learned that the president had secretly taped conversations in the Oval Office, the prosecutor filed a subpoena to secure tapes he believed relevant to the criminal investigation. In March 1974, a federal grand jury indicted seven associates of President Nixon for conspiracy to obstruct justice and other offenses relating to the Watergate burglary. The president himself was named as an unindicted co-conspirator. The District Court, upon the motion of the special prosecutor, issued a subpoena to the president requiring him to produce certain tapes and documents relating to precisely identified meetings between the president and others. Although President Nixon released edited transcripts of some of the subpoenaed conversations, his counsel filed a ""special appearance"" and moved to quash the subpoena on the grounds of executive privilege. When the District Court denied the motion, the president appealed and the case was quickly brought to the Supreme Court. In the following portion of the Court's unanimous opinion, the Supreme Court dealt with two key issues, the power of the judiciary as the ultimate arbiter of the Constitution, and the claim of the president that, in the name of executive privilege, he could choose to withhold materials germane to a criminal investigation. Chief Justice Burger reaffirmed the rulings of Marbury v. Madison and Cooper v. Aaron that under the Constitution the courts have the final voice in determining constitutional questions, and that no person, not even the president of the United States, is above the law. Although there had been some speculation as to whether Nixon would obey the Court, within eight hours after the decision had been handed down the White House announced it would comply. On August 5, 1974, transcripts of sixty-four tape recordings were released, including one that was particularly damaging in regard to White House involvement in the Watergate cover-up. Three days later, his support in Congress almost completely gone, Nixon announced that he would resign.    For further reading: Robert Woodward and Carl Bernstein, All the President's Men (1974); Theodore H. White, Breach of Faith (1975); Stanley I. Kutler, The Wars of Watergate (1990).       UNITED STATES V. NIXON    Mr. Chief Justice Burger delivered the opinion of the Court. This litigation presents for review the denial of a motion, filed [on] behalf of the [President] in the case of United States v. Mitchell et al., to quash a third-party subpoena duces tecum...direct[ing] the President to produce certain tape recordings and documents relating to his conversations with aides and advisers. The court rejected the President's claims of absolute executive privilege, [and] of lack of jurisdiction.... A. ...we turn to the claim that the subpoena should be quashed because it demands ""confidential conversations between a President and his close advisors that it would be inconsistent with the public interest to produce."" The first contention is a broad claim that the separation of powers doctrine precludes judicial review of a President's claim of privilege. The second contention is that if he does not prevail on the claim of absolute privilege, the court should hold as a matter of constitutional law that the privilege prevails over the subpoena duces tecum.    In the performance of assigned constitutional duties each branch of the Government must initially interpret the Constitution, and the interpretation of its powers by any branch is due great respect from the other. The President's counsel [reads] the Constitution as providing an absolute privilege of confidentiality for all Presidential communications. Many decisions of this Court, however, have unequivocally reaffirmed the holding of [Marbury v. Madison] that ""it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.""    No holding of the Court has defined the scope of judicial power specifically related to the enforcement of a subpoena for confidential Presidential communications for use in a criminal prosecution, but other exercises of powers by the Executive Branch and the Legislative Branch have been found invalid as in conflict with the Constitution. In a series of cases, the Court interpreted the explicit immunity conferred by express provisions of the Constitution on Members of the House and Senate by the Speech or Debate Clause. Since this Court has consistently exercised the power to construe and delineate claims arising under express powers, it must follow that the Court has authority to interpret claims with respect to powers alleged to derive from enumerated interpret claims with respect to powers.    ...Notwithstanding the deference each branch must accord the others, the ""judicial Power of the United States"" vested in the federal courts by [the Constitution] can no more be shared with the Executive Branch than the Chief Executive for example, can share with the Judiciary the veto power, or the Congress share with the Judiciary the power to override a Presidential veto. Any other conclusion would be contrary to the basic concept of separation of powers and the checks and balances that flow from the scheme of a tripartite government. We therefore reaffirm that it is the province and the duty of this Court ""to say what the law is"" with respect to the claim of privilege presented in this case.    B. In support of his claim of absolute privilege, the President's counsel urges two grounds. The first is the valid need for protection of communications between high Government officials and those who advise and assist them in the performance of their manifold duties; the importance of this confidentiality is too plain to require further discussion. Human experience teaches that those who expect public dissemination of their remarks may well temper candor with a concern for appearances and for their own interests to the detriment of the decision-making process. Whatever the nature of the privilege of confidentiality of Presidential communications in the exercise of Art. II powers, the privilege can be said to derive from the supremacy of each branch within its own assigned areas of constitutional duties. Certain powers and privileges flow from the nature of enumerated powers; the protection of the confidentiality of Presidential communications has similar constitutional underpinnings.    The second ground asserted to support the claim of absolute privilege rests on the doctrine of separation of powers. Here it is argued that the independence of the Executive Branch within its own sphere insulates a President from a judicial subpoena in an ongoing criminal prosecution, and thereby protects confidential Presidential communications.    However, neither the doctrine of separation of powers, nor the need for confidentiality of high level communications, without more, can sustain an absolute, unqualified Presidential privilege of immunity from judicial process under all circumstances. The President's need for complete candor and objectivity from advisers calls for great deference from the court. However, when the privilege depends solely on the broad, undifferentiated claim of public interest in the confidentiality of such conversations, a confrontation with other values arises. Absent a claim of need to protect military, diplomatic, or sensitive national security secrets, we find it difficult to accept the argument that even the very important interest in confidentiality of Presidential communications is significantly diminished by production of such material for in camera inspection with all the protection that a district court will be obliged to provide.    The impediment that an absolute, unqualified privilege would place in the way of primary constitutional duty of the Judicial Branch to do justice in criminal prosecutions would plainly conflict with the function of the courts under Art. III. In designing the structure of our Government and dividing and allocating the sovereign power among three co-equal branches, the [Framers] sought to provide a comprehensive system, but the separate powers were not intended to operate with absolute independence. To read the Art. II powers of the President as providing an absolute privilege as against a subpoena essential to enforcement of criminal statutes on no more than a generalized claim of the public interest in confidentiality of nonmilitary and nondiplomatic discussions would upset the constitutional balance of ""a workable government"" and gravely impair the role of the courts under Art. III.    C. Since we conclude that the legitimate needs of the judicial process may outweigh Presidential privilege, it is necessary to resolve those competing interests in a manner that preserves the essential functions of each branch. The right and indeed the duty to resolve that question does not free the Judiciary from according high respect to the representations made on behalf of the President.    The expectation of a President to the confidentiality of his conversations and correspondence, like the claim of confidentiality of judicial deliberations, for example, has all the values to which we accord deference for the privacy of all citizens and added to those values the necessity for protection of the public interest in candid, objective, and even blunt or harsh opinions in Presidential decision-making. A President and those who assist him must be free to explore alternatives in the process of shaping policies and making decisions and to do so in a way many would be unwilling to express except privately. These are the considerations justifying a presumptive privilege for Presidential communications. The privilege is fundamental to the operation of government and inextricably rooted in the separation of powers under the Constitution.    ...But this presumptive privilege must be considered in light of our historic commitment to the rule of law. This is nowhere more profoundly manifest than in our view that ""the twofold aim [of criminal justice] is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer.""...The need to develop all relevant facts in the adversary system is both fundamental and comprehensive. The ends of criminal justice would be defeated if judgments were to be founded on a partial or speculative presentation of the facts.... To ensure that justice is done, it is imperative to the function of courts that compulsory process be available for the production of evidence needed either by the prosecution or by the defense. ...The [evidentiary] privileges are designed to protect weighty and legitimate competing interests... [and] are not lightly created nor expansively construed for they are in derogation of the search for truth.    In this case the President challenges a subpoena served on him as a third party requiring the production of materials for use in a criminal prosecution; he does so on the claim that he has a privilege against disclosure of confidential communications. He does not place his claim of privilege on the ground they are military or diplomatic secrets. As to these areas of Art. II duties the courts have traditionally shown the utmost deference to Presidential responsibilities.... No case of the Court, however, has extended this high degree of deference to a President's generalized interest in confidentiality. Nowhere in the Constitution is there any explicit reference to a privilege of confidentiality, yet to the extent this interest relates to the effective discharge of a President's powers, it is constitutionally based.    The right to the production of all evidence at a criminal trial similarly has constitutional dimensions.... It is the manifest duty of the courts to vindicate [the Sixth and Fifth Amendment] guarantees and to accomplish that it is essential that all relevant and admissible evidence be produced.    In this case we must weigh the importance of the general privilege of confidentiality of Presidential communications in performance of his responsibilities against inroads of such privilege on the fair administration of criminal justice. The interest in preserving confidentiality is weighty indeed and entitled to great respect. However, we cannot conclude that advisers will be moved to temper the candor of their remarks by the infrequent occasions of disclosure because of the possibility that such conversations will be called for in the context of a criminal prosecution.    On the other hand, the allowance of the privilege to withhold evidence that is demonstrably relevant in a criminal trial would cut deeply into the guarantee of due process of law and gravely impair the basic function of the courts. A President's acknowledged need for confidentiality in the communications of his office is general in nature, whereas the constitutional need for production of relevant evidence in a criminal proceeding is specific and central to the fair adjudication of a particular criminal case. Without access to specific facts a criminal prosecution may be totally frustrated. The President's broad interest in confidentiality of communications will not be vitiated by disclosure of a limited number of conversations preliminarily shown to have some bearing on the pending trials. We conclude that when the ground for asserting privilege as to subpoenaed materials sought for use in a criminal trial is based only on the generalized interests in confidentiality, it cannot prevail over the fundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of criminal justice. The generalized assertion of privilege must yield to the demonstrated, specific need for evidence in a pending criminal trial.    D. ...If a President concludes that a compliance with a subpoena would be injurious to the public interest he may properly, as was done here, invoke a claim of privilege on the return of the subpoena. Upon receiving a claim of privilege from the Chief Executive, it became the further duty of the District Court to treat the subpoenaed material as presumptively privileged and to require the Special Prosecutor to demonstrate that the Presidential material was ""essential to the justice of the case."" ...We affirm the order of the District Court that subpoenaed materials be transmitted to that court. We now turn to the important question of the District Court's responsibilities in conducting the in camera examination of Presidential materials or communications delivered under the compulsion of the subpoena duces tecum.    E. ...Statements that meet the test of admissibility and relevance must be isolated; all other material must be excised. ...The District Court has a very heavy responsibility to see to it that Presidential conversation, which are either not relevant or not admissible, are accorded that high degree of respect due the President. Mr. Chief Justice Marshall sitting as a trial judge...was extraordinarily careful to point out that: ""In no case of this kind would a Court be required to proceed against the president as against an ordinary individual."" Marshall's statement cannot be read to mean in any sense that a President is above the law, but relates to the singularly unique role under Art. II of a President's communications and activities, related to the performance of duties under that Article. Moreover, a President's communications and activities encompass a vastly wider range of sensitive material than would be true of any ""ordinary individual."" It is therefore necessary in the public interest to afford Presidential confidentiality the greatest protection consistent with the fair administration of justice. The need for confidentiality even as to idle conversation with associates in which casual reference might be made concerning political leaders within the country or foreign statesmen is too obvious to call for further treatment. We have no doubt that the District Judge will at all times accord to Presidential records that high degree of deference suggested....    Affirmed.    Source:  418 U.S. 683 (1974).

The District Court, Edward R. Becker, Chief Circuit Judge, held that: (1) CIPA unconstitutionally induced libraries to violate First Amendment; (2) CIPA's disabling provision was insufficient to cure constitutional defect; and (3) CIPA was severable from remainder of public library funding statutes to which it had been appended.           Statute held unconstitutional.              West Headnotes         [1]  Constitutional Law  82(5)    92k82(5)   Most Cited Cases         [1]  Constitutional Law  254(2)    92k254(2)   Most Cited Cases         Public libraries, which are funded and controlled by state and local governments, are state actors, subject to constraints of First Amendment, as incorporated by Due Process Clause of Fourteenth Amendment.    U.S.C.A.

Preliminary Statement           This case challenges an act of Congress that makes the use of filtering software by public libraries a condition of the receipt of federal funding. The Internet, as is well known, is a vast, interactive medium based on a decentralized network of computers around the world.    Its most familiar feature is the World Wide Web (the ""Web""), a network of computers known as servers that provide content to users.    The Internet provides easy access to anyone who wishes to provide or distribute information to a worldwide audience;    it is used by more than 143 million Americans.    Indeed, much of the world's knowledge accumulated over centuries is available to Internet users almost instantly. Approximately 10% of the Americans who use the Internet access it at public libraries.    And approximately 95% of all public libraries in the United States provide public access to the Internet.           While the beneficial effect of the Internet in expanding the amount of information available to its users is self-evident, its low entry barriers have also led to a perverse result--facilitation of the widespread dissemination of hardcore pornography within the easy reach not only of adults  *406  who have every right to access it (so long as it is not legally obscene or child pornography), but also of children and adolescents to whom it may be quite harmful.    The volume of pornography on the Internet is huge, and the record before us demonstrates that public library patrons of all ages, many from ages  11 to 15, have regularly sought to access it in public library settings.    There are more than 100,000 pornographic Web sites that can be accessed for free and without providing any registration information, and tens of thousands of Web sites contain child pornography.           Libraries have reacted to this situation by utilizing a number of means designed to insure that patrons avoid illegal (and unwanted) content while also enabling patrons to find the content they desire.    Some libraries have trained patrons in how to use the Internet while avoiding illegal content, or have directed their patrons to ""preferred"" Web sites that librarians have reviewed. Other libraries have utilized such devices as recessing the computer monitors, installing privacy screens, and monitoring implemented by a ""tap on the shoulder"" of patrons perceived to be offending library policy.    Still others, viewing the foregoing approaches as inadequate or uncomfortable (some librarians do not wish to confront patrons), have purchased commercially available software that blocks certain categories of material deemed by the library board as unsuitable for use in their facilities.    Indeed, 7% of American public libraries use blocking software for adults.    Although such programs are somewhat effective in blocking large quantities of pornography, they are blunt instruments that not only ""underblock,"" i.e., fail to block access to substantial amounts of content that the library boards wish to exclude, but also, central to this litigation, ""overblock,"" i.e., block access  to large quantities of material that library boards do not wish to exclude and that is constitutionally protected.           Most of the libraries that use filtering software seek to block sexually explicit speech.    While most libraries include in their physical collection copies of volumes such as  The Joy of Sex  and  The Joy of Gay Sex,  which contain quite explicit photographs and descriptions, filtering software blocks large quantities of other, comparable information about health and sexuality that adults and teenagers seek on the Web. One teenager testified that the Internet access in a public library was the only venue in which she could obtain information important to her about her own sexuality.    Another library patron witness described using the Internet to research breast cancer and reconstructive surgery for his mother who had breast surgery.    Even though some filtering programs contain exceptions for health and education, the exceptions do not solve the problem of overblocking constitutionally protected material. Moreover, as we explain below, the filtering software on which the parties presented evidence in this case overblocks not only information relating to health and sexuality that might be mistaken for pornography or erotica, but also vast numbers of Web pages and sites that could not even arguably be construed as harmful or inappropriate for adults or minors.           The Congress, sharing the concerns of many library boards, enacted the Children's Internet Protection Act (""CIPA""),  Pub.L. No. 106-554 , which makes  the use of filters by a public library a condition of its receipt of two kinds of subsidies that are important (or even critical) to the budgets of many public libraries--grants under the Library Services and Technology Act,  20 U.S.C. §    9101   et seq.    (""LSTA""), and so-called ""E-rate discounts"" for Internet access and support under the Telecommunications Act,  47 U.S.C. §    254 .    LSTA  *407  grant funds are awarded,  inter alia,  in order to:    (1) assist libraries in accessing information through electronic networks, and (2) provide targeted library and information services to persons having difficulty using a library and to underserved and rural communities, including children from families with incomes below the poverty line. E-rate discounts serve the similar purpose of extending Internet access to schools and libraries in low-income communities. CIPA requires that libraries, in order to receive LSTA funds or E-rate discounts, certify that they are using a ""technology protection measure"" that prevents patrons from accessing ""visual depictions"" that are ""obscene,"" ""child pornography,"" or in the case of minors, ""harmful to minors.""    20 U.S.C. §    9134(f)(1)(A)  (LSTA);    47 U.S.C. §    254(h)(6)(B) & (C)  (E-rate).           The plaintiffs, a group of libraries, library associations, library patrons, and Web site publishers, brought this suit against the United States and others alleging that CIPA is facially unconstitutional because:    (1) it induces public libraries to violate their patrons' First Amendment rights contrary to the requirements of  South Dakota v. Dole,  483 U.S. 203, 107 S.Ct. 2793, 97   L.Ed.2d 171 (1987) ;    and (2) it requires libraries to relinquish their First Amendment rights as a condition on the receipt of federal funds and is therefore impermissible under the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions.    In arguing that CIPA will induce public libraries to violate the First Amendment, the plaintiffs contend that given the limits of the filtering technology, CIPA's conditions effectively require libraries to impose content-based restrictions on their patrons' access to constitutionally protected speech. According to the plaintiffs, these content-based restrictions are subject to strict scrutiny under public forum doctrine,  see  Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va.,  515 U.S. 819, 837, 115 S.Ct. 2510, 132 L.Ed.2d 700 (1995) , and are therefore permissible only if they are narrowly tailored to further a compelling state interest and no less restrictive alternatives would further that interest,  see  Reno v. ACLU,  521 U.S. 844, 874, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 138 L.Ed.2d 874 (1997) .  [FN1]    The government responds that CIPA will not induce public libraries to violate the First Amendment, since it is possible for at least some public libraries to constitutionally comply with CIPA's conditions.    Even if some libraries' use of filters might violate the First Amendment, the government submits that CIPA can be facially invalidated only if it is impossible for any public library to comply with its conditions without violating the First Amendment.              FN1.  Plaintiffs advance three other alternative, independent grounds for holding CIPA facially invalid.    First, they submit that even if CIPA will not induce public libraries to violate the First Amendment, CIPA nonetheless imposes an unconstitutional condition on public libraries by requiring them to relinquish their own First Amendment rights to provide unfiltered Internet access as a condition on their receipt of federal funds.    See infra  n. 36.    Second, plaintiffs contend that CIPA is facially invalid because it effects an impermissible prior restraint on speech by granting filtering companies and library staff unfettered discretion to suppress speech before it has been received by library patrons and before it has been subject to a judicial determination that it is unprotected under the First Amendment.    See  Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad,  420 U.S. 546, 558, 95 S.Ct. 1239, 43 L.Ed.2d 448 (1975) .    Finally, plaintiffs submit that CIPA is unconstitutionally vague.    See  City of Chicago v. Morales,  527 U.S. 41, 119 S.Ct. 1849, 144 L.Ed.2d 67 (1999) .                Pursuant to CIPA, a three-judge Court was convened to try the issues.     Pub.L. No. 106-554 .    Following an intensive period of discovery on an expedited schedule  *408  to allow public libraries to know whether they need to certify compliance with CIPA by July 1, 2002, to receive subsidies for the upcoming year, the Court conducted an eight-day trial at which we heard 20  witnesses, and received numerous depositions, stipulations and documents.    The principal focus of the trial was on the capacity of currently available filtering software.    The plaintiffs adduced substantial evidence not only that filtering programs bar access to a substantial amount of speech on the Internet that is clearly constitutionally protected for adults and minors, but also that these programs are intrinsically unable to block only illegal Internet content while simultaneously allowing access to all protected speech.           As our extensive findings of fact reflect, the plaintiffs demonstrated that thousands of Web pages containing protected speech are wrongly blocked by the four leading filtering programs, and these pages represent only a fraction of Web pages wrongly blocked by the programs.    The plaintiffs' evidence explained that the problems faced by the manufacturers and vendors of filtering software are legion.    The Web is extremely dynamic, with an estimated 1.5 million new pages added every day and the contents of existing Web pages changing very rapidly.    The category lists maintained by the blocking programs are considered to be proprietary information, and hence are unavailable to customers or the general public for review, so that public libraries that select categories when implementing filtering software do not really know what they are blocking.           There are many reasons why filtering software suffers from extensive over- and underblocking, which we will explain below in great detail.    They center on the limitations on filtering companies' ability to:    (1) accurately collect Web  pages that potentially fall into a blocked category (e.g., pornography);    (2) review and categorize Web pages that they have collected;    and (3) engage in regular re-review of Web pages that they have previously reviewed.    These failures spring from constraints on the technology of automated classification systems, and the limitations inherent in human review, including error, misjudgment, and scarce resources, which we describe in detail  infra  at 58- 74.    One failure of critical importance is that the automated systems that filtering companies use to collect Web pages for classification are able to search only text, not images.    This is crippling to filtering companies' ability to collect pages containing ""visual depictions"" that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors, as CIPA requires.    As will appear, we find that it is currently impossible, given the Internet's size, rate of growth, rate of change, and architecture, and given the state of the art of automated classification systems, to develop a filter that neither underblocks nor overblocks a substantial amount of speech.           The government, while acknowledging that the filtering software is imperfect, maintains that it is nonetheless quite effective, and that it successfully blocks the vast majority of the Web pages that meet filtering companies' category definitions (e.g., pornography).    The government contends that no more is required.    In its view, so long as the filtering software selected by the libraries screens out the bulk of the Web pages proscribed by  CIPA, the libraries have made a reasonable choice which suffices, under the applicable legal principles, to pass constitutional muster in the context of a facial challenge.Central to the government's position is the analogy it advances between Internet filtering and the initial decision of a library to determine which materials to purchase for its print collection.    Public libraries have finite budgets and must make choices as to whether to purchase, for example, books  *409  on gardening or books on golf.    Such content-based decisions, even the plaintiffs concede, are subject to rational basis review and not a stricter form of First Amendment scrutiny.    In the government's view, the fact that the Internet reverses the acquisition process and requires the libraries to, in effect, purchase the entire Internet, some of which (e.g., hardcore pornography) it does not want, should not mean that it is chargeable with censorship when it filters out offending material.           The legal context in which this extensive factual record is set is complex, implicating a number of constitutional doctrines, including the constitutional limitations on Congress's spending clause power, the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, and subsidiary to these issues, the First Amendment doctrines of prior restraint, vagueness, and overbreadth.    There are a number of potential entry points into the analysis, but the most logical is the spending clause jurisprudence in which the seminal case is  South Dakota v. Dole,  483 U.S. 203, 107 S.Ct. 2793, 97 L.Ed.2d 171 (1987) .    Dole  outlines  four categories of constraints on Congress's exercise of its power under the Spending Clause, but the only  Dole  condition disputed here is the fourth and last, i.e., whether CIPA requires libraries that receive LSTA funds or E-rate discounts to violate the constitutional rights of their patrons.    As will appear, the question is not a simple one, and turns on the level of scrutiny applicable to a public library's content-based restrictions on patrons' Internet access.    Whether such restrictions are subject to strict scrutiny, as plaintiffs contend, or only rational basis review, as the government contends, depends on public forum doctrine.           The government argues that, in providing Internet access, public libraries do not create a public forum, since public libraries may reserve the right to exclude certain speakers from availing themselves of the forum.    Accordingly, the government contends that public libraries' restrictions on patrons' Internet access are subject only to rational basis review.           Plaintiffs respond that the government's ability to restrict speech on its own property, as in the case of restrictions on Internet access in public libraries, is not unlimited, and that the more widely the state facilitates the dissemination of private speech in a given forum, the more vulnerable the state's decision is to restrict access to speech in that forum.    We agree with the plaintiffs that public libraries' content-based restrictions on their patrons' Internet access are subject to strict scrutiny.    In providing even  filtered Internet access, public libraries create a public forum open to any speaker around the world to communicate with library patrons via the Internet on a virtually unlimited number of topics.    Where the state provides access to a ""vast democratic forum[ ],""  Reno v. ACLU,  521 U.S. 844, 868, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 138 L.Ed.2d 874 (1997) , open to any member of the public to speak on subjects ""as diverse as human thought,""  id.  at 870, 117 S.Ct. 2329  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), the state's decision selectively to exclude from the forum speech whose content the state disfavors is subject to strict scrutiny, as such exclusions risk distorting the marketplace of ideas that the state has facilitated.    Application of strict scrutiny finds further support in the extent to which public libraries' provision of Internet access uniquely promotes First Amendment values in a manner analogous to traditional public fora such as streets, sidewalks, and parks, in which content-based restrictions are always subject to strict scrutiny.           *410  Under strict scrutiny, a public library's use of filtering software is permissible only if it is narrowly tailored to further a compelling government interest and no less restrictive alternative would serve that interest.    We acknowledge that use of filtering software furthers public libraries' legitimate interests in preventing patrons from accessing visual depictions of obscenity, child pornography, or in the case of minors, material harmful to minors.    Moreover, use of filters also helps prevent patrons from being  unwillingly exposed to patently offensive, sexually explicit content on the Internet.           We are sympathetic to the position of the government, believing that it would be desirable if there were a means to ensure that public library patrons could share in the informational bonanza of the Internet while being insulated from materials that meet CIPA's definitions, that is, visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or in the case of minors, harmful to minors. Unfortunately this outcome, devoutly to be wished, is not available in this less than best of all possible worlds.    No category definition used by the blocking programs is identical to the legal definitions of obscenity, child pornography, or material harmful to minors, and, at all events, filtering programs fail to block access to a substantial amount of content on the Internet that falls into the categories defined by CIPA. As will appear, we credit the testimony of plaintiffs' expert Dr. Geoffrey Nunberg that the blocking software is (at least for the foreseeable future) incapable of effectively blocking the majority of materials in the categories defined by CIPA without overblocking a substantial amount of materials.    Nunberg's analysis was supported by extensive record evidence.    As noted above, this inability to prevent both substantial amounts of underblocking and overblocking stems from several sources, including limitations on the technology that software filtering companies use to gather and review Web pages, limitations on  resources for human review of Web pages, and the necessary error that results from human review processes.           Because the filtering software mandated by CIPA will block access to substantial amounts of constitutionally protected speech whose suppression serves no legitimate government interest, we are persuaded that a public library's use of software filters is not narrowly tailored to further any of these interests.    Moreover, less restrictive alternatives exist that further the government's legitimate interest in preventing the dissemination of obscenity, child pornography, and material harmful to minors, and in preventing patrons from being unwillingly exposed to patently offensive, sexually explicit content.    To prevent patrons from accessing visual depictions that are obscene and child pornography, public libraries may enforce Internet use policies that make clear to patrons that the library's Internet terminals may not be used to access illegal speech.    Libraries may then impose penalties on patrons who violate these policies, ranging from a warning to notification of law enforcement, in the appropriate case.    Less restrictive alternatives to filtering that further libraries' interest in preventing minors from exposure to visual depictions that are harmful to minors include requiring parental consent to or presence during unfiltered access, or restricting minors' unfiltered access to terminals within view of library staff.    Finally, optional filtering, privacy screens, recessed monitors, and placement of unfiltered  Internet terminals outside of sight-lines provide less restrictive alternatives for libraries to prevent patrons from being unwillingly exposed to sexually explicit content on the Internet.           *411  In an effort to avoid the potentially fatal legal implications of the overblocking problem, the government falls back on the ability of the libraries, under CIPA's disabling provisions,  see  CIPA §    1712 (codified at  20 U.S.C. §    9134(f)(3) ), CIPA §    1721(b) (codified at  47 U.S.C. §    254(h)(6)(D) ), to unblock a site that is patently proper yet improperly blocked.    The evidence reflects that libraries can and do unblock the filters when a patron so requests.    But it also reflects that requiring library patrons to ask for a Web site to be unblocked will deter many patrons because they are embarrassed, or desire to protect their privacy or remain anonymous.    Moreover, the unblocking may take days, and may be unavailable, especially in branch libraries, which are often less well staffed than main libraries.    Accordingly, CIPA's disabling provisions do not cure the constitutional deficiencies in public libraries' use of Internet filters.           Under these circumstances we are constrained to conclude that the library plaintiffs must prevail in their contention that CIPA requires them to violate the First Amendment rights of their patrons, and accordingly is facially invalid, even under the standard urged on us by the government, which would permit us to facially invalidate CIPA only if it is impossible for a single  public library to comply with CIPA's conditions without violating the First Amendment.    In view of the limitations inherent in the filtering technology mandated by CIPA, any public library that adheres to CIPA's conditions will necessarily restrict patrons' access to a substantial amount of protected speech, in violation of the First Amendment.    Given this conclusion, we need not reach plaintiffs' arguments that CIPA effects a prior restraint on speech and is unconstitutionally vague.    Nor do we decide their cognate unconstitutional conditions theory, though for reasons explained  infra  at note 36, we discuss the issues raised by that claim at some length.           For these reasons, we will enter an Order declaring Sections 1712(a)(2) and 1721(b) of the Children's Internet Protection Act, codified at  20 U.S.C. §    9134(f)  and  47 U.S.C. §    254(h)(6) , respectively, to be facially invalid under the First Amendment and permanently enjoining the defendants from enforcing those provisions.         II. Findings of Fact    A. Statutory Framework    1. Nature and Operation of the E-rate and LSTA Programs           In the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (""1996 Act""), Congress directed the Federal Communications Commission (""FCC"") to take the steps necessary to establish a system of support mechanisms to ensure the delivery of affordable telecommunications service to all Americans.    This system, referred to as  ""universal service,"" is codified in  section 254  of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the 1996 Act.  See   47 U.S.C. §    254 .    Congress specified several groups as beneficiaries of the universal service support mechanism, including consumers in high-cost areas, low-income consumers, schools and libraries, and rural health care providers.    See   47 U.S.C. §    254(h)(1) .    The extension of universal service to schools and libraries in  section 254(h)  is commonly referred to as the Schools and Libraries Program, or ""E-rate"" Program.           Under the E-rate Program, ""[a]ll telecommunications carriers serving a geographic area shall, upon a bona fide request for any of its services that are within the definition of universal service ..., provide such services to elementary schools, secondary schools, and libraries for educational purposes at rates less than the amounts charged for similar services to  *412  other parties.""    47 U.S.C. §    254(h)(1)(B) .    Under FCC regulations, providers of ""interstate telecommunications"" (with certain exceptions,  see   47 C.F.R. §    54.706(d) ), must contribute a portion of their revenue for disbursement among eligible carriers that are providing services to those groups or areas specified by Congress in  section 254 .    To be eligible for the discounts, a library must:    (1) be eligible for assistance from a State library administrative agency under the Library Services and Technology Act,  see infra;    (2) be funded as an independent entity, completely separate from any schools;    and (3) not be operating as a for-profit business.    See   47 C.F.R.   §    54.501(c) .    Discounts on services for eligible libraries are set as a percentage of the pre-discount price, and range from 20% to 90%, depending on a library's level of economic disadvantage and its location in an urban or rural area.    See   47 C.F.R. §    54.505 . Currently, a library's level of economic disadvantage is based on the percentage of students eligible for the national school lunch program in the school district in which the library is located.           The Library Services and Technology Act (""LSTA""), Subchapter II of the Museum and Library Services Act,  20 U.S.C. §    9101   et seq.,  was enacted by Congress in 1996 as part of the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of  1997, Pub.L. No. 104-208 .    The LSTA establishes three grant programs to achieve the goal of improving library services across the nation.    Under the Grants to States Program, LSTA grant funds are awarded,  inter alia,  in order to assist libraries in accessing information through electronic networks and pay for the costs of acquiring or sharing computer systems and telecommunications technologies.    See   20 U.S.C. §    9141(a) .    Through the Grants to States program, LSTA funds have been used to acquire and pay costs associated with Internet-accessible computers located in libraries.         2. CIPA           The Children's Internet Protection Act (""CIPA"") was enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001, which consolidated and enacted several appropriations bills, including the Miscellaneous Appropriations Act,  of which CIPA was a part.    See   Pub.L. No. 106-554 .    CIPA addresses three distinct types of federal funding programs:    (1) aid to elementary and secondary schools pursuant to Title III of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965,  see  CIPA §    1711 (amending  Title 20  to add §    3601); (2) LSTA grants to states for support of libraries,  see  CIPA §    1712 (amending the Museum and Library Services Act,  20 U.S.C. §    9134 );    and (3) discounts under the E-rate program,  see  CIPA §    1721(a) & (b) (both amending the Communications Act of 1934,  47 U.S.C. §    254(h) ).    Only sections 1712 and 1721(b) of CIPA, which apply to libraries, are at issue in this case.           As explained in more detail below, CIPA requires libraries that participate in the LSTA and E-rate programs to certify that they are using software filters on their computers to protect against visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or in the case of minors, harmful to minors.    CIPA permits library officials to disable the filters for patrons for bona fide research or other lawful purposes, but disabling is not permitted for minor patrons if the library receives E-rate discounts.         a. CIPA's Amendments to the E-rate Program           Section 1721(b) of CIPA imposes conditions on a library's participation in the E-rate program.    A library ""having one or more computers with Internet access may not receive services at discount rates,"" CIPA §    1721(b) (codified at  47 U.S.C. §    254(h)(6)(A)(i) ), unless the library certifies  *413  that it is  ""enforcing a policy of Internet safety that includes the operation of a technology protection measure with respect to any of its computers with Internet access that protects against access through such computers to visual depictions that are--(I) obscene;    (II) child pornography;    or (III) harmful to minors,"" and that it is ""enforcing the operation of such technology protection measure during any use of such computers by minors.""    CIPA §    1721(b) (codified at  47 U.S.C. §    254(h)(6)(B) ).  [FN2]    CIPA defines a ""technology protection measure"" as ""a specific technology that blocks or filters access to visual depictions that are obscene, ... child pornography, ... or harmful to minors.""    CIPA §    1703(b)(1) (codified at  47 U.S.C. §    254(h)(7)(I) ).              FN2.  CIPA defines ""[m]inor"" as ""any individual who has not attained the age of 17 years.""    CIPA §    1721(c) (codified at  47 U.S.C. §    254(h)(7)(D) ).    CIPA further provides that ""[o]bscene"" has the meaning given in  18 U.S.C. §    1460 , and ""child pornography"" has the meaning given in  18 U.S.C. §    2256 .    CIPA §    1721(c) (codified at  47 U.S.C. §    254(h)(7)(E) & (F) ).    CIPA defines material that is ""harmful to minors"" as:     any picture, image, graphic image file, or other visual depiction that--(i) taken as a whole and with respect to minors, appeals to a prurient interest in nudity, sex, or excretion;    (ii) depicts, describes, or represents, in a patently offensive way with respect to what is suitable for minors, an  actual or simulated sexual act or sexual contact, actual or simulated normal or perverted sexual acts, or a lewd exhibition of the genitals; and (iii) taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value as to minors.     CIPA §    1721(c) (codified at  47 U.S.C. §    254(h)(7)(G) ).     CIPA prohibits federal interference in local determinations regarding what Internet content is appropriate for minors:     A determination regarding what matter is appropriate for minors shall be made by the school board, local educational agency, library or other authority responsible for making the determination.    No agency or instrumentality of the United States Government may--(A) establish criteria for making such determination;    (B) review the determination made by the certifying [entity] ...;    or (C) consider the criteria employed by the certifying [entity] ... in the administration of subsection (h)(1)(B).     CIPA §    1732 (codified at  47 U.S.C. §    254( l  )(2) ).                To receive E-rate discounts, a library must also certify that filtering software is in operation during adult use of the Internet.    More specifically, with respect to adults, a library must certify that it is ""enforcing a policy of Internet safety that includes the operation of a technology protection measure with respect to any of its computers with Internet access that protects  against access through such computers to visual depictions that are--(I) obscene;    or (II) child pornography,"" and that it is ""enforcing the operation of such technology protection measure during any use of such computers.""    CIPA §    1721(b) (codified at  47 U.S.C. §    254(h)(6)(C) ).    Interpreting the statutory terms ""any use,"" the FCC has concluded that ""CIPA makes no distinction between computers used only by staff and those accessible to the public.""    In re Federal State Joint Board on Universal Service:    Children's Internet Protection Act,  CC Docket No. 96-45, Report and Order, FCC 01- 120, ¶    30 (Apr. 5, 2001).           With respect to libraries receiving E-rate discounts, CIPA further specifies that ""[a]n administrator, supervisor, or other person authorized by the certifying authority ... may disable the technology protection measure concerned, during use by an adult, to enable access for bona fide research or other lawful purpose.""    CIPA §    1721(b) (codified at  47 U.S.C. §    254(h)(6)(D) ).         b. CIPA's Amendments to the LSTA Program           Section 1712 of CIPA amends the Museum and Library Services Act ( *414 20 U.S.C.    §    9134(f))  to provide that no funds made available under the Act ""may be used to purchase computers used to access the Internet, or to pay for direct costs associated with accessing the Internet,"" unless such library ""has in place"" and is enforcing ""a policy of Internet safety that includes the  operation of a technology protection measure with respect to any of its computers with Internet access that protects against access through such computers to visual depictions"" that are ""obscene"" or ""child pornography,"" and, when the computers are in use by minors, also protects against access to visual depictions that are ""harmful to minors.""    CIPA §    1712 (codified at  20 U.S.C. §    9134(f)(1) ).    Section 1712 contains definitions of ""technology protection measure,"" ""obscene,"" ""child pornography,"" and ""harmful to minors,"" that are substantially similar to those found in the provisions governing the E-rate program.    CIPA §    1712 (codified at  20 U.S.C. §    9134(f)(7) );    see also supra  note 2.           As under the E-rate program, ""an administrator, supervisor or other authority may disable a technology protection measure ... to enable access for bona fide research or other lawful purposes.""    CIPA §    1712 (codified at  20 U.S.C. §    9134(f)(3) ).    Whereas CIPA's amendments to the E-rate program permit disabling for bona fide research or other lawful purposes only during adult use, the LSTA provision permits disabling for both adults and minors.         B. Identity of the Plaintiffs    1. Library and Library Association Plaintiffs           Plaintiffs American Library Association, Alaska Library Association, California Library Association, Connecticut Library Association, Freedom to Read Foundation, Maine Library Association, New England Library Association,  New York Library Association, and Wisconsin Library Association are non-profit organizations whose members include public libraries that receive either E-rate discounts or LSTA funds for the provision of Internet access.    Because it is a prerequisite to associational standing, we note that the interests that these organizations seek to protect in this litigation are central to their  raison d'être.           Plaintiffs Fort Vancouver Regional Library District, in southwest Washington state;    Multnomah County Public Library, in Multnomah County, Oregon;    Norfolk Public Library System, in Norfolk, Virginia;    Santa Cruz Public Library Joint Powers Authority, in Santa Cruz, California;    South Central Library System (""SCLS""), centered in Madison, Wisconsin;    and the Westchester Library System, in Westchester County, New York, are public library systems with branch offices in their respective localities that provide Internet access to their patrons.           The Fort Vancouver Regional Library District, for over three years from 1999-2001, received $135,000 in LSTA grants and $19,500 in E-rate discounts for Internet access.    The Multnomah County Public Library received $70,000 in E- rate discounts for Internet access this year, and has applied for $100,000 in E-rate discounts for the upcoming year.    The Norfolk Public Library System received $90,000 in E-rate discounts for Internet access this year, and has received a $200,000 LSTA grant to put computer labs in eight of its libraries. The Santa Cruz Public Library Joint Powers Authority received $20,560 in E-rate  discounts for Internet access in 2001-02.    The SCLS received between $3,000 and $5,000 this year in E-rate discounts for Internet access.           The Fort Vancouver Regional Library District Board is a public board whose members are appointed by elected county commissioners.    The Multnomah County Library is a county department, whose  *415  board is appointed by the county chair and confirmed by the other commissioners.    The SCLS is an aggregation of 51 independently governed statutory member public libraries, whose relationship to SCLS is defined by state law.    The governing body of the SCLS is the Library Board of Trustees, which consists of 20 members nominated by county executives and ratified by county boards of supervisors.         2. Patron and Patron Association Plaintiffs           Plaintiffs Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, Friends of the Philadelphia City Institute Library, and the Pennsylvania Alliance for Democracy are nonprofit organizations whose members include individuals who access the Internet at public libraries that receive E-rate discounts or LSTA funds for the provision of public Internet access.    We note for the purpose of associational standing that the interests that these organizations seek to protect in this litigation are germane to their purposes.           Plaintiffs Emmalyn Rood, Mark Brown, Elizabeth Hrenda, C. Donald Weinberg, Sherron Dixon, by her father and next friend Gordon Dixon, James Geringer, Marnique Tynesha Overby, by her next friend Carolyn C. Williams, William J.  Rosenbaum, Carolyn C. Williams, and Quiana Williams, by her mother and next friend Sharon Bernard, are adults and minors who use the Internet at public libraries that, to the best of their knowledge, do not filter patrons' access to the Internet.    Several of these plaintiffs do not have Internet access from home.           Emmalyn Rood is a sixteen-year-old who uses the Multnomah County Public Library.    When she was 13, she used the Internet at the Multnomah County Public Library to research issues relating to her sexual identity.    Ms. Rood did not use her home or school computer for this research, in part because she wished her searching to be private.    Although the library offered patrons the option of using filtering software, Ms. Rood did not use that option because she had had previous experience with such programs blocking information that was valuable to her, including information relating to gay and lesbian issues.           Plaintiff Mark Brown used the Internet at the Philadelphia Free Library to research breast cancer and reconstructive surgery for his mother who had breast surgery.    Mr. Brown's research at the library provided him and his mother with essential information about his mother's medical condition and potential treatments.         3. Web Publisher Plaintiffs           Plaintiff Afraid to Ask, Inc., based in Saunderstown, Rhode Island, publishes a health education Web site, www.AfraidtoAsk.com. Dr. Jonathan Bertman, the  president and medical director of Afraid to Ask, is a family practice physician in rural Rhode Island and a clinical assistant professor of family medicine at Brown University.    AfraidtoAsk.com's mission is to provide detailed information on sensitive health issues, often of a sexual nature, such as sexually transmitted diseases, male and female genitalia, and birth control, sought by people of all ages who would prefer to learn about sensitive health issues anonymously, i.e., they are ""afraid to ask.""    As part of its educational mission, AfraidtoAsk.com often uses graphic images of sexual anatomy to convey information.    Its primary audience is teens and young adults.    Based on survey data collected on the site, half of the people visiting the site are under 24 years old and a quarter are under 18.    AfraidtoAsk.com is blocked by several leading blocking products as containing sexually explicit content.           *416  Plaintiff Alan Guttmacher Institute has a Web site that contains information about its activities and objectives, including its mission to protect the reproductive choices of women and men.    Plaintiff Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. (""Planned Parenthood"") is a national voluntary organization in the field of reproductive health care.    Planned Parenthood owns and operates several Web sites that provide a range of information about reproductive health, from contraception to prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, to finding an abortion provider, and to information about the drug Mifepristone.    Plaintiff Safersex.org is a Web site  that offers free educational information on how to practice safer sex.           Plaintiff Ethan Interactive, Inc., d/b/a Out In America, is an online content provider that owns and operates 64 free Web sites for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered persons worldwide.    Plaintiff PlanetOut Corporation is an online content provider for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered persons. Plaintiff the Naturist Action Committee (""NAC"") is the nonprofit political arm of the Naturist Society, a private organization that promotes a way of life characterized by the practice of nudity.    The NAC Web site provides information about Naturist Society activities and about state and local laws that may affect the rights of Naturists or their ability to practice Naturism, and includes nude photographs of its members.           Plaintiff Wayne L. Parker was the Libertarian candidate in the 2000 U.S. Congressional election for the Fifth District of Mississippi (and is running again in 2002).    He publishes a Web site that communicates information about his campaign and that provides information about his political views and the Libertarian Party to the public.    Plaintiff Jeffrey Pollock was the Republican candidate in the 2000 U.S. Congressional election for the Third District of Oregon.    He operates a Web site that is now promoting his candidacy for Congress in 2002.  [FN3]              FN3.  The government challenges the standing of several of the  plaintiffs and the ripeness of their claims.    These include all of the Web site publishers and all of the individual library patrons.    Notwithstanding these objections, we are confident that the ""case or controversy"" requirement of  Article III, §    2 of the Constitution  is met by the existence of the plaintiff libraries that qualify for LSTA and E-rate funding and the library associations whose members qualify for such funding.    These plaintiffs are faced with the impending choice of either certifying compliance with CIPA by July 1, 2002, or foregoing subsidies under the LSTA and E-rate programs, and therefore clearly have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the conditions to which they will be subject should they accept the subsidies.    We also note that the presence of the Web site publishers and individual library patrons does not affect our legal analysis or disposition of the case.                   C. The Internet         1. Background           As we noted at the outset, the Internet is a vast, interactive medium consisting of a decentralized network of computers around the world.    The Internet presents low entry barriers to anyone who wishes to provide or distribute information.    Unlike television, cable, radio, newspapers, magazines or books, the Internet provides an opportunity for those with access to it to  communicate with a worldwide audience at little cost.    At least 400 million people use the Internet worldwide, and approximately 143 million Americans were using the Internet as of September 2001.    Nat'l Telecomm.     & Info. Admin.,  A Nation Online:    How Americans Are Expanding Their Use of the Internet  (February 2002),  available at http://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/dn/.           *417  The World Wide Web is a part of the Internet that consists of a network of computers, called ""Web servers,"" that host ""pages"" of content accessible via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or ""HTTP."" Anyone with a computer connected to the Internet can search for and retrieve information stored on Web servers located around the world.    Computer users typically access the Web by running a program called a ""browser"" on their computers.    The browser displays, as individual pages on the computer screen, the various types of content found on the Web and lets the user follow the connections built into Web pages--called ""hypertext links,"" ""hyperlinks,"" or ""links""--to additional content.    Two popular browsers are Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator.           A ""Web page"" is one or more files a browser graphically assembles to make a viewable whole when a user requests content over the Internet.    A Web page may contain a variety of different elements, including text, images, buttons, form fields that the user can fill in, and links to other Web pages.    A ""Web site"" is a term that can be used in several different ways.    It may refer to all of  the pages and resources available on a particular Web server.    It may also refer to all the pages and resources associated with a particular organization, company or person, even if these are located on different servers, or in a subdirectory on a single server shared with other, unrelated sites.    Typically, a Web site has as an intended point of entry, a ""home page,"" which includes links to other pages on the same Web site or to pages on other sites. Online discussion groups and chat rooms relating to a variety of subjects are available through many Web sites.           Users may find content on the Web using engines that search for requested keywords.    In response to a keyword request, a search engine will display a list of Web sites that may contain relevant content and provide links to those sites.    Search engines and directories often return a limited number of sites in their search results (e.g., the Google search engine will return only 2,000 sites in response to a search, even if it has found, for example, 530,000 sites in its index that meet the search criteria).           A user may also access content on the Web by typing a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into the address line of the browser.    A URL is an address that points to some resource located on a Web server that is accessible over the Internet.    This resource may be a Web site, a Web page, an image, a sound or video file, or other resource.    A URL can be either a numeric Internet Protocol or ""IP"" address, or an alphanumeric ""domain name"" address.    Every Web  server connected to the Internet is assigned an IP address.    A typical IP address looks like ""13.1.64.14."" Typing the URL "" http://13.1.64.14  /"" into a browser will bring the user to the Web server that corresponds to that address.    For convenience, most Web servers have alphanumeric domain name addresses in addition to IP addresses.    For example, typing in "" http:// www.paed.uscourts.gov  "" will bring the user to the same Web server as typing in "" http://204.170.64.143. ""           Every time a user attempts to access material located on a Web server by entering a domain name address into a Web browser, a request is made to a Domain Name Server, which is a directory of domain names and IP addresses, to ""resolve,"" or translate, the domain name address into an IP address.    That IP address is then used to locate the Web server from which content is being requested.    A Web site may be accessed by using either its domain name address or its IP address.           *418  A domain name address typically consists of several parts.    For example, the alphanumeric URL  http://www.paed.uscourts.gov/documents/opinions  can be broken down into three parts.    The first part is the transfer protocol the computer will use in accessing the content (e.g., ""http"" for Hypertext Transfer Protocol);    next is the name of the host server on which the information is stored (e.g.,  www.paed.uscourts.gov  );    and then the name of the particular file or directory on that server (e.g.,  /documents/opinions  ).           A single Web page may be associated with more than one URL. For example, the URLs  http://www.newyorktimes.com  and  http://www.nytimes.com  will both take the user to the  New York Times  home page.    The topmost directory in a Web site is often referred to as that Web site's root directory or root URL. For example, in  http://www.paed.uscourts"

Washington, DC         20005                     Charles F.C. Ruff         Cheryl Mills         Lanny A. Breuer                 OFFICE OF THE WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL         The White House         Washington, DC 20005         September 11, 1998         EXECUTIVE SUMMARY         Summary of Key Points of the President's Case in Anticipation     of the Starr Report        1.  The President has acknowledged a serious mistake        - an inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky. He has taken responsibility       for his actions, and he has apologized to the country, to his friends, leaders       of his party, the cabinet and most importantly, his family.       2.  This private mistake does not amount to an impeachable       action.  A relationship outside one's marriage is wrong - and the President       admits that. It is not a high crime or misdemeanor. The Constitution specifically       states that Congress shall impeach  only  for ""treason, bribery       or other high crimes and misdemeanors."" These words in the Constitution       were chosen with great care, and after extensive deliberations.       3.  ""High crimes and misdemeanors"" had       a fixed meaning to the Framers of our Constitution - it meant wrongs committed       against our system of government.  The impeachment clause was designed       to protect our country against a President who was using his official powers       against the nation, against the American people, against our society. It       was never designed to allow a political body to force a President from office       for a very personal mistake.      4.  Remember - this report is based entirely on       allegations obtained by a grand jury  - reams and reams of allegations       and purported ""evidence"" that would never be admitted in court,       that has never been seen by the President or his lawyers, and that was not       subject to cross-examination or any other traditional safeguards to ensure       its credibility.       5.  Grand juries are not designed to search for       truth.  They do not and are not intended to ensure credibility, reliability,       or simple fairness. They only exist to accuse. Yet this is the process that       the Independent Counsel has chosen to provide the ""evidence"" to       write his report.      6.  The law defines perjury very clearly.  Perjury       requires proof that an individual knowingly made a false statement while       under oath. Answers to questions that are literally true are  not        perjury. Even if an answer doesn't directly answer the question asked, it       is not perjury if it is true - no accused has an obligation to help his       accuser. Answers to fundamentally ambiguous questions also can never be       perjury. And nobody can be convicted of perjury based on only one other       person's testimony.      7.  The President did not commit perjury. Most of       the illegal leaks suggesting his testimony was perjurious falsely describe       his testimony.  First of all, the President never testified in the Jones       deposition that he was not alone with Ms. Lewinsky. The President never       testified that his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky was the same as with any       other intern. To the contrary, he admitted exchanging gifts with her, knowing       about her job search, receiving cards and notes from her, and knowing other       details of her personal life that made it plain he had a special relationship       with her.      8.  The President has admitted he had an improper       sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.  In a civil deposition, he gave       narrow answers to ambiguous questions. As a matter of law, those answers       could not give rise to a criminal charge of perjury. In the face of the       President's admission of his relationship, the disclosure of lurid and salacious       allegations can only be intended to humiliate the President and force him       from office.      9.  There was no obstruction of justice. We believe        Betty Currie   testified  that Ms. Lewinsky asked her to hold       the gifts and that the President never talked to her about the gifts.        The President admitted giving and receiving gifts from Ms. Lewinsky when       he was asked about it. The President never asked Ms. Lewinsky to get rid       of the gifts and he never asked Ms. Currie to get them. We believe that       Ms. Currie's testimony supports the President's.      10.  The President never tried to get Ms. Lewinsky       a job after she left the White House in order to influence her testimony       in the Paula Jones case.  The President knew Ms. Lewinsky was unhappy       in her Pentagon job after she left the White House and did ask the White       Housepersonnel office to treat her fairly in her job search. He never instructed       anyone to hire her, or even indicated that he very much wanted it to happen.       Ms. Lewinsky was never offered a job at the White House after she left -       and it's pretty apparent that if the President had ordered it, she would       have been.      11.  The President did not facilitate Ms. Lewinsky's       interview with Bill Richardson, or her discussions with Vernon Jordan.        Betty Currie asked John Podesta if he could help her with her New York job       search which led to an interview with Bill Richardson, and Ms. Currie also       put her in touch with her longtime friend, Mr. Jordan. Mr. Jordan has made       it clear that this is the case, and, as a private individual, he is free       to offer job advice wherever he sees fit.      12.  There was no witness tampering. Betty Currie       was not supposed to be a witness in the Paula Jones case.  If she was       not called or going to be called, it was impossible for any conversations       the President had with her to be witness tampering. The President testified       that he did not in any way attempt to influence her recollection.       13.  There is no ""talking points"" smoking       gun.  Numerous illegal leaks painted the mysterious talking points as       the proof that the President or his staff attempted to suborn the perjury       of Monica Lewinsky or Linda Tripp. The OIC's spokesman said that the ""talking       points"" were the ""key"" to Starr even being granted authority       to investigate the President's private life. Yet in the end, Ms. Lewinsky       has apparently admitted the talking points were written by her alone [or       with Ms. Tripp's assistance], and the President was not asked one single       question about them in his grand jury appearance.      14.  Invocation of privileges was not an abuse of       power.  The President's lawful assertion of privileges in a court of       law was only made on the advice of his Counsel, and was in significant measure        validated  by the courts. The legal claims were advanced sparingly       and as a last resort after all attempts at compromise by the White House       Counsel's office were rejected to protect the core constitutional and institutional       interests of this and future presidencies.      15.  Neither the President nor the White House played       a role in the Secret Service's lawful efforts to prevent agents from testifying       to preserve its protectivefunction.  The President never asked, directed       or participated in any decision regarding the protective function privilege.       Neither did any White House official. The Treasury and Justice Departments       independently decided to respond to the historically unprecedented subpoenas       of Secret Service personnel and to pursue the privilege to ensure the protection       of this and future presidents.      16.  The President did not abuse his power by permitting       White House staff to comment on the investigation.  The President has       acknowledged misleading his family, staff and the country about the nature       of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, and he has apologized and asked for       forgiveness. However, this personal failing does not constitute a criminal       abuse of power. If allowing aides to repeat misleading statements is a crime,       then any number of public officials are guilty of misusing their office       for as long as they fail to admit wrong doing in response to any allegation       about their activities.      17.  The actions of White House attorneys were completely       lawful . The White House Counsel attorneys provided the President and       White House officials with informed, candid advice on issues raised during       this investigation that affected the President's official duties. This was       especially necessary given the fact that impeachment proceedings against       the President were a possible result of the OIC's investigation from Day       One. In fact, throughout the investigation, the OIC  relied on  the       White House Counsel's office for assistance in gathering information and       arranging interviews and grand jury appearances. The Counsel's office's       actions were well known to the OIC throughout the investigation and no objection       was ever voiced.      This means that the OIC report is left with nothing     but the details of a private sexual relationship, told in graphic details     with the intent to embarrass.  Given the flimsy and unsubstantiated basis     for the accusations, there is a complete lack of any credible evidence to     initiate an impeachment inquiry concerning the President. And the principal     purpose of this investigation, and the OIC's report, is to embarrass the President     and titillate the public by producing a document that is little more than     an unreliable, one-sided account of sexual behavior.     Where's Whitewater?  The OIC's allegations reportedly     include  no  suggestion of wrongdoing by the President in any of the     areas which Mr. Starr spend four years investigating: Whitewater, the FBI     files and the White House travel office. What began as an inquiry into a 24     year old land deal in Arkansas has ended as an inquest into brief, improper     personal encounters between the President and Monica Lewinsky. Despite the     exhaustive nature of the OIC's investigation into the Whitewater, FBI files     and travel office matters, and a constant stream of suggestions of misconduct     in the media over a period of years, to this day the OIC has never exonerated     the President or the First Lady of wrongdoing. PRELIMINARY MEMORANDUM CONCERNING REFERRAL OF OFFICE OF INDEPENDENT COUNSEL This document is intended to be a preliminary response   to the Referral submitted by the Office of Independent Counsel to The Congress.   Because we were denied the opportunity to review the content, nature or specifics   of the allegations made against the President by the Office of Independent Counsel   (OIC), we do not pretend to offer a point-by-point refutation of those allegations,   or a comprehensive defense of the President. We commend the House of Representatives for the extraordinary   steps it has taken to safeguard the secrecy of the OIC's allegations. Unfortunately,   its efforts were thwarted by unnamed sources familiar with the details of the   OIC's allegations -- sources that could only come from the OIC itself -- who   saw fit to leak elements of the allegations to the news media. Based on these illegal leaks, as well as our knowledge   of the President's testimony, we offer this document as a summary outline of   his side of the case. We will provide you with a specific rebuttal as soon as   we have had a chance to review the materials that the OIC has already transmitted   to you. The simple reality of this situation is that the House   is being confronted with evidence of a man's efforts to keep an inappropriate   relationship private. A personal failure that the President has acknowledged   was wrong, for which he apologized, and for which he accepts complete responsibility.   A personalfailure for which the President has sought forgiveness from members   of his family, members of the Cabinet, Members of Congress, and the American   people. Such a personal failing does not, however, constitute ""treason,   bribery and high crimes and misdemeanors"" that would justify the impeachment   of the President of the United States. The President himself has described his conduct as wrong.   But no amount of gratuitous details about the President's relationship with   Ms. Lewinsky, no matter how salacious, can alter the fact that:    1) The President did not commit perjury:    2) The President did not obstruct justice;    3) The President did not tamper with witnesses; and    4) The President did not abuse the power of his office.        Impeachment is a matter of incomparable gravity. Even   to discuss it is to discuss overturning the electoral will of the people. For   this reason, the Framers made clear, and scholars have long agreed, that the   power should be exercised only in the event of such grave harms to the state   as ""serious assaults on the integrity of the processes of government,""   or ""such crimes as would so stain a president as to make his continuance   in office dangerous to public order."" Charles L. Black,  Impeachment:   A Handbook  38-39 (1974). We do not believe the OIC can identify any conduct   remotely approaching this standard. Instead, from press reports, if true, it   appears that the OIC has dangerouslyoverreached to describe in the most dramatic   of terms conduct that not only is not criminal but is actually proper and lawful. The President has confessed to indiscretions with Ms.   Lewinsky and accepted responsibility and blame. The allegations concerning obstruction,   intimidation, perjury and subornation of perjury that we anticipate from the   OIC are extravagant attempts to transform a case involving inappropriate personal   behavior into one of public misconduct justifying reversal of the judgment of   the electorate of this country. I.  STANDARDS FOR IMPEACHMENT              The Constitution provides that the President shall       be removed from office only upon ""Impeachment for, and Conviction of,       Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors."" U.S. Const.       Art. II, § 4. Of course, there is no suggestion of treason or bribery       present here. Therefore, the question confronting the House of Representatives       is whether the President has committed a ""high Crime[] or Misdemeanor.""       The House has an obligation to consider the evidence in view of that very       high Constitutional threshold. It should pursue the impeachment process       only if there is evidence implicating that high standard.      The House must approach the question with solemnity       and with care, for history teaches that an ""impeachable offense""       is no ordinary kind of wrongdoing. The Framers included specific provisions       for impeachment in the Constitution itself because they understood that       the most severe political remedy was necessary to remedy the most serious       forms of public wrongdoing. Impeachment is a basic constitutional safeguard,       designed both to correct harms to the system of government itself and to       protect the people from ongoing malfeasance. Nothing less than the gravest       executive wrongdoing can justify impeachment. The Constitution leaves lesser       wrongs to the political process and to public opinion.       Presidential impeachment is thus a matter of incomparable       gravity. As Professor Charles Black stated,             [t]he presidency is a prime symbol of our national         unity. The election of the president (with his alternate, the vice-president)         is the only political act that we perform together as a nation; voting         in the presidential election is certainly the political choice most significant         to the American people, and the most closely attended to by them. No matter,         then, can be of higher political importance than our considering whether,         in any given instance, this act of choice is to be undone, and the chosen         president dismissed from office in disgrace. Everyone must shrink from         this most drastic of measures.                Impeachment: A Handbook  1 (1974). Presidential       impeachment is thus an ""awful step.""  Ibid.  The Framers       knew this. For that reason they framed the constitutional procedure with       precision and specified grounds for impeachment with great care.           The Framers deliberately chose to make ""high       Crimes and Misdemeanors"" the standard of an impeachable offense. They       were familiar with English common law and parliamentary history and they       borrowed the expression directly from the English law of impeachment. They       did so knowing that the expression was a term of art and they made the choice       after deliberate rejection of alternative formulations of the impeachment       standard.      The Framers intended the standard to be a high one.       They rejected a proposal that the President be impeachable for ""maladministration,""       for, as James Madison pointed out, such a standard would ""be equivalent       to a tenure during the pleasure of the Senate."" 1          The Framers plainly did not intend to permit Congress to debilitate       the executive by authorizing impeachment for something short of the most       serious harm to the state. In George Mason's apt phrase, impeachment was       thought necessary to remedy ""[a]ttempts to subvert the Constitution.""      In English practice, the term ""high crimes and       misdemeanors"" had been applied to various offenses, the common elements       of which were their severity and the fact that the wrongdoing was directed       against the state. 2    The English cases       included misappropriation of public funds, interfering in elections, accepting       bribes, neglect of duty, and various forms of corruption.  Ibid.  These       offenses all affected the discharge of public duties by public officials.       In short, under the English practice, ""the critical element of injury       in an impeachable offense was  injury to the state ."" 3                That is why, at the time of the ratification debates,       Alexander Hamilton described impeachment as a ""method of NATIONALINQUEST       into the conduct of public men."" The Federalist No. 65 at 331 (Gary       Wills ed. 1982). This ""inquest"" is perhaps the gravest process       known to our Constitution. No act touches more fundamental questions of       constitutional government than does the process of Presidential impeachment.       No act more directly affects the public interest. No act presents the potential       for greater injustice -- injustice both to the Chief Executive and to the       people who elected him.       For these reasons, the impeachment process must be       painstaking and deliberate. It must focus only on such harms as the Framers       intended to be redressed by the incomparably severe act of impeachment.       And most importantly, it must be understood for what it is -- a process       of inquiry. That process is itself the exercise of a public trust ""of       delicacy and magnitude."" 4    Accordingly,       if the process is begun it is only just that the members engaged in this       solemn task withhold judgment until the process is complete and all the       facts are known. Our Constitution's most basic values and the requirements       of simple justice together demand no less.      The President is sole head of one branch of our government       -- indeed, in a certain sense the President  is  the Executive Branch.       The Constitution provides that ""[t]he executive Power shall be vested       in a President of the United States of America."" U.S. Const. art. II,       § 1. The President isthe only government official to have been popularly       elected by all the American people. When the people elect a President, the       popular will is expressed in its most important, most visible and most unmistakable       form. 5    The impeachment process, by       definition, threatens to undo the popular will. Impeachment presents the       prospect of reversing the electoral mandate that brought the executive to       office. Conviction upon articles of impeachment actually does so.       For these reasons, impeachment is limited to only       certain forms of potential wrongdoing and it is intended to redress only       certain kinds of harms. Again, in Hamilton's words:             the subjects of [the Senate's impeachment] jurisdiction         are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or         in other words from the abuse of violation of some public trust. They         are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL,         as they relate chiefly to injuries done to the society itself.               Federalist 65 at 330-31.           The Framers and early commentators on the Constitution       are in accord on the question of impeachment's intended consequence. In       Justice James Wilson's words, impeachments are ""proceedings of a political       nature . . . confined to political characters"" charging only ""political       crimes and misdemeanors"" and culminating only in ""political punishments.""       J. Wilson,  Works  426 (R. McCloskey, ed. 1967) And as Justice Story       put the matter, ""the [impeachment] power partakes of a political character,       as itrespects injuries to the society in its political character.""       Joseph Story,  Commentaries on the Constitution  § 744 (1 st        Ed. 1833). 6    That understanding of       the Framers and early commentators reflected the historical understanding       of impeachable offenses in England. ""'High crimes and misdemeanors'       were a category of  political  crimes against the state."" Berger,        Impeachment , at 61 (emphasis in original). Therefore, the Framers       ""intended that a president be removable from office for the commission       of  great offenses against the Constitution ."" 7          Impeachment therefore addresses public wrongdoing, whether denominated       a ""political crime[] against the state,"" 8          or ""an act of malfeasance or abuse of office,"" 9          or a ""great offense[s] against the federal government."" 10          In short, impeachment is a necessary Constitutional check by a coordinate       branch of government upon serious and aggravated abuses of executive power       that, given the President's four-year term, might otherwise go unchecked.      Holders of public office are therefore not to be impeached       for private conduct, however wrongful. To the contrary, only ""serious       assaults on the integrity of the processes of government,"" 11          and ""such crimes as would so stain a president as to make his       continuance in office dangerous to public order"" 12          should constitute impeachable offenses. Conduct which is not an ""offense[]       against the government,"" 13    or       ""malfeasance or abuse of office,"" 14          and which bears no ""functional relationship"" 15          to public office, does not constitute grounds for impeachment. Allegations       concerning private conduct--private sexual conduct in particular--simply       do not implicate high crimes or misdemeanors.      Private misconduct, or even public misconduct short       of an offense against the state, is not redressable by impeachment because       that solemn process, in Justice Story's words, addresses ""offences[]       which are committed by public men  in violation of their public trust       and duties ."" Story,  Commentaries  § 744 (emphasis added).       Impeachment is a political act in the sense that its aims are public; it       attempts to rein in abuses of the public trust committed by public officeholders       in connection with conduct in public office. As one scholar has put it,       ""[t]henature of [impeachment] proceedings is dictated by the harms       sought to be redressed - ""the misconduct of public men"" relating       to the conduct of their public office - and the ultimate issue to be resolved       - whether they have forfeited through that conduct their right to continued       public trust."" 16          Impeachment's public character is further evidenced       by the fact that, as Justice Story expressed it, the process is conducted       ""by the representatives of the nation, in their public capacity,""       and ""in the face of the nation."" Story,  Commentaries  §       686. Constitutionally, impeachment's public function demands public accountability.       Elected officials are no more qualified than ordinary voters to assess the       private wrongs of public officeholders. The Constitution's impeachment mechanism       does not exist to punish such wrongs.       The public character of impeachable wrongs is also       reflected in the fact that the remedy imposed for commission of impeachable       acts is a wholly public one. Impeachment results in removal from office       and possible disqualification from further office. U.S. Const. art.I, §       3, cl. 7.       To say that impeachment is fundamentally a ""political""       process, however, is not to say that it is ""partisan"" in nature.       Indeed, the Framers warned against the spirit of partisanship in impeachment       proceedings. In Federalist 65, Hamilton wrote that the impeachment process       threatened to ""agitate the passions ofthe whole community . . .to divide       it into parties . . . [to] connect itself with pre-existing factions [and]       to enlist their animosities, partialities, influence and interest.""        Id.  at 331. Justice Story warned of the danger that ""the decision       [to impeach] will be regulated more by the comparative strength of the parties,       than by the strength of the proofs."" Commentaries § 744. Only       substantial evidence of presidential wrongdoing that threatened the processes       of government or the public order can justify this grave and ideally bipartisan       process.       What is ultimately intended by impeachment's truly       ""political"" nature is the manner of limitation the Constitution       allows one elected (political) branch to place on the other elected (political)       branch, the Presidency. Impeachment is necessarily a  public  act conducted       by public bodies (the Houses of Congress exercising their constitutionally       allotted portion of impeachment power) against a public officeholder (here,       the President). Exercise of that limiting function is justified only when       the people's representatives conclude that the people themselves must be       protected from their own elected executive.      Impeachment must therefore be approached with the       utmost solemnity. The process must focus on public acts, performed in the       President's public capacity, and affecting the public interest. Cognizant       of the enormous harm that must follow the bare suggestion of formal impeachment       processes, the House should pursue an impeachment inquiry if and only if       there is credible evidence of actions constituting fundamental injuries       tothe governmental process. Indeed, the Committee should consider and approve       articles of impeachment  only  for such acts as have, in its judgment,       so seriously threatened the integrity of governmental processes as to have       made the President's continuation in office a threat to the public order.             Impropriety falling short of that high standard does       not meet the constitutional measure. It must be left to the court of public       opinion and the judgment of history.     II.  THE RELEVANT FACTUAL BACKGROUND      The Monica Lewinsky investigation is the most recent phase of an amorphous, languorous, expensive, and seemingly interminable investigation into the affairs of a small Arkansas real estate firm, Whitewater Development Company, Inc.  In January, 1994, Attorney General Reno made an administrative appointment (the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 having expired) of Robert B. Fiske, Jr., to investigate the relationship of the President and Mrs. Clinton to Whitewater, Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan Association, and Capital Management Services. After the reenactment of the Ethics in Government Act, the Special Division for the Purpose of Appointing Independent Counsels of the Court of Appeals appointed Kenneth W. Starr, a former high official in two Republican administrations, to replace Mr. Fiske on August 5, 1994, and gave him a generally similar grant of investigatory jurisdiction.      During the past four and a half years, the President has cooperated extensively with this investigation.  He has giventestimony by deposition at the White House to the Independent Counsel on four separate occasions, and on two other occasions, he gave videotaped deposition testimony for Whitewater defendants and was cross-examined by the Independent Counsel.  He has submitted written interrogatory answers, produced more than 90,000 pages of documents and other items, and provided information informally in a variety of ways.  The OIC subpoenaed from the President, and reviewed, virtually  every  personal financial record and gubernatorial campaign finance record that exists for the period from the mid-1980s to the present, in its endless search to find something to use against the President. This comprehensive and thorough financial review yielded the OIC nothing.      In May 1994, President Clinton was sued civilly by       Ms. Paula Jones, who made various claims arising out of an encounter on       May 8, 1991, when the President was Governor of Arkansas. Various constitutional       questions were litigated, and it was not until the Supreme Court's decision       on May 27, 1997 17    that the case proceeded       to discovery. The Independent Counsel had no jurisdiction with respect to       the  Jones  case, but there were occasional press reports that the       OIC was in fact investigating the President's personal life. 18         III.  THE PRESIDENT'S TESTIMONY ABOUT MS. LEWINSKY      In his grand jury testimony on August 17, 1998, the President acknowledged having had an improperly intimate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.  This is enormously difficult for any person to do even in private, much less in public.       It is important to recognize that the improper relationship with Ms. Lewinsky  ended  in early 1997, at the President's behest.  It therefore had been over for almost a year at the time of the President's deposition in the  Jones  case. From feelings both of friendship and responsibility, the President remained in touch with Ms. Lewinsky after the improper relationship ended and tried to help her:  none of this help was improper or conditioned on her behaving (or testifying) in any particular way.        It is not true that the President had an improper 18-month relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, as several media reports have alleged.  In his grand jury deposition, he testified that on certain occasions in early 1996 and once in early 1997, he engaged in improper conduct with Ms. Lewinsky.  These encounters did not consist of sexual intercourse, and they did not consist of ""sexual relations"" as he understood that term to be defined at his  Jones  deposition on January 17, 1998 (explained  infra ), but they did involve inappropriate intimate contact.  These inappropriate encounters ended, at the President's insistence, in early 1997, not because of the imminence of discovery, not because of the  Jones  case (which the Supreme Court had not yet decided), but because he knew they were  wrong .  On August 17,1998, the President expressed regret to the grand jury and, later, to the country, that what began as a friendship came to include this conduct, and he took full responsibility.  He has frequently, to different audiences, made similar expressions of regret and apology.        In this investigation, no stone has been left unturned--or (we believe) unthrown.  In simple fairness, therefore, it is important to distinguish between what the President has acknowledged and what the OIC merely alleges (on the basis of evidence we have not yet seen). IV.   THE NATURE OF THE OIC'S EVIDENCE              Use of a federal grand jury to compile evidence for       possible impeachment proceedings in Congress raises numerous troubling questions       regarding the credibility of that evidence. Indeed, given the limited role       of a grand jury in our system and the total absence of procedural protections       in the process, the Independent Counsel's insistence that his investigation       has been a search for ""truth"" is deeply misleading. In fact, it       has been a one-sided effort to present the worst possible version of a limited       set of facts.      Section 595(c) requires the OIC to provide the House       with ""substantial and credible information . . . that may constitute       grounds for impeachment."" But a grand jury is a totally unsuitable       vehicle for generating information that can, without more, be taken as credible       beyond challenge. The grand jury's historic role is not to determine the       truth but rather toact as an accusatory body.  United States v. Williams ,       504 U.S. 36, 51 (1992). The process excludes contrary views of the information       gathered and fails to identify the kinds of exculpatory information that       might have been elicited or presented had a targeted individual, and not       just the OIC, had an opportunity to cross-examine and the ability to compel       responses.      Because it is inherently so one-sided and untested       by cross-examination, it normally is not permissible to use grand jury testimony       as a basis for anything other than permitting a grand jury to indict or       decline to indict. It may constitute nothing more than hearsay,  Costello       v. United States , 350 U.S. 359, 364 (1956), or even multiple hearsay--evidence       which would likely be excluded from a trial. Indeed, the information a grand       jury gathers is not circumscribed by the Federal Rules of Evidence at all,        see  Fed. R. Evid. 1101(d)(2), nor delimited by the other safeguards       of reliability which would be enforced at trial. The testimony a grand jury       elicits is not subject to impeachment by interested parties, and such testimony       may come from immunized witnesses, from witnesses who fear prosecution,       from witnesses prepared by the prosecution, from witnesses with a history       of untruthfulness--or from disinterested witnesses. On the record of the       grand jury there need be no distinction among these sources, despite the       fact that their reliability varies greatly.      In its day-to-day operations, no judge presides over       grand jury proceedings.  United States v. Williams , 504 U.S. 36,48       (1992). Grand jury witnesses do not have counsel present. Fed. R. Crim P.       6(d). The Double Jeopardy Clause does not prevent a grand jury from returning       an indictment after a first grand jury has declined to do so.  Ex Parte       United States , 287 U.S. 241, 250-51 (1932). The exclusionary rule does       not apply to grand jury proceedings.  United States v. Calandra , 414       U.S. 338, 349 (1974). Grand jury witnesses have no right to respond with       information, however related, if it is not called for by the prosecution,       and targets and subjects of its inquiry have no compulsory process to gather       and present their side of the matter. Nor does the target of a grand jury       inquiry have any right to offset potentially incriminating information with       exculpatory information in his possession.  Williams , 504 U.S. at       55. In short, the most basic techniques our adversary system of justice       employs for testing and assuring the reliability of evidence are completely       missing in the grand jury context.       As a consequence, ""reliability"" simply is       not the touchstone of a grand-jury inquiry. The Supreme Court itself has       said that ""the mere fact that evidence is unreliable is not sufficient       to require a dismissal of [an] indictment.""  Bank of Nova Scotia       v. United States , 487 U.S. 250, 261 (1988). The same is true of ""inadequate       or incompetent"" evidence. Its presence will not justify dismissal of       an indictment.  Calandra , 414 U.S. at 345;  see also   Holt       v. United States , 218 U.S. 245 (1910) (same).       It must therefore be recognized that it is not the       grand jury's function to provide information about anything that can be       taken as true on its face. Its function is not to get at the ultimate truth.       The grand jury's inquisitorial powers serve but one end: to empower a body       of citizens to make a threshold decision whether to initiate the search       for truth that is the purpose of adversarial proceedings or to decline to       indict and thereby forego that search altogether. Only after the grand jury       renders that threshold decision does the search for truth really commence       because only then are the adversary system's credibility-assessing mechanisms       available.      The grand jury secrecy rule, Rule 6(e), Fed. R. Crim.       P., is justified--indeed, mandated--by this reality. Grand jury information       is to be kept secret largely because it has been generated without the protections       of the adversarial system. Unlike information presented in a trial setting,       grand jury information presents an enormous risk that persons' reputations       will be injured or destroyed on the basis of non-credible or insubstantial       assertions. That harm may damage both witnesses and persons who are subjects       of witness testimony. That is why, when a grand jury elects to indict, grand       jury materials are sealed and withheld from the petit jury ultimately convened       to find the truth and render a verdict.       Accordingly a fair report from the OIC would,  inter         alia , provide all exculpatory evidence, assess the credibility of       witnesses in terms of bias, reason to falsify, prior inconsistentstatements,       etc., and draw reasonable inferences. A fair report would identify shortcomings       in the investigation itself, including any excesses, mistakes, errors in       judgment, or impermissible tactics. A fair report would demonstrate that       every possible effort had been made to identify all possibly exculpatory       evidence, and that all such evidence had been given appropriate weight.       And a fair report would address honestly and answer truthfully the following       questions:             1) What were Linda Tripp's motives in seeking out         the OIC in January, 1998? Did she articulate a fear of being prosecuted         in Maryland under that State's anti-taping laws? Why did she request immunity         from prosecution? Why was she given immunity?        2) What role did the OIC play in arranging for Ms.         Tripp to meet with the  Jones  lawyers on Friday, January 16, 1998,         the evening before the President's deposition? Did anyone from the OIC         drive Ms. Tripp to this meeting? Did the OIC warn Ms. Tripp about the         criminal law pertaining to sharing with third parties the fruits of illegal         tapings or even communicating the fact that illegal tapes exist? Has anyone         at the OIC made any assessment of what impact Ms. Tripp's conduct might         have on any federal immunity deal Ms. Tripp might have obtained from the         OIC?        3) What authority did the OIC have to wire Linda         Tripp and attempt to develop evidence  before  obtaining permission         to expand its jurisdiction from the Attorney General or the Special Division?         What prevented the OIC from going directly to the Attorney General upon         receiving the tapes from Ms. Tripp? If the primary basis for the expansion         of the OIC's jurisdiction was evidence that was obtained in an  ultra         vires  manner by the OIC, does that taint other information obtained         by the OIC?        4) What assessment has the OIC made of Ms. Tripp's         ideological motivations? Was the OIC aware she had submitted an anti-Clinton         book proposal to avowed Clinton hater Lucianne Goldberg? Was the OIC aware         of Goldberg's role in Ms. Tripp's taping and arrangement for Ms. Lewinsky's         use of a messenger service?         5) How many statements on the Tripp-Lewinsky tapes         are false or exaggerated? How many statements contradict assertions in         the OIC's report?         6) When Ms. Tripp was asked to record Ms. Lewinsky         surreptitiously, was this because the OIC was concerned about the legality         of Ms. Tripp's previous telephone tapes of Ms. Lewinsky?        7) What was Ms. Tripp's motivation in initiating         the surreptitious recording of her conversations with Ms. Lewinsky? Did         Tripp steer the taped conversations with Ms. Lewinsky to obtain details         about Ms. Lewinsky's sexual activities? Was the taping connected in any         way to her relationship with Lucianne Goldberg? If Ms. Tripp began to         tape Ms. Lewinsky with an unlawful purpose, did she commit a violation         of the federal wiretapping statute (Title III)? If the tapes were obtained         in violation of federal law, can the tapes or evidence derived from them         be part of any official proceeding in Congress ( see  18 U.S.C. §         2515)?        8) What, if anything, did the OIC offer the press         to keep secret its investigation into Ms. Lewinsky?         9) Why was the OIC in such haste to petition the         Attorney General for an expansion of jurisdiction? Precisely what was         the Attorney General told about Ms. Tripp's telephone taping of Ms. Lewinsky?         Did the ""talking points"" play any role in the application? What         particular alleged crimes did the OIC seek authorization to investigate?          10) Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers, William Ginsburg and         Nathaniel Speights, wrote in an essay in  Time  (Feb. 16, 1998) that         the OIC informed them on Friday, January 16, 1998, ""We've got a deal,         and we want to wire her and record some phone calls;"" these lawyers         also wrote in that essay that ""[The OIC] wanted her [Ms. Lewinsky]         wired, and they wanted her to record telephone calls with the President         of the U.S., Vernon Jordan and others--at their will."" What persons         did the OIC intend Ms. Lewinsky to record surreptitiously?          11) In a letter from the Independent Counsel to         the President's personal counsel, dated February 6, 1998, the Independent         Counsel wrote: ""From the beginning, I have made the prohibition of         leaks a principal priority of the Office. It is a firing offense, as well         as one that leads to criminal prosecution."" However, Chief Judge         Johnson has entered a series of orders finding  prima   facie          reason to believe that persons in the OICviolated Rule 6(e), Fed. R. Crim.         P., by illegal leaking (for example, ""[t]he Court finds that the         serious and repetitive nature of disclosures to the media of Rule 6(e)         material strongly militates in favor of conducting a show cause hearing""         (June 19, 1998, Order, at 5)). Has anyone been fired or disciplined by         the OIC for illegal leaking? What steps have been taken to investigate         and discipline OIC personnel who have engaged in illegal leaking?        V.  LIKELY OIC ALLEGATIONS OF OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, SUBORNATION OF  PERJURY, AND INTIMIDATION OF WITNESSES              The OIC obtained jurisdiction on January 16, 1998       to investigate possible obstruction of justice, subornation of perjury,       and intimidation of witnesses in the  Jones  case. These crimes are       quite specifically defined in the law, and the elements do not always have       an obvious meaning. We consider first the definition and then the possible       conduct to which these definitions might be applied.       The term ""obstruction of justice"" usually       refers to violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1503, the ""Omnibus Obstruction       Provision,"" which prohibits the intimidation and retaliation against       grand and petit jurors and judicial officers and contains a catch-all clause       making it unlawful to ""influence, obstruct, or impede the due administration       of justice."" It may also refer to 18 U.S.C. § 1512, which proscribes       intimidating, threatening, or corruptly persuading, through deceptive conduct,       a person in connection with an official proceeding.      For a conviction under § 1503, the government       must prove that there was a pending judicial proceeding, that the defendant       knew of the proceeding, and that the defendant acted""corruptly""       with the specific intent to obstruct or interfere with the proceeding or       due administration of justice.  See ,  e.g. ,  United States       v. Bucey , 876 F.2d 1297, 1314 (7th Cir. 1989);  United States v. Smith ,       729 F. Supp. 1380, 1383-84 (D.D.C. 1990). Thus, if a defendant is unaware       of a pending grand jury proceeding, he cannot be said to have obstructed       it in violation of § 1503.  See ,  e.g. ,  United States       v. Brown , 688 F.2d 1391, 1400 (9th Cir. 1992). Perhaps more significant       is the ""acting corruptly"" element of the offense. Some courts       have defined this term as acting with ""evil and wicked purposes.""        See   United States v. Banks , 942 F.2d 1576, 1578 (11th Cir.       1991). Four federal courts of appeals have held that to ""act corruptly""       under the statute, a defendant must have acted with the specific intent       to obstruct justice.  See   United States v. Moon , 718 F.2d 1219,       1236 (2d Cir. 1983);  United States v. Bashaw , 982 F.2d 168, 170 (6th       Cir. 1992);  United States v. Anderson , 798 F.2d 919, 928 (7th Cir,       1986);  United States v. Rasheed , 663 F.2d 843, 847 (9th Cir. 1981).       That is, it is not enough to prove that the defendant knew that a result       of his actions might be to impede the administration of justice, if that       was not his intent.      It is critical to note which actions cannot fall under       the ambit of § 1503. First, false statements or testimony alone  cannot        sustain a conviction under § 1503.  See   United States v. Thomas ,       916, F.2d 647, 652 (11th Cir. 1990);  United States v. Rankin , 870       F.2d 109, 111 (3d Cir. 1989). For instance, in  United States v. Wood ,       6 F.3d 692, 697 (10th Cir. 1993), theUnited States Court of Appeals for       the Tenth Circuit found that a defendant's false statements to the Federal       Bureau of Investigation during a grand jury investigation did not violate       § 1503, because they did not have the natural and probable effect of       impeding the due administration of justice. Moreover, § 1503 does  not        apply to a party's concealing or withholding discoverable documents in  civil        litigation.  See ,  e.g. ,  Richmark v. Timber Falling Consultants ,       730 F. Supp. 1525, 1532 (D. Or. 1990) (because of the remedies afforded       by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, § 1503 does not cover party       discovery in civil cases, and ""[t]he parties have not cited and the       court has not found any case in which a person was charged with obstruction       of justice for concealing or withholding discovery in a civil case""). 19          Most cases that have found § 1503 applicable to civil cases       do not involve the production or withholding of documents.  See United       States v. London,  714 F.2d 1558 (11th Cir. 1983) (attorney forged court       order and attempted to enforce it),  cited in Richmark,  730 F. Supp.       at 1532;  Sneed v. United States,  298 F. 911 (5th Cir. 1924) (influencing       juror in civil case);  cited in Richmark,  730 F. Supp at 1532. While       § 1503 can apply to concealment of subpoenaed documents in a grand       juryinvestigation, the defendant must have knowledge of the pending grand       jury investigation, must know that the particular documents are covered       by a subpoena, and must willfully conceal or endeavor to conceal them from       the grand jury with the specific intent to interfere with its investigation.        See United States v. McComb,  744 F.2d 555 (7th Cir. 1984).      Section 1512 specifically applies to ""witness       tampering."" However, by its terms, it does not purport to reach all       forms of witness tampering, but only tampering by specified means. In order       to obtain a conviction under § 1512, the government must prove that       a defendant knowingly engaged in intimidation, physical force, threats,       misleading conduct, or corrupt persuasion with intent to influence, delay,       or prevent testimony or cause any person to withhold objects or documents       from an official proceeding. While there is no ""pending proceeding""       requirement for convictions under § 1512, it is clear that a defendant       must be aware of the possibility of a proceeding and his efforts must be       aimed specifically at obstructing that proceeding, whether pending or not;       § 1512 does not apply to defendants' innocent remarks or other acts       unintended to affect a proceeding.  See United States v. Wilson , 565       F. Supp. 1416, 1431 (S.D.N.Y. 1983).      Moreover, it is important to define the terms ""corruptly       persuade"" and ""misleading conduct,"" as used in § 1512.       The statute itself explains that ""corruptly persuades"" does not       include ""conduct which would be misleading conduct but for a lackof       a state of mind."" 18 U.S.C. § 1515(a)(6). It is also clear from       the caselaw that ""misleading conduct"" does not cover scenarios       where the defendant urged a witness to give false testimony without resorting       to coercive or deceptive conduct.  See,   e.g.,   United States       v. Kulczyk,  931 F.2d 542, 547 (9th Cir. 1991) (no attempt to mislead       witnesses knew defendant was asking them to lie);  United States v. King,        762 F.2d 232, 237 (2d Cir. 1985) (defendant who attempts to persuade witness       to lie but not to mislead trier of fact does not violate § 1512).      Subornation of perjury is addressed in 18 U.S.C. §       1622. The elements of subornation are that the defendant must have persuaded       another to perjure himself, and the witness must have actually committed       perjury.  See,   e.g.   United States v. Hairston , 46 F.3d       361, 376 (4th Cir. 1959),  rev'd on other grounds , 361 U.S. 529 (1960).       If actual perjury does not occur, there is simply no subornation.  See         id.  at 376 (reversing conviction for subornation because of conclusion       that, in applying  Bronston , witness did not commit perjury due to       his literally truthful testimony). Moreover, § 1622 requires that the       defendant know that the testimony of witness will be perjurious --  i.e. ,       knowing and willful procurement of false testimony is a key element of subornation       of perjury.  See Rosen v. NLRB , 735 F.2d 564, 575 n.19 (D.C. Cir.       1984) (""a necessary predicate of the charge of subornation of perjury       is the suborner's belief that the testimony sought is in fact false"").             Based upon illegal OIC leaks and press reports, we       believe that the OIC's principal claims of obstruction, intimidation and       subornation -- the three prongs of the January 1998 expansion of jurisdiction       -- appear to arise out of:      (1) "" Talking Points ""           The so-called ""talking points"" 20          have been widely hailed as the linchpin of any charge of subornation       of perjury or obstruction of justice. Not only were they touted as the ""smoking       gun"" of the investigation, they were instrumental in the OIC efforts       to secure an expansion of its jurisdictional authority. Charles Bakaly,       the OIC spokesman, appearing on Meet the Press, emphasized the critical       nature of this document to the expansion of the OIC jurisdiction:             Tim Russert: ... How important is it that we find         out who is the author of those talking points?         Charles Bakaly: Well, in the grant of jurisdiction         that the special division of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals gave to         Judge Starr after the request of the Attorney General,  that was the         key mandate to look into , those kinds of issues of subornation of         perjury and obstruction of justice.         NBC Meet the Press, July 5, 1998 (emphasis added).          The ""talking points"" were the basis of thinly       veiled smears, groundless speculation, and allegations against President       Clinton, White House aides and others close to the President:              ""And NBC News has learned more about another         critical piece of evidence. A memo first discovered by Newsweek that Linda         Tripp claims was given to her by Monica Lewinsky. ...  Sources in Starr's         office  and close to Linda Tripp say they believe the instructions         came from the White House . If true, that could help support a case         of obstruction of justice."" NBC Nightly News, February 4, 1998.

Who wrote the document is one of the key questions, whoever did         could be charged with obstruction of justice."" Chicago Tribune, February         15, 1998.            After all of the rumor and speculation regarding a       connection between the White House and the ""talking points,"" President       Clinton was not asked one single question relating to the talking points       during his August 17 deposition. Ms. Lewinsky is reported to have testified       that she wrote the document without any assistance other than conversations       she had with Linda Tripp. In the venerable tradition of Whitewater allegations,       the ""talking points"" were surfaced as important and damning evidence       of wrongdoing, but in the fullness of time and after investigation, have       apparently vanished entirely. Only the stigma remains.             (2)  Ms. Lewinsky's Transfer of Gifts to Betty Currie           The President frequently gives gifts to and receives       gifts from friends and supporters; he gave Ms. Lewinsky the same kind of       gifts he has shared with others. He was not concerned about the Jones lawyers'       knowledge of the gifts. In the Jones deposition, he acknowledged knowing       Ms. Lewinsky, acknowledged seeing her, acknowledged she had given him gifts,       and acknowledged he had given her gifts. Moreover, in his grand jury testimony,       he acknowledged giving Ms. Lewinsky good-bye gifts on December 28, 1997,       shortly before she moved to New York, a date which we believe to be  after        Ms. Currie picked up the box of gifts from Ms. Lewinsky. The gifts simply       were not a concern to him.      It is our understanding that Ms. Lewinsky may have       testified that she raised with the President a concern about theJones lawyers'       request for gifts from the President and that, shortly thereafter, Ms. Currie       appeared at her home stating that she understood Ms. Lewinsky had something       for her. Ms. Lewinsky apparently testified that she then provided to Ms.       Currie for safekeeping a box containing some of the gifts received from       the President.       For Ms. Lewinsky's account to be credible, Ms. Currie       must have been asked by the President to contact Ms. Lewinsky for the box.       However, her account conflicts directly both with that of the President       and with what we believe to be Ms. Currie's testimony. The President told       Ms. Lewinsky she would have to produce what she had in response to a request.       He did not ever suggest that gifts from him should be disposed of, and he       did not ever ask or instruct Ms. Currie to pick up the gifts from Ms. Lewinsky.       We believe that Ms. Currie's testimony corroborates this recollection. Ms.       Currie has apparently testified that Ms. Lewinsky initiated the contact       with her about the box, asking Ms. Currie to come by her apartment building,       giving a sealed box to her, and asking her to hold on to it. Ms. Currie       has no knowledge that the President ever even knew about the box prior to       public disclosures about it, and the President testified that he did not       learn about the box until after the OIC investigation became public.                  (3)  Job Assistance to Ms. Lewinsky           The President made certain efforts to try to assure       that Ms. Lewinsky had a fair shot at a job other than herPentagon position,       where she was not happy, and he generally was aware of other efforts by       his secretary Ms. Currie and his friend Mr. Jordan. These actions were totally       appropriate. At no time did the President ask that Ms. Lewinsky be accorded       specially favorable or unfavorable treatment because of his relationship       with her or for any other reason. These actions began well before Ms. Lewinsky       was ever named a witness in the  Jones  litigation, and they were in       no way intended to influence Ms. Lewinsky to keep secret what was at that       time an already terminated relationship. There is no evidence of any link       whatsoever between the President's actions and possible testimony by Ms.       Lewinsky in the  Jones  case.       In April 1996, Ms. Lewinsky was reassigned from the       White House to the Pentagon. Although the transfer was viewed as a promotion,       the President became aware that Ms. Lewinsky was upset about it, did not       see it as a positive change, and feared that the transfer would be appear       to be a demotion or ""black mark"" on her resume. To the extent       that Ms. Lewinsky was criticized for spending more time in the West Wing       than was required by her responsibilities in the Office of Legislative Affairs,       the President felt responsible.       In the summer of 1997, the President spoke to Marsha       Scott, the deputy personnel director at the White House, and inquired about       the possibility of a position being available for Ms. Lewinsky in the White       House. He never ordered Ms. Scott or anyone else to provide her special       treatment or directed that shebe given a job at the White House. He simply       wanted to assure that she had been treated fairly and asked only that Ms.       Scott look into the possibility of a position at the White House for Ms.       Lewinsky if it was appropriate. Ms. Lewinsky was never offered an opportunity       to return to the White House--as a result of that conversation or otherwise.             In the fall of 1997, Ms. Betty Currie spoke to Mr.       John Podesta about finding a job for Ms. Lewinsky in New York, and Mr. Podesta       ultimately spoke to Ambassador Bill Richardson about the matter. The Ambassador       agreed to interview Ms. Lewinsky for a position in his New York office.       The President was not involved in arranging the Richardson interview. When       Ms. Lewinsky indicated to Ms. Currie that she preferred a job in the private       sector, Ms. Currie contacted Mr. Jordan, her long-time friend, to see whether       he would be willing to make inquiries regarding a job opportunity for Ms.       Lewinsky in the private sector. Mr. Jordan referred her for interviews at       American Express and Revlon, and to the advertising agency of Young &       Rubicam. As Mr. Jordan said in his January 22, 1998 statement on the matter:             Throughout my professional career, I have been privileged         to assist people with their vocational aspirations. I have done so for         two reasons. first, I stand on the shoulders of many individuals who have         helped me. Second, I believe ""to whom much is given much is required""         so I have tried to lend a helping hand.        For many years now . . . I am consulted by individuals,         young and old, male and female, black and white, Hispanic and Asian, rich         and poor, cabinet members and secretaries, for assistance. And I have         met with some success, from paralegals to mailroom clerks, to corporate         directors, to CEO's.        I was pleased to be helpful to Ms. Lewinsky whose         drive, ambition, and personality were impressive. She was referred by         Ms. Betty Currie, a secretary to the president.                 Mr. Jordan is a private individual who is free to       offer job assistance to whomever he chooses.            Questions have been raised about a connection between       the timing of Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit (which was executed January 7 and       filed January 16) and the timing of any job offer. There was no connection.       Francis Carter, Esq., Ms. Lewinsky's attorney at the time she executed the       affidavit, apparently has stated that Ms. Lewinsky never asked him to delay       the filing of an affidavit until after she had secured a job in New York       and never suggested when the affidavit should be filed.  The   Washington         Post , June 19, 1998. Indeed, Mr. Carter has reported that he himself       delayed the filing of the affidavit while he attempted to persuade the  Jones        attorneys to withdraw the subpoena to Ms. Lewinsky.  Ibid.        Indeed, it was totally appropriate for Mr. Jordan       to refer Ms. Lewinsky to Francis Carter to represent her in the  Jones        litigation. Mr. Carter is a highly respected lawyer who would owe his duty       to Ms. Lewinsky and represent her interests. Assuring a witness has her       own counsel in whom she may confide is the surest and most appropriate way       to protect the integrity of the process. As Mr. Jordan indicated in his       January 22 statement, the referral was ""at her request"" and Mr.       Jordan simply ""took her to Mr. Carter's office, introduced them, and       returned to my office."" Ms. Lewinsky paid Mr. Carter herself. Mr. Carter       has said that Mr. Jordan brought Ms. Lewinsky to his office, introduced       them, and told him that she had been subpoenaed in the  Jones  case       and needed an attorney. The Washington Post, June 19, 1998. According to       Mr. Carter, Mr. Jordan did not suggest what should be done or how the matter       should be handled, but promptly left.  Ibid.  Mr. Carter has stated,       ""I never received any kind of information from [Ms. Lewinsky] at any       time that contradicted anything that's in that affidavit.""  Ibid.      Finally, in January of 1998, the President asked Mr.       Erskine Bowles whether the legislative affairs office where Ms. Lewinsky       once had worked would be able to give Ms. Lewinsky a reference that would       not be negative. The President understood from Ms. Lewinsky that she thought       she could get a good reference from The Department of Defense but hoped       for a White House reference that was at least neutral. The President did       not instruct anyone to provide such a reference and did not follow up on       the inquiry. This innocuous query for an honest reference cannot conceivably       be a basis for any charge of wrongdoing.    VI.  ""ABUSES OF POWER""         From the very beginning, the Lewinsky investigation       has been about potential impeachment -- a direct attack by the OIC on the       constitutional status of the President. It is in that context that the OIC's       allegations of abuse of power must be judged.       Any charge the OIC might make that the President has       abused the powers of his office through the assertion of privileges -- privileges       that were asserted at the initiation and recommendation of the Counsel's       Office, not by the President himself -- is utterly baseless. Indeed, those       charges are more a reflection of the OIC's unfettered abuse of his authority       and his wholesale abandonment of any prosecutorial judgment in his campaign       to prevent the President from consulting with his most senior advisors in       confidence. No prosecutor, not even during Watergate,  ever  has contemplated       the sort of sweeping intrusion into the President's ability to obtain advice       that has been undertaken by the OIC. At bottom, the Independent Counsel       believes that, merely because he demands confidential information, the President       may not defend himself against impeachment without raising a charge that       he is thereby abusing his power.      Before moving to these issues, one other point is       worthy of note. It has been suggested in media reports that one of the grounds       for impeachment advanced by the OIC is that the President abused his power       by denying to his staff, in the days immediately following disclosure of       the Lewinsky investigation, that he had engaged in any improper conduct       when he knew that they might be called as witnesses before the grand jury       and knew that they were making public statements in his defense. If this       allegation were not so serious, such a suggestion would be ludicrous.      Implicit in the allegation is the notion that any       official, in any branch of the government, who makes a statement about his       own conduct, or indeed any other matter, that is not absolutely true is       liable for misusing his office for so long as he fails to admit wrongdoing,       for the official's staff will inevitable repeat his explanation in any number       of forums. It would follow, therefore, according to what appears to be the       OIC's reasoning, that no official could mount a defense to impeachment,       or to ethics charges, or to a criminal investigation while remaining in       office, for anything other than an admission of guilt will be treated as       an abuse of his official powers.            1.  The President's Decision to Litigate Privilege       Issues Cannot Be Compared to the Abuses of Power Alleged during Watergate           The Independent Counsel apparently attempts to evoke       images of Watergate by charging that the President has abused the powers       of his office. This allegation is simply meritless. In the  Federalist       Papers,  Alexander Hamilton described abuse of power as the ""corrupt       use of the office for personal gain or some other improper purpose.""       Former President Nixon's use of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to       thwart a major criminal investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation       (FBI) of a crime in which he was involved, to take but one example, fits       squarely within that definition. President Clinton's lawful assertion of       privileges in a court of law and the Counsel's Office conduct of its official       duties plainly does not.       There is no comparison between the claimed abuses       of power by President Nixon and the public and lawful assertion ofprivileges       during the OIC investigation. Indeed, comparing this White House with President       Nixon's diminishes the historical significance of the unprecedented claims       of abuse of power by the Nixon administration and attempts to criminalize       the proper exercise of presidential prerogatives. The specious nature of       the OIC's allegations reveal the OIC's true motive: to create an offense       where none exists.      In July 1974, the House Judiciary Committee lodged       serious and significant abuse of power charges against President Nixon,       alleging that President Nixon, among other things:             Engaged in an elaborate cover-up scheme that included         using his secret intelligence operation to pay both for illegal activities         and subsequent blackmail money for the cover-up;                 Paid hush money to his advisor;           Instructed administration officials on how to commit         perjury;                  Violated grand jury secrecy rules by obtaining 6(e)         material from the Justice Department and passing it on to presidential         advisors, who were targets of the investigation;                 Attempted to subvert the IRS and CIA;        Authorized illegal intelligence gathering activities;                  Directly interfered with the Justice Department's         ITT investigation; and,         Pressured the CIA to interfere with the FBI's investigation         of the Watergate break-in -- a conversation caught on tape.                 In contrast, the OIC apparently has made such charges       of abuse against President Clinton, however erroneously, for purportedly       encouraging the Secret Service to assert privilegeclaims over their testimony       and invoking attorney-client and executive privileges. President Clinton's       privilege claims have been open and lawful, and were reviewed and in significant       measure  validated  by the courts. Thus, the Nixon investigation and       precedent stand in sharp contrast to the OIC's investigation and baseless       charges in this matter.       2.  The United States Secret Service's Decision       to Pursue A Protective Privilege Was the Proper Exercise of Its Own         Authority And In No Way an Abuse of Power By the President           The assertion of a protective function privilege by       the Secret Service cannot possibly serve as a basis for the OIC's allegations       of abuse of power. As a factual matter, the President never asked, directed,       or participated in any decision regarding the protective function privilege.       Moreover, no one at the White House asked, directed, participated or had       any role in such decisions. The Treasury and Justice Departments independently       decided to pursue a privilege for the Secret Service to ensure the protection       of this and future presidents.      Second, ignoring significant security concerns expressed       by the Secret Service, the Independent Counsel sought testimony from agents       about  non-criminal  events they may have witnessed as well as  non-criminal        conversations they may have overheard in the course of protecting the President.       For the first time in the history of the Independent Counsel statute, the       Independent Counsel sought to use the protective service as a source of       intelligence for admittedly non-criminal activities ofa protectee. In the       wake of this unprecedented demand, it was and continues to be the reasoned       judgment of career professionals in the Secret Service that the absence       of a protective privilege would severely impair agents' ability to fulfill       their mission to protect this and future Presidents (as well as other protectees).       The Secret Service's position was supported by former presidents and by       former agents assigned to protect presidents in both Republican as well       as Democratic administrations.       Thus, the Justice and Treasury Departments' assertion       of a protective privilege advanced valid concerns about the Secret Service's       ability to perform its function. The OIC's suggestion that the assertion       of this privilege constituted an abuse of power not only insults the integrity       of career law enforcement officials, but that of congressional policy makers       too. Indeed, because of the Independent Counsel's unorthodox overreaching,       Senator Hatch vowed to seek legislation to enact the type of limited privilege       asserted by the Secret Service in response to the Independent Counsel's       sweeping actions. Congressional Press Releases, Senator Orrin Hatch, July       17, 1998.      3.  The President's Assertions of Executive and       Attorney/Client Privilege were Valid and Necessary              Any charge by the OIC that the President's assertion       of privileges constitutes an abuse of power is equally baseless. The White       House advanced claims of privilege only sparingly and as a last resort to       protect the core constitutional and institutional interests of this and       future presidencies. Inpursuing his attack on the institution of the Presidency,       the OIC took the extreme position that executive privilege was inapplicable       and that the governmental attorney-client privilege did not exist in the       face of grand jury subpoena. The OIC now seeks to penalize the President       for disagreeing with its interpretations of the law, despite the fact that       the courts (and the Department of Justice) both also disagreed with the       OIC.              A.  The President Followed the Advice of White         House   Counsel Regarding the Assertion of Official Privileges        A necessary component of the OIC's abuse of power         allegation is that the President initiated the White House's claims of         privilege -- both executive and attorney-client -- with intent to impede         the OIC's investigation. The record completely refutes this premise.         The privilege issue initially arose when the OIC         served on Bruce Lindsey, Assistant to the President and Deputy Counsel,         a subpoena seeking his testimony before the grand jury. Declaration of         Charles F.C. Ruff (""Ruff Dec."") ¶ 31. Prior to Mr. Lindsey's         appearance, the White House Counsel met with the OIC to discuss privilege         issues and to ask the OIC to describe with particularity possible areas         of inquiry to determine whether they would encompass privileged information.          Id . ¶ 32. The OIC declined to discuss this issue, and later         stated that it intended to question Mr. Lindsey on areas implicating a         wide array of privileges because it believed that executive and attorney-client         privileges were inapplicable to information relating to the Lewinsky investigation.          Id . ¶¶ 32-34. The White House offered,in good faith,         to provide the OIC with any factual testimony regarding the Lewinsky investigation.          Id . ¶¶ 45-50. The OIC rejected this offer.  Id .         ¶ 51.        Instead, the OIC suddenly filed motions to compel         the testimony of Mr. Lindsey and other senior staff.  Id . After         careful deliberations, the White House Counsel notified the President         of the privilege issue, explained the failed accommodation effort, and         recommended that he invoke privilege. As he did in every instance, the         President accepted the White House Counsel's recommendation and authorized         the Counsel to make the claim of privilege.  Id . ¶ 56. Thus,         the President's decision to claim privilege was never the result of his         own initiative, but of his Counsel's advice.                      B.  The President's Executive Privilege Assertions       Were Upheld by the Court                   To put the OIC's apparent abuse of power charges         in context, it is important to recognize that the OIC took the extraordinary         position that executive privilege was inapplicable in the face of a grand         jury subpoena and that it therefore was entitled to immediate and full         disclosure of all strategic and political communication among the President's         most senior advisors. This position was squarely at odds with the law         of the Supreme Court, and of course, the D.C. Circuit. Executive privilege         is constitutionally-based and covers communications relating to the President's         official duties and the effective functioning of the executive branch.         It ensures that the President receives frank and candid advice and recommendations,which         ultimately fosters more informed and effective decision-making.        Here, the President asserted executive privilege         over communications that relate to matters that affect the performance         of his official duties.  In re Grand Jury Proceedings , 1998 U.S.         Dist. Lexis 7736, *7 (D.D.C. 1998); Ruff Dec. ¶¶ 16-30. Indeed,         some of these communications related to the President's decision whether         to invoke privilege over other communications.  Id . ¶¶         26-28.        Rather than acknowledge the presumptively privileged         nature of the information, the OIC maintained that the privilege was inapplicable         and that it did not have to demonstrate any need for the information.         Chief Judge Johnson rejected the OIC's position holding that the communications         were presumptively privileged.  In re Grand Jury Proceedings , 1998         U.S. Dist. Lexis at *3-10. The Court then required the OIC to make a showing         that its need for the information was sufficient to overcome the privilege.          Id . at * 13-21. Although the Court concluded that the OIC had met         its burden, the Court at no time even suggested that the President's assertion         of executive privilege was groundless, improper, or made in bad faith.         In those circumstances, it cannot seriously be argued that assertion of         the privilege was an abuse of power.                  C.  The President's Assertion of the Attorney-Client       Privilege was Solidly Grounded in the Law of this Circuit                   For centuries, the law has recognized the attorney-client         privilege as absolute in protecting the confidentiality of communications         between lawyers and their clients. The D.C. Circuit has also recognized         that the attorney-client privilege protects confidential communications         between government lawyers and officials.  E.g.   Mead Data Control,         Inc.  v.  Dep't of the Air Force , 566 F.2d 242 (D.C. Cir. 1977).         Courts recognize that a government official, like any other citizen, must         be able to provide information to and seek advice from government lawyers         without fear of public disclosure. Ultimately, the privilege serves an         important governmental function by fostering well-advised and fully-informed         decision-making. The possibility that those communications may be disclosed         will forfeit the benefits the privilege was intended to protect.         Despite the law in the D.C. Circuit recognizing         the attorney-client privilege in the governmental context, the Independent         Counsel pushed to breach the bonds of the governmental attorney-client         privilege. Unlike his predecessors, who have respected the professional         obligation of government attorneys to provide confidential legal advice         on official matters, the Independent Counsel has insisted that government         attorneys and clients do not have the right to discuss legal issues in         confidence. In this context, the White House'sassertion of the attorney-client         privilege was not only appropriate, but it was an ethical and institutional         obligation.        Prior to the D.C. Circuit litigation, the OIC was         well aware that the White House fundamentally disagreed with the OIC regarding         the applicability and scope of the governmental attorney-client privilege.         In the Eighth Circuit, the OIC had attempted to obtain a White House lawyer's         notes that reflected confidential communications.  In re Grand Jury         Subpoena Duces Tecum , 112 F.3d 910 (8 th  Cir. 1997). At         the time of that litigation, which the White House resisted and the OIC         won, there was no authority rejecting the existence of a governmental         attorney-client privilege.         Two years later, the OIC, in the Lewinsky investigation,         sought to compel the disclosure of confidential communications between         the President and his official lawyers in which legal advice was either         being sought by or provided to the President regarding official matters.         In view of the law of the D.C. Circuit, which recognized an absolute governmental         attorney-client privilege, the White House Counsel recommended, and the         President asserted, the privilege.         A recent Supreme Court ruling that rejected the         OIC's sweeping attack on the attorney-client privilege provided additional         support for the President's position. In  Swidler & Berlin v. United         States , ___U.S.___ (1998); 1998 U.S. Lexis 4214 (1998), the OIC argued         that the personal attorney-client privilege should automatically give         way to the needs of acriminal investigation. The Court rejected the OIC's         position and stated that ""there is no case authority for the proposition         that the privilege applies differently in criminal and civil cases,""          id . at *7, supporting the principle that the privilege remains         absolute in a grand jury context. Accordingly, the President's position         on the applicability of the privilege in this context had a substantial         basis in the decisions of both this Circuit and the Supreme Court.        Undaunted, the OIC argued that, based upon the non-binding         Eighth Circuit opinion, the governmental attorney-client privilege is         inapplicable in a grand jury context. 112 F.3d 910 (8 th  Cir.         1997). From an institutional standpoint, the OIC's position stripped the         President of any ability to obtain confidential advice from government         lawyers about official matters in the event that the OIC made a referral         to Congress for possible impeachment hearings. In an impeachment context,         the President is entitled to rely on Counsel's Office lawyers to provide         critical legal guidance. Without the ability to receive such confidential         advice, he is left without any legal guidance regarding the conduct of         his official duties.        The District Court rejected the OIC's position and         held that the President had a valid, though qualified, governmental attorney-client         privilege.  In re Grand Jury Proceedings , 1998 U.S. Dist. Lexis         at *21-52. Performing a need analysis similar to executive privilege,         the Court balanced the President's interests against those of the grand         jury and ultimatelydetermined that the grand jury was entitled to the         information. Once again, the District Court did not suggest that the privilege         claim was spurious or made in bad faith.         On appeal, a divided D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals         ruled that the President had an attorney-client privilege with White House         Counsel in some contexts, but not this one.  In re: Bruce R. Lindsey ,         1998 U.S. App. Lexis 17066, *7-43 (D.C. Cir. 1998). Judge David Tatel,         whose dissenting opinion in the Court of Appeals' decision in  Swidler         & Berlin  was adopted by the Supreme Court, dissented here as well.         Consistent with his analysis in  Swidler & Berlin , Judge Tatel         found that the Court's opinion did not account for ""the unique nature         of the Presidency, its unique need for confidential legal advice, or the         possible consequences of abrogating the attorney-client privilege for         a President's ability to obtain such advice.""  Id . at *54.         Judge Tatel's recognition of the validity of the absolute nature of the         privilege and the President's need to assert this and belies the notion         that the assertion was in any way an abuse of power.         The OIC's apparent argument that the assertions         of privilege were for purposes of delay lacks any evidentiary support         and, more significantly, overlooks the OIC's own dilatory conduct. After         Mr. Lindsey was subpoenaed and  before  he was scheduled to testify,         the Office of the President attempted to avoid litigating these issues         by reaching an accommodation that would provide the OIC with access to         the information to which it was entitled while maintaining the legitimate         confidentialityinterests of the President.  Id . ¶¶ 31-32.         The OIC rejected those efforts and instead filed its motion to compel.          Id . ¶51. The OIC has continued to reject any attempt by the         White House to compromise, choosing instead to litigate these issues.         The Office of the President has sought to avoid any delay by agreeing         to expedited briefing schedules involving privilege litigation, and the         courts, appreciating the time-sensitivity of the issues, have ruled swiftly         on these matters.         In any event, any delay that might have been caused         by the White House had no substantive impact on the OIC's investigation.         Privilege claims have been advanced as to only a narrow portion of the         testimony of three witnesses. The OIC originally filed motions to compel         the testimony of two senior staff members and one Counsel's Office lawyer.         The litigation only temporarily postponed the testimony of the two senior         staffers; in March, they both appeared before the grand and testified         fully. The privilege assertions ultimately involved the testimony of only         three Counsel's Office lawyers. Each of these individuals has testified         at length regarding any facts they may have possessed about whether the         President had a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. The questions as to which         they asserted privilege were narrow in scope and irrelevant to the matters         being investigated.         Finally, substantial delay in the investigation         has been self-inflicted. The OIC has wandered aimlessly down more alleys         and byways than any federal prosecutor would appropriatelydo. The OIC         has called current and former White House staffers before the grand jury,         and interviewed many others. The OIC has called presidential advisers         before the grand jury four, five and six times; sometimes for only one-         or two-hour sessions. Some witnesses appeared to testify only to find         themselves waiting for hours and then being told to return on another         day. The OIC has also insisted on exploring such irrelevant subjects as         White House contacts with the press, and has required testimony from attorneys         whose primary function was to deal with the OIC. Such actions are highly         unusual, if not unprecedented.                4.  White House Lawyers Played an Appropriate Role       in the Investigation           Finally, the open and lawful efforts of the White       House lawyers to assist White House staff obtain lawyers, to speak with       witnesses and their lawyers, and to provide advice on the ramifications       of the investigation also cannot be considered an abuse of power.                  As a threshold matter, when there is an official nexus       between the duties of the President and an ongoing investigation, which       certainly exists here, it is the duty of government attorneys to represent       their official client. The specter of impeachment loomed from the day the       Lewinsky story broke in the press. Ruff Dec. ¶ 21. Members of the Congress       asserted that the investigation, which drew explosive media, public and       congressional attention, burdened the President's ability to perform his       constitutional and statutory duties. Accordingly,the White House Counsel's       Office lawyers, among others, were responsible for providing the President       and White House officials with informed, candid advice on the issues raised       by the investigation that affected the President's official duties.  Id .       ¶¶ 16-30.           When it suited the OIC's interests, the OIC recognized       the appropriateness of, and relied on, the White House Counsel's efforts.       From the beginning of this investigation, the OIC sought -- and received       -- the cooperation of the White House lawyers in setting up interviews and       grand jury appearances of current and former White House employees. The       OIC, however, refused to allow the White House lawyers to represent even       the most junior, uninvolved witnesses. Thus, all White House officials,       from the most senior to the most junior, were required to obtain private       counsel. White House lawyers also provided relevant documents to witnesses'       attorneys to ensure complete and accurate testimony, provided privilege       instructions and guidance, and followed-up afterwards to discuss an individual's       interview or grand jury appearance and any outstanding issues. All of the       Counsel's Office activities were well-known to the OIC, and no objection       was ever voiced.      Lastly, it was not uncommon for the White House to       be faced with inaccurate and spurious stories that seemed to be coming from       the OIC or ""sources close to the OIC"" shortly after a witness       testified or was interviewed by the prosecution. Indeed, Judge Johnson examined       media reports, and concluded that theycontained grand jury material and       that there was evidence that the OIC as the source.  In re Grand Jury       Proceedings , Misc. No. 98-55 (D.D.C. June 19, 1998), Mem. Op. at 6.       Accordingly, Judge Johnson held that this evidence established a prima facie       case that the OIC had violated Rule 6(e) and ordered the OIC to appear to       show cause why it should not be held in contempt for Rule 6(e) violations.       These leaks created a deluge of press inquiries to the White House; not       surprisingly, White House Counsel lawyers were required to gather information       and advise senior staff concerning the appropriate response to these inquiries.    VII.  ALLEGATIONS OF PERJURY 21                  The OIC cannot make out even a colorable claim of perjury.     If answers are truthful or literally truthful but misleading,  there       is   no   perjury  as a matter of law, no matter how misleading     the testimony is or is intended to be. The law simply does not require the     witness to aid his interrogator. The Referral seeks to punish the President     for being unhelpful to those trying to destroy him politically.                     A.  The Law of Perjury           Perjury requires proof that a defendant, while under       oath, knowingly made a false statement as to material facts. 22           See ,  e.g. ,  United States v. Dunnigan , 507 U.S.       87, 94 (1993). The ""knowingly"" requirement is a high burden: the       government must prove the defendant had a subjective awareness of the falsity       of his statement at the time he provided it.  See ,  e.g. ,  United       States v. Dowdy , 479 F.2d 213, 230 (4th Cir. 1973);  United States       v. Markiewicz , 978 F.2d 786, 811 (2d Cir. 1992). It is beyond debate       that false testimony provided as a result of confusion, mistake, faulty       memory, carelessness, misunderstanding, mistaken conclusions, unjustified       inferences testified to negligently, or even recklessness does  not        satisfy the ""knowingly"" element.  See ,  e.g. ,  Dunnigan ,       507 U.S. at 94;  United States v. Dean , 55 F.3d 640, 659 (D.C. Cir.       1995);  see   also  Department of Justice Manual, 1997 Supplement,       at 9-69.214.      Moreover, it is of course clear that a statement must       be false in order to constitute perjury. It is equally beyond debate that       the following types of answers are not capable of being false and are therefore       by definition non-perjurious: literally truthful answers that imply facts       that are not true,  see ,  e.g. ,  United States v. Bronston ,       409 U.S. 352, 358 (1973), truthful answers to questions that are not asked,        see ,  e.g. ,  United States v. Corr , 543 F.2d 1042, 1049       (2d Cir. 1976), and failures to correct misleading impressions.  See ,        e.g. ,  United States v. Earp , 812 F.2d 917, 919 (4th Cir. 1987).       The SupremeCourt has made abundantly clear that it is not relevant for perjury       purposes whether the witness intends his answer to mislead, or indeed intends       a ""pattern"" of answers to mislead, if the answers are truthful       or literally truthful.       Thus, in explaining the law of perjury, the Supreme       Court and numerous lower federal courts have set forth three clear standards.       First, answers to questions under oath that are literally true, but unresponsive       to the questions asked, do not, as a matter of law, fall under the scope       of the federal perjury statute. That is so even if the witness intends to       mislead his questioner by his answer and even if the answer is false by       ""negative implication."" The second clear rule is that answers       to questions that are fundamentally ambiguous cannot, as a matter of law,       be perjurious. Finally, a perjury conviction under 18 U.S.C. § 1621       cannot rest solely on the testimony of a single witness, and, at the very       least as a matter of practice, no reasonable prosecutor would bring any       kind of perjury case based on the testimony of one witness without independent       corroboration - especially if the witness is immunized, or has  any        question as to credibility or truthfulness. As the Supreme Court has made       clear, a perjury case ""ought not to rest entirely upon `an oath against       an oath.'""  United States v. Weiler , 323 U.S. 606, 608-09 (1945).            1.  Bronston and ""Literal Truth. ""           In  United States v. Bronston , 409 U.S. 352       (1973), the leading case on the law of perjury, the United States Supreme       Court addressed ""whether a witness may be convicted of perjury for       an answer, under oath, that is literally true but not responsive to the       question asked and arguably misleading by negative implication.""  Id .       at 352. The Court directly answered the question ""no."" It made       absolutely clear that a literally truthful answer cannot constitute perjury,       no matter how much the witness intended by his answer to mislead.      Bronston  involved testimony taken under oath       at a bankruptcy hearing. At the hearing, the sole owner of a bankrupt corporation       was asked questions about the existence and location of both his personal       assets and the assets of his corporation. The owner testified as follows:             Q: Do you have any bank accounts in Swiss banks,         Mr. Bronston?        A: No, sir.                 Q: Have you ever?        A: The company had an account there for about six         months in Zurich.        Q: Have you any nominees who have bank accounts         in Swiss banks?        A: No, sir.        Q: Have you ever?        A: No, sir.                 Id . at 354. The government later proved that       Bronston did in fact have a personal Swiss bank account that was terminated       prior to his testimony. The government prosecuted Bronston ""on the       theory that in order to mislead his questioner, [Bronston] answered the       second question with literal truthfulness butunresponsively addressed his       answer to the company's assets and not to his own--thereby implying that       he had no personal Swiss bank account at the relevant time.""  Id .       at 355.           The Supreme Court unanimously rejected this theory       of perjury. It assumed for purposes of its holding that the questions referred       to Bronston's personal bank accounts and not his company's assets. Moreover,       the Court stated, Bronston's ""answer to the crucial question was not       responsive,"" and indeed ""an implication in the second answer to       the second question [is] that there was never a personal bank account.""        Id . at 358. The Court went so far as to note that Bronston's answers       ""were not guileless but were shrewdly calculated to evade.""  Id .       at 361. However, the Court emphatically held that implications alone do       not rise to the level of perjury, and that Bronston therefore could not       have committed perjury. ""[W]e are not dealing with casual conversation       and the statute does not make it a criminal act for a witness to willfully       state any material matter that implies any material matter that he does       not believe to be true.""  Id . at 357-58. The Court took pains       to point out the irrelevance of the witness's intent: ""A jury should       not be permitted to engage in conjecture whether an unresponsive answer,       true and complete on its face, was intended to mislead or divert the examiner.""        Id . at 359.      The Supreme Court in  Bronston  provided several       rationales for its holding that literally true, non-responsive answers are       by definition non-perjurious, regardless of theirimplications. First, the       Court noted that the burden always rests squarely on the interrogator to       ask precise questions, and that a witness is under no obligation to assist       the interrogator in that task. The Court ""perceive[d] no reason why       Congress would intend the drastic sanction of a perjury prosecution to cure       a testimonial mishap that could readily have been reached with a single       additional question by counsel alert - as every counsel ought to be--to       the incongruity of petitioner's unresponsive answer.""  Id . at       359. Moreover, the Court noted that because of the adversarial process,       perjury is an extraordinary sanction that is almost always unwarranted,       since ""a prosecution for perjury is not the sole, or even the primary       safeguard against errant testimony.""  Id . at 360. The perjury       statute cannot be invoked ""simply because a wily witness succeeds in       derailing the questioner - so long as the witness speaks the literal truth.""        Id .      Bronston  is just one of scores of cases across       the federal circuits that make clear that the definition of perjury must       be carefully limited because perjury prosecutions are dangerous to the public       interest since they ""discourage witnesses from appearing or testifying.""        Id . at 359. 23    For instance,       in United States v. Earp , 812 F.2d 917 (4th Cir. 1987), the defendant,       a member of the Ku Klux Klan, had stood guard during the attempted burning       of a cross on the lawn of an interracial couple, and further evidence demonstrated       that he had personally engaged in other attempts to burn crosses. During       questioning before a grand jury, however, he denied ever having burned crosses       on anyone's lawn. He was convicted of perjury, but the United States Court       of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed his conviction, because ""like       the witness in  Bronston , [the defendant's] answers were literally       true although his second answer was unresponsive.""  Id . at 919.       That is, the defendant had not actually succeeded in his cross-burning attempts,       so it was literally true that he had never burned crosses on anyone's lawn.       The court noted that ""while he no doubt knew full well that he had       on that occasion tried to burn a cross, he was not specifically asked either       about any attempted cross burnings.""  Id . Literally every federal       court of appeals in the nation concurs in this reading of  Bronston . 24                    2. Fundamentally Ambiguous Questions Cannot Produce       Perjurious Answers.           When a question or a line of questioning is ""fundamentally       ambiguous,"" the answers to the questions posed are insufficient as       a matter of law to support a perjury conviction.""  See ,  e.g. ,        United States v. Finucan , 708 F.2d 838, 848 (1st Cir. 1983);  United       States v. Lighte , 782 F.2d 367, 375 (2d Cir. 1986);  United States       v. Tonelli , 577 F.2d 194, 199 (3d Cir. 1978);  United States v. Bell ,       623 F.2d 1132, 1337 (5th Cir. 1980);  United States v. Wall , 371 F.2d       398, 400 (6th Cir. 1967);  United States v. Williams , 552 F.2d 226,       229 (8th Cir. 1977). In other words, when there is more than one way of       understanding the meaning of a question, and the witness has answered truthfully       as to his understanding, he cannot commit perjury. Many courts have emphasized       that ""defendants may not be assumed into the penitentiary"" by       ""sustain[ing] a perjury charge based on [an] ambiguous line of questioning.""        Tonelli , 577 F.2d at 199.      United States v. Lattimore , 127 F. Supp. 405       (D.D.C. 1955), is the key case dealing with ambiguous questions in the perjury       context. In  Lattimore , a witness was questioned before the Senate       Internal Security Subcommittee about his ties to the Communist party. He       was asked whether he was a ""follower of the Communist line,"" and       whether he had been a ""promoter of Communist interests."" He answered       ""no"" to both questions, and was subsequently indicted for committing       perjury. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia found       that the witness could not be indicted on ""charges so formless and       obscure as those before the Court.""  Id . at 413. The court held       that ""'follower of the Communist line' is not a phrase with a meaning       about which men of ordinary intellect could agree, nor one which could be       used with mutual understanding by a questioner and answerer unless it were       defined at the time it were sought and offered as testimony.""  Id .       at 110. As the court explained further:            [The phrase] has no universally accepted definition.         The Government has defined it in one way and seeks to impute its definition         to the defendant. Defendant has declined to adopt it, offering a definition         of his own. It would not necessitate great ingenuity to think up definitions         differing from those offered either by the Government or defendant. By         groundless surmise only could the jury determine which definition defendant         had in mind.                  Id . at 109.      Many other cases stand for the proposition that a       witness cannot commit perjury by answering an inherently ambiguous question.       For instance, in  United States v. Wall , 371F.2d 398 (6th Cir. 1967),       a witness was asked whether she had ""been on trips with Mr. X,""       and she answered ""no."" The government could prove that in fact       the witness, who was from Oklahoma City, had been in Florida with ""Mr.       X."" However, the government could not prove that the witness had traveled       from Oklahoma City to Florida with ""Mr. X."" The court noted (and       the government conceded) that the phrase ""been on trips"" could       mean at least two different things: ""That a person accompanied somebody       else travelling with, or it can mean that they were there at a particular       place with a person."" The court then stated that ""[t]he trouble       with this case is that the question upon which the perjury charge was based       was inarticulately phrased, and, as admitted by the prosecution, was susceptible       of two different meanings. In our opinion, no charge of perjury can be based       upon an answer to such a question.""  Id . at 399-400.           Similarly, in  United States v. Tonelli , 577       F.2d 194 (3d Cir. 1978), the defendant answered negatively a question whether       he had ""handled any pension fund checks."" The government then       proved that the defendant had actually handled the transmission of pension       fund checks by arranging for others to send, mail, or deliver the checks.       The government charged the defendant with perjury. The court held that perjury       could not result from the government's ambiguous question. The court explained:       It is clear that the defendant interpreted the prosecutor's       questions about `handling' to mean `touching' . . . To sustain a perjury       charge based on the ambiguous line of questioning here would require us       to assume [defendant]interpreted `handle' to include more than `touching.'       The record will not allow us to do so and as the Court of Appeals for the       Fifth Circuit has observed `[e]specially in perjury cases defendants may       not be assumed into the penitentiary.            United States v. Bell , 623 F.2d 1132, 1137       (5th Cir. 1980), is yet another example of this doctrine. In  Bell ,       a witness was asked before a grand jury, ""Whether personal or business       do you have records that are asked for in the subpoena,"" and the witness       answered, ""No, sir, I do not."" It was later established that the       witness's files clearly contained relevant records. Nonetheless, the court       held that the question was ambiguous, and therefore incapable of yielding       a perjurious answer. The witness interpreted the question to ask whether       he had brought the records with him that day, and not whether he had any       records anywhere else in the world. 25                       3. A Perjury Case Must Not Be Based Solely Upon the       Testimony of a Single Witness.           The law is clear that in a perjury prosecution under       18 U.S.C. § 1621, the falsity of a statement alleged to be perjurious       cannot be established by the testimony of just one witness. This ancient       common law rule, referred to as the ""two-witness rule,"" has survived       repeated challenges to its legitimacy, and has been judicially recognized       as the standard of proof for perjury prosecutions brought under § 1621.        See ,  e.g. ,  Weiler v. United States , 323 U.S. 606, 608-610       (1945) (discussing the history and policy rationales of the two-witness       rule);  United States v. Chaplin , 25 F.3d 1373, 1377-78 (7th Cir.       1994) (two-witness rule applies to perjury prosecutions). The Department       of Justice recognizes the applicability of the two-witness rule to perjury       prosecutions brought under § 1621.  See  Department of Justice       Manual, 1997 Supplement, at 9-69.265.       The crux of the two-witness rule is that ""the       falsity of a statement alleged to be perjurious must be established either       by the testimony of two  independent  witnesses, or by one witness       and  independent  corroborating evidence which is inconsistent with       the innocence of the accused."" Department of Justice Manual, 1997 Supplement,       at 9-69.265 (emphasis in original). The second witness must give testimony       independent of the first which, if believed, would ""prove that what       the accused said under oath was false.""  Id .;  United States       v. Maultasch , 596F.2d 19, 25 (2d Cir. 1979). Alternatively, the independent       corroborating evidence must be inconsistent with the innocence of the accused       and ""of a quality to assure that a guilty verdict is solidly founded.""       Department of Justice Manual, 1997 Supplement, at 9-69.265;  United States       v. Forrest , 639 F.2d 1224, 1226 (5th Cir. 1981). It is therefore clear       that a perjury conviction under § 1621 cannot lie where there is no        independent  second witness who corroborates the first, or where there       is no  independent  evidence that convincingly contradicts the testimony       of the accused.      While 18 U.S.C. § 1623 does not incorporate the       ""two-witness rule,"" it is nonetheless clear from the case law       that perjury prosecutions require a high degree of proof, and that prosecutors       should not, as a matter of reason and practicality, even try to bring perjury       prosecutions based solely on the testimony of a single witness. In  Weiler       v. United States , 323 U.S. 606, 608-09 (1945), the United States Supreme       Court observed that ""[t]he special rule which bars conviction for perjury       solely upon the evidence of a single witness is deeply rooted in past centuries.""       The Court further observed that ""equally honest witnesses may well       have differing recollections of the same event,"" and hence "" a       conviction for perjury ought not to rest entirely upon `an oath against       an oath .'""  Id . at 609 (emphasis added). Indeed, the common       law courts in seventeenth-century England  required  the testimony       of two witnesses as a precondition to a perjury conviction, when the testimony       of a single witnesswas in almost all other cases sufficient.  See         Chaplin , 25 F.3d at 1377,  citing  Wigmore on Evidence §       2040(a), at 359-60 (Chadbourne rev. 1978). The common law courts actually       adopted the two-witness rule from the Court of Star Chamber, which had followed       the practice of the ecclesiastical courts of requiring two witnesses in       perjury cases.  Id . The English rationale for the rule is as resonant       today as it was in the seventeenth century: ""[I]n all other criminal       cases the accused could not testify, and thus one oath for the prosecution       was in any case something as against nothing; but on a charge of perjury       the accused's oath was always in effect evidence and thus, if but one witness       was offered, there would be merely . . . an oath against an oath.""        Id . And, as noted above, no perjury case should rest merely upon       ""an oath against an oath.""            B.  The Jones Deposition           Without knowledge of the OIC's specific allegations       it is impossible to address why any particular claim of perjury fails although       we are confident that no colorable claim of perjury can be made out. However,       illegal leaks and speculation make clear that there are certain misperceptions       about this testimony that can immediately be laid to rest. For example,             Allegation : The President falsely testified         in his  Jones  deposition that he was never alone with Ms. Lewinsky.                         Not so. The President acknowledged in his deposition       that he met with Ms. Lewinsky on up to five occasions while she worked at       the White House. (p. 50). He then referred back to that testimonywhen asked       if he ever was alone with her in the Oval Office (p. 52), and again when       asked whether he was alone with her in any room in the White House. (p.       59). The  Jones  lawyers did not follow up and ask the President to       describe the nature of any physical contact that may have occurred on these       occasions.                  Allegation : The President falsely testified         in his  Jones  deposition that he never had any improper physical         contact of any kind with Ms. Lewinsky.                   Not so. The President was asked whether he had ""an       extramarital sexual affair"" with Ms. Lewinsky (p. 78) and responded       that he did not. That term was undefined and ambiguous. The President understood       the term ""sexual affair"" to involve a relationship involving sexual       intercourse. He had no such relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.           The President also was asked whether he had ""sexual       relations"" with Ms. Lewinsky, ""as that term is defined in Deposition       Exhibit 1, as modified by the Court."" (p. 59). The Court explicitly       directed the President's attention to Definition Number 1 on Exhibit 1,       which the President had circled.       The President denied he had ""sexual relations""       with Ms. Lewinsky under this definition. Although the President's counsel,       Mr. Bennett, had invited the Jones lawyers to ask specific questions about       the President's conduct--""Why don't they ask the President what he       did, what he didn't do, and then we can argue in Court later about what       it means?"" (p. 21)--the Jones lawyers declined to do so, relying instead       on the definition. The President was not asked any specific questions at       all abouthis physical contact with Ms. Lewinsky, and in particular he was       not pointedly asked whether he had engaged in any of the conduct  outside        the definition provided. The President's testimony in response to these       questions was accurate. He did not have sexual intercourse with Ms. Lewinsky       or otherwise engage in sexual conduct covered by the definition, as provided       by plaintiff and narrowed by the Court.      The President also testified in the  Jones  deposition       that Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit, in which she stated she had never had a ""sexual       relationship"" with the President, was accurate (p. 204). He believed       this testimony to be truthful. The term ""sexual relationship""       was not defined in the affidavit or in the deposition. The definition of       the different term ""sexual relations"" utilized by the Jones lawyers       did not apply to that question. The term ""sexual relationship,""       like sexual affair, has no definitive meaning. To the President, that term       reasonably requires sexual intercourse as a necessary component of the relationship.       Since his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky did not involve intercourse, he       truthfully answered that the affidavit was accurate.             Allegation : The President falsely testified         in his  Jones  deposition that his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky         was the same as that with any other White House intern.                Not so. The President's answers left no doubt that       he had a special relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. He acknowledged knowing       how she had gotten her internship at the White House. He acknowledged meeting       with her and knowing where she worked afterleaving the White House. He acknowledged       exchanging small gifts with her. He acknowledged that he knew she was moving       to New York and that her mother had moved there. He acknowledged knowing       about her job search in New York, and that she had had an interview with       (then) U.N. Ambassador Bill Richardson. He acknowledged that Mr. Jordan       reported on his meeting with Ms. Lewinsky about her New York job search.       He acknowledged receiving cards and notes from her through Ms. Betty Currie.       The  Jones  lawyers received affirmative responses to particular questions.       Had they opted to ask precise questions on other matters, they would have       received truthful responses. They did not do so.    VIII.   THE LEWINSKY EXPANSION OF THE WHITEWATER INVESTIGATION              The expansion of the Independent Counsel's jurisdiction       to encompass the  Jones  case and Ms. Lewinsky did not occur by accident       or easily. The OIC deliberately and purposefully sought this expansion on       an emergency basis. Media accounts that the Attorney General herself requested       this expansion are highly misleading.      On January 16, 1998, upon the OIC's request, the Special       Division of the Court of Appeals for the Purpose of Appointing Independent       Counsels expanded the OIC's jurisdiction to allow it to investigate ""whether       Monica Lewinsky or others suborned perjury, obstructed justice, intimidated       witnesses, or otherwise violated federal law . . . in dealing with witnesses,       potential witnesses, attorneys, or others concerning the civilcase  Jones       v. Clinton ."" Order, Div. No. 94-1 (Jan. 16, 1998) (Div. for Purpose       of Appointing Independent Counsel) (D.C. Cir.). The series of events that       led to this expansion of authority raise serious questions as to the motivations       and manipulations of the OIC in securing this expanded jurisdiction.       Under the Independent Counsel statute, if the ""independent       counsel discovers or receives information about possible violations of criminal       law by [covered persons], which are not covered by the prosecutorial jurisdiction       of the independent counsel, the independent counsel may submit such information       to the Attorney General."" 28 U.S.C. § 593 (c)(2)(A). The Attorney       General is then to conduct a preliminary investigation. 28 U.S.C. §       592. The statute did not give the OIC authority to conduct its own preliminary       investigation in order to gather or create evidence to present to the Attorney       General to support a request for an expansion of jurisdiction.      According to media reports, Ms. Linda Tripp contacted       the OIC on Monday, January 12, 1998. There was no particular logic to this       contact, and she could easily have taken her concerns to state or federal       authorities. In any event, the OIC arranged for Ms. Tripp to wear an F.B.I.       recording device and tape surreptitiously a conversation that she had with       Ms. Lewinsky the next day, Tuesday, January 13, 1998 (Ms. Lewinsky had not       yet filed an affidavit in the  Jones  case). On Friday, January 16,       1998, at the OIC's request, Ms. Tripp lured Ms. Lewinsky to a meeting, where       she was apprehended by OIC agents,who confronted her and attempted to pressure       her into doing surreptitious taping herself. She was informed that an immunity       agreement was contingent on her  not  contacting her lawyer. 26              That same day, the Special Division agreed to expand       the OIC's authority, based upon the Independent Counsel's earlier application       to the Attorney General and on the tapes that the OIC had already created:       ""In a taped conversation with a cooperating witness, Ms. Lewinsky states       that she intends to lie when deposed. In the same conversation, she urges       the cooperating witness to lie in her own upcoming deposition. . . . Independent       Counsel Starr has requested that this matter be referred to him."" (Text       of Attorney General's Petition to Special Division, The Associated Press,       January 29, 1998.)      The Independent Counsel later suggested that the expansion       of authority prior to the taping was unnecessary, as it was already within       his jurisdiction. However, the Lewinsky matter had no connection whatsoever       to the Whitewater activities, or any other activities, then being investigated       by the OIC. In addition, the Attorney General specifically stated in her       referral to the Special Division that she was seeking an  expansion        of the Independent Counsel's jurisdiction. Or, as former independent counsel       Michael Zeldin pointed out, ""If he had jurisdiction to investigate       it when he wired her, why did he have to go to court to get it afterward?       In some ways, he is talking out of both sides of his mouth. . . . It seems       to me arguablethat he obtained evidence unlawfully . . . ."" Chicago       Tribune, January 25, 1998. And former independent counsel Lawrence Walsh       declared, ""A prosecutor has no business getting into that case [Paula       Jones] unless there's something terrible happening. I question Starr's judgment       in going into it so hard."" Chicago Tribune, January 25, 1998.      Furthermore, the sequence of events suggests that       Independent Counsel Starr deliberately delayed requesting the expansion       of jurisdiction. Neither Monica Lewinsky nor President Clinton had made       any statements under oath in the  Jones  case (at least that had been       filed with any court) when Linda Tripp approached the OIC on January 12.       The only evidence the OIC possessed at that time were tapes illegally created       by Tripp. The OIC itself proceeded to tape the Tuesday, January 13 conversation       between Tripp and Lewinsky. Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit was not filed in the        Jones  case until January 16, and the OIC had petitioned the Attorney       General the day  before  for an expansion of authority based on the       evidence (the Tripp tapes and the OIC's tape) that he had acquired without       any authority to do so.      Ms. Tripp remained through the day at the hotel where       Ms. Lewinsky was apprehended by the OIC on Friday, January 16, 1998. 27          During that day, Ms. Jones' lawyers repeatedly tried to contact Ms.       Tripp for a meeting, but she was unavailable.  Ibid . Late in the afternoon,       when it became clear that Ms. Lewinsky would not cooperate in the surreptitious       taping of others, the Jones lawyers received a call arranging a meeting       with Ms. Tripp for that night, so she could help them prepare for the President's       deposition next day.  Ibid . 28          It seems probable that Ms. Tripp, who was acting as the OIC's agent under       an immunity agreement, must have gotten approval for this briefing from       the OIC. Ms. Tripp met with the Jones lawyers at her home in Maryland that       night and briefed them on the illegal tapes she had made of Ms. Lewinsky 29         , so they could use the contents of those tapes in their questioning       of the President. 30    Ms. Tripp isunder       investigation in the state of Maryland because she secretly recorded Ms.       Lewinsky and then shared the existence and contents of those tapes with       the Jones lawyers. It is a crime in that state, punishable by imprisonment       up to five years and a fine of up to $10,000, for a person to ""wilfully""       record a conversation without the consent of both parties or to ""wilfully""       disclose the contents of such an illegally recorded conversation. Md. Code       Ann. § 10-402 (1997). 31               On January 17, armed with the information obtained       from Ms. Tripp, Ms. Jones' attorneys deposed President Clinton in great       detail regarding Ms. Lewinsky. At about this time, the OIC sought to prevent       press coverage of its attempt to have Ms. Lewinsky cooperate in secret taping. 32                     This entire sequence of events--the OIC's delay in requesting     jurisdiction, the OIC's pressure on reporters to withhold public disclosure     of the matter, 33    the OIC'sunwillingness     to permit Ms. Lewinsky to contact her lawyer, and the OIC's dispatch of Ms.     Tripp to brief the Jones lawyers about the fruits of her illegal taping the     day before they were to depose the President--suggests an intention by the     OIC to ensure that the expansion of jurisdiction was kept a secret until the     President and Ms. Lewinsky had given testimony under oath and (if Ms. Lewinsky     could be so persuaded) she had been enlisted to do surreptitious taping. In     other words, rather than taking steps to defer or avoid any possible interference     with the  Jones  case, the OIC did everything in its power--and some     things outside its authority--to set up a case against the President.          1     2 Max   Farrand,  The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787  550 (Rev. ed.   1966).  2     See   Raoul Berger,  Impeachment: The Constitutional Problems , 67-73 (1973).     3     Michael   J.

Supp. 2d 249, 251-54 (S.D.N.Y.   1998) (noting that ""[c]ases involving prosecutions for document destruction   during civil pre-trial discovery are notably absent from the extensive body   of reported § 1503 case law,"" and that ""there are a great many   good reasons why federal prosecutors should be reluctant to bring criminal charges   relating to conduct in ongoing civil litigation,"" but concluding that systematic   destruction of documents sought during discovery should satisfy § 1503).  20     The   term ""talking points"" refers to a document apparently provided by   Ms. Lewinsky to Ms. Tripp in January 1998 regarding possible testimony in the    Jones  case.  21     ""Perjury""   was not even in the original grant of jurisdiction to the OIC but reportedly   is now the crux of the OIC's case.  22     There   are two basic federal perjury statutes: 18 U.S.C. § 1621, and 18 U.S.C.   § 1623. Section 1621 applies to all material statements or information   provided under oath ""to a competent tribunal, officer, or person, in any   case in which a law of the United States authorizes an oath to be administered.""   Section 1623, in contrast, applies only to testimony given before a grand jury and other   court proceedings. Although there are differences between the two statutes,   the four basic elements of each are substantially the same.  23     While    Bronston  involved a perjury conviction under the general perjury statute,   18 U.S.C. § 1621, lower federal courts have uniformly relied on it in reviewing   perjury convictions under § 1623(a), which makes it unlawful to make any   false material declaration ""in any proceeding before or ancillary to any   court or grand jury of the United States.""

Mrs. Tripp had already given those tapes to Mr. Starr's investigators.        With the information from Mrs. Tripp,         the Jones lawyers were able to ask Mr. Clinton in his deposition specific         questions about his relationship with and gifts to Miss Lewinsky, according         to a person informed about the President's testimony.""          29     Under   the Maryland electronic surveillance statute, which criminalizes taping without   the consent of both parties, it is a violation of the statute simply to disclose   that an illegal tape has been made, since the term ""Contents"", as   used in the statute to define what may not be disclosed, is defined to include   ""any information concerning the identity of the parties to the communication   or the  existence , substance, purport, or meaning of that communication.""   Md. Code Ann. § 10-401(7) (1997) (emphasis added).  30     There   is no doubt that the Jones lawyers believed they had a significant tactical   advantage due to their knowledge of theTripp tapes. They may also have known   that Ms. Tripp was an OIC agent. After being asked a highly specific series   of questions about Ms. Lewinsky, the President replied, ""I don't even know   what you're talking about, I don't think,"" and one of the Jones lawyers,   James Fisher, responded, ""Sir, I think this will come to light shortly,   and you'll understand"" (p. 85).  31     Recent   news reports indicate that Ms. Tripp was specifically warned at the Radio Shack   store where she brought her tape recorder that it was illegal to tape in Maryland   without the consent of the other party.

Washington, DC  20005       September 11, 1998                           EXECUTIVE SUMMARY          Summary of Key Points of the President's Case in Anticipation of      the Starr Report          The President has acknowledged a serious mistake - an           inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky.  He has           taken responsibility for his actions, and he has apologized           to the country, to his friends, leaders of his party, the           cabinet and most importantly, his family.     This private mistake does not amount to an impeachable           action.  A relationship outside one's marriage is wrong -           and the President admits that.  It is not a high crime or           misdemeanor.  The Constitution specifically states that           Congress shall impeach only for ""treason, bribery or other           high crimes and misdemeanors.""  These words in the           Constitution were chosen with great care, and after           extensive deliberations.     ""High crimes and misdemeanors"" had a fixed meaning to the           Framers of our Constitution - it meant wrongs committed           against our system of government.  The impeachment clause           was designed to protect our country against a President who           was using his official powers against the nation, against           the American people, against our society.  It was never           designed to allow a political body to force a President           from office for a very personal mistake.     Remember -- this report is based entirely on allegations           obtained by a grand jury - reams and reams of allegations           and purported ""evidence""  that would never be admitted in           court, that has never been seen by the President or his           lawyers, and that was not subject to cross-examination or           any other traditional safeguards to ensure its credibility.     Grand juries are not designed to search for truth. They do           not and are not intended to ensure credibility,           reliability, or simple fairness.  They only exist to           accuse.  Yet this is the process that the Independent           Counsel has chosen to provide the ""evidence"" to write his           report.     The law defines perjury very clearly.  Perjury requires           proof that an individual knowingly made a false statement           while under oath.  Answers to questions that are literally           true are not perjury.  Even if an answer doesn't directly           answer the question asked, it is not perjury if it is true          no accused has an obligation to help his accuser.           Answers to fundamentally ambiguous questions also can never           be perjury.  And nobody can be convicted of perjury based           on only one other person's testimony.         The President did not commit perjury.  Most of the illegal             leaks suggesting his testimony was perjurious falsely           describe his testimony.  First of all, the President never           testified in the Jones deposition that he was not alone           with Ms. Lewinsky.  The President never testified that his           relationship with Ms. Lewinsky was the same as with any           other intern.  To the contrary, he admitted exchanging           gifts with her, knowing about her job search, receiving           cards and notes from her, and knowing other details of her           personal life that made it plain he had a special           relationship with her.     The President has admitted he had an improper sexual           relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.  In a civil deposition, he           gave narrow answers to ambiguous questions.  As a matter of           law, those answers could not give rise to a criminal charge           of perjury.  In the face of the President's admission of           his relationship, the disclosure of lurid and salacious           allegations can only be intended to humiliate the President           and force him from office.     There was no obstruction of justice. We believe Betty           Currie testified that Ms. Lewinsky asked her to hold the           gifts and that the President never talked to her about the           gifts.  The President admitted giving and receiving gifts           from Ms. Lewinsky when he was asked about it.  The           President never asked Ms. Lewinsky to get rid of the gifts           and he never asked Ms. Currie to get them.  We believe that           Ms. Currie's testimony supports the President's.     The President never tried to get Ms. Lewinsky a job after           she left the White House in order to influence her           testimony in the Paula Jones case.  The President knew Ms.           Lewinsky was unhappy in her Pentagon job after she left the           White House and did ask the White House personnel office to           treat her fairly in her job search.  He never instructed           anyone to hire her, or even indicated that he very much           wanted it to happen.  Ms. Lewinsky was never offered a job           at the White House after she left - and it's pretty           apparent that if the President had ordered it, she would           have been.     The President did not facilitate Ms. Lewinsky's interview           with Bill Richardson, or her discussions with Vernon           Jordan.  Betty Currie asked John Podesta if he could help           her with her New York job search which led to an interview           with Bill Richardson, and Ms. Currie also put her in touch           with her longtime friend, Mr. Jordan.  Mr. Jordan has made           it clear that this is the case, and, as a private           individual, he is free to offer job advice wherever he sees           fit.     There was no witness tampering. Betty Currie was not           supposed to be a witness in the Paula Jones case. If she           was not called or going to be called, it was impossible for           any conversations the President had with her to be witness           tampering.  The President testified that he did not in any           way attempt to influence her recollection.     There is no ""talking points"" smoking gun.  Numerous illegal           leaks painted the mysterious talking points as the proof           that the President or his staff attempted to suborn the           perjury of Monica Lewinsky or Linda Tripp.  The OIC's           spokesman said that the ""talking points"" were the ""key"" to           Starr even being granted authority to investigate the           President's private life.  Yet in the end, Ms. Lewinsky has           apparently admitted the talking points were written by her           alone [or with Ms. Tripp's assistance], and the President           was not asked one single question about them in his grand           jury appearance.     Invocation of privileges was not an abuse of power.  The           President's lawful assertion of privileges in a court of           law was only made on the advice of his Counsel, and was in           significant measure validated by the courts.  The legal           claims were advanced sparingly and as a last resort after           all attempts at compromise by the White House Counsel's           office were rejected to protect the core constitutional and           institutional interests of this and future presidencies.     Neither the President nor the White House played a role in           the Secret Service's lawful efforts to prevent agents from           testifying to preserve its protective function.  The           President never asked, directed or participated in any           decision regarding the protective function privilege.           Neither did any White House official.  The Treasury and           Justice Departments independently decided to respond to the           historically unprecedented subpoenas of Secret Service           personnel and to pursue the privilege to ensure the           protection of this and future presidents.     The President did not abuse his power by permitting White           House staff to comment on the investigation.  The President           has acknowledged misleading his family, staff and the           country about the nature of his relationship with Ms.           Lewinsky, and he has apologized and asked for forgiveness.           However, this personal failing does not constitute a           criminal abuse of power.  If allowing aides to repeat           misleading statements is a crime, then any number of public           officials are guilty of misusing their office for as long           as they fail to admit wrong doing in response to any           allegation about their activities.     The actions of White House attorneys were completely           lawful.  The White House Counsel attorneys provided the           President and White House officials with informed, candid           advice on issues raised during this investigation that           affected the President's official duties.  This was           especially necessary given the fact that impeachment           proceedings against the President were a possible result of           the OIC's investigation from Day One.  In fact, throughout           the investigation, the OIC relied on the White House           Counsel's office for assistance in gathering information           and arranging interviews and grand jury appearances.  The           Counsel's office's actions were well known to the OIC           throughout the investigation and no objection was ever           voiced.           This means that the OIC report is left with nothing but the      details of a private sexual relationship, told in graphic details      with the intent to embarrass.  Given the flimsy and      unsubstantiated basis for the accusations, there is a complete      lack of any credible evidence to initiate an impeachment inquiry      concerning the President.  And the principal purpose of this      investigation, and the OIC's report, is to embarrass the      President and titillate the public by producing a document that      is little more than an unreliable, one-sided account of sexual      behavior.       Where's Whitewater?  The OIC's allegations reportedly include no      suggestion of wrongdoing by the President in any of the areas      which Mr. Starr spend four years investigating:  Whitewater, the      FBI files and the White House travel office.  What began as an      inquiry into a 24 year old land deal in Arkansas has ended as an      inquest into brief, improper personal encounters between the      President and Monica Lewinsky.  Despite the exhaustive nature of      the OIC's investigation into the Whitewater, FBI files and travel      office matters, and a constant stream of suggestions of      misconduct in the media over a period of years, to this day the      OIC has never exonerated the President or the First Lady of      wrongdoing.                     PRELIMINARY MEMORANDUM CONCERNING                REFERRAL OF OFFICE OF INDEPENDENT COUNSEL            This document is intended to be a preliminary response to     the Referral submitted by the Office of Independent Counsel to The Congress. Because we were denied the opportunity to review the content, nature or specifics of the allegations made against the President by the Office of Independent Counsel (OIC), we do not pretend to offer a point-by-point refutation of those allegations, or a comprehensive defense of the President.              We commend the House of Representatives for the extraordinary steps it has taken to safeguard the secrecy of the OIC's allegations.  Unfortunately, its efforts were thwarted by unnamed sources familiar with the details of the OIC's allegations -- sources that could only come from the OIC itself -- who saw fit to leak elements of the allegations to the news media.              Based on these illegal leaks, as well as our knowledge of the President's testimony, we offer this document as a summary outline of his side of the case.  We will provide you with a specific rebuttal as soon as we have had a chance to review the materials that the OIC has already transmitted to you.              The simple reality of this situation is that the House is being confronted with evidence of a man's efforts to keep an inappropriate relationship private.  A personal failure that the President has acknowledged was wrong, for which he apologized, and for which he accepts complete responsibility.  A personal failure for which the President has sought forgiveness from members of his family, members of the Cabinet, Members of Congress, and the American people. Such a personal failing does not, however, constitute ""treason, bribery and high crimes and misdemeanors"" that would justify the impeachment of the President of the United States.              The President himself has described his conduct as wrong. But no amount of gratuitous details about the President's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, no matter how salacious, can alter the fact that:       The President did not commit perjury:    The President did not obstruct justice;    The President did not tamper with witnesses; and    The President did not abuse the power of his office.                Impeachment is a matter of incomparable gravity.  Even to discuss it is to discuss overturning the electoral will of the people. For this reason, the Framers made clear, and scholars have long agreed, that the power should be exercised only in the event of such grave harms to the state as ""serious assaults on the integrity of the processes of government,"" or ""such crimes as would so stain a president as to make his continuance in office dangerous to public order."" Charles L. Black, Impeachment: A Handbook 38-39 (1974).  We do not believe the OIC can identify any conduct remotely approaching this standard.  Instead, from press reports, if true, it appears that the OIC has dangerously overreached to describe in the most dramatic of terms conduct that not only is not criminal but is actually proper and lawful.              The President has confessed to indiscretions with Ms. Lewinsky and accepted responsibility and blame.  The allegations concerning obstruction, intimidation, perjury and subornation of perjury that we anticipate from the OIC are extravagant attempts to transform a case involving inappropriate personal behavior into one of public misconduct justifying reversal of the judgment of the electorate of this country.     I. STANDARDS FOR IMPEACHMENT               The Constitution provides that the President shall be removed from office only upon ""Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.""  U.S. Const. Art. II, Sect. 4.  Of course, there is no suggestion of treason or bribery present here.  Therefore, the question confronting the House of Representatives is whether the President has committed a ""high Crime[] or Misdemeanor.""  The House has an obligation to consider the evidence in view of that very high Constitutional threshold. It should pursue the impeachment process only if there is evidence implicating that high standard.              The House must approach the question with solemnity and with care, for history teaches that an ""impeachable offense"" is no ordinary kind of wrongdoing.  The Framers included specific provisions for impeachment in the Constitution itself because they understood that the most severe political remedy was necessary to remedy the most serious forms of public wrongdoing.  Impeachment is a basic constitutional safeguard, designed both to correct harms to the system of government itself and to protect the people from ongoing malfeasance.  Nothing less than the gravest executive wrongdoing can justify impeachment.  The Constitution leaves lesser wrongs to the political process and to public opinion.              Presidential impeachment is thus a matter of incomparable gravity.  As Professor Charles Black stated,        [t]he presidency is a prime symbol of our national unity.  The      election of the president (with his alternate, the vice-president)       is the only political act that we perform together as a nation;       voting in the presidential election is certainly the political       choice most significant to the American people, and the      most closely attended to by them.  No matter, then, can be of      higher political importance than our considering whether, in any      given instance, this act of choice is to be undone, and the      chosen president dismissed from office in disgrace.  Everyone      must shrink from this most drastic of measures.      Impeachment: A Handbook 1 (1974).  Presidential impeachment is thus an ""awful step.""  Ibid.  The Framers knew this.  For that reason they framed the constitutional procedure with precision and specified grounds for impeachment with great care.              The Framers deliberately chose to make ""high Crimes and Misdemeanors"" the standard of an impeachable offense.  They were familiar with English common law and parliamentary history and they borrowed the expression directly from the English law of impeachment. They did so knowing that the expression was a term of art and they made the choice after deliberate rejection of alternative formulations of the impeachment standard.              The Framers intended the standard to be a high one.  They rejected a proposal that the President be impeachable for ""maladministration,"" for, as James Madison pointed out, such a standard would ""be equivalent to a tenure during the pleasure of the Senate.""(1) The Framers plainly did not intend to permit Congress to debilitate the executive by authorizing impeachment for something short of the most serious harm to the state.  In George Mason's apt phrase, impeachment was thought necessary to remedy ""[a]ttempts to subvert the Constitution.""              In English practice, the term ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" had been applied to various offenses, the common elements of which were their severity and the fact that the wrongdoing was directed against the state.(2)  The English cases included misappropriation of public funds, interfering in elections, accepting bribes, neglect of duty, and various forms of corruption.  Ibid.  These offenses all affected the discharge of public duties by public officials.  In short, under the English practice, ""the critical element of injury in an impeachable offense was injury to the state.""(3)              That is why, at the time of the ratification debates, Alexander Hamilton described impeachment as a ""method of NATIONAL INQUEST into the conduct of public men.""  The Federalist No. 65 at 331 (Gary Wills ed. 1982).  This ""inquest"" is perhaps the gravest process known to our Constitution.  No act touches more fundamental questions of constitutional government than does the process of Presidential impeachment.  No act more directly affects the public interest.  No act presents the potential for greater injustice -- injustice both to the Chief Executive and to the people who elected him.              For these reasons, the impeachment process must be painstaking and deliberate.  It must focus only on such harms as the Framers intended to be redressed by the incomparably severe act of impeachment.  And most importantly, it must be understood for what it is -- a process of inquiry.  That process is itself the exercise of a public trust ""of delicacy and magnitude.""(4)  Accordingly, if the process is begun it is only just that the members engaged in this solemn task withhold judgment until the process is complete and all the facts are known.  Our Constitution's most basic values and the requirements of simple justice together demand no less.              The President is sole head of one branch of our government -- indeed, in a certain sense the President is the Executive Branch. The Constitution provides that ""[t]he executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.""  U.S. Const. art. II, Sect. 1. The President is the only government official to have been popularly elected by all the American people.  When the people elect a President, the popular will is expressed in its most important, most visible and most unmistakable form.(5) The impeachment process, by definition, threatens to undo the popular will.  Impeachment presents the prospect of reversing the electoral mandate that brought the executive to office.  Conviction upon articles of impeachment actually does so.              For these reasons, impeachment is limited to only certain forms of potential wrongdoing and it is intended to redress only certain kinds of harms.  Again, in Hamilton's words:        the subjects of [the Senate's impeachment] jurisdiction are those      offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or in      other words from the abuse of violation of some public trust.      They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be      denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done to      the society itself.      Federalist 65 at 330-31.              The Framers and early commentators on the Constitution are in accord on the question of impeachment's intended consequence.   In Justice James Wilson's words, impeachments are ""proceedings of a political nature . . . confined to political characters"" charging only ""political crimes and misdemeanors"" and culminating only in ""political punishments."" J. Wilson, Works 426 (R. McCloskey, ed. 1967)  And as Justice Story put the matter, ""the [impeachment] power partakes of a political character, as it respects injuries to the society in its political character.""   Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution Sect. 744 (1st Ed. 1833).(6)  That understanding of the Framers and early commentators reflected the historical understanding of impeachable offenses in England.  ""'High crimes and misdemeanors' were a category of political crimes against the state.""  Berger, Impeachment, at 61 (emphasis in original).  Therefore, the Framers ""intended that a president be removable from office for the commission of great offenses against the Constitution.""(7)         Impeachment therefore addresses public wrongdoing, whether denominated a ""political crime[] against the state,""(8) or ""an act of malfeasance or abuse of office,""(9) or a ""great offense[s] against the federal government.""(10)   In short, impeachment is a necessary Constitutional check by a coordinate branch of government upon serious and aggravated abuses of executive power that, given the President's four-year term, might otherwise go unchecked.              Holders of public office are therefore not to be impeached for private conduct, however wrongful.  To the contrary, only ""serious assaults on the integrity of the processes of government,""(11)and ""such crimes as would so stain a president as to make his continuance in office dangerous to public order""(12) should constitute impeachable offenses.  Conduct which is not an ""offense[] against the government,""(13) or ""malfeasance or abuse of office,""(14) and which bears no ""functional relationship""(15) to public office, does not constitute grounds for impeachment.  Allegations concerning private conduct--private sexual conduct in particular--simply do not implicate high crimes or misdemeanors.              Private misconduct, or even public misconduct short of an offense against the state, is not redressable by impeachment because that solemn process, in Justice Story's words, addresses ""offences[] which are committed by public men in violation of their public trust and duties.""  Story, Commentaries Sect. 744 (emphasis added). Impeachment is a political act in the sense that its aims are public; it attempts to rein in abuses of the public trust committed by public officeholders in connection with conduct in public office.  As one scholar has put it, ""[t]he nature of [impeachment] proceedings is dictated by the harms sought to be redressed - ""the misconduct of public men"" relating to the conduct of their public office - and the ultimate issue to be resolved - whether they have forfeited through that conduct their right to continued public trust.""(16)              Impeachment's public character is further evidenced by the fact that, as Justice Story expressed it, the process is  conducted ""by the representatives of the nation, in their public capacity,"" and ""in the face of the nation.""  Story, Commentaries Sect. 686. Constitutionally, impeachment's public function demands public accountability.  Elected officials are no more qualified than ordinary voters to assess the private wrongs of public officeholders.  The Constitution's impeachment mechanism does not exist to punish such wrongs.              The public character of impeachable wrongs is also reflected in the fact that the remedy imposed for commission of impeachable acts is a wholly public one.  Impeachment results in removal from office and possible disqualification from further office. U.S. Const. art.I, Sect. 3, cl. 7.              To say that impeachment is fundamentally a ""political"" process, however, is not to say that it is ""partisan"" in nature. Indeed, the Framers warned against the spirit of partisanship in impeachment proceedings.  In Federalist 65, Hamilton wrote that the impeachment process threatened to ""agitate the passions of the whole community . . .to divide it into parties . . . [to] connect itself with pre-existing factions [and] to enlist their animosities, partialities, influence and interest.""  Id. at 331.  Justice Story warned of the danger that ""the decision [to impeach] will be regulated more by the comparative strength of the parties, than by the strength of the proofs.""  Commentaries Sect. 744.  Only substantial evidence of presidential wrongdoing that threatened the processes of government or the public order can justify this grave and ideally bipartisan process.              What is ultimately intended by impeachment's truly ""political"" nature is the manner of limitation the Constitution allows one elected (political) branch to place on the other elected (political) branch, the Presidency.  Impeachment is necessarily a public act conducted by public bodies (the Houses of Congress exercising their constitutionally allotted portion of impeachment power) against a public officeholder (here, the President).  Exercise of that limiting function is justified only when the people's representatives conclude that the people themselves must be protected from their own elected executive.              Impeachment must therefore be approached with the utmost solemnity.  The process must focus on public acts, performed in the President's public capacity, and affecting the public interest. Cognizant of the enormous harm that must follow the bare suggestion of formal impeachment processes, the House should pursue an impeachment inquiry if and only if there is credible evidence of actions constituting fundamental injuries to the governmental process.  Indeed, the Committee should consider and approve articles of impeachment only for such acts as have, in its judgment, so seriously threatened the integrity of governmental processes as to have made the President's continuation in office a threat to the public order.              Impropriety falling short of that high standard does not meet the constitutional measure.  It must be left to the court of public opinion and the judgment of history.     II.  THE RELEVANT FACTUAL BACKGROUND               The Monica Lewinsky investigation is the most recent phase of an amorphous, languorous, expensive, and seemingly interminable investigation into the affairs of a small Arkansas real estate firm, Whitewater Development Company, Inc.  In January, 1994, Attorney General Reno made an administrative appointment (the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 having expired) of Robert B. Fiske, Jr., to investigate the relationship of the President and Mrs. Clinton to Whitewater, Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan Association, and Capital Management Services.  After the reenactment of the Ethics in Government Act, the Special Division for the Purpose of Appointing Independent Counsels of the Court of Appeals appointed Kenneth W. Starr, a former high official in two Republican administrations, to replace Mr. Fiske on August 5, 1994, and gave him a generally similar grant of investigatory jurisdiction.              During the past four and a half years, the President has cooperated extensively with this investigation.  He has given testimony by deposition at the White House to the Independent Counsel on four separate occasions, and on two other occasions, he gave videotaped deposition testimony for Whitewater defendants and was cross-examined by the Independent Counsel.  He has submitted written interrogatory answers, produced more than 90,000 pages of documents and other items, and provided information informally in a variety of ways.  The OIC subpoenaed from the President, and reviewed, virtually every personal financial record and gubernatorial campaign finance record that exists for the period from the mid-1980s to the present, in its endless search to find something to use against the President.  This comprehensive and thorough financial review yielded the OIC nothing.              In May 1994, President Clinton was sued civilly by Ms. Paula Jones, who made various claims arising out of an encounter on May 8, 1991, when the President was Governor of Arkansas.  Various constitutional questions were litigated, and it was not until the Supreme Court's decision on May 27, 1997(17) that the case proceeded to discovery.  The Independent Counsel had no jurisdiction with respect to the Jones case, but there were occasional press reports that the OIC was in fact investigating the President's personal life.(18)     III. THE PRESIDENT'S TESTIMONY ABOUT MS. LEWINSKY               In his grand jury testimony on August 17, 1998, the President acknowledged having had an improperly intimate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.  This is enormously difficult for any person to do even in private, much less in public.              It is important to recognize that the improper relationship with Ms. Lewinsky ended in early 1997, at the President's behest.  It therefore had been over for almost a year at the time of the President's deposition in the Jones case.  From feelings both of friendship and responsibility, the President remained in touch with Ms. Lewinsky after the improper relationship ended and tried to help her: none of this help was improper or conditioned on her behaving (or testifying) in any particular way.              It is not true that the President had an improper 18-month relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, as several media reports have alleged. In his grand jury deposition, he testified that on certain occasions in early 1996 and once in early 1997, he engaged in improper conduct with Ms. Lewinsky.  These encounters did not consist of sexual intercourse, and they did not consist of ""sexual relations"" as he understood that term to be defined at his Jones deposition on January 17, 1998 (explained infra), but they did involve inappropriate intimate contact. These inappropriate encounters ended, at the President's insistence, in early 1997, not because of the imminence of discovery, not because of the Jones case (which the Supreme Court had not yet decided), but because he knew they were wrong.  On August 17, 1998, the President expressed regret to the grand jury and, later, to the country, that what began as a friendship came to include this conduct, and he took full responsibility.  He has frequently, to different audiences, made similar expressions of regret and apology.              In this investigation, no stone has been left unturned--or (we believe) unthrown.  In simple fairness, therefore, it is important to distinguish between what the President has acknowledged and what the OIC merely alleges (on the basis of evidence we have not yet seen).     IV.  THE NATURE OF THE OIC'S EVIDENCE               Use of a federal grand jury to compile evidence for possible impeachment proceedings in Congress raises numerous troubling questions regarding the credibility of that evidence.  Indeed, given the limited role of a grand jury in our system and the total absence of procedural protections in the process, the Independent Counsel's insistence that his investigation has been a search for ""truth"" is deeply misleading.  In fact, it has been a one-sided effort to present the worst possible version of a limited set of facts.              Section 595(c) requires the OIC to provide the House with ""substantial and credible information . . . that may constitute grounds for impeachment.""  But a grand jury is a totally unsuitable vehicle for generating information that can, without more, be taken as credible beyond challenge.  The grand jury's historic role is not to determine the truth but rather to act as an accusatory body.  United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 51 (1992).  The process excludes contrary views of the information gathered and fails to identify the kinds of exculpatory information that might have been elicited or presented had a targeted individual, and not just the OIC, had an opportunity to cross-examine and the ability to compel responses.              Because it is inherently so one-sided and untested by cross-examination, it normally is not permissible to use grand jury testimony as a basis for anything other than permitting a grand jury to indict or decline to indict.  It may constitute nothing more than hearsay, Costello v. United States, 350 U.S. 359, 364 (1956), or even multiple hearsay--evidence which would likely be excluded from a trial. Indeed, the information a grand jury gathers is not circumscribed by the Federal Rules of Evidence at all, see Fed. R. Evid. 1101(d)(2), nor delimited by the other safeguards of reliability which would be enforced at trial.  The testimony a grand jury elicits is not subject to impeachment by interested parties, and such testimony may come from immunized witnesses, from witnesses who fear prosecution, from witnesses prepared by the prosecution, from witnesses with a history of untruthfulness--or from disinterested witnesses.  On the record of the grand jury there need be no distinction among these sources, despite the fact that their reliability varies greatly.              In its day-to-day operations, no judge presides over grand jury proceedings.  United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 48 (1992). Grand jury witnesses do not have counsel present.  Fed. R. Crim P. 6(d).  The Double Jeopardy Clause does not prevent a grand jury from returning an indictment after a first grand jury has declined to do so. Ex Parte United States, 287 U.S. 241, 250-51 (1932).   The exclusionary rule does not apply to grand jury proceedings.  United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 349 (1974).  Grand jury witnesses have no right to respond with information, however related, if it is not called for by the prosecution, and targets and subjects of its inquiry have no compulsory process to gather and present their side of the matter.  Nor does the target of a grand jury inquiry have any right to offset potentially incriminating information with exculpatory information in his possession.  Williams, 504 U.S. at 55.  In short, the most basic techniques our adversary system of justice employs for testing and assuring the reliability of evidence are completely missing in the grand jury context.              As a consequence, ""reliability"" simply is not the touchstone of a grand-jury inquiry.  The Supreme Court itself has said that ""the mere fact that evidence is unreliable is not sufficient to require a dismissal of [an] indictment.""  Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, 487 U.S. 250, 261 (1988).  The same is true of ""inadequate or incompetent"" evidence.  Its presence will not justify dismissal of an indictment.  Calandra, 414 U.S. at 345; see also Holt v. United States, 218 U.S. 245 (1910) (same).              It must therefore be recognized that it is not the grand jury's function to provide information about anything that can be taken as true on its face.  Its function is not to get at the ultimate truth. The grand jury's inquisitorial powers serve but one end:  to empower a body of citizens to make a threshold decision whether to initiate the search for truth that is the purpose of adversarial proceedings or to decline to indict and thereby forego that search altogether.  Only after the grand jury renders that threshold decision does the search for truth really commence because only then are the adversary system's credibility-assessing mechanisms available.              The grand jury secrecy rule, Rule 6(e), Fed. R. Crim. P., is justified--indeed, mandated--by this reality.  Grand jury information is to be kept secret largely because it has been generated without the protections of the adversarial system.  Unlike information presented in a trial setting, grand jury information presents an enormous risk that persons' reputations will be injured or destroyed on the basis of non-credible or insubstantial assertions.  That harm may damage both witnesses and persons who are subjects of witness testimony.  That is why, when a grand jury elects to indict, grand jury materials are sealed and withheld from the petit jury ultimately convened to find the truth and render a verdict.              Accordingly a fair report from the OIC would, inter alia, provide all exculpatory evidence, assess the credibility of witnesses in terms of bias, reason to falsify, prior inconsistent statements, etc., and draw reasonable inferences.  A fair report would identify shortcomings in the investigation itself, including any excesses, mistakes, errors in judgment, or impermissible tactics.  A fair report would demonstrate that every possible effort had been made to identify all possibly exculpatory evidence, and that all such evidence had been given appropriate weight.  And a fair report would address honestly and answer truthfully the following questions:       What were Linda Tripp's motives in seeking out the OIC in           January, 1998?  Did she articulate a fear of being           prosecuted in Maryland under that State's anti-taping laws?           Why did she request immunity from prosecution?  Why was she           given immunity?     What role did the OIC play in arranging for Ms. Tripp to           meet with the Jones lawyers on Friday, January 16, 1998,           the evening before the President's deposition?  Did anyone           from the OIC drive Ms. Tripp to this meeting?  Did the OIC           warn Ms. Tripp about the criminal law pertaining to sharing           with third parties the fruits of illegal tapings or even           communicating the fact that illegal tapes exist?  Has           anyone at the OIC made any assessment of what impact Ms.           Tripp's conduct might have on any federal immunity deal Ms.           Tripp might have obtained from the OIC?     What authority did the OIC have to wire Linda Tripp and           attempt to develop evidence before obtaining permission to           expand its jurisdiction from the Attorney General or the           Special Division?  What prevented the OIC from going           directly to the Attorney General upon receiving the tapes           from Ms. Tripp?  If the primary basis for the expansion of           the OIC's jurisdiction was evidence that was obtained in an           ultra vires manner by the OIC, does that taint other           information obtained by the OIC?     What assessment has the OIC made of Ms. Tripp's ideological           motivations?  Was the OIC aware she had submitted an            anti-Clinton book proposal to avowed Clinton hater Lucianne           Goldberg?  Was the OIC aware of Goldberg's role in Ms.           Tripp's taping and arrangement for Ms. Lewinsky's use of a           messenger service?     How many statements on the Tripp-Lewinsky tapes are false           or exaggerated?  How many statements contradict assertions           in the OIC's report?     When Ms. Tripp was asked to record Ms. Lewinsky           surreptitiously, was this because the OIC was concerned           about the legality of Ms. Tripp's previous telephone tapes           of Ms. Lewinsky?     What was Ms. Tripp's motivation in initiating the           surreptitious recording of her conversations with Ms.           Lewinsky?  Did Tripp steer the taped conversations with Ms.           Lewinsky to obtain details about Ms. Lewinsky's sexual           activities?  Was the taping connected in any way to her           relationship with Lucianne Goldberg?  If Ms. Tripp began to           tape Ms. Lewinsky with an unlawful purpose, did she commit           a violation of the federal wiretapping statute (Title III)?           If the tapes were obtained in violation of federal law, can           the tapes or evidence derived from them be part of any           official proceeding in Congress (see 18 U.S.C. Sect. 2515)?     What, if anything, did the OIC offer the press to keep           secret its investigation into Ms. Lewinsky?     Why was the OIC in such haste to petition the Attorney           General for an expansion of jurisdiction?  Precisely what           was the Attorney General told about Ms. Tripp's telephone           taping of Ms. Lewinsky?  Did the ""talking points"" play any           role in the application?  What particular alleged crimes           did the OIC seek authorization to investigate?     Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers, William Ginsburg and Nathaniel           Speights, wrote in an essay in Time (Feb. 16, 1998) that           the OIC informed them on Friday, January 16, 1998, ""We've           got a deal, and we want to wire her and record some phone           calls;"" these lawyers also wrote in that essay that ""[The           OIC] wanted her [Ms. Lewinsky] wired, and they wanted her           to record telephone calls with the President of the U.S.,           Vernon Jordan and others--at their will.""  What persons did           the OIC intend Ms. Lewinsky to record surreptitiously?     In a letter from the Independent Counsel to the President's           personal counsel, dated February 6, 1998, the Independent           Counsel wrote:  ""From the beginning, I have made the           prohibition of leaks a principal priority of the Office.           It is a firing offense, as well as one that leads to           criminal prosecution.""  However, Chief Judge Johnson has           entered a series of orders finding prima facie reason to           believe that persons in the OIC violated Rule 6(e), Fed. R.           Crim. P., by illegal leaking (for example, ""[t]he Court           finds that the serious and repetitive nature of disclosures           to the media of Rule 6(e) material strongly militates in           favor of conducting a show cause hearing"" (June 19, 1998,           Order, at 5)).  Has anyone been fired or disciplined by the           OIC for illegal leaking?  What steps have been taken to           investigate and discipline OIC personnel who have engaged           in illegal leaking?      LIKELY OIC ALLEGATIONS OF OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, SUBORNATION OF    PERJURY, AND INTIMIDATION OF WITNESSES                 The OIC obtained jurisdiction on January 16, 1998 to investigate possible obstruction of justice, subornation of perjury, and intimidation of witnesses in the Jones case.  These crimes are quite specifically defined in the law, and the elements do not always have an obvious meaning.  We consider first the definition and then the possible conduct to which these definitions might be applied.              The term ""obstruction of justice"" usually refers to violations of 18 U.S.C. Sect. 1503, the ""Omnibus Obstruction Provision,"" which prohibits the intimidation and retaliation against grand and petit jurors and judicial officers and contains a catch-all clause making it unlawful to ""influence, obstruct, or impede the due administration of justice.""  It may also refer to 18 U.S.C. Sect. 1512, which proscribes intimidating, threatening, or corruptly persuading, through deceptive conduct, a person in connection with an official proceeding.              For a conviction under Sect. 1503, the government must prove that there was a pending judicial proceeding, that the defendant knew of the proceeding, and that the defendant acted ""corruptly"" with the specific intent to obstruct or interfere with the proceeding or due administration of justice.  See, e.g., United States v. Bucey, 876 F.2d 1297, 1314 (7th Cir. 1989); United States v. Smith, 729 F. Supp. 1380, 1383-84 (D.D.C. 1990).  Thus, if a defendant is unaware of a pending grand jury proceeding, he cannot be said to have obstructed it in violation of Sect. 1503.  See, e.g., United States v. Brown, 688 F.2d 1391, 1400 (9th Cir. 1992).  Perhaps more significant is the ""acting corruptly"" element of the offense.  Some courts have defined this term as acting with ""evil and wicked purposes.""  See United States v. Banks, 942 F.2d 1576, 1578 (11th Cir. 1991).  Four federal courts of appeals have held that to ""act corruptly"" under the statute, a defendant must have acted with the specific intent to obstruct justice.  See United States v. Moon, 718 F.2d 1219, 1236 (2d Cir. 1983); United States v. Bashaw, 982 F.2d 168, 170 (6th Cir. 1992); United States v. Anderson, 798 F.2d 919, 928 (7th Cir, 1986); United States v. Rasheed, 663 F.2d 843, 847 (9th Cir. 1981).  That is, it is not enough to prove that the defendant knew that a result of his actions might be to impede the administration of justice, if that was not his intent.              It is critical to note which actions cannot fall under the ambit of Sect. 1503.  First, false statements or testimony alone cannot sustain a conviction under Sect. 1503.  See United States v. Thomas, 916, F.2d 647, 652 (11th Cir. 1990); United States v. Rankin, 870 F.2d 109, 111 (3d Cir. 1989).  For instance, in United States v. Wood, 6 F.3d 692, 697 (10th Cir. 1993), the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit found that a defendant's false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation during a grand jury investigation did not violate Sect. 1503, because they did not have the natural and probable effect of impeding the due administration of justice. Moreover, Sect. 1503 does not apply to a party's concealing or withholding discoverable documents in civil litigation.  See, e.g., Richmark v. Timber Falling Consultants, 730 F. Supp. 1525, 1532 (D. Or. 1990) (because of the remedies afforded by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Sect. 1503 does not cover party discovery in civil cases, and ""[t]he parties have not cited and the court has not found any case in which a person was charged with obstruction of justice for concealing or withholding discovery in a civil case"").(19)  Most cases that have found Sect. 1503 applicable to civil cases do not involve the production or withholding of documents.  See United States v. London, 714 F.2d 1558 (11th Cir. 1983) (attorney forged court order and attempted to enforce it), cited in Richmark, 730 F. Supp. at 1532; Sneed v. United States, 298 F. 911 (5th Cir. 1924) (influencing juror in civil case); cited in Richmark, 730 F. Supp at 1532.  While Sect. 1503 can apply to concealment of subpoenaed documents in a grand jury investigation, the defendant must have knowledge of the pending grand jury investigation, must know that the particular documents are covered by a subpoena, and must willfully conceal or endeavor to conceal them from the grand jury with the specific intent to interfere with its investigation.  See United States v. McComb, 744 F.2d 555 (7th Cir. 1984).              Section 1512 specifically applies to ""witness tampering."" However, by its terms, it does not purport to reach all forms of witness tampering, but only tampering by specified means.  In order to obtain a conviction under Sect. 1512, the government must prove that a defendant knowingly engaged in intimidation, physical force, threats, misleading conduct, or corrupt persuasion with intent to influence, delay, or prevent testimony or cause any person to withhold objects or documents from an official proceeding.  While there is no ""pending proceeding"" requirement for convictions under Sect. 1512, it is clear that a defendant must be aware of the possibility of a proceeding and his efforts must be aimed specifically at obstructing that proceeding, whether pending or not; Sect. 1512 does not apply to defendants' innocent remarks or other acts unintended to affect a proceeding.  See United States v. Wilson, 565 F. Supp. 1416, 1431 (S.D.N.Y. 1983).              Moreover, it is important to define the terms ""corruptly persuade"" and ""misleading conduct,"" as used in Sect. 1512.  The statute itself explains that ""corruptly persuades"" does not include ""conduct which would be misleading conduct but for a lack of a state of mind."" 18 U.S.C. Sect. 1515(a)(6).  It is also clear from the caselaw that ""misleading conduct"" does not cover scenarios where the defendant urged a witness to give false testimony without resorting to coercive or deceptive conduct.  See, e.g., United States v. Kulczyk, 931 F.2d 542, 547 (9th Cir. 1991) (no attempt to mislead witnesses knew defendant was asking them to lie); United States v. King, 762 F.2d 232, 237 (2d Cir. 1985) (defendant who attempts to persuade witness to lie but not to mislead trier of fact does not violate Sect. 1512).              Subornation of perjury is addressed in 18 U.S.C. Sect. 1622.  The elements of subornation are that the defendant must have persuaded another to perjure himself, and the witness must have actually committed perjury.  See, e.g. United States v. Hairston, 46 F.3d 361, 376 (4th Cir. 1959), rev'd on other grounds, 361 U.S. 529 (1960).  If actual perjury does not occur, there is simply no subornation.  See id. at 376 (reversing conviction for subornation because of conclusion that, in applying Bronston, witness did not commit perjury due to his literally truthful testimony).  Moreover, Sect. 1622 requires that the defendant know that the testimony of witness will be perjurious -- i.e., knowing and willful procurement of false testimony is a key element of subornation of perjury.  See Rosen v. NLRB, 735 F.2d 564, 575 n.19 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (""a necessary predicate of the charge of subornation of perjury is the suborner's belief that the testimony sought is in fact false"").              Based upon illegal OIC leaks and press reports, we believe that the OIC's principal claims of obstruction, intimidation and subornation -- the three prongs of the January 1998 expansion of jurisdiction -- appear to arise out of:    (1)  ""Talking Points""              The so-called ""talking points""(20) have been widely hailed as the linchpin of any charge of subornation of perjury or obstruction of justice.  Not only were they touted as the ""smoking gun"" of the investigation, they were instrumental in the OIC efforts to secure an expansion of its jurisdictional authority.  Charles Bakaly, the OIC spokesman, appearing on Meet the Press, emphasized the critical nature of this document to  the expansion of the OIC jurisdiction:        Tim Russert:   How important is it that we find out who is the      author of those talking points?       Charles Bakaly: Well, in the grant of jurisdiction that the      special division of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals gave to      Judge Starr after the request of the Attorney General, that was      the key mandate to look into, those kinds of issues of      subornation of perjury and obstruction of justice.      NBC Meet the Press, July 5, 1998 (emphasis added).              The ""talking points"" were the basis of thinly veiled smears, groundless speculation, and allegations against President Clinton, White House aides and others close to the President:        ""And NBC News has learned more about another critical piece of           evidence.  A memo first discovered by Newsweek that Linda           Tripp claims was given to her by Monica Lewinsky.   Sources           in Starr's office and close to Linda Tripp say they believe           the instructions came from the White House.  If true, that           could help support a case of obstruction of justice.""  NBC           Nightly News, February 4, 1998.

Who wrote the document is one of           the key questions, whoever did could be charged with           obstruction of justice.""  Chicago Tribune, February 15,           1998.            After all of the rumor and speculation regarding a     connection between the White House and the ""talking points,"" President Clinton was not asked one single question relating to the talking points during his August 17 deposition.  Ms. Lewinsky is reported to have testified that she wrote the document without any assistance other than conversations she had with Linda Tripp.  In the venerable tradition of Whitewater allegations, the ""talking points"" were surfaced as important and damning evidence of wrongdoing, but in the fullness of time and after investigation, have apparently vanished entirely.  Only the stigma remains.    (2)  Ms. Lewinsky's Transfer of Gifts to Betty Currie              The President frequently gives gifts to and receives gifts from friends and supporters; he gave Ms. Lewinsky the same kind of gifts he has shared with others.  He was not concerned about the Jones lawyers' knowledge of the gifts.  In the Jones deposition, he acknowledged knowing Ms. Lewinsky, acknowledged seeing her, acknowledged she had given him gifts, and acknowledged he had given her gifts.  Moreover, in his grand jury testimony, he acknowledged giving Ms. Lewinsky good-bye gifts on December 28, 1997, shortly before she moved to New York, a date which we believe to be after Ms. Currie picked up the box of gifts from Ms. Lewinsky.  The gifts simply were not a concern to him.              It is our understanding that Ms. Lewinsky may have testified that she raised with the President a concern about the Jones lawyers' request for gifts from the President and that, shortly thereafter, Ms. Currie appeared at her home stating that she understood Ms. Lewinsky had something for her.  Ms. Lewinsky apparently testified that she then provided to Ms. Currie for safekeeping a box containing some of the gifts received from the President.              For Ms. Lewinsky's account to be credible, Ms. Currie must have been asked by the President to contact Ms. Lewinsky for the box. However, her account conflicts directly both with that of the President and with what we believe to be Ms. Currie's testimony.  The President told Ms. Lewinsky she would have to produce what she had in response to a request.  He did not ever suggest that gifts from him should be disposed of, and he did not ever ask or instruct Ms. Currie to pick up the gifts from Ms. Lewinsky.  We believe that Ms. Currie's testimony corroborates this recollection.  Ms. Currie has apparently testified that Ms. Lewinsky initiated the contact with her about the box, asking Ms. Currie to come by her apartment building, giving a sealed box to her, and asking her to hold on to it.  Ms. Currie has no knowledge that the President ever even knew about the box prior to public disclosures about it, and the President testified that he did not learn about the box until after the OIC investigation became public.    (3)  Job Assistance to Ms. Lewinsky              The President made certain efforts to try to assure that Ms. Lewinsky had a fair shot at a job other than her Pentagon position, where she was not happy, and he generally was aware of other efforts by his secretary Ms. Currie and his friend Mr. Jordan.  These actions were totally appropriate.  At no time did the President ask that Ms. Lewinsky be accorded specially favorable or unfavorable treatment because of his relationship with her or for any other reason.  These actions began well before Ms. Lewinsky was ever named a witness in the Jones litigation, and they were in no way intended to influence Ms. Lewinsky to keep secret what was at that time an already terminated relationship.  There is no evidence of any link whatsoever between the President's actions and possible testimony by Ms. Lewinsky in the Jones case.              In April 1996, Ms. Lewinsky was reassigned from the White House to the Pentagon.  Although the transfer was viewed as a promotion, the President became aware that Ms. Lewinsky was upset about it, did not see it as a positive change, and feared that the transfer would be appear to be a demotion or ""black mark"" on her resume.  To the extent that Ms. Lewinsky was criticized for spending more time in the West Wing than was required by her responsibilities in the Office of Legislative Affairs, the President felt responsible.              In the summer of 1997, the President spoke to Marsha Scott, the deputy personnel director at the White House, and inquired about the possibility of a position being available for Ms. Lewinsky in the White House.  He never ordered Ms. Scott or anyone else to provide her special treatment or directed that she be given a job at the White House.  He simply wanted to assure that she had been treated fairly and asked only that Ms. Scott look into the possibility of a position at the White House for Ms. Lewinsky if it was appropriate.  Ms. Lewinsky was never offered an opportunity to return to the White House--as a result of that conversation or otherwise.              In the fall of 1997, Ms. Betty Currie spoke to Mr. John Podesta about finding a job for Ms. Lewinsky in New York, and Mr. Podesta ultimately spoke to Ambassador Bill Richardson about the matter.  The Ambassador agreed to interview Ms. Lewinsky for a position in his New York office.  The President was not involved in arranging the Richardson interview.  When Ms. Lewinsky indicated to Ms. Currie that she preferred a job in the private sector, Ms. Currie contacted Mr. Jordan, her long-time friend, to see whether he would be willing to make inquiries regarding a job opportunity for Ms. Lewinsky in the private sector.  Mr. Jordan referred her for interviews at American Express and Revlon, and to the advertising agency of Young & Rubicam. As Mr. Jordan said in his January 22, 1998 statement on the matter:        Throughout my professional career, I have been privileged to      assist people with their vocational aspirations.  I have done so      for two reasons.  first, I stand on the shoulders of many      individuals who have helped me.  Second, I believe ""to whom much      is given much is required"" so I have tried to lend a helping      hand.       For many years now . . .  I am consulted by individuals, young      and old, male and female, black and white, Hispanic and Asian,      rich and poor, cabinet members and secretaries, for assistance.      And I have met with some success, from paralegals to mailroom      clerks, to corporate directors, to CEO's.       I was pleased to be helpful to Ms. Lewinsky whose drive,      ambition, and personality were impressive.  She was referred by      Ms. Betty Currie, a secretary to the president.      Mr. Jordan is a private individual who is free to offer job assistance to whomever he chooses.              Questions have been raised about a connection between the timing of Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit (which was executed January 7 and filed January 16) and the timing of any job offer.  There was no connection.  Francis Carter, Esq., Ms. Lewinsky's attorney at the time she executed the affidavit, apparently has stated that Ms. Lewinsky never asked him to delay the filing of an affidavit until after she had secured a job in New York and never suggested when the affidavit should be filed.  The Washington Post, June 19, 1998.  Indeed, Mr. Carter has reported that he himself delayed the filing of the affidavit while he attempted to persuade the Jones attorneys to withdraw the subpoena to Ms. Lewinsky.  Ibid.              Indeed, it was totally appropriate for Mr. Jordan to refer Ms. Lewinsky to Francis Carter to represent her in the Jones litigation.  Mr. Carter is a highly respected lawyer who would owe his duty to Ms. Lewinsky and represent her interests.  Assuring a witness has her own counsel in whom she may confide is the surest and most appropriate way to protect the integrity of the process.  As Mr. Jordan indicated in his January 22 statement, the referral was ""at her request"" and Mr. Jordan simply ""took her to Mr. Carter's office, introduced them, and returned to my office.""  Ms. Lewinsky paid Mr. Carter herself.  Mr. Carter has said that Mr. Jordan brought Ms. Lewinsky to his office, introduced them, and told him that she had been subpoenaed in the Jones case and needed an attorney.  The Washington Post, June 19, 1998.  According to Mr. Carter, Mr. Jordan did not suggest what should be done or how the matter should be handled, but promptly left.  Ibid.  Mr. Carter has stated, ""I never received any kind of information from [Ms. Lewinsky] at any time that contradicted anything that's in that affidavit.""  Ibid.              Finally, in January of 1998, the President asked Mr. Erskine Bowles whether the legislative affairs office where Ms. Lewinsky once had worked would be able to give Ms. Lewinsky a reference that would not be negative.  The President understood from Ms. Lewinsky that she thought she could get a good reference from The Department of Defense but hoped for a White House reference that was at least neutral.  The President did not instruct anyone to provide such a reference and did not follow up on the inquiry.  This innocuous query for an honest reference cannot conceivably be a basis for any charge of wrongdoing.     VI.  ""ABUSES OF POWER""               From the very beginning, the Lewinsky investigation has been about potential impeachment -- a direct attack by the OIC on the constitutional status of the President.  It is in that context that the OIC's allegations of abuse of power must be judged.              Any charge the OIC might make that the President has abused the powers of his office through the assertion of privileges -- privileges that were asserted at the initiation and recommendation of the Counsel's Office, not by the President himself -- is utterly baseless.  Indeed, those charges are more a reflection of the OIC's unfettered abuse of his authority and his wholesale abandonment of any prosecutorial judgment in his campaign to prevent the President from consulting with his most senior advisors in confidence.  No prosecutor, not even during Watergate, ever has contemplated the sort of sweeping intrusion into the President's ability to obtain advice that has been undertaken by the OIC.  At bottom, the Independent Counsel believes that, merely because he demands confidential information, the President may not defend himself against impeachment without raising a charge that he is thereby abusing his power.              Before moving to these issues, one other point is worthy of note.  It has been suggested in media reports that one of the grounds for impeachment advanced by the OIC is that the President abused his power by denying to his staff, in the days immediately following disclosure of the Lewinsky investigation, that he had engaged in any improper conduct when he knew that they might be called as witnesses before the grand jury and knew that they were making public statements in his defense.  If this allegation were not so serious, such a suggestion would be ludicrous.              Implicit in the allegation is the notion that any official, in any branch of the government, who makes a statement about his own conduct, or indeed any other matter, that is not absolutely true is liable for misusing his office for so long as he fails to admit wrongdoing, for the official's staff will inevitable repeat his explanation in any number of forums.  It would follow, therefore, according to what appears to be the OIC's reasoning, that no official could mount a defense to impeachment, or to ethics charges, or to a criminal investigation while remaining in office, for anything other than an admission of guilt will be treated as an abuse of his official powers.       The President's Decision to Litigate Privilege Issues Cannot Be      Compared to the Abuses of Power Alleged during Watergate                The Independent Counsel apparently attempts to evoke images of Watergate by charging that the President has abused the powers of his office.  This allegation is simply meritless. In the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton described abuse of power as the ""corrupt use of the office for personal gain or some other improper purpose."" Former President Nixon's use of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to thwart a major criminal investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) of a crime in which he was involved, to take but one example, fits squarely within that definition.  President Clinton's lawful assertion of privileges in a court of law and the Counsel's Office conduct of its official duties plainly does not.              There is no comparison between the claimed abuses of power by President Nixon and the public and lawful assertion of privileges during the OIC investigation.  Indeed, comparing this White House with President Nixon's diminishes the historical significance of the unprecedented claims of abuse of power by the Nixon administration and attempts to criminalize the proper exercise of presidential prerogatives.  The specious nature of the OIC's allegations reveal the OIC's true motive:  to create an offense where none exists.              In July 1974, the House Judiciary Committee lodged serious and significant abuse of power charges against President Nixon, alleging that President Nixon, among other things:        Engaged in an elaborate cover-up scheme that included using his      secret intelligence operation to pay both for illegal activities      and subsequent blackmail money for the cover-up;       Paid hush money to his advisor;       Instructed administration officials on how to commit perjury;       Violated grand jury secrecy rules by obtaining 6(e) material from      the Justice Department and passing it on to presidential      advisors, who were targets of the investigation;       Attempted to subvert the IRS and CIA;       Authorized illegal intelligence gathering activities;       Directly interfered with the Justice Department's ITT      investigation; and,       Pressured the CIA to interfere with the FBI's investigation of      the Watergate break-in -- a conversation caught on tape.            In contrast, the OIC apparently has made such charges of     abuse against President Clinton, however erroneously, for purportedly encouraging the Secret Service to assert privilege claims over their testimony and invoking attorney-client and executive privileges. President Clinton's privilege claims have been open and lawful, and were reviewed and in significant measure validated by the courts. Thus, the Nixon investigation and precedent stand in sharp contrast to the OIC's investigation and baseless charges in this matter.    2.   The United States Secret Service's Decision to Pursue AProtective       Privilege Was the Proper Exercise of Its Own Authority And In No      Way an Abuse of Power By the President            The assertion of a protective function privilege by the     Secret Service cannot possibly serve as a basis for the OIC's allegations of abuse of power.  As a factual matter, the President never asked, directed, or participated in any decision regarding the protective function privilege.  Moreover, no one at the White House asked, directed, participated or had any role in such decisions.  The Treasury and Justice Departments independently decided to pursue a privilege for the Secret Service to ensure the protection of this and future presidents.              Second, ignoring significant security concerns expressed by the Secret Service, the Independent Counsel sought testimony from agents about non-criminal events they may have witnessed as well as non-criminal conversations they may have overheard in the course of protecting the President.  For the first time in the history of the Independent Counsel statute, the Independent Counsel sought to use the protective service as a source of intelligence for admittedly  non-criminal activities of a protectee.  In the wake of this  unprecedented demand, it was and continues to be the reasoned judgment  of career professionals in the Secret Service that the absence of a  protective privilege would severely impair agents' ability to fulfill  their mission to protect this and future Presidents (as well as other protectees).  The Secret Service's position was supported by former presidents and by former agents assigned to protect presidents in both Republican as well as Democratic administrations.              Thus, the Justice and Treasury Departments' assertion of a protective privilege advanced valid concerns about the Secret Service's ability to perform its function.  The OIC's suggestion that the assertion of this privilege constituted an abuse of power not only insults the integrity of career law enforcement officials, but that of congressional policy makers too.  Indeed, because of the Independent Counsel's unorthodox overreaching, Senator Hatch vowed to seek legislation to enact the type of limited privilege asserted by the Secret Service in response to the Independent Counsel's sweeping actions.  Congressional Press Releases, Senator Orrin Hatch, July 17, 1998.    3.   The President's Assertions of Executive and Attorney/Client        Privilege were Valid and Necessary              Any charge by the OIC that the President's assertion of privileges constitutes an abuse of power is equally baseless.  The White House advanced claims of privilege only sparingly and as a last resort to protect the core constitutional and institutional interests of this and future presidencies.  In pursuing his attack on the institution of the Presidency, the OIC took the extreme position that executive privilege was inapplicable and that the governmental attorney-client privilege did not exist in the face of grand jury subpoena.  The OIC now seeks to penalize the President for disagreeing with its interpretations of the law, despite the fact that the courts (and the Department of Justice) both also disagreed with the OIC.       The President Followed the Advice of White House Counsel           Regarding the Assertion of Official Privileges                A necessary component of the OIC's abuse of power allegation is that the President initiated the White House's claims of privilege -- both executive and attorney-client -- with intent to impede the OIC's investigation.  The record completely refutes this premise.              The privilege issue initially arose when the OIC served on Bruce Lindsey, Assistant to the President and Deputy Counsel, a subpoena seeking his testimony before the grand jury.  Declaration of Charles F.C. Ruff (""Ruff Dec."") Par. 31.  Prior to Mr. Lindsey's appearance, the White House Counsel met with the OIC to discuss privilege issues and to ask the OIC to describe with particularity possible areas of inquiry to determine whether they would encompass privileged information.  Id. Par. 32.  The OIC declined to discuss this issue, and later stated that it intended to question Mr. Lindsey on areas implicating a wide array of privileges because it believed that executive and attorney-client privileges were inapplicable to information relating to the Lewinsky investigation.  Id. Par.Par. 32-34. The White House offered, in good faith, to provide the OIC with any factual testimony regarding the Lewinsky investigation.  Id. Par.Par. 45-50.  The OIC rejected this offer.  Id. Par. 51.              Instead, the OIC suddenly filed motions to compel the testimony of Mr. Lindsey and other senior staff.  Id.  After careful deliberations, the White House Counsel notified the President of the privilege issue, explained the failed accommodation effort, and recommended that he invoke privilege.  As he did in every instance, the President accepted the White House Counsel's recommendation and authorized the Counsel to make the claim of privilege.  Id. Par. 56. Thus, the President's decision to claim privilege was never the result of his own initiative, but of his Counsel's advice.        B.   The President's Executive Privilege Assertions Were Upheld           by the Court            To put the OIC's apparent abuse of power charges in     context, it is important to recognize that the OIC took the extraordinary position that executive privilege was inapplicable in the face of a grand jury subpoena and that it therefore was entitled to immediate and full disclosure of all strategic and political communication among the President's most senior advisors.  This position was squarely at odds with the law of the Supreme Court, and of course, the D.C. Circuit.   Executive privilege is  constitutionally-based and covers communications relating to the  President's official duties and the effective functioning of the  executive branch.  It ensures that the President receives frank and  candid advice and recommendations, which ultimately fosters more  informed and effective decision-making.              Here, the President asserted executive privilege over communications that relate to matters that affect the performance of his official duties.  In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 1998 U.S. Dist. Lexis 7736, *7 (D.D.C. 1998); Ruff Dec. Par.Par. 16-30.  Indeed, some of these communications related to the President's decision whether to invoke privilege over other communications.  Id. Par.Par. 26-28.              Rather than acknowledge the presumptively privileged nature of the information, the OIC maintained that the privilege was inapplicable and that it did not have to demonstrate any need for the information.   Chief Judge Johnson rejected the OIC's position holding that the communications were presumptively privileged.  In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 1998 U.S. Dist. Lexis at *3-10.  The Court then required the OIC to make a showing that its need for the information was sufficient to overcome the privilege.  Id. at * 13-21.  Although the Court concluded that the OIC had met its burden, the Court at no time even suggested that the President's assertion of executive privilege was groundless, improper, or made in bad faith.  In those circumstances, it cannot seriously be argued that assertion of the privilege was an abuse of power.             C.   The President's Assertion of the Attorney-Client Privilege           was Solidly Grounded in the Law of this Circuit            For centuries, the law has recognized the attorney-client     privilege as absolute in protecting the confidentiality of communications between lawyers and their clients.  The D.C. Circuit has also recognized that the attorney-client privilege protects confidential communications between government lawyers and officials. E.g. Mead Data Control, Inc. v. Dep't of the Air Force, 566 F.2d 242 (D.C. Cir. 1977).  Courts recognize that a government official, like any other citizen, must be able to provide information to and seek advice from government lawyers without fear of public disclosure. Ultimately, the privilege serves an important governmental function by fostering well-advised and fully-informed decision-making. The possibility that those communications may be disclosed  will forfeit the benefits the privilege was intended to protect.              Despite the law in the D.C. Circuit recognizing the attorney-client privilege in the governmental context, the Independent Counsel pushed to breach the bonds of the governmental attorney-client privilege.  Unlike his predecessors, who have respected the professional obligation of government attorneys to provide confidential legal advice on official matters, the Independent Counsel has insisted that government attorneys and clients do not have the right to discuss legal issues in confidence.  In this context, the White House's assertion of the attorney-client privilege was not only appropriate, but it was an ethical and institutional obligation.              Prior to the D.C. Circuit litigation, the OIC was well aware that the White House fundamentally disagreed with the OIC regarding the applicability and scope of the governmental  attorney-client privilege.  In the Eighth Circuit, the OIC had  attempted to obtain a White House lawyer's notes that reflected  confidential communications.  In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum,  112 F.3d 910 (8th Cir. 1997).  At the time of that litigation, which  the White House resisted and the OIC won, there was no authority  rejecting the existence of a governmental attorney-client privilege.              Two years later, the OIC, in the Lewinsky investigation, sought to compel the disclosure of confidential communications between the President and his official lawyers in which legal advice was either being sought by or provided to the President regarding official matters.  In view of the law of the D.C. Circuit, which recognized an absolute governmental attorney-client privilege, the White House Counsel recommended, and the President asserted, the privilege.              A recent Supreme Court ruling that rejected the OIC's sweeping attack on the attorney-client privilege provided additional support for the President's position.  In  Swidler & Berlin v. United States, ___U.S.___  (1998); 1998 U.S. Lexis 4214 (1998), the OIC argued that the personal attorney-client privilege should automatically give way to the needs of a criminal investigation.  The Court rejected the OIC's position and stated that ""there is no case authority for the proposition that the privilege applies differently in criminal and civil cases,""  id. at *7, supporting the principle that the privilege remains absolute in a grand jury context.  Accordingly, the President's position on the applicability of the privilege in this context had a substantial basis in the decisions of both this Circuit and the Supreme Court.              Undaunted, the OIC argued that, based upon the non-binding Eighth Circuit opinion, the governmental attorney-client privilege is inapplicable in a grand jury context.  112 F.3d 910 (8th Cir. 1997). From an institutional standpoint, the OIC's position stripped the President of any ability to obtain confidential advice from government lawyers about official matters in the event that the OIC made a referral to Congress for possible impeachment hearings.  In an impeachment context, the President is entitled to rely on Counsel's Office lawyers to provide critical legal guidance. Without the ability to receive such confidential advice, he is left without any legal guidance regarding the conduct of his official duties.              The District Court rejected the OIC's position and held that the President had a valid, though qualified, governmental attorney-client privilege.  In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 1998 U.S. Dist. Lexis at *21-52.  Performing a need analysis similar to executive privilege, the Court balanced the President's interests against those of the grand jury and ultimately determined that the grand jury was entitled to the information.  Once again, the District Court did not suggest that the privilege claim was spurious or made in bad faith.              On appeal, a divided D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the President had an attorney-client privilege with White House Counsel in some contexts, but not this one.  In re:  Bruce R. Lindsey, 1998 U.S. App. Lexis 17066, *7-43 (D.C. Cir. 1998).  Judge David Tatel, whose dissenting opinion in the Court of Appeals' decision in Swidler & Berlin was adopted by the Supreme Court, dissented here as well. Consistent with his analysis in Swidler & Berlin, Judge Tatel found that the Court's opinion did not account for ""the unique nature of the Presidency,  its unique need for confidential legal advice, or the possible consequences of abrogating the attorney-client privilege for a President's ability to obtain such advice.""  Id. at *54.  Judge Tatel's recognition of the validity of the absolute nature of the privilege and the President's need to assert this and belies the notion that the assertion was in any way an abuse of power.              The OIC's apparent argument that the assertions of privilege were for purposes of delay lacks any evidentiary support and, more significantly, overlooks the OIC's own dilatory conduct.  After Mr. Lindsey was subpoenaed and before he was scheduled to testify, the Office of the President attempted to avoid litigating these issues by reaching an accommodation that would provide the OIC with access to the information to which it was entitled while maintaining the legitimate confidentiality interests of the President.  Id. Par.Par. 31-32.  The OIC rejected those efforts and instead filed its motion to compel.  Id. Par.51.  The OIC has continued to reject any attempt by the White House to compromise, choosing instead to litigate these issues.  The Office of the President has sought to avoid any delay by agreeing to expedited briefing schedules involving privilege litigation, and the courts, appreciating the time-sensitivity of the issues, have ruled swiftly on these matters.              In any event, any delay that might have been caused by the White House had no substantive impact on the OIC's investigation. Privilege claims have been advanced as to only a narrow portion of the testimony of three witnesses.  The OIC originally filed motions to compel the testimony of two senior staff members and one Counsel's Office lawyer.  The litigation only temporarily postponed the testimony of the two senior staffers; in March, they both appeared before the grand and testified fully.  The privilege assertions ultimately involved the testimony of only three Counsel's Office lawyers.  Each of these individuals has testified at length regarding any facts they may have possessed about whether the President had a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.  The questions as to which they asserted privilege were narrow in scope and irrelevant to the matters being investigated.              Finally, substantial delay in the investigation has been self-inflicted.  The OIC has wandered aimlessly down more alleys and byways than any federal prosecutor would appropriately do.  The OIC has called current and former White House staffers before the grand jury, and interviewed many others.  The OIC has called presidential advisers before the grand jury four, five and six times; sometimes for only oneor  two-hour sessions.  Some witnesses  appeared to testify only to find themselves waiting for hours and then being told to return on another day.  The OIC has also insisted on exploring such irrelevant subjects as White House contacts with the press, and has required testimony from attorneys whose primary function was to deal with the OIC.  Such actions are highly unusual, if not unprecedented.    4.   White House Lawyers Played an Appropriate Role in the        Investigation              Finally, the open and lawful efforts of the White House lawyers to assist White House staff obtain lawyers, to speak with witnesses and their lawyers, and to provide advice on the ramifications of the investigation also cannot be considered an abuse of power.              As a threshold matter, when there is an official nexus between the duties of the President and an ongoing investigation, which certainly exists here, it is the duty of government attorneys to represent their official client.  The specter of impeachment loomed from the day the Lewinsky story broke in the press.  Ruff Dec. Par. 21. Members of the Congress asserted that the investigation, which drew explosive media, public and congressional attention, burdened the President's ability to perform his constitutional and statutory duties. Accordingly, the White House Counsel's Office lawyers, among others, were responsible for providing the President and White House officials with informed, candid advice on the issues raised by the investigation that affected the President's official duties.  Id. Par.Par. 16-30.              When it suited the OIC's interests, the OIC recognized the appropriateness of, and relied on, the White House Counsel's efforts. From the beginning of this investigation, the OIC sought -- and received -- the cooperation of the White House lawyers in setting up interviews and grand jury appearances of current and former White House employees.  The OIC, however, refused to allow the White House lawyers to represent even the most junior, uninvolved witnesses.  Thus, all White House officials, from the most senior to the most junior, were required to obtain private counsel.  White House lawyers also provided relevant documents to witnesses' attorneys to ensure complete and accurate testimony, provided privilege instructions and guidance, and followed-up afterwards to discuss an individual's interview or grand jury appearance and any outstanding issues.  All of the Counsel's Office activities were well-known to the OIC, and no objection was ever voiced.              Lastly,  it was not uncommon for the White House to be faced with inaccurate and spurious stories that seemed to be coming from the OIC or ""sources close to the OIC"" shortly after a witness testified or was interviewed by the prosecution.  Indeed, Judge Johnson examined media reports, and concluded that they contained grand jury material and that there was evidence that the OIC as the source.  In re Grand Jury Proceedings, Misc. No. 98-55 (D.D.C. June 19, 1998), Mem. Op. at 6.  Accordingly, Judge Johnson held that this evidence established a prima facie case that the OIC had violated Rule 6(e) and ordered the OIC to appear to show cause why it should not be held in contempt for Rule 6(e) violations.  These leaks created a deluge of press inquiries to the White House; not surprisingly, White House Counsel lawyers were required to gather information and advise senior staff concerning the appropriate response to these inquiries.     VII. ALLEGATIONS OF PERJURY(21)               The OIC cannot make out even a colorable claim of perjury. If answers are truthful or literally truthful but misleading, there is no perjury as a matter of law, no matter how misleading the testimony is or is intended to be.  The law simply does not require the witness to aid his interrogator.  The Referral seeks to punish the President for being unhelpful to those trying to destroy him politically.       The Law of Perjury                Perjury requires proof that a defendant, while under oath, knowingly made a false statement as to material facts.(22)  See, e.g., United States v. Dunnigan, 507 U.S. 87, 94 (1993).  The ""knowingly"" requirement is a high burden: the government must prove the defendant had a subjective awareness of the falsity of his statement at the time he provided it.  See, e.g., United States v. Dowdy, 479 F.2d 213, 230 (4th Cir. 1973); United States v. Markiewicz, 978 F.2d 786, 811 (2d Cir. 1992).  It is beyond debate that false testimony provided as a result of confusion, mistake, faulty memory, carelessness, misunderstanding, mistaken conclusions, unjustified inferences testified to negligently, or even recklessness does not satisfy the ""knowingly"" element.  See, e.g., Dunnigan, 507 U.S. at 94; United States v. Dean, 55 F.3d 640, 659 (D.C. Cir. 1995); see also Department of Justice Manual, 1997 Supplement, at 9-69.214.              Moreover, it is of course clear that a statement must be false in order to constitute perjury.  It is equally beyond debate that the following types of answers are not capable of being false and are therefore by definition non-perjurious: literally truthful answers that imply facts that are not true, see, e.g., United States v. Bronston, 409 U.S. 352, 358 (1973), truthful answers to questions that are not asked, see, e.g., United States v. Corr, 543 F.2d 1042, 1049 (2d Cir. 1976), and failures to correct misleading impressions.  See, e.g., United States v. Earp, 812 F.2d 917, 919 (4th Cir. 1987).  The Supreme Court has made abundantly clear that it is not relevant for perjury purposes whether the witness intends his answer to mislead, or indeed intends a ""pattern"" of answers to mislead, if the answers are truthful or literally truthful.              Thus, in explaining the law of perjury, the Supreme Court and numerous lower federal courts have set forth three clear standards. First, answers to questions under oath that are literally true, but unresponsive to the questions asked, do not, as a matter of law, fall under the scope of the federal perjury statute.  That is so even if the witness intends to mislead his questioner by his answer and even if the answer is false by ""negative implication.""  The second clear rule is that answers to questions that are fundamentally ambiguous cannot, as a matter of law, be perjurious.  Finally, a perjury conviction under 18 U.S.C. Sect. 1621  cannot rest solely on the testimony of a single witness, and, at the very least as a matter of practice, no reasonable prosecutor would bring any kind of perjury case based on the testimony of one witness without independent corroboration - especially if the witness is immunized, or has any question as to credibility or truthfulness.  As the Supreme Court has made clear, a perjury case ""ought not to rest entirely upon 'an oath against an oath.'""  United States v. Weiler, 323 U.S. 606, 608-09 (1945).       Bronston and ""Literal Truth.""                In United States v. Bronston, 409 U.S. 352 (1973), the leading case on the law of perjury, the United States Supreme Court addressed ""whether a witness may be convicted of perjury for an answer, under oath, that is literally true but not responsive to the question asked and arguably misleading by negative implication.""   Id. at 352. The Court directly answered the question ""no.""  It made absolutely clear that a literally truthful answer cannot constitute perjury, no matter how much the witness intended by his answer to mislead.              Bronston involved testimony taken under oath at a bankruptcy hearing.  At the hearing, the sole owner of a bankrupt corporation was asked questions about the existence and location of both his personal assets and the assets of his corporation.  The owner testified as follows:        Q:   Do you have any bank accounts in Swiss banks, Mr. Bronston?      A:   No, sir.      Q:   Have you ever?      A:   The company had an account there for about six months in           Zurich.      Q:   Have you any nominees who have bank accounts in Swiss banks?      A:   No, sir.      Q:   Have you ever?      A:   No, sir.      Id. at 354.  The government later proved that Bronston did in fact have a personal Swiss bank account that was terminated prior to his testimony.  The government prosecuted Bronston ""on the theory that in order to mislead his questioner, [Bronston] answered the second question with literal truthfulness but unresponsively addressed his answer to the company's assets and not to his own--thereby implying that he had no personal Swiss bank account at the relevant time.""  Id. at 355.              The Supreme Court unanimously rejected this theory of perjury.  It assumed for purposes of its holding that the questions referred to Bronston's personal bank accounts and not his company's assets.  Moreover, the Court stated, Bronston's ""answer to the crucial question was not responsive,"" and indeed ""an implication in the second answer to the second question [is] that there was never a personal bank account.""  Id. at 358.  The Court went so far as to note that Bronston's answers ""were not guileless but were shrewdly calculated to evade.""  Id. at 361.  However, the Court emphatically held that implications alone do not rise to the level of perjury, and that Bronston therefore could not have committed perjury.  ""[W]e are not dealing with casual conversation and the statute does not make it a criminal act for a witness to willfully state any material matter that implies any material matter that he does not believe to be true.""  Id. at 357-58.  The Court took pains to point out the irrelevance of the witness's intent: ""A jury should not be permitted to engage in conjecture whether an unresponsive answer, true and complete on its face, was intended to mislead or divert the examiner.""  Id. at 359.              The Supreme Court in Bronston provided several rationales for its holding that literally true, non-responsive answers are by definition non-perjurious, regardless of their implications.  First, the Court noted that the burden always rests squarely on the interrogator to ask precise questions, and that a witness is under no obligation to assist the interrogator in that task.  The Court ""perceive[d] no reason why Congress would intend the drastic sanction of a perjury prosecution to cure a testimonial mishap that could readily have been reached with a single additional question by counsel alert - as every counsel ought to be--to the incongruity of petitioner's unresponsive answer.""  Id. at 359.   Moreover, the Court noted that because of the adversarial process, perjury is an extraordinary sanction that is almost always unwarranted, since ""a prosecution for perjury is not the sole, or even the primary safeguard against errant testimony.""  Id. at 360.  The perjury statute cannot be invoked ""simply because a wily witness succeeds in derailing the questioner - so long as the witness speaks the literal truth.""  Id.              Bronston is just one of scores of cases across the federal circuits that make clear that the definition of perjury must be carefully limited because perjury prosecutions are dangerous to the public interest since they ""discourage witnesses from appearing or testifying.""  Id. at 359.(23)   For instance, in United States v. Earp, 812 F.2d 917 (4th Cir. 1987), the defendant, a member of the Ku Klux Klan, had stood guard during the attempted burning of a cross on the lawn of an interracial couple, and further evidence demonstrated that he had personally engaged in other attempts to burn crosses.  During questioning before a grand jury, however, he denied ever having burned crosses on anyone's lawn.  He was convicted of perjury, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed his conviction, because ""like the witness in Bronston, [the defendant's] answers were literally true although his second answer was unresponsive.""  Id. at 919.  That is, the defendant had not actually succeeded in his cross-burning attempts, so it was literally true that he had never  burned crosses on anyone's lawn.  The court noted that ""while he no  doubt knew full well that he had on that occasion tried to burn a cross, he was not specifically asked either about any attempted cross  burnings.""  Id.  Literally every federal court of appeals in the nation concurs in this reading of Bronston.(24)        2.   Fundamentally Ambiguous Questions Cannot Produce Perjurious           Answers.            When a question or a line of questioning is ""fundamentally     ambiguous,"" the answers to the questions posed are insufficient as a matter of law to support a perjury conviction.""  See, e.g., United States v. Finucan, 708 F.2d 838, 848 (1st Cir. 1983); United States v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 375 (2d Cir. 1986); United States v. Tonelli, 577 F.2d 194, 199 (3d Cir. 1978); United States v. Bell, 623 F.2d 1132, 1337 (5th Cir. 1980); United States v. Wall, 371 F.2d 398, 400 (6th Cir. 1967); United States v. Williams, 552 F.2d 226, 229 (8th Cir. 1977).  In other words, when there is more than one way of understanding the meaning of a question, and the witness has answered truthfully as to his understanding, he cannot commit perjury.  Many courts have emphasized that ""defendants may not be assumed into the penitentiary"" by ""sustain[ing] a perjury charge based on [an] ambiguous line of questioning.""  Tonelli, 577 F.2d at 199.              United States v. Lattimore, 127 F. Supp. 405 (D.D.C. 1955), is the key case dealing with ambiguous questions in the perjury context.  In Lattimore, a witness was questioned before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee about his ties to the Communist party. He was asked whether he was a ""follower of the Communist line,"" and whether he had been a ""promoter of Communist interests.""  He answered ""no"" to both questions, and was subsequently indicted for committing perjury.  The United States District Court for the District of Columbia found that the witness could not be indicted on ""charges so formless and obscure as those before the Court.""  Id. at 413.  The court held that ""'follower of the Communist line' is not a phrase with a meaning about which men of ordinary intellect could agree, nor one which could be used with mutual understanding by a questioner and answerer unless it were defined at the time it were sought and offered as testimony.""  Id. at 110.  As the court explained further:        [The phrase] has no universally accepted definition.  The      Government has defined it in one way and seeks to impute      its definition to the defendant.  Defendant has declined to      adopt it, offering a definition of his own.  It would not      necessitate great ingenuity to think up definitions      differing from those offered either by the Government or      defendant.  By groundless surmise only could the jury      determine which definition defendant had in mind.       Id. at 109.              Many other cases stand for the proposition that a witness  cannot commit perjury by answering an inherently ambiguous question.   For instance, in United States v. Wall, 371 F.2d 398 (6th Cir. 1967), a  witness was asked whether she had ""been on trips with Mr. X,"" and she  answered ""no.""  The government could prove that in fact the witness, who was from Oklahoma City, had been in Florida with ""Mr. X.""  However, the government could not prove that the witness had traveled from Oklahoma  City to Florida with ""Mr. X.""  The court noted (and the government conceded) that the phrase ""been on trips"" could mean at least two  different things: ""That a person accompanied somebody else travelling  with, or it can mean that they were there at a particular place with a  person.""  The court then stated that ""[t]he trouble with this case is  that the question upon which the perjury charge was based was inarticulately phrased, and, as admitted by the prosecution, was susceptible of two different meanings.  In our opinion, no charge of  perjury can be based upon an answer to such a question.""  Id. at  399-400.              Similarly, in United States v. Tonelli, 577 F.2d 194 (3d Cir. 1978), the defendant answered negatively a question whether he had ""hand led any pension fund checks.""  The government then proved that the  defendant had actually handled the transmission of pension fund checks  by arranging for others to send, mail, or deliver the checks.  The  government charged the defendant with perjury.  The court held that  perjury could not result from the government's ambiguous question.  The court explained:             It is clear that the defendant interpreted the prosecutor's      questions about 'handling' to mean 'touching' . . . To sustain a      perjury charge based on the ambiguous line of questioning here       would require us to assume [defendant] interpreted 'handle' to       include more than 'touching.'  The record will not allow us to do       so and as the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has observed       '[e]specially in perjury cases defendants may not be assumed into       the penitentiary.       United States v. Bell, 623 F.2d 1132, 1137 (5th Cir. 1980), is yet     another example of this doctrine.  In Bell, a witness was asked before a grand jury, ""Whether personal or business do you have records that are asked for in the subpoena,"" and the witness answered, ""No, sir, I do  not.""  It was later established that the witness's files clearly  contained relevant records.  Nonetheless, the court held that the  question was ambiguous, and therefore incapable of yielding a  perjurious answer.  The witness interpreted the question to ask whether  he had brought the records with him that day, and not whether he had  any records anywhere else in the world.(25)        3.   A Perjury Case Must Not Be Based Solely Upon the Testimony           of a Single Witness.            The law is clear that in a perjury prosecution under 18 U.S.C.     Sect. 1621, the falsity of a statement alleged to be perjurious cannot  be established by the testimony of just one witness.  This ancient  common law rule, referred to as the ""two-witness rule,"" has survived  repeated challenges to its legitimacy, and has been judicially  recognized as the standard of proof for perjury prosecutions brought  under Sect. 1621.  See, e.g., Weiler v. United States, 323 U.S. 606,  608-610 (1945) (discussing the history and policy rationales of the  two-witness rule); United States v. Chaplin, 25 F.3d 1373, 1377-78  (7th Cir. 1994) (two-witness rule applies to perjury prosecutions).   The Department of Justice recognizes the applicability of the  two-witness rule to perjury prosecutions brought under Sect. 1621.   See Department of Justice Manual, 1997 Supplement, at 9-69.265.              The crux of the two-witness rule is that ""the falsity of a statement alleged to be perjurious must be established either by the testimony of two independent witnesses, or by one witness and  independent corroborating evidence which is inconsistent with the  innocence of the accused.""  Department of Justice Manual, 1997  Supplement, at 9-69.265 (emphasis in original).  The second witness must give testimony independent of the first which, if believed, would  ""prove that what the accused said under oath was false.""  Id.; United  States v. Maultasch, 596 F.2d 19, 25 (2d Cir. 1979).  Alternatively,  the independent corroborating evidence must be inconsistent with the  innocence of the accused and ""of a quality to assure that a guilty  verdict is solidly founded.""  Department of Justice Manual, 1997  Supplement, at 9-69.265; United States v. Forrest, 639 F.2d 1224, 1226 (5th Cir. 1981).  It is therefore clear that a perjury conviction under Sect. 1621 cannot lie where there is no independent second witness who corroborates the first, or where there is no independent evidence that  convincingly contradicts the testimony of the accused.              While 18 U.S.C. Sect. 1623 does not incorporate the  ""two-witness rule,"" it is nonetheless clear from the case law that perjury prosecutions require a high degree of proof, and that  prosecutors should not, as a matter of reason and practicality, even  try to bring perjury prosecutions based solely on the testimony of a  single witness.  In Weiler v. United States, 323 U.S. 606, 608-09  (1945), the United States Supreme Court observed that ""[t]he  special  rule which bars conviction for perjury solely upon the evidence of a single witness is deeply rooted in past centuries.""  The Court  further observed that ""equally honest witnesses may well have differing recollections of the same event,"" and hence ""a conviction for perjury  ought not to rest entirely upon 'an oath against an oath.'""  Id. at 609 (emphasis added).  Indeed, the common law courts in seventeenth-century England required the testimony of two witnesses as a precondition to a  perjury conviction, when the testimony of a single witness was in almost all other cases sufficient.  See Chaplin, 25 F.3d at 1377, citing  Wigmore on Evidence Sect. 2040(a), at 359-60 (Chadbourne rev. 1978).   The common law courts actually adopted the two-witness rule from the  Court of Star Chamber, which had followed the practice of the  ecclesiastical courts of requiring two witnesses in perjury cases.  Id.  The English rationale for the rule is as resonant today as it was in  the seventeenth century:  ""[I]n all other criminal cases the accused could not testify, and thus one oath for the prosecution was in any case something as against nothing; but on a charge of perjury the accused's  oath was always in effect evidence and thus, if but one witness was  offered, there would be merely . . . an oath against an oath.""  Id.   And, as noted above, no perjury case should rest merely upon ""an oath  against an oath.""    B.   The Jones Deposition              Without knowledge of the OIC's specific allegations it is impossible to address why any particular claim of perjury fails although we are confident that no colorable claim of perjury can be made out.   However, illegal leaks and speculation make clear that there are certain misperceptions about this testimony that can immediately be laid to  rest.  For example,        Allegation:    The President falsely testified in his Jones                      deposition that he was never alone with Ms.                      Lewinsky.      Not so.  The President acknowledged in his deposition that he met with  Ms. Lewinsky on up to five occasions while she worked at the White  House.  (p. 50).  He then referred back to that testimony when asked if  he ever was alone with her in the Oval Office (p. 52), and again when  asked whether he was alone with her in any room in the White House.   (p. 59).  The Jones lawyers did not follow up and ask the President to  describe the nature of any physical contact that may have occurred on  these occasions.        Allegation:    The President falsely testified in his Jones                      deposition that he never had any improper physical                      contact of any kind with Ms. Lewinsky.      Not so.  The President was asked whether he had ""an extramarital sexual affair"" with Ms. Lewinsky (p. 78) and responded that he did not.  That  term was undefined and ambiguous.  The President understood the term  ""sexual affair"" to involve a relationship involving sexual intercourse.  He had no such relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.              The President also was asked whether he had ""sexual relations"" with Ms. Lewinsky, ""as that term is defined in Deposition Exhibit 1, as modified by the Court."" (p. 59).  The Court explicitly directed the President's attention to Definition Number 1 on Exhibit 1, which the President had circled.              The President denied he had ""sexual relations"" with Ms.  Lewinsky under this definition.  Although the President's counsel, Mr.  Bennett, had invited the Jones lawyers to ask specific questions about  the President's conduct--""Why don't they ask the President what he did,  what he didn't do, and then we can argue in Court later about what it  means?"" (p. 21)--the Jones lawyers declined to do so, relying instead  on the definition.  The President was not asked any specific questions  at all about his physical contact with Ms. Lewinsky, and in particular  he was not pointedly asked whether he had engaged in any of the conduct outside the definition provided.  The President's testimony in response to these questions was accurate.  He did not have sexual intercourse  with Ms. Lewinsky or otherwise engage in sexual conduct covered by the  definition, as provided by plaintiff and narrowed by the Court.              The President also testified in the Jones deposition that Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit, in which she stated she had never had a ""sexual relationship"" with the President, was accurate (p. 204).  He believed  this testimony to be truthful.  The term ""sexual relationship"" was not  defined in the affidavit or in the deposition.  The definition of the  different term ""sexual relations"" utilized by the Jones lawyers did not  apply to that question.  The term ""sexual relationship,"" like sexual  affair, has no definitive meaning.  To the President, that term  reasonably requires sexual intercourse as a necessary component of the  relationship.  Since his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky did not involve intercourse, he truthfully answered that the affidavit was accurate.        Allegation:    The President falsely testified in his Jones                      deposition that his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky                      was the same as that with any other White House                      intern.      Not so.  The President's answers left no doubt that he had a special relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.  He acknowledged knowing how she had  gotten her internship at the White House.  He acknowledged meeting with her and knowing where she worked after leaving the White House.  He  acknowledged exchanging small gifts with her.  He acknowledged that he  knew she was moving to New York and that her mother had moved there.   He acknowledged knowing about her job search in New York, and that she  had had an interview with (then) U.N. Ambassador Bill Richardson.  He  acknowledged that Mr. Jordan reported on his meeting with Ms. Lewinsky  about her New York job search.  He acknowledged receiving cards and  notes from her through Ms. Betty Currie.  The Jones lawyers received  affirmative responses to particular questions.  Had they opted to ask  precise questions on other matters, they would have received truthful  responses.  They did not do so.     VIII.  THE LEWINSKY EXPANSION OF THE WHITEWATER INVESTIGATION               The expansion of the Independent Counsel's jurisdiction to encompass the Jones case and Ms. Lewinsky did not occur by accident or easily.  The OIC deliberately and purposefully sought this expansion on an emergency basis.  Media accounts that the Attorney General herself requested this expansion are highly misleading.              On January 16, 1998, upon the OIC's request, the Special  Division of the Court of Appeals for the Purpose of Appointing  Independent Counsels expanded the OIC's jurisdiction to allow it to  investigate ""whether Monica Lewinsky or others suborned perjury,  obstructed justice, intimidated witnesses, or otherwise violated  federal law . . . in dealing with witnesses, potential witnesses,  attorneys, or others concerning the civil case Jones v. Clinton.""   Order, Div. No. 94-1 (Jan. 16, 1998) (Div. for Purpose of Appointing  Independent Counsel) (D.C. Cir.).  The series of events that led to  this expansion of authority raise serious questions as to the  motivations and manipulations of the OIC in securing this expanded  jurisdiction.              Under the Independent Counsel statute, if the ""independent counsel discovers or receives information about possible violations of criminal law by [covered persons], which are not covered by the prosecutorial jurisdiction of the independent counsel, the independent  counsel may submit such information to the Attorney General.""  28  U.S.C. Sect. 593 (c)(2)(A).  The Attorney General is then to conduct a  preliminary investigation.  28 U.S.C. Sect. 592.  The statute did not  give the OIC authority to conduct its own preliminary investigation in  order to gather or create evidence to present to the Attorney General  to support a request for an expansion of jurisdiction.              According to media reports, Ms. Linda Tripp contacted the  OIC on Monday, January 12, 1998.  There was no particular logic to  this contact, and she could easily have taken her concerns to state or  federal authorities.  In any event, the OIC arranged for Ms. Tripp to  wear an F.B.I. recording device and tape surreptitiously a conversation that she had with Ms. Lewinsky the next day, Tuesday, January 13, 1998  (Ms. Lewinsky had not yet filed an affidavit in the Jones case).  On  Friday, January 16, 1998, at the OIC's request, Ms. Tripp lured  Ms. Lewinsky to a meeting, where she was apprehended by OIC agents,  who confronted her and attempted to pressure her into doing  surreptitious taping herself.  She was informed that an immunity  agreement was contingent on her not contacting her lawyer.(26)              That same day, the Special Division agreed to expand the  OIC's authority, based upon the Independent Counsel's earlier  application to the Attorney General and on the tapes that the OIC had  already created:  ""In a taped conversation with a cooperating witness,  Ms. Lewinsky states that she intends to lie when deposed.  In the same  conversation, she urges the cooperating witness to lie in her own  upcoming deposition. . . . Independent Counsel Starr has requested that this matter be referred to him."" (Text of Attorney General's Petition  to Special Division, The Associated Press, January 29, 1998.)              The Independent Counsel later suggested that the expansion of authority prior to the taping was unnecessary, as it was already within  his jurisdiction.  However, the Lewinsky matter had no connection  whatsoever to the Whitewater activities, or any other activities, then  being investigated by the OIC.    In addition, the Attorney General  specifically stated in her referral to the Special Division that she  was seeking an expansion of the Independent Counsel's jurisdiction.  Or, as former independent counsel Michael Zeldin pointed out, ""If he had  jurisdiction to investigate it when he wired her, why did he have to go to court to get it afterward?  In some ways, he is talking out of both  sides of his mouth. . . .  It seems to me arguable that he obtained  evidence unlawfully . . . .""  Chicago Tribune, January 25, 1998.  And  former independent counsel Lawrence Walsh declared, ""A prosecutor has  no business getting into that case [Paula Jones] unless there's  something terrible happening.  I question Starr's judgment in going  into it so hard."" Chicago Tribune, January 25, 1998.              Furthermore, the sequence of events suggests that Independent Counsel Starr deliberately delayed requesting the expansion of jurisdiction.  Neither Monica Lewinsky nor President Clinton had made  any statements under oath in the Jones case (at least that had been  filed with any court) when Linda Tripp approached the OIC on January 12. The only evidence the OIC possessed at that time were tapes illegally  created by Tripp.  The OIC itself proceeded to tape the Tuesday,  January 13 conversation between Tripp and Lewinsky.  Ms. Lewinsky's  affidavit was not filed in the Jones case until January 16, and the OIC had petitioned the Attorney General the day before for an expansion of  authority based on the evidence  (the Tripp tapes and the OIC's tape)  that he had acquired without any authority to do so.              Ms. Tripp remained through the day at the hotel where Ms. Lewinsky was apprehended by the OIC on Friday, January 16, 1998.(27) During  that day, Ms. Jones' lawyers repeatedly tried to contact Ms.  Tripp for a meeting, but she was unavailable.  Ibid.  Late in the  afternoon, when it became clear that Ms. Lewinsky would not cooperate  in the surreptitious taping of others, the Jones lawyers received a  call arranging a meeting with Ms. Tripp for that night, so she could  help them prepare for the President's deposition next day.  Ibid.(28)   It seems probable that Ms. Tripp, who was acting as the OIC's agent  under an immunity agreement, must have gotten approval for this  briefing from the OIC.  Ms. Tripp met with the Jones lawyers at her  home in Maryland that night and briefed them on the illegal tapes she  had made of Ms. Lewinsky(29), so they could use the contents of those  tapes in their questioning of the President.(30)  Ms. Tripp is under  investigation in the state of Maryland because she secretly recorded  Ms. Lewinsky and then shared the existence and contents of those tapes  with the Jones lawyers.  It is a crime in that state, punishable by  imprisonment up to five years and a fine of up to $10,000, for a person to ""wilfully"" record a conversation without the consent of both parties or to ""wilfully"" disclose the contents of such an illegally recorded  conversation.  Md. Code Ann. Sect. 10-402 (1997).(31)              On January 17, armed with the information obtained from Ms. Tripp, Ms. Jones' attorneys deposed President Clinton in great detail regarding Ms. Lewinsky.  At about this time, the OIC sought to prevent press coverage of its attempt to have Ms. Lewinsky cooperate in secret taping.(32)              This entire sequence of events--the OIC's delay in requesting jurisdiction, the OIC's pressure on reporters to withhold public  disclosure of the matter,(33) the OIC's unwillingness to permit Ms.  Lewinsky to contact her lawyer, and the OIC's dispatch of Ms. Tripp to  brief the Jones lawyers about the fruits of her illegal taping the day  before they were to depose the President--suggests an intention by the  OIC to ensure that the expansion of jurisdiction was kept a secret  until the President and Ms. Lewinsky had given testimony under oath  and (if Ms. Lewinsky could be so persuaded) she had been enlisted to  do surreptitious taping.  In other words, rather than taking steps to  defer or avoid any possible interference with the Jones case, the OIC  did everything in its power--and some things outside its authority--to set up a case against the President.

Lundwall, 1 F. Supp. 2d 249, 251-54 (S.D.N.Y.       1998) (noting that ""[c]ases involving prosecutions for document      destruction during civil pre-trial discovery are notably absent       from the extensive body of reported Sect. 1503 case law,"" and that       ""there are a great many good reasons why federal prosecutors       should be reluctant to bring criminal charges relating to conduct       in ongoing civil litigation,"" but concluding that systematic       destruction of documents sought during discovery should satisfy       Sect. 1503).      (20) The term ""talking points"" refers to a document apparently provided by       Ms. Lewinsky to Ms. Tripp in January 1998 regarding possible testimony      in the Jones case.      (21) ""Perjury"" was not even in the original grant of jurisdiction to the        OIC but reportedly is now the crux of the OIC's case.    (22) There are two basic federal perjury statutes: 18 U.S.C. Sect. 1621,       and 18 U.S.C. Sect. 1623.  Section 1621 applies to all material       statements or information provided under oath ""to a competent       tribunal, officer, or person, in any case in which a law of the       United States authorizes an oath to be administered.""  Section       1623, in contrast, applies only to testimony given before a grand       jury and other court proceedings.  Although there are differences       between the two statutes, the four basic elements of each are       substantially the same.      (23) While Bronston involved a perjury conviction under the general        perjury statute, 18 U.S.C. Sect. 1621, lower federal courts have       uniformly relied on it in reviewing perjury convictions under       Sect. 1623(a), which makes it unlawful to make any false material       declaration ""in any proceeding before or ancillary to any court or      grand jury of the United States.""  See, e.g., United States v.       Porter, 994 F.2d 470, 474 n. 7 (8th Cir.1993); United States v.       Reveron Martinez, 836 F.2d 684, 689 (1st Cir.1988); United States       v.

(25) Many other cases as well hold that ambiguous questions cannot        produce perjurious answers.  See, e.g., Lighte, 782 F.2d at 376 (      questions fundamentally ambiguous because of imprecise use of       ""you,"" ""that,"" and ""again""); United States v.

Markiewicz,       978 F.2d 786, 809 (2d Cir. 1992) (question ""[D]id you receive any       money that had been in bingo hall"" ambiguous, and incapable of       producing perjurious answer, when it did not differentiate between      witness's personal and business capacities).

Hilliard, 31 F.3d 1509 (10th Cir. 1994).      (26) Time, Feb. 16, 1998, at 49.    (27) ""Linda Tripp Briefed Jones Team on Tapes,"" The Washington Post,         Feb. 14, 1998, at A1.    (28) The Washington Times, Feb. 15, 1998,at A1, reported:             ""Yesterday, a source close to Mrs. Jones' legal team confirmed           that on Jan. 16, the day before Mrs. Jones' lawyers took a           deposition from Mr. Clinton, Mrs. Tripp met for two hours with           those lawyers at her suburban Maryland home and discussed at           length what Miss Lewinsky had said in some 20 hours of            secretly recorded conversations.  Mrs. Tripp had already given           those tapes to Mr. Starr's investigators.            With the information from Mrs. Tripp, the Jones lawyers were            able to ask Mr. Clinton in his deposition specific questions            about his relationship with and gifts to Miss Lewinsky,            according to a person informed about the President's            testimony.""      (29) Under the Maryland electronic surveillance statute, which        criminalizes taping without the consent of both parties, it is a       violation of the statute simply to disclose that an illegal tape       has been made, since the term ""Contents"", as used in the statute       to define what may not be disclosed, is defined to include ""any       information concerning the identity of the parties to the       communication or the existence, substance, purport, or meaning of       that communication.""  Md. Code Ann. Sect. 10-401(7) (1997)       (emphasis added).      (30) There is no doubt that the Jones lawyers believed they had a       significant tactical advantage due to their knowledge of the Tripp      tapes.  They may also have known that Ms. Tripp was an OIC agent.      After being asked a highly specific series of questions about Ms.      Lewinsky, the President replied, ""I don't even know what you're      talking about, I don't think,"" and one of the Jones lawyers,       James Fisher, responded, ""Sir, I think this will come to light       shortly, and you'll understand"" (p. 85).      (31) Recent news reports indicate that Ms. Tripp was specifically warned       at the Radio Shack store where she brought her tape recorder that       it was illegal to tape in Maryland without the con sent of the       other party.  See, e.g., ""Tripp Was Told of Law at Store,"" The       Baltimore Sun, Aug. 28, 1998, at A1.      (32) ""Pressgate"", Brill's Content, August 1998, at 128.

Isikoff says he agreed to hold       off in exchange for getting a full report on how the stings had       gone."").                                   # # #"

This action involves a financial fraud designed to falsely inflate the sales revenue, accounts receivable, and inventory of Suprema Specialties, Inc. (""Suprema""), a publicly-traded company based in Paterson, New Jersey that was formerly engaged in the manufacturing, processing, and distribution of cheese and cheese products.  The fraudulent scheme commenced in or around 1998 or earlier, and continued into February 2002, when Suprema filed for bankruptcy.    2. The fraudulent scheme was orchestrated by Suprema's management with the direct participation of Suprema's employees and certain vendors to and customers of Suprema, and their owners and operators.  The named defendants are Suprema employees, vendors, customers, and the owners and operators of Suprema customers and vendors.    3. The fraudulent scheme had three main components.  First, the scheme involved fictitious circular ""round-tripping"" transactions between Suprema and certain of its customers and vendors.  From 1998 through and including the first quarter of 2002, these fictitious round-tripping transactions resulted in Suprema's reporting of fictitious sales that represented approximately 60% of Suprema's total reported revenue of approximately $1.13 billion.  From 1998 through the bankruptcy filing, the fictitious sales revenue on Suprema's books and records totaled over $700 million.  The fictitious sales also accounted for approximately 30%, 65%, 85%, and 87% of the accounts receivable reported by Suprema at the end of fiscal years 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001, respectively.  Second, imitation cheese and non-cheese products were falsely re-labeled as premium cheeses to fraudulently inflate Suprema's inventory.  Third, certain of Suprema's cheese products were adulterated with various imitation cheese and other non-cheese ingredients in order to reduce Suprema's costs and boost sales.  The illegal adulteration of Suprema's cheeses was contrary to the repeated statements in the company's filings with the Commission that Suprema sold ""natural"" or ""all natural"" cheeses that met applicable federal standards.  All three components of the fraudulent scheme resulted in material misstatements in Suprema's periodic reports filed with the Commission during its fiscal years 1998 through 2001 and the first quarter of 2002, as well as Suprema's registration statements filed with the Commission for its secondary public offerings in 2000 and 2001.    4. While the defendants were engaged in this fraudulent scheme, Suprema continued to offer additional securities for sale, using fraudulent and materially false financial statements and financial information in the course of those offers and sales.  As a result of the fraudulent scheme, Suprema's public investors and potential investors were deceived into believing that Suprema's revenues were materially better than they actually were.    5. By knowingly or recklessly engaging in the acts alleged in this Complaint, defendants violated, or aided and abetted violations of, the anti-fraud, reporting, books and records, internal controls, and lying to auditors provisions of the federal securities laws.    6. Unless enjoined by this Court, it is likely that each defendant will continue to engage in such violative conduct.  Therefore, the Commission seeks this Court's injunction against future violations directed to each defendant, officer and director bars against the individual defendants, as well as disgorgement of unjust enrichment, prejudgment interest, and statutory civil penalties as described in its prayer for relief.    JURISDICTION     7. The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 20(b) and 20(d) of the Securities Act of 1933 (""Securities Act"")  [15 U.S.C. § 77t(b), (d)], and Section 21(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""Exchange Act"") [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)].    8. This Court has jurisdiction of this action pursuant to Sections 20 and 22(a) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77t and 77v(a)] and pursuant to Sections 21(d) and (e) and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d), (e) and 78aa].      9. The defendants, and each of them, directly or indirectly, have made use of the means or instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or of the mails, or the facilities of a national securities exchange in connection with the transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business alleged herein.    DEFENDANTS    10. ARTHUR CHRISTENSEN, age 34, began working as an accountant with Suprema in 1994 and served as controller of the company from 1997 until his resignation on December 19, 2001.      11. JOHN VAN SICKELL, age 43, was the operations manager of Suprema's plant in Paterson, New Jersey from 1996 until 2000, when he was promoted to be assistant to the executive vice president of Suprema.  VAN SICKELL continued to work for Suprema until March 2002, when Suprema's bankruptcy proceeding was converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation.        12. GEORGE VIEIRA, age 42, became chief operations officer for Suprema's subsidiary facility in California following the death of the company's former executive vice president in August 2001 and remained in that position until March 2002.  From at least 1998 through March 2002, VIEIRA owned and/or operated California Milk Market and West Coast Commodities, Inc. and was president and chairman of the board of West Coast Commodities, Inc.    13. CALIFORNIA MILK MARKET (""CMM"") is a non-public corporation incorporated and located in California that brokers the sale of milk and milk-related products.      14. WEST COAST COMMODITIES, INC. (""WCC"") is a non-public corporation incorporated and located in California that brokers the sale of cattle and animal food products.    15. LAWRENCE FRANSEN, age 49, owns LNN Enterprises, Inc., and also owns a 25% interest in Wall Street Cheese, LLC, both of which he operates.  FRANSEN is also the founder and president of LNN Enterprises, Inc.    16. LNN ENTERPRISES, INC. (""LNN"") is a sole proprietorship incorporated and located   in California that brokers cheese transactions.      17. ROBERT QUATTRONE, age 46, owns, operates, and is president of both Battaglia & Company, Inc. and Packing Products, Inc.      18. BATTAGLIA & COMPANY, INC. (""BATTAGLIA"") is a non-public corporation incorporated and located in New Jersey that imports and sells cheese, as well as other food products.     19. PACKING PRODUCTS, INC. (""PACKING PRODUCTS"") is a non-public corporation incorporated and located in New Jersey that imports and sells cheese, as well as other food products.    OTHER RELEVANT ENTITIES    20. California Goldfield Cheese Trading, LLC (""California Goldfield"") is a non-public company registered as an LLC and located at different times in California and in Colorado that purchases and sells cheese products.    21. Founded in 1983, Suprema, a New York corporation based in Paterson, New Jersey, held itself out as a manufacturer, processor and distributor of ""all natural"" gourmet Italian cheeses.  Suprema maintained three wholly owned subsidiary facilities in California, New York, and Idaho.  Suprema held its initial public offering in 1991 and registered its securities with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act.  As such, the company was required to file periodic reports with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 of the Act.  The company adopted a fiscal year ending on June 30.  Suprema's common stock was traded on the over-the-counter market starting on April 25, 1991, as well as on the NASDAQ National Market System from March 22, 1993 until March 1, 2002, when the stock was delisted.  Suprema is presently liquidating pursuant to a Chapter 7 proceeding in federal bankruptcy court.    22. Wall Street Cheese, LLC (""Wall Street"") is a non-public company registered as an LLC and located in California that purchases and sells cheese products.    THE FRAUDULENT SCHEME    23. In every fiscal year from 1996 forward, Suprema claimed annual double-digit growth in sales and revenues.  The company borrowed against its accounts receivable and inventory to obtain a revolving credit line with a consortium of banks that rose to $140 million by the end of 2001.  Suprema held secondary public offerings in August 2000 and November 2001 that raised over $8 million and $48 million, respectively.  In fiscal 2001, which ended on June 30 of the calendar year, Suprema reported over $420 million in revenues, an increase of over 50% from the prior fiscal year, and reported $8.9 million in net income.    24. From at least 1998 through the first quarter of 2002, however, Suprema's apparent success was the product of a fraudulent scheme orchestrated and managed by the company's management with the defendants' direct and knowing involvement.  The scheme had three main components.    I.   The ""Round-Tripping"" Fraud    A.  The False Transactions    25. First, from at least 1998 through early 2002, Suprema engaged in circular round-tripping transactions that generated fictitious sales revenues.  Each round-tripping ""circle"" in this scheme involved three parties:  Suprema, a third-party ""customer,"" and a related ""vendor.""  In most instances, the customer and vendor in these circles shared a common owner.  With some exceptions as noted below, the fraud operated as follows:  Fictitious paperwork was created purporting to represent sales of cheese products from Suprema to a customer involved in the fraud.  The customer then purportedly sold those or other products to the related vendor.  This was followed by a fictitious sale of other products (often purporting to be the raw materials for cheese manufacturing) from the vendor back to Suprema.  With rare exception, no goods were actually sold or purchased, or otherwise changed hands, in these transactions.      26. On each leg of the circle — Suprema to the customer, customer to the vendor, and vendor back to Suprema — the entity purporting to sell goods created false and fictitious invoices and bills of lading to document the false transaction, and the entity purporting to buy goods generated a check in payment for the same false transaction.    27. These circular round-tripping transactions resulted in a continuous flow of checks from Suprema to the vendors involved in the fraud, from the vendors to the related customers, and from the customers back to Suprema, all purportedly in payment for the fictitious sales.  Typically, the checks from Suprema to the vendors involved in the fraud were greater than the corresponding checks from the related customer back to Suprema.  This difference in the checks represented a kick-back or ""commission"" paid to the common owner of the customer and vendor for his participation in the fraudulent scheme.  Funds for the checks, including commissions, were drawn on Suprema's line of credit, which increased as Suprema's accounts receivable grew.    B.  Defendants' Participation in the Round-Tripping Transactions    28. From at least 1998 through the first quarter of 2002, Suprema engaged in round-tripping transactions with BATTAGLIA as a customer and PACKING PRODUCTS as a vendor; both of these companies were owned and operated by defendant QUATTRONE.  During this period, Suprema recognized approximately $108 million in fraudulent revenue from the round-tripping transactions with BATTAGLIA and PACKING PRODUCTS.  Defendant QUATTRONE participated in the round-tripping fraud, received false invoices reflecting fictitious sales from Suprema to BATTAGLIA, generated false invoices reflecting fictitious purchases by Suprema from PACKING PRODUCTS, circulated checks purportedly in payment for these fictitious transactions, and signed false audit confirmations that were provided to Suprema's independent auditors purporting to confirm the existence of the fictitious transactions.  For his participation in the fraudulent scheme to inflate Suprema's publicly reported revenues, QUATTRONE was paid approximately $1.3 million in ""commissions.""    29. From at least 1998 through the first quarter of 2002, Suprema engaged in round-tripping transactions with WCC and CMM; both of these companies were owned and/or operated by defendant VIEIRA.  In most transactions, WCC assumed the role of a customer and CMM assumed the role of a vendor, although there were variations on this arrangement.  During this period, Suprema recognized approximately $34 million in fraudulent revenue from the round-tripping transactions with WCC and CMM.  Defendant VIEIRA participated in the round-tripping fraud, received false invoices reflecting fictitious sales from Suprema to WCC, generated false invoices reflecting fictitious purchases by Suprema from CMM, circulated checks purportedly in payment for these fictitious transactions, and signed false audit confirmations that were provided to Suprema's independent auditors purporting to confirm the existence of the fictitious transactions.  For his participation in the fraudulent scheme to inflate Suprema's publicly reported revenues, VIEIRA was paid between $200,000 and $300,000 in ""commissions.""     30. From at least 2000 through the first quarter of 2002, Suprema engaged in round-tripping transactions with Wall Street as a customer and LNN as a vendor; both of these companies were owned in whole or in part and were operated by defendant FRANSEN.  In some instances, California Goldfield rather than LNN assumed the role of a vendor in Suprema's round-tripping transactions with Wall Street.  During this period, Suprema recognized approximately $27 million in fraudulent revenue from the round-tripping transactions with Wall Street and LNN.   Defendant FRANSEN participated in the round-tripping fraud, received false invoices reflecting fictitious sales from Suprema to Wall Street, generated false invoices reflecting fictitious purchases by Suprema from LNN, circulated checks purportedly in payment for these fictitious transactions, and signed false audit confirmations that were provided to Suprema's independent auditors purporting to confirm the existence of the fictitious transactions.  For his participation in the fraudulent scheme to inflate Suprema's publicly reported revenues, FRANSEN was paid approximately $112,000 in ""commissions.""     31. In furtherance of the round-tripping fraud, one or more officers and directors of Suprema not named as defendants in this Complaint created false paperwork and instructed QUATTRONE, VIEIRA, and FRANSEN to sign the false audit confirmations, all of which were provided to Suprema's independent auditors purporting to confirm the existence of the fictitious transactions.        32. In furtherance of the round-tripping fraud, defendant VAN SICKELL, acting at the direction of one or more of Suprema's officers, relabeled the company's inventory, delivered and retrieved checks in person, and created fraudulent paperwork.  VAN SICKELL knew that no goods changed hands in the transactions referenced in the fraudulent paperwork he created.    33.  From at least 1998 to August 2001, defendant CHRISTENSEN knew of the creation of false invoices and bills of lading reflecting fictitious sales by Suprema, but turned a blind eye to this practice on instruction from one or more officers of Suprema.  Starting at least as early as 2000, CHRISTENSEN himself also participated in this practice.  Following the death of Suprema's former executive vice president in August 2001, defendant CHRISTENSEN assumed responsibility, at the direction of one or more officers of Suprema, for coordinating the flow of false invoices and checks in the round-tripping scheme.  CHRISTENSEN continued in this role until December 2001, when he resigned as Suprema's controller.    34. In December 2001, following CHRISTENSEN's resignation, defendant VIEIRA, then chief operating officer for Suprema's subsidiary facility in California, assumed responsibility for coordinating the flow of false invoices and checks in the round-tripping scheme.  VIEIRA continued in this role until February 2002, when Suprema filed for bankruptcy.    35. VAN SICKELL, CHRISTENSEN, VIEIRA, QUATTRONE, and FRANSEN each knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that their respective conduct would result in material misstatements of revenue in the financial statements that Suprema filed with the Commission.  By and through their principals, BATTAGLIA, CMM, LNN, PACKING PRODUCTS, and WCC each knew, or were reckless in not knowing, that their respective conduct would result in material misstatements of revenue in the financial statements that Suprema filed with the Commission.      C. Suprema's Reporting of Fictitious Revenue from the Round-Tripping Transactions in its Filings with the Commission    36. QUATTRONE's participation in fictitious sales transactions with Suprema through BATTAGLIA and PACKING resulted in overstatements in Suprema's reported revenue by approximately 5.7%, 7.4%, 8.8%, 11.6%, and 10.4% in fiscal years 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, and the first quarter of 2002, respectively.  Similarly, VIEIRA's participation through WCC and CMM resulted in overstatements in Suprema's reported revenue by approximately 0.025%, 0.016%, 4.5%, 4.0%, and 3.19% in fiscal years 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, and the first quarter of 2002, respectively.  FRANSEN's participation through Wall Street and LNN resulted in overstatements in Suprema's reported revenue by approximately 1.11%, 3.95%, and 5.87% in fiscal years 2000, 2001, and the first quarter of 2002, respectively.  Collectively, the participation of QUATTRONE, VIEIRA, and FRANSEN resulted in overstatements in Suprema's reported revenue by approximately 5.75%, 7.41%, 14.25%, 19.51%, and 19.48% in fiscal years 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, and the first quarter of 2002, respectively.      37. As a consequence, the round-tripping scheme resulted in material overstatements of Suprema's revenue in the following forms that the company filed with the Commission:  a Form 10-K for each of its fiscal years 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001; a Form 10-Q for the first three quarters of each of those fiscal years and for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2002; and a Form S-2 registration statement for each of the secondary public offerings in August 2000 and November 2001.      II.  The Fraudulent Inflation of Suprema's Inventory    38. The second component of the fraudulent scheme involved a deliberate overvaluation of Suprema's inventory through the purchase of imitation cheeses and other non-cheese products and the subsequent relabeling of these products as high priced premium cheeses.  This component thus enabled Suprema, among other things, to conceal from its auditors and others the fraudulent invoicing scheme and to conceal the fact that Suprema possessed less inventory, or less valuable inventory, than it claimed to have in its filings with the Commission.      39. VAN SICKELL regularly traveled to Suprema's warehouses to meet incoming trucks delivering imitation cheese products from one or more vendors.  These shipments usually occurred in the months leading up to the end of Suprema's fiscal year, in anticipation of the fiscal year-end audit by the company's outside auditors.  VAN SICKELL switched the product labels and bills of lading to designate the products falsely as higher-valued premium cheeses shipped from one of Suprema's subsidiaries.  At the direction of one or more company officers, VAN SICKELL was then to destroy the original product labels and bills of lading for the imitation cheese products.      40. VAN SICKELL knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that this conduct would result in material misstatements of inventory in the financial statements that Suprema filed with the Commission.    41. The fraudulent inflation of Suprema's assets resulted in material misstatements of the company's inventory in the following forms that the company filed with the Commission:  a Form 10-K for each of its fiscal years 1999, 2000, and 2001; a Form 10-Q for the first three quarters of each of those fiscal years and for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2002; and a Form S-2 registration statement for each of the secondary public offerings in August 2000 and November 2001.    III.  The Adulteration of Suprema's Cheese Products    42. The third component of the fraudulent scheme involved the ""cutting"" or adulteration of Suprema's cheeses with inexpensive imitation cheese products, in order to reduce the company's costs and boost sales, contrary to statements in Suprema's filings with the Commission that the company's cheeses were ""natural"" or ""all natural"" and met applicable federal standards.        43. VAN SICKELL and others adulterated Suprema's cheese products using formulas that were developed in response to competitive pressures; the lower the price paid by the customer, the greater the degree of adulteration.  The adulterating ingredients specified by these formulas often consisted principally of food starch and partially hydrogenated soybean oil, as well as other fillers.    44. VAN SICKELL knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that this conduct would result in material misstatements and omissions in Suprema's filings with the Commission.    45. To the contrary, Suprema described its cheeses as ""natural"" in its annual reports in 1998 and 1999, and as ""all natural"" both in its annual reports and in its registration statements in 2000 and 2001.  Suprema's annual report and registration statement in 2001 added that its cheese products were ""premium quality all natural cheeses that meet or exceed all federal and industry standards for purity, freshness, taste, appearance and texture.""  In all of these filings with the Commission, Suprema further stated that its cheese products contained no ""preservatives, additives, sweeteners, dehydrated fillers or artificial flavorings,"" and that the company was in ""substantial compliance"" with ""all material government laws and regulations,"" including federal laws and regulations governing the labeling of its products.  Suprema also failed to disclose its cheese adulteration, not only in all of these filings with the Commission, but also on its product labels or otherwise to its customers.    46. Suprema's claim to sell ""natural"" or ""all natural"" cheeses that met applicable federal standards, and its failure to disclose the cheese adulteration, constituted material misstatements and omissions in the following forms that the company filed with the Commission:  a Form 10-K for each of its fiscal years 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001, and a Form S-2 registration statement for each of the secondary public offerings in August 2000 and November 2001.    THE FRAUDULENT SCHEME COLLAPSES    47. On December 21, 2001, after the close of trading, Suprema issued a press release announcing the resignations of its chief financial officer and its controller.  The same press release also stated that the company had ""initiated an internal investigation of its prior reported financial results and ha[d] instructed its auditors to review the Company's financial records.""      48. Also after the close of trading on December 21, 2001, the Nasdaq halted trading in Suprema's common stock.  The trading halt continued until the Nasdaq delisted Suprema's common stock on March 1, 2002.    49. On February 24, 2002, Suprema filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition for a Chapter 11 reorganization in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.  On March 20, 2002, the bankruptcy was converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation.   In re the Jointly Administered Estate of Suprema Specialties, Inc., et al. , No. 02-10823 (CB) (Bankr. S.D.N.Y.).

Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(2)(B)] requires issuers to, among other things, devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that the company's transactions were recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.    62.  By reason of the conduct described above in paragraphs  1  to  58  inclusive, Suprema violated Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (B) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-13.    63.

Congress enacted the Children's Online        Privacy Protection Act, 15 U.S.C.  6501-6506, in 1998 to protect the        safety and privacy of children online by prohibiting the unauthorized or        unnecessary collection of children's personal information online by        Internet websites and online services. The Act directed the Federal Trade        Commission to promulgate a rule implementing COPPA. The Commission        promulgated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule, 16 C.F.R.        Part 312, on November 3, 1999 under Section 1303(b) of COPPA, 15 U.S.C.         6502(b), and Section 553 of the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C.         553. The Rule went into effect on April 21, 2000.         6. The Rule applies to any operator of a        commercial website or online service directed to children that collects,        uses, and/or discloses personal information from children, or to any        operator that has actual knowledge that it is collecting or maintaining a        child's personal information.          7. The Rule requires a subject website        operator to meet specific requirements prior to collecting online, using,        or disclosing personal information from children, including but not        limited to:                    a. Posting a privacy policy on its          website providing clear, understandable, and complete notice of its          information practices, including what information the website operator          collects from children online, how it uses such information, its          disclosure practices for such information, and other specifically          required disclosures;                       b. Providing clear, understandable,          and complete notice of its information practices directly to parents          when required by the Rule;                       c. Obtaining verifiable parental          consent prior to collecting, using, and/or disclosing personal          information from children;                       d. Giving parents the option to          consent to the collection and internal use of their children's personal          information without consenting to the disclosure of that information to          third parties;                       e. Providing a reasonable means for          parents to review the personal information collected from their children          and to refuse to permit its further use or maintenance; and                       f. Establishing and maintaining          reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and          integrity of personal information collected from children.                 8. Pursuant to Section 18(d)(3) of the        FTC Act, 15 U.S.C.  57a(d)(3), a violation of the Rule constitutes an        unfair or deceptive act or practice, in violation of Section 5(a)(1) of        the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C.  45(a)(1).  See also  COPPA, 15 U.S.C.         6502(c).         DEFENDANT                 9. Defendant Hershey Foods Corporation is        a Delaware corporation with its principal office or place of business        located at 100 Crystal A Drive, Hershey, Pennsylvania, 17033.         10. Defendant markets its chocolate and        non-chocolate confectionery, and chocolate-related grocery products        throughout the Unites States, including through the Internet. Since at        least April 21, 2000, defendant has been the operator of www.hersheys.com,        a website on the Internet, portions of which are directed to children.        Defendant also has operated numerous other websites featuring its        individual name-brand candies or other candy-related themes. Some of these        websites knowingly collect personal information from children.          11. The acts and practices of defendant        alleged in this Complaint have been in or affecting commerce, as        ""commerce"" is defined in Section 4 of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C.  44.         DEFENDANT'S COURSE        OF CONDUCT         12. Defendant operates the        www.hersheys.com website and over thirty other websites dedicated to        particular brand name candies or to other marketing opportunities for its        candies. The www.hersheys.com website includes a ""Kidztown"" area directed        to children. The subject matter, visual content, and language of Kidztown        are targeted to children under the age of 13. For example, Kidztown        features cartoon characters in the shape of candies introducing the        various children's activities. Kidztown's ""Fun & Games"" section includes        mazes, hidden words, simple crossword puzzles and coloring activities.        Kidztown also includes a section titled ""Candy of the Month."" ( See         Exhibit A.)          13. Defendant collects or has collected        personal information from children through the operation of the Kidztown        portion of its website. In addition, defendant operates other websites,        such as www.paydaybar.com and www.reesefastbreak.com, through which it has        collected personal information from its visitors. Many of these websites        are targeted to children under the age of 13; others are general audience        websites where the defendant had actual knowledge that the visitors giving        their personal information were under the age of 13. Defendant is,        therefore, an ""operator"" as defined in the Rule.         Defendant's        Information Collection, Use and Disclosure Practices         14. Children who visited the ""Candy of        the Month"" section of the Kidztown area were invited to register for a        sweepstakes to win a free box of candy. ( See  Exhibit B.) The        registration page included a hyperlink inviting individuals over the age        of 13 to register. The registration page informed children 13 years of age        or under that they must get the consent of a parent or guardian before        entering the sweepstakes, and included a ""Parental Consent"" form. ( See         Exhibit C.) The parental consent form asked for the parent's name, the        child's name and their full home address. At the bottom of the form, there        was a box labeled ""Click here to consent."" Clicking on this box        automatically brought up the registration form for the sweepstakes. ( See         Exhibit D.) This registration form asked for additional personal        information, including name, home address, email address, gender and age        range. This method of obtaining parental consent was not reasonably        calculated to ensure that the person providing consent was the child's        parent. Moreover, even if no information was submitted in the parental        consent form, and a child filled in the registration form indicating that        he/she was under the age of 13, the entry form was accepted by defendant.         15. At the bottom of the online parental        consent form described above, defendant allowed parents to withdraw their        consent at any time by clicking on a hyperlink. Because the use of this        form was not reasonably calculated to ensure that the person providing        consent was the child's parent, however, defendant did not provide a        reasonable means for parents to review or delete the information collected        from their children.         16. In addition to the sweepstakes on the        Kidztown area of www.hersheys.com, defendant offered similar sweepstakes        on some of its other websites. For visitors under the age of 13,        defendant's methods for obtaining parental consent were substantially        similar to those described above. Some of the parental consent forms asked        for additional personal information, such as the parent's email address        and the child's email address and telephone number. Because defendant        asked whether visitors wishing to enter the sweepstakes were under the age        of 13 during the registration process, it had actual knowledge that some        of the personal information it was collecting was from children.        Defendant's method for obtaining prior parental consent for the collection        of this information was not reasonably calculated to ensure that the        person providing consent was the child's parent. Moreover, even if no        information was submitted in the parental consent form, and a child filled        in the registration form indicating that he/she was under the age of 13,        the entry form was accepted by defendant.         17. In this manner, defendant collected        personal information from thousands of children, including the child's        first and last name, street address, email address, gender, approximate        age, and, in some cases, the telephone number. According to defendant's        website, this information was to be used to send winners of the        sweepstakes a box of candy.         18. At times, defendant disclosed the        personal information it collected from children by posting the first and        last names and home states of the sweepstakes' winners on the Internet.        This personal information was disclosed without obtaining verifiable        parental consent.         Defendant's        Privacy Policy         19. Defendant posted a ""Privacy Policy        Statement"" on its websites, but this statement did not clearly,        understandably, or completely disclose all of its information collection,        use, and disclosure practices and other disclosures required by the Rule.        ( See  Exhibit E.)          DEFENDANT'S        VIOLATIONS OF THE        CHILDREN'S ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION RULE         20. Since at least April 21, 2000,        defendant has been an operator of a website directed to children and/or        has had actual knowledge that it has collected or maintained personal        information from children.         21. In numerous instances, including the        acts and practices described above, defendant has collected personal        information from children in violation of the Rule, including:                   a. Failing to provide sufficient          notice on the website of what information it collects online from          children, how it uses such information, its disclosure practices, and          all other required content, in violation of Section 312.4(b) of the          Rule, 16 C.F.R.  312.4(b);                       b. Failing to provide direct notice to          parents of what information it collects online from children, how it          uses such information, its disclosure practices, and all other required          content, in violation of Section 312.4(c) of the Rule, 16 C.F.R.           312.4(c);                       c. Failing to obtain verifiable          parental consent before any collection, use, and/or disclosure of          personal information from children, in violation of Section 312.5 of the          Rule, 16 C.F.R.  312.5; and                       d. Failing to provide a reasonable          means for parents to review the personal information collected from          their children and to refuse to permit its further use or maintenance,          in violation of Section 312.6 of the Rule, 16 C.F.R.  312.6.                 DEFENDANT'S UNFAIR        OR DECEPTIVE ACTS OR PRACTICES        IN VIOLATION OF THE FTC ACT         22. Section 5(a) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C.         45(a), provides that ""unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or        affecting commerce are hereby declared unlawful.""         23. Pursuant to Section 18(d)(3) of the        FTC Act, 15 U.S.C.  57a(d)(3), a violation of the Rule constitutes an        unfair or deceptive act or practice in violation of Section 5(a)(1) of the        FTC Act, 15 U.S.C.  45(a)(1).  See  COPPA, 15 U.S.C.  6502(c).         24. By and through the acts and practices        described in Paragraph 21 above, defendant has violated Section 5(a)(1) of        the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C.  45(a)(1).         CIVIL PENALTIES,        INJUNCTION AND OTHER RELIEF         25. Defendant has violated the Rule as        described above with knowledge as set forth in Section 5(m)(1)(A) of the        FTC Act, 15 U.S.C.  45(m)(1)(A).         26. Each collection, use, or disclosure        of a child's personal information from April 21, 2000 through the filing        of this Complaint, in which defendant has violated the Rule in one or more        of the ways described above, constitutes a separate violation for which        plaintiff seeks monetary civil penalties.         27. Section 5(m)(1)(A) of the FTC Act, 15        U.S.C.  45(m)(1)(A), as modified by Section 4 of the Federal Civil        Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, 28 U.S.C.  2461, and Section        1.98(d) of the FTC's Rules of Practice, 16 C.F.R.  1.98(d), authorizes        this Court to award monetary civil penalties of not more than $11,000 for        each such violation of the Rule.         28. Under Section 13(b) of the FTC Act,        15 U.S.C.  53(b), this Court is authorized to issue a permanent        injunction against defendant's violation of the FTC Act, as well as such        ancillary relief as may be just and proper.          PRAYER         WHEREFORE, plaintiff requests this Court,        pursuant to 15 U.S.C.  45(a)(1), 45(m)(1)(A), 53(b) and 57b, and the        Court's own equitable powers to:                   (1) Enter judgment against defendant          and in favor of plaintiff for each violation alleged in this Complaint;                       (2) Award plaintiff monetary civil          penalties from defendant for each violation of the Rule;                       (3) Permanently enjoin defendant from          violating the Rule; and (4) Award plaintiff such additional relief as          the Court may deem just, proper, or necessary to redress injury to          consumers resulting from defendant's violations of the Rule.

GX066-95-10408250	Statement of Senator Patrick Leahy     on the Committee Subpoena Resolution     Executive Business Meeting     September 23, 1999       I am glad that the Chairman and I were able to reach a sensible solution on the resolution that would avoid immediate issuance of subpoenas for testimony and documents from the Department of Justice on the FALN clemency matter.  As I said last week, I  did not agree with the Presidents decision to grant clemency to the FALN prisoners.  Furthermore, I have heard nothing to make me change my view that his decision was wrong from the hearings held in this Committee or in the Foreign Relations Committee or in press reports.   On the other hand, I do not believe we should be issuing subpoenas to the Justice Department unless that step is absolutely necessary.  I appreciate the Chairmans commitment to fulfilling this Committees oversight responsibilities, and I take those responsibilities very seriously myself.  Sometimes the only way to stop the federal bureaucracy from taking a silly or dangerous action is to shine the spotlight of congressional oversight hearings on the matter.   Yet, on this clemency matter, the Department has voluntarily sent the Committee several boxes of documents, totaling over 3000 pages, on the clemency matter.  The Department has also already made the Pardon Attorney available to provide an informal briefing to the Committee on clemency procedures.     Most importantly, compelling compliance with a congressional subpoena in this context would be difficult.  The civil contempt  mechanism normally available to Congress, see 28 U.S.C.  1365, specifically exempts subpoenas to the executive branch.  The criminal contempt mechanism, see 2 U.S.C.  192, which punishes as a misdemeanor a refusal to testify or produce documents to Congress, requires a referral to the Justice Department, which is not likely to pursue compliance in the likely event that the President asserts executive privilege in response to the request for certain documents or testimony. Thus, the only legal way to enforce this subpoena would be to hold a witness in contempt using its inherent contempt authority, but this would require a contempt trial on the floor of the Senate.  Not many of us relished our role as jurors during the impeachment trial and are not anxious to reprise that role.   This resolution makes clear that a subpoena will only be issued after consultation with the Ranking Member, if the Justice Department refuses or fails to satisfy three conditions:   - First, the Department must give us a log of privileged documents by September 30th;    - Second, the Department must produce non-privileged documents by September 30th; and    - Finally, the Deputy Attorney General and the Pardon Attorney will make themselves available to testify no later than October 8th on procedures for reviewing clemency petitions; efforts to produce the privilege log and on documents produced to the Committee, to the extent that such efforts or documents are not privileged.   If the Committee had issued these subpoenas as the majority planned at last weeks exec, it was likely that the President would have asserted executive privilege, as he already has on September 16, 1999, in response to a subpoena seeking FALN-clemency documents issued by House Government Reform and Oversight Committee Chairman Dan Burton.  Executive privilege is used by the President and the executive branch to shield presidential communications, advice, and  national security information from disclosure in judicial proceedings, congressional investigations and other arenas.   While the proper scope of executive privilege is the subject of much debate, at a minimum, it covers presidential communications, and may also protect the decision-making, or deliberative process, of the executive branch in general.   Courts have recognized a presumptive privilege for presidential communications that is grounded in a Presidents generalized interest in confidentiality and is viewed as important to preserving the candor of presidential advisors and protecting the freedom of the president and his advisors to explore alternatives in the process of shaping policies and making decisions and to do so in a way many would be unwilling to express except privately. U. S. v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 708, 711 (1974); In re Sealed Case, 121 F.3d 729, 743 (D.C. Cir. 1997).   This privilege is inextricably rooted in the separation of powers under the Constitution and flow[s] from the nature of enumerated powers of the President. Id., 418 U.S. at 705; 121  F.3d at 743.    According to a recent D.C. Circuit case, [t]he President can invoke the privilege when asked to produce documents or other materials that reflect Presidential decision making and deliberations and that the President believes should remain confidential. Id., 121 F.3d at 744.  As to the scope of this privilege, the court found, in the context of the criminal proceeding, it to cover communications made by presidential advisers in the course of preparing advice for the President, . . . even when these communications are not made directly to the President. Id. at 751-52.   I recognize that the presidential communications privilege is not absolute.  For instance, in the context of a criminal case (one of the Watergate cases), the Supreme Court found that an assertion of executive privilege based only on the generalized interest in confidentiality . . . must yield to the demonstrated, specific need for evidence in a pending criminal trial. 418 U.S. at 713.   In the context of a congressional investigation, the privilege would be more difficult to overcome and require a showing that the information sought to be obtained is demonstrably critical to the responsible fulfillment of the Committees functions.Senate Select Committee v. Nixon , 498  F.2d 725, 731 (D.C. Cir. 1974).  This would be a difficult task in this matter given the peculiarly executive nature of the clemency process.      The executive privilege may also be construed broadly to permit the government to protect documents that would reveal advisory opinions, recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated. 121 F.3d at 737 (quoting Carl Zeiss Stiftung v. V.E.B. Carl Zeiss, Jena, 40 F.R.D. 318, 324 (D.D.C. 1966)(internal quotation omitted)).   This privilege, litigated more often in the FOIA context, is rooted in common law and protects information that is both predecisional and deliberative.  It does not protect documents that simply state or explain a governmental decision, or protect material that is purely factual.  Id., 121 F.3d at 737.  The deliberative process privilege is a qualified one and can be overcome by a sufficient showing of need.  Id.  When this privilege is asserted in the context of a court proceeding, a court will balance factors like relevance, the availability of other evidence, the nature and seriousness of the litigation and the possible future effect on government employees. Again,  in my view, this may be a difficult task in this matter given the peculiarly executive nature of the clemency process.     Thus, this resolution, which avoids the issuance of a subpoena should the Justice Department continue to cooperate with the Committee in producing non-privileged documents, is a good result.  I expect that no subpoena will need to be issued and that the Justice Department will continue to cooperate in furnishing us with the documents we request, so long as those documents are not privileged and do not relate to any ongoing criminal investigation.    The resolution reflects a constructive plan for proceeding with this Committees oversight responsibilities and I commend the Chairman for reaching this consensus resolution.

Honolulu, HI: Legislative Reference Bureau, December 2003. 1. Call centers. KFH421.5.L35 A25 03-3   FOREWORD This report was prepared in response to House Concurrent Resolution No. 128, H.D. 1, adopted by the Twenty-second Legislature during the Regular Session of 2003. The resolution directs the Legislative Reference Bureau ""to review pending customer rights practices and draft legislation mandating that call centers must accurately disclose their location to any customer who inquires."" We hope that this publication assists the Legislature in resolving the matters presented in the resolution.  Ken H. Takayama Acting Director December 2003  iii   FACT SHEET I. Highlights A. House Concurrent Resolution No. 128, H.D. 1, adopted by the Legislature in the 2003 Regular Session, requested the Bureau to ""review pending customer rights practices and draft legislation mandating that call centers must accurately disclose their location to any customer who inquires."" Findings. The Bureau finds that: 1. No statutes from Hawaii, the other states, or the federal government expressly or specifically address ""pending customer rights practices"" with regard to a call center's duty to disclose its location to customers. A 2003 bill introduced into the New Jersey legislature addresses the specific issue of call center disclosure. To date, the New Jersey legislature has not adopted the legislation. 2. The problem that proponents claim needs to be corrected by the requested proposed legislation involves foreign call centers that serve American customers and whose employees reportedly hold themselves out to American customers as being American. Several rationales are given by proponents for the need for disclosure legislation. The key reason appears to be job protection. Other reasons given are the protection of national security, the protection of consumer privacy, and the promotion of customer satisfaction. There is no indication in local media and business reports that call center jobs in Hawaii are being outsourced or are at risk of being outsourced to foreign countries. Under the existing law on deceptive trade practices, a call center's failure to disclose its location does not seem to create the kind of likelihood of confusion that the laws were intended to prevent.  B.  3.  4.  5.  C.  Recommendations 1. There are no recommendations.  iv   II.  Frequently Asked Questions 1. What are call centers? Answer: Under the Hawaii Revised Statutes, a ""call center"" is defined under certain tax and economic development laws as a business or operation that provides customer support by telephone for certain types of companies and services, but does not engage in telemarketing or sales. The companies and services served by the call centers include but are not limited to manufacturing companies and computer hardware and software companies.  2.  If there is no recommendation, why is proposed legislation included in this report? Answer: It is the proposed legislation that was requested under H.C.R. No. 128, H.D. 1. It is presented without any endorsement, approval, or recommendation by the Bureau. It is offered only because the Bureau was directed by the resolution to ""draft legislation mandating that call centers must accurately disclose their location to any customer who inquires."" The proposed legislation applies to a call center that is owned and operated by a corporation or other business entity whose principal place of business is in the State. It requires the employees of the call center to disclose their location to Hawaii customers. No geographic limitations are placed on the location of the call center.  v   TABLE OF CONTENTS Page FOREWORD........................................................................................................................

(See Appendix A.) In chapter 2, the Bureau presents both its findings on pending customer rights practices and its draft of legislation mandating call centers to accurately disclose their location to Hawaii customers. The draft is attached to the end of the chapter. In chapter 3, the Bureau discusses the problem that the disclosure legislation is intended to solve, the source of the draft of the legislation, and the policies to be served by the legislation. In chapter 4, the Bureau discusses the need for legislation to ensure that the failure of a call center to disclose its location is treated as a deceptive trade practice. In chapter 5, the Bureau presents its findings.  1   Chapter 2 CUSTOMER RIGHTS PRACTICES AND LEGISLATION MANDATING DISCLOSURE Call Centers Defined The Hawaii Revised Statutes define the term ""call center"" in certain laws relating to economic development and taxation. Chapter 209E, on state enterprise zones, defines a ""call center"" at section 209E-2 to mean: ...a business providing service at an establishment in which customer and technical support service for manufacturing companies, disease management services, computer hardware and software companies, credit collection services, product fulfillment services, or disaster management services, are provided by telephone; provided that the business shall not include telemarketing or sales.  In other words, a ""call center"" is a business, exclusive of tele marketing or sales, that uses an establishment to provide customer and technical support service by telephone for specified types of companies and services. These companies and services are comprised of manufacturing companies, disease management services, computer hardware and software companies, credit collection services, product fulfillment services, and disaster management services. Likewise, chapter 237, on the general excise tax law, and chapter 239, on the public service tax company tax law, both contain an identical definition of a ""call center"", which is similar to but not identical with the definition in chapter 209E. The tax chapters define a ""call center"" at sections 237-29.8(d) and 239-12(c) to mean: ...a physical or electronic operation that focuses on providing customer service and support for computer hardware and software companies, manufacturing companies, software service organizations, and telecommunications support services, within an organization in which a managed group of individuals spend most of their time engaging in business by telephone, usually working in a computer-automated environment; provided that the operation shall not include telemarketing or sales.  In other words, a ""call center"" is an operation, exclusive of telemarketing or sales, that uses a managed group of individuals who spend most of their time providing customer service and support by telephone for specified types of companies and services. These companies and services are comprised of manufacturing companies, computer hardware and software companies, software service organizations, and telecommunications support services.  2   CUSTOMER RIGHTS PRACTICES AND LEGISLATION MANDATING DISCLOSURE  The common, basic element of the two definitions is that a call center is a business or operation that provides customer support by telephone for certain types of companies and services, but does not engage in telemarketing or sales. The types of companies and services served by the call centers that the two definitions have in common are manufacturing companies and computer hardware and software companies.  Pending Customer Rights Practices The first of the two items that the Bureau is directed to address under H.C.R. No. 128, 1 H.D. 1, is to ""review pending customer rights practices"". The Bureau searched for but was unable to discover, as of June 2003, any state or federal statutes that expressly or specifically addressed pending customer rights practices with regard to a call center's duty to disclose its location to customers. The Bureau did find a 2003 bill from New Jersey that addresses the matter. Evidently, 2 New Jersey is the only state that introduced a bill in 2003 that requires call center disclosure. 3 The New Jersey legislature has not adopted the measure. The amended version of the New Jersey bill forms the basis for legislation drafted pursuant to the direction of H.C.R. No. 128, H.D. 1. The Bureau was unaware, until it was too late for incorporation in the main body of this report, a bill introduced in Congress toward the end of the year requiring call centers to disclose 4 their location. 1. No response was received from the Communications Workers of America to the Bureau's e-mail request for assistance in obtaining information on pending customer rights practices in the industry. The e-mail was sent on June 5, 2003, to CWA9415HPAC@mail.com, the e-mail address listed in the copy of the testimony of the union that had been submitted for H.C.R. No. 128, H.D. 1. The Communications Workers of America states in a May 2, 2003, website article that: ""New Jersey will join Hawaii as the only two states to date to introduce legislation to require call-takers to tell customers where they are based and the name of their employer, along with other information."" ""CWA Leads NJ to Look at 'Right-to-Know' Bill"", May 2, 2003, at http://cwa-union.org . The New Jersey legislation is Assembly Bill No. 3529, a bill; whereas the Hawaii legislation is H.C.R. No. 128, H.D. 1, a resolution. No bills on the call center disclosure issue were introduced in the State legislature during the 2003 session. See http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov. 3. Assembly Bill No. 3529 was introduced May 8, 2003. It was amended in committee on June 5, 2003. No further progress on the bill is noted on the New Jersey legislature's website. See, http://www.njleg.state.nj.us. S. 1873, was introduced on November 17, 2003, in the Senate of the United States Congress during the 1st session of the 108th Congress. The bill requires a United States corporation or its subsidiaries that utilize a call center to initiate telephone calls to, or receive telephone calls from, individuals located in the United States, to require each employee in the call center to disclose the physical location of the employee at the beginning of each telephone call so initiated or received. Noncompliance subjects the corporation or subsidiary to civil penalties to be prescribed by the Federal Trade Commission. See http://thomas.loc.gov. Unlike the original version of the New Jersey measure, Assembly Bill No. 3529, the Congressional bill  2.  4.  3   CALL CENTERS: A DUTY TO DISCLOSE THEIR LOCATION TO CUSTOMERS  Legislation Mandating that Call Centers Disclose Their Location The second of the two items that H.C.R. No. 128, H.D. 1, directs the Bureau to do is to ""draft legislation mandating that call centers must accurately disclose their location to any customer who inquires"". The Bureau infers from the text of the resolution that it is Hawaii 5 6 residents who should be given the right-to-know while it is call centers located in Hawaii that should be given the duty of disclosure. Upon further review, though, it would seem that the duty of disclosure should actually be imposed upon call centers operated by businesses that are located in Hawaii rather than upon call centers that are located in Hawaii. The requested proposed legislation may not achieve its intent if aimed merely at call centers located in Hawaii. For example, although a call center located in Hawaii would need to disclose its location, it would no longer need to do so if it is moved offshore. This result is contrary to the intent of the proposed legislation, which is to require the call centers in foreign countries to disclose their location. The requested proposed legislation is attached at the end of this chapter. It is offered without any endorsement, approval, or recommendation by the Bureau. It is offered only because H.C.R. No. 128, H.D. 1, directs the Bureau to draft legislation mandating call centers to disclose their location. The requested measure requires a call center owned and operated by a corporation, business entity, or person whose principal place of business is in the State to disclose its location. No limitations are placed on the geographic location of the call center itself. Specifically, the measure amends Hawaii Revised Statutes chapter 481A by adding a new section that requires an employee of certain call centers that answer non-emergency telephone calls from a resident of this State to disclose the employee's name and the state or country in does not require an employee in a foreign call center to reroute the call to a call center located in the United States, if so requested by the customer. The New Jersey legislation is discussed later in chapter 3. The measure is being supported by the Communications Workers of America. In a November 20, 2003, form letter addressed to the United States Senators, the union states that it ""supports efforts to restore confidence in the booming call center market, save precious jobs here in America, and help provide a measure of security for telephone and Internet consumer transactions."" See http://www.cwa-legis-pol.org . In other words, the reasons for the legislation are the promotion of customer satisfaction, the protection of American jobs, and the protection of consumer privacy. These are the same reasons put forth by the union in its support of the New Jersey measure, Assembly Bill No. 3529. Protecting the national security, a reason put forth by the union in support of H.C.R. No. 128, H.D. 1, is not mentioned. The rationale for call center disclosure legislation is discussed later in chapter 3. 5. H.C.R. No. 128, H.D. 1, states that ""Hawaii residents use the telephone ... for the general purpose of inbound and outbound communications"" and ""Hawaii consumers contact or are contacted by ... individuals and organizations"". H.C.R. No. 128, H.D. 1, states that ""call centers located within the State's boundaries"" provide ""positive and constructive economic and social benefit[s]"" to ""all the people of the State of Hawaii and the United States of America"". It also states that the ""continued expansion and growth of the Hawaii call center industry enables positive economic diversification for Hawaii.""  6.  4   CUSTOMER RIGHTS PRACTICES AND LEGISLATION MANDATING DISCLOSURE  which the employee is located. The disclosure must be made within the first thirty seconds of the call. The measure defines ""call center"" as a call center that is owned and operated by a corporation, business entity, or person whose principal place of business is in the State. The definition does not include call centers that are operated by a third party contractor of the Hawaii-based entity. Violations of the new section are made a deceptive trade practice under Hawaii Revised Statutes section 481A-3, which broadly entitles any ""person"" who is ""likely to be damaged"" by a deceptive trade practice, conceivably including a labor organization, to seek an injunction against the violator. To reiterate, first, the requested proposed legislation applies only to a company whose principal place of business is in the State. It does not apply to a company that merely does business in the State or merely transacts business in the State. It also does not apply to a company that does not do business or transact business in the State. Second, the legislation applies only to a call center that is owned and operated by the company. It does not apply to a call center that is owned and operated by a third party who enters into a contract with the company to provide the operations of a call center. Third, although the proposed legislation applies only to a call center owned and operated by a company whose principal place of business is in the State, the call center itself may be located anywhere in the world. In other words, the proposed legislation may apply to a call center located in the State, in another state or territory of the United States, or in a foreign country. The ""x's"" in the table below indicate what call centers fall within the intended reach of the proposed legislation: Table 2-1 THE REACH OF THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION Business nexus with the State ?

No.  5   CALL CENTERS: A DUTY TO DISCLOSE THEIR LOCATION TO CUSTOMERS  128, H.D. 1, unavoidably causes extraterritorial effects because it requires some call centers in other states and foreign countries to disclose their location to Hawaii residents. Of particular concern are two parts of the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution: the interstate commerce clause and the foreign commerce clause. Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3, of the United States Constitution, states that: The Congress shall have Power...To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes;  State legislation that interferes with this congressional power is potentially unconstitutional. First, the proposed legislation raises an interstate commerce issue because the proposed legislation requires call centers that may be located in other states to disclose their mainland or out-of-state location to Hawaii residents. According to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in a 7 1994 opinion, a state regulation violates the interstate commerce clause in one of two ways. The regulation is per se invalid if it discriminates against interstate commerce. ""Discrimination"" means benefiting in-state economic interests and burdening out-of-state economic interests. If a state regulation regulates evenhandedly with only incidental effects on interstate commerce, it is valid unless the burden imposed on interstate commerce outweighs the state's interests in having 8 the regulation. Second, the proposed legislation raises a foreign commerce clause issue because the proposed legislation requires call centers that may be located in other countries to disclose their foreign location to Hawaii residents. According to the United States Supreme Court in a 1994 opinion: In ""the unique context of foreign commerce,"" a State's power is further constrained because of ""the special need for federal uniformity."" ... ""'In international relations and with respect to foreign intercourse and trade the people of the United States act through a single government with unified and adequate national power.'"" ... A tax affecting foreign commerce therefore raises two concerns .... The second relates to the Federal Government's capacity to ""'speak with one voice when regulating commercial 9 relations with foreign governments.'""  In other words, the federal government's capacity to ""speak with one voice"" may be impaired if one state's law interferes with the need for federal uniformity.  7. 8. 9.

Art icle VI, Paragraph 2, states: This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges of every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.  11.

Chapter 481A, Hawaii Revised Statutes, is  amended by adding a new section to be appropriately designated and to read as follows: ""481ACall centers; disclosure. (a) Within the first  thirty seconds of answering a non-emergency telephone call made by a resident of this State to a call center, an employee at the call center shall disclose the following: (1) (2) (3) (b) The employee's name; The name of the employee's employer; and The state or country in which the employee is located.

""Principal place of business"" means the place where the principal executive office of the corporation, business entity, or person is located."" SECTION 2. SECTION 3. New statutory material is underscored. This Act shall take effect upon its approval.  INTRODUCED BY: _____________________________  10   Chapter 3 THE RATIONALE FOR THE LEGISLATION H.C.R. No. 128, H.D. 1, from the State of Hawaii, and Assembly, No. 3529 from the state of New Jersey were both supported by the labor organization, the Communications Workers of America. The union reports no other state that has introduced similar legislation this past 1 year. The problem that the legislation is intended to correct is the failure of the foreign call center employee to disclose the location of the call center. The proposed solution to solving the problem is mandatory disclosure. One of the policies to be served by the New Jersey bill and Hawaii resolution is the protection of American jobs. Other policies to be served include the protection of national security, the protection of consumer privacy, and the promotion of consumer satisfaction.  The Problem: The Failure to Disclose Employees in foreign call centers fail to disclose the location of the call center. Moreover, they do something else. They hold themselves out as being Americans. According to the media, call centers in India, staffed by English speaking workers, mainly serve clients based in the United States. The industry there trains its youths to adopt American accents and corporate culture to put customers at ease. Furthermore, most Indian call center employees assume American-sounding names and carefully hide their location and true 2 identities. In general, call center employees in foreign countries are often trained on the local accents and dialects of the regions that they support, and they also stay knowledgeable on 3 various cultural items relating to the region that they support. Thus, in some Indian call centers,  1.  The New Jersey legislation was found through the website of the labor organization, the Communications Workers of America. The union posted on its website an article dated May 2, 2003, which states that ""New Jersey will join Hawaii as the only two states to date to introduce legislation to require call-takers to tell customers where they are based and the name of their employer, along with other information."" ""CWA Leads NJ to Look at 'Right-to-Know' Bill,"" May 2, 2003, at http://cwa-union.org . The New Jers ey legislation is evidently Assembly Bill No. mentioned in the article is apparently nothing more than H.C.R. No. 128, H.D. 1. A check of the State of Hawaii bills, as opposed to resolutions, that were introduced in the See http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov. 3529. On the other hand, the Hawaii legislation the resolution that requests this study, namely, Legislature's website shows that there were no 2003 session on the call center disclosure issue.  2. 3.  ""Indian Firms See Darker Side of Call Center Boom,"" July 1 3, 2003, at http://www.reuters.com. ""EMEA Call Center Outsourcing is Primed for Growth,"" May 15, 2003, at http://www.destinationcrm.com.  11   CALL CENTERS: A DUTY TO DISCLOSE THEIR LOCATION TO CUSTOMERS  United States callers are routed to operators with American accents, while British callers are 4 routed to those with British accents. Also, according to the Communications Workers of America: Corporations, aware that consumers want local service and a sense of security about their private information, are giving the call-takers American names and teaching them to chat 5 about baseball and American TV shows. ...foreign based employees are instructed never to reveal their locations and to adopt 6 American catchwords and phrases.  In any event, the ability of employees in foreign call centers to speak with American accents may lure American customers into assuming that they are dealing with Americans rather than with foreigners. An issue therefore arises as to whether these foreign call center employees are engaging in an unfair or deceptive trade practice. For example, upon hearing fluent English spoken on the other end of the phone line, an American customer who calls an American software company for assistance with a softwarerelated problem may be led into thinking that the employee at the company's call center is simply another American, on American soil, when in fact the employee is a foreigner, on foreign soil.  The Solution: Mandatory Disclosure Legislation The proposed legislation presented in the previous chapter is based on the New Jersey bill Assembly, No. 3529, as amended. As stated in chapter 2, the proposed bill requires an employee of an inbound call center who answers a non-emergency telephone call from a Hawaii resident to disclose the call center's geographic location, if the call center is operated by a Hawaii-based corporation. A violation constitutes a deceptive trade practice. The reason for using the amended version rather than the original version of the New Jersey legislation as the basis for the proposed Hawaii bill is that the amended version of the New Jersey bill can more fairly be described as just a mandatory disclosure bill. The original version requires more than just disclosure. It also requires the rerouting of calls. The original version requires an employee of an inbound call center to disclose the location of the municipality, state, and country in which the employee is located, within the first thirty seconds of answering the telephone call. If the inbound call center is in a foreign country, then the call  4. 5. 6.  ""Call Centres Take the Passage to India,"" May 25, 2003, at http://www.telegraph.co.uk.

Violations constitute unfair trade practices, subject to fines. The rerouting feature made applicable to foreign call centers was subsequently deleted in 8 committee. The original version, with its rerouting feature, poses constitutional due process problems, by interfering with a person's right to own and use property. The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits states from depriving ""any person of life, 9 liberty, or property, without due process of law."" Furthermore, the rerouting requirement frustrates a company's purpose of saving costs by outsourcing a call center to a foreign country. An American company would find it difficult to minimize labor costs through outsourcing if it nonetheless had to maintain a call center in the United States. On the other hand, it is not too difficult to see how the rerouting feature of the bill serves to maintain jobs in the United States (although not necessarily in New Jersey). The original version of the New Jersey bill could be described as a bill that purports to require disclosure but in effect prohibits outsourcing.  The Underlying Policies of Mandatory Disclosure Based on media reports, the text of and accompanying testimony relating to H.C.R. No. 128, H.D. 1, and the internet press releases of the Communications Workers of America concerning the New Jersey bill, Assembly No. 3529, it appears that mandatory disclosure 7. Assembly Bill No. 3529, was introduced May 8, 2003, and proposes to amend New Jersey Permanent Statutes title 56 on trade names, trade-marks and unfair trade practices. The bill was amended in the Assembly state government committee on June 5, 2003. The committee noted that it deleted the provisions applicable only to inbound call centers located in a foreign country. Specifically, these were the provisions that required telephone calls to an inbound call center located in a foreign country to be rerouted to a call center located in the United States, if such a request were made by the caller. Furthermore, the committee noted that it clarified the bill by making it apply to inbound call centers staffed by 25 or more employees, whose significant and primary duties, responsibilities, and functions involve responding to incoming telephone calls and electronic mail, operated by a corporation or other entity doing business in New Jersey, or a subcontractor thereof. No further progress of the bill is reported on the New Jersey legislature's website. http://www.njleg.state.nj.us. See,  New Jersey is not one of the states that have enacted the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act. See a list of the states that have, at http://www.law.cornell.edu/uniform/vol7.html. 8. 9. See, http://www.njleg.state.nj.us, on Assembly Bill No. 3529. Generally: The right to acquire and own property, and to deal with it and use it as the owner chooses so long as the use harms nobody, has been termed a natural right to which the police power of the state is subordinate. Although the government has considerable latitude in regulating property rights in ways that may adversely affect a property owner, the owner nevertheless has the constitutional right to make any use of it he or she desires so long as the use does not endanger or threaten the safety, health, and comfort or general welfare of the public. 16A Am Jurs 2d 346, Constitutional right to own and use property; generally.  13   CALL CENTERS: A DUTY TO DISCLOSE THEIR LOCATION TO CUSTOMERS  legislation is intended to serve American call center jobs from purports to serve one or more protecting consumer privacy, and  one common, key policy. That policy is the protection of being outsourced to foreign countries. The legislation also other policies, specifically, protecting the national security, promoting consumer satisfaction.  Protecting Jobs, The National Security, and Consumer Privacy The text of the H.C.R. No. 128, H.D. 1, and its supporting testimony advocate the policy of job protection together with the policy of protecting both national security and consumer privacy. Specifically, the text of the resolution suggests that the underlying purpose for disclosure legislation is to protect the sovereignty and national security of the United States from 10 anti-American terrorists who share data with countries whose call centers obtain data, 11 especially personal information, from Hawaii customers. Mandatory disclosure, it is asserted, will protect consumer privacy and national security by maintaining the growth of the Hawaii's 12 call center industry. In addition, the testimony of the Communications Workers of America on H.C.R. No. 128 reaffirms that a ""customer's right to know goes to the heart of homeland security."" The testimony maintains that data sharing agreements between countries in which a number of American companies use call centers and rogue nations represent a potential breach of national security. On the other hand, customers interfacing with local call centers can count on high quality workers who deliver security and consumer protection. Accordingly, a customer 13 interfacing with a call center has a right to know where the center is located.  Protecting Jobs and Consumer Privacy, Promoting Consumer Satisfaction Likewise, the union's press releases in support of the New Jersey bill, Assembly No. 3529, advocate the policy of job protection together with a second policy. The second policy differed depending on the version of the bill. There was a shift in the basis for the union's support of the legislation. For the original version of the bill, in which there is a rerouting feature, the press releases mention the policy of job protection with that of protecting consumer privacy. For the amended version, in which the rerouting feature is deleted, the press releases  10.  Specifically, ""... individuals and organizations involved in call center work could be located in foreign countries that might have data-sharing agreements with nations or other entities supporting terrorism and targeting the sovereignty and national security of the United States of America;"" Specifically, ""...

Protecting the national security is not mentioned in the press releases for either version. Specifically, the union supported the original (rerouting) version of the bill as follows: By making companies come clean with their customers, the Consumer's Right-to-Know bill aims to protect both jobs and the privacy of Americans' financial, medical and other personal data. Scores of businesses, from telecom companies to banks to car rental firms, as well as various state agencies, are contracting call center jobs to India and other countries where wages are a fraction of what they'd have to pay in the United States. Corporations, aware that consumers want local service and a sense of security about their private information, are giving the call-takers American names and teaching them to chat about baseball and American TV shows. .... Not only do American workers lose jobs when companies outsource,... foreign companies gain access to Social Security numbers and endless amounts of personal data about 14 callers.  Likewise, the union continued to show its support for the amended (no rerouting) version of the bill, but shifted the basis for their support to customer satisfaction, as follows: The customer has a right to know whether they are talking to the service provider and that the problem can be solved, not passed around the system, .... However, consumers are increasingly vulnerable not only to exploitation, but to the frustration of not gaining the service, information or assistance they really need, .... Customers also need accurate information about the location and identity of the customer service provider to document their transactions and make sure their problems get resolved, ....

The national scene and the local scene with regard to the call center operations of companies are discussed below.  The National Scene At the national level, the media reports that American companies have been relocating a greater number and a greater range of service jobs, including call centers, to foreign nations in order to minimize labor costs. The positions were once limited to call centers and other lowlevel processing work but now include stock analysis, accounting, and tax-return and insuranceclaims processing. More than twenty-five percent of all of the 500 largest United States 16 corporations are engaged in outsourcing to foreign countries. Accordingly, American labor organizations have been supporting state legislation aimed at maintaining service jobs, such as call center jobs, in the United States. One in particular 17 requires foreign call-center employees to identify where they are located. The legislation was introduced in the 2003 New Jersey legislature and was supported by the labor organization the Communications Workers of America. The union stated that the measure gives people ""the right to know where--as in which countries--people are answering the phone at service centers for 18 businesses and government agencies."" The most popular destinations for call center outsourcing are India and the Philippines. By the end of the year 2003, India is anticipated to acquire a 70 percent market share of the call center services market, while the Philippines will acquire a 15 percent market share. Of other popular destinations, Singapore will obtain a 7 percent market share, China a 3 percent market 19 share, and Malaysia and New Zealand each a 1 percent share. The wages paid to employees in foreign call centers are low by American standards. They are so low that American labor organizations will have difficulty matching them through collective bargaining. On the mainland, the entry-level call center employee is currently paid 20 about $2,150 per month, or about $13.44 per hour. In contrast, the entry-level call center 21 employee in India is paid about $215 per month, or about $1.34 per hour. The floor on wages  16. 17. 18. 19. 20. 21.

""Indian Firms See Darker Side of Call Center Boom,"" July 13, 2003, at http://www.reuters.com. Id.  16   THE RATIONALE FOR THE LEGISLATION 22  is the mandatory federal minimum wage of $5.15 per hour, or about $824 for a full month of work, which is also higher than the entry-level wage in India. For call centers in Hawaii, the floor on wages is the mandatory State minimum wage, 24 which, at $6.25 per hour, or about $1,000 for a full month of work, is also higher than the entry-level wage in India. 23  Moreover, it is uncertain whether a company even has a duty to bargain collectively with a labor union over a decision to outsource a call center to a foreign location. Under the National 25 26 Labor Relations Act it would have to be established that the outsourcing of a call center 27 constitutes a condition of employment for which the employer, here the company, has a duty to 28 bargain. For relocations and subcontracting of bargaining unit work, tests have been developed 29 by the National Labor Relations Board to determine whether the move requires the employer to 30 bargain with the union over the decision. 22. The federal minimum wage is found at 29 U.S.C. section 206. Violations of section 206 are made unlawful by 29 U.S.C. section 215(a)(2). The federal minimum wage law, however, is not applicable to ""any switchboard operator employed by an independently owned public telephone company which has more than seven hundred and fifty stations ...."" 29 U.S.C. section 213(a)(10). This exception may be relevant to employees at some call centers. 23. Federal law allows for higher state minimum wage laws. 29 U.S.C. section 218(a) states t hat ""No provision of this chapter or of any order thereunder shall excuse noncompliance with any Federal or State law or municipal ordinance establishing a minimum wage higher than the minimum wage established under this chapter ...."" The State minimum wage is found at Hawaii Revised Statutes section 387-2. The wage is not waivable by private agreement, Hawaii Revised Statutes section 387-4.5. The National Labor Relations Act comprises 29 U.S.C. sections 151 to 169. The burden of proof is on the government. At the hearing before the administrative law judge, ""The Board's attorney has the burden of proof of violations of section 8 of the National Labor Relations Act ..."" 29 C.F.R. 101 .10(b). Employers covered under the National Labor Relations Act includes all employers except the federal government, the states, and counties, 29 U.S.C. section 152(2). In other words, the Act generally covers private sector employers. The National Labor Relations Act makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer ""to refuse to bargain collectively with the representatives of his employees, subject to the provisions of section 159(a) of this title."" 29 U.S.C. section 158(a)(5). In turn, section 159 requires representatives designated or selected for the purposes of collective bargaining by the majority of the employees in a unit appropriate for such purposes ""shall be the exclusive representatives of all the employees in such unit for the purposes of collective bargaining in respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, or other conditions of employment ...."" 29 U.S.C. section 159(a). 29. 30. The National Labor Relations Act places oversight responsibilities with the National Labor Relations Board, 29 U.S.C. sections 159, 160. For the relocating of unit work, a two-pronged test is used to determine whether the duty exists. If the relocation decision is based on a basic change in the nature of the employer's operation, the employer is not required to bargain over the decision. However, if the employer's decision is based on a proposed savings in labor costs, the employer must bargain over the decision. 48A Am Jur 2d 3124.  24. 25. 26.  27.  28.  17   CALL CENTERS: A DUTY TO DISCLOSE THEIR LOCATION TO CUSTOMERS  The Local Scene In Hawaii, overall employment figures among local call centers appear to have remained steady over the past few years, according to news and business reports. As of December 2001, about sixty-nine companies in at least nine different industries operated call centers in Hawaii. The call centers held approximately 2,876 seats for approximately 3,717 employees. The ratio of employees to supervisors was 18 to 1. The average hourly wage in 2001 for an entry-level call center employee was $10.52 per hour, or about $1,683 per month. The industry growth rate that was projected for 2002 was roughly 2 percent. 31 As of March 2002, Hawaii still had about 4,000 call center jobs, despite the closure of four call centers in 2001, because remaining call centers were expanding. Furthermore, the number of jobs in 2002 was expected to hold fairly steady. Hawaii is evidently a favorite location for companies setting up call centers, despite the high cost of living, because the industry's traditionally high turnover is lower in the State and the State does well on customer 32 satisfaction. As of November 2003, Hawaii is reportedly still a hub for call centers of all sorts, despite the announced closure of a local call center. ""Once the dust settles, ... [the closure] won't mean 33 much to call centers in Hawaii."" The steady overall employment figures are comprised of call center openings or 35 36 expansions on the one hand and call center closures on the other hand. Furthermore, it For the subcontracting of unit work, another two-pronged test is used. No duty to bargain exists if the decision involves a change in the scope and direction of the business or is a core entrepreneurial decision. However, the duty exists if the basic nature of the employer's business remains unchanged, the decision to subcontract is based on labor costs, and the issue can be resolved through negotiations with the union. 48A Am Jur 2d 3125. 31. 32. 33. 34. 35.

Specifically, the mainland locations were Winona, Minnesota, the West 40 41 42 Coast, California and Arizona, and the Central time zone and the East Coast. No media reports were found of the operations of any local call center being terminated and relocated to a foreign country. State officials also note that call centers in Hawaii are small and are not likely 43 to be moved offshore. Comprehensive data on union representation of call center employees was not available. 44 However, AT&T is said to operate the second largest call center in the State, with about 310 45 positions in 2002, and AT&T workers in Hawaii are represented by the Communications 46 Workers of America Local 9415, California.  Deceptive Trade Practices Although job protection seems to be a misplaced basis for mandatory disclosure legislation in Hawaii, one of the other enumerated policies may actually serve as a more credible rationale to justify the legislation. Perhaps the appropriate rationale to emphasize is that of pr omoting consumer satisfaction, especially since this was the policy stressed by the union after the New Jersey bill 2003; ""Verizon Wireless closing Honolulu call center,"" November 5, 2002; ""Genesys call center to close,"" November 1, 2002; at http://pacific.bizjournals.com. 37. 38.

Moreover, the law to be amended by the proposed Hawaii bill is the law on deceptive trade practices. Customer satisfaction can be said to be at the heart of that law. The next chapter discusses a call center's failure to disclose its location as a candidate for recognition as a deceptive trade practice or similar cause of action. The Bureau finds that, without new legislation, it will be difficult under the existing law to construe such failure to disclose as a deceptive trade practice or similar cause of action.  20   Chapter 4 UNFAIR OR DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICE The current unfair or deceptive trade statutes and their accompanying case law suggest that a call center's failure to disclose its location will not likely be construed to amount to an unfair or deceptive trade practice. Specifically, under the current law the failure to disclose does not create the kind of likelihood of confusion that the statutes were intended to prevent. Accordingly, to outlaw a call center's failure to disclose its location, legislation would be necessary to positively declare that the failure to disclose does in fact constitute an unfair or deceptive trade practice.  Hawaii Statutes As stated earlier, the Bureau was not able to find any statutory provisions that specifically or expressly address customer rights practices with regard to a call center's duty to disclose its location to customers. The statutes that initially seem the most applicable to a call center's failing to disclose its true location are chapter 481A, on the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practice Act, and section 480-2, on unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices. But even these statutes ultimately will not likely be construed to apply to call center disclosures, without further legislation. As a side note, the Hawaii Revised Statutes contain misbranding statutes specifically for 1 goods made or grown in Hawaii. The gist of these statutes is that they prohibit persons from 2 holding out in the State certain goods as being grown or made in Hawaii unless those goods were actually grown or made in Hawaii. These statutes specifically cover Hawaii-made 3 4 5 6 products, acacia koa wood, ""island fresh"" milk, macadamia nuts, and roasted or instant 7 coffee. Without a doubt they prohibit misrepresentations of the geographic origins of goods.  1. 2.  Hawaii Revised Statutes sections 486-119 to 486-120.6. The general misbranding statute is section 486118. The general misbranding provision, Hawaii Revised Statutes section 486-118, is the only section that clearly identifies the persons subject to the misbranding laws. Section 486-118(a) says: ""No person shall deliver for introduction, hold for introduction or introduce into the State ...."" Hawaii Revised Statutes section 486-119. Hawaii Revised Statutes section 486-119.5. Hawaii Revised Statutes section 486-120. Hawaii Revised Statutes section 486-120.5.

In fact, both chapter 481A and sect ion 480-2 are potentially applicable to the same factual situations governed by these misbranding statutes. Section 481A-3(a)(4) prohibits deceptive representations or designations of the geographic origin in connection with goods or services. Meanwhile, section 480-2 was invoked in a 1990 appellate court case that dealt with the geographic origins of kukui nuts being sold in Hawaii.  Chapter 481A, Uniform Deceptive Trade Practice Act Chapter 481A, on the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practice Act, contains a provision on deceptive trade practices in connection with geographic origin. Chapter 481A was codified from Act 187, Session Laws of Hawaii 1969. The purpose of the Act, as recorded in its legislative history, is to prevent consumer fraud through commercial 9 deception by prohibiting deceptive conduct. The legislative history also notes that the measure is based on the 1966 Revised Uniform Deceptive Trade Practice Act drafted by the National 10 Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. The commentary to the draft suggests that the Act is intended to protect competitors of the wrongdoer, rather than consumers of the 11 wrongdoer. Section 481A-3 defines a ""deceptive trade practice"" as conduct by a person in the course of the person's business, vocation, or occupation that creates a ""likelihood of confusion or of misunderstanding."" Actual confusion or misunderstanding is irrelevant. Specific kinds of deceptive conduct are listed, including the use of deceptive representations or designations of  8.  Act 153, Session Law of Hawaii 1991, for section 486-118 (general misbranding), section 486-119 (Hawaii-made products), section 486-120 (""island fresh"" milk). Act 110, Session Laws of Hawaii 1991, for section 486-120. 5 (macadamia nuts). Act 289, Session Laws of Hawaii 1991, for section 486-120.6 (Hawaii-grown roasted or instant coffee). The exception to this time period is Act 18, Session Laws of Hawaii 2002, for section 486-119.5 (acacia koa wood).  9.  The legislativ e history of S.B. No. 239 S.D. 1, which was approved as Act 187, can be found in the committee reports, Senate Standing Committee Report No. 537 recommending adoption of S.D. 1, Senate Journal 1969, and House Standing Committee Report No. 763, House Journal 1969. A copy of the draft may be found at http://www.law.upenn.edu/bll/ulc/fnact99/1920_69/rudtpa66.htm. ""Deceptive conduct constituting unreasonable interference with another's promotion and conduct of business is part of a heterogeneous collection of legal wrongs knows as ""unfair trade practices."" .... The tort action for deceptive trade practices or ""passing off"" developed from the common- law action for trademark infringement.... The action was historically available whenever one trader diverted patronage from a rival by falsely representing that his goods were the goods of his rival."" Revised Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, 1966, Prefatory Note, at p. 1.  10. 11.  22   UNFAIR OR DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICE  ""geographic origin"" in connection with goods or services. Specifically, section 481A-3(a)(4) states that: A person engages in a deceptive trade practice when, in the course of the person's business, vocation, or occupation, the person ...[u]ses deceptive representations or designations of geographic origin in connection with goods or services ....  In general, however, the determinative issue of whether a trade practice is deceptive 12 under section 481A-3 is whether there is a ""likelihood of confusion."" Specifically: A likelihood of confusion exists when consumers confronted with products or services bearing one label or mark would be likely to assume that the source of the products or services is the same as or associated with the source of a different product or service 13 identified by a similar mark.  In other words, a consumer is likely to be confused into thinking that the consumer is receiving services from one provider when in fact the consumer is receiving those services from a different, unrelated provider.  Section 480-2, Unfair Competition, Practices, Declared Unlawful Related to chapter 481A is section 480-2 on unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices, which was enacted several years earlier. Specifically, section 4802(a) provides: Unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are unlawful.  Section 480-2 was originally enacted into law through Act 129, Session Laws of Hawaii 1965. Modeled after the federal statute, 15 U.S.C. section 45, the purpose of the state statute is to provide the attorney general with broad authority to bring proceedings to enjoin unfair and deceptive business practices by which consumers are defrauded and the economy of the State is harmed. The legislature believed it was impractical to attempt to enact legislation with respect to 14 each unfair business practice after the need for it comes to light.  The Relationship Between Sections 480-2 and 481A-3 Thus, there are three causes of actions:  12. 13. 14.  Carrington v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 5 Haw. App. 194, 198-199 (1984). Carrington v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 5 Haw. App. 194, 199 (1984). The legislative history of Act 129, Session Laws of Hawaii 1965 is found in 1965 House Journal Standing Committee Reports No. 55 and No. 267; 1965 Senate Journal Standing Committee Report No. 729.  23   CALL CENTERS: A DUTY TO DISCLOSE THEIR LOCATION TO CUSTOMERS  (1) (2) (3)  Unfair methods of competition under section 480-2(a); Unfair or deceptive acts or practices under section 480-2(a); and Deceptive trade practices under section 481A-3(a).  Substantively, the actions are similar, because they are based on the same kind of factual allegations. Specifically, ""likelihood of confusion"" allegations will support all three causes of actions, according to federal and state courts. ""Likelihood of confusion"" is the basis of claims 15 under section 480-2 for unfair methods of competition, according to the federal district court, 16 and for unfair or deceptive acts or practices, according to the Intermediate Court of Appeals. It is also the basis of claims under section 481A-3 for deceptive trade practices, according to the 17 Intermediate Court of Appeals. The primary differences among the actions involve standing and remedies. Standing refers to the persons entitled to bring the actions. Section 480-2 authorizes two causes of action: unfair or deceptive acts or practices, and unfair methods of competition. Only 18 a ""consumer"" or the State may bring an action for unfair or deceptive acts or practices. A ""consumer"" is limited to a ""natural person"" who makes a personal, family, or household 19 purchase. On the other hand, any ""person"" may bring an action for unfair methods of 20 21 competition. In this case, a ""person"" can be an individual or a business entity. Accordingly, an entity, such as a competitor, may bring an action based on unfair methods of competition, but not one based on unfair or deceptive acts or practices. A consumer or the State may bring either action.  15.  Star Markets, Ltd. v. Texaco, 945 F.Supp. 1344, 1348 (D Hawaii 1996). According to the federal district court, ""likelihood of confusion allegations may support both 480-2 unfair methods of competition and 481A deceptive acts or practices claims."" The federal court explains that ""[n]either the Hawaii state courts nor the legislature have stated in clear language that a plaintiff is limited to using likelihood of confusion allegations to support only one claim under either 480-2 or 481A."" Kukui Nuts of Hawaii, Inc. v. R. Baird & Co., Inc., 7 Haw. App. 598, 611-612, 613-614 (1990). Throughout its opinion, the Intermediate Court of Appeals appears to, but does not unequivocally, adopt the ""likelihood of confusion"" standard for unfair or deceptive acts or practices under section 480-2. Carrington v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 5 Haw. App. 194, 198-199 (1984). ""Consequently, we hold that the ""likelihood of confusion"" test is determinative of whether a trade practice is deceptive under HRS 481A3(a)(2), (3)."" Hawaii Revised Statutes section 480-2(d). Hawaii Revised Statutes section 480-1. """"Consumer"" means a natural person who, primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, purchases, attempts to purchase, or is solicited to purchase goods or services or who commits money, property, or services in a personal investment."" Hawaii Revised Statutes section 480-2(e). Hawaii Revised Statutes section 480-1. """"Person"" or ""persons"" includes individuals, corporations, firms, trusts, partnerships and incorporated associations, existing under or authorized by the laws of this State, or any other state, or any foreign country.""  16.  17.  18. 19.  20. 21.  24   UNFAIR OR DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICE  In comparison, section 481A-3 authorizes only an action for deceptive trade practices. Here, the complainant need not prove competition between the parties in order to prevail in the 22 action. ""A person likely to be damaged by a deceptive trade practice of another"" may be 23 granted an injunction against it. A ""person"" can be an individual, a business entity, or the 24 government. In other words, section 481A-3 seems to allow either a consumer or the State, as well as an entity such as a competitor, to bring the action. Also, section 481A-3 specifies that the section does not affect unfair trade practices otherwise actionable at common law or under 25 other statutes of the State. Thus, although the section allows a competitor to bring a 481A-3 deceptive trade practices action, the section does not preempt section 480-2, which does not allow a competitor to bring a 480-2 unfair or deceptive acts or practices action. Likewise, section 481A-3 allows either the State or a consumer to bring a 481A-3 deceptive trade practices action and does not affect the right of the State or a consumer to also bring an action for unfair or deceptive acts or practices under section 480-2. Accordingly, an entity that is a competitor who alleges ""likelihood of confusion"" has standing to bring a deceptive trade practices action under section 481A-3 and an unfair methods of competition action under section 480-2, but not an unfair or deceptive acts or practices action 26 under section 480-2. The second difference between the two provisions is remedies. Chapter 481A authorizes 27 injunctions. It does not award damages. In order to prevail, a complainant need not prove 28 competition between the parties or actual confusion or misunderstanding. Also, proof of 29 monetary damage, loss of profits, or intent to deceive is not required. The person must only be 30 ""likely to be damaged.""  22. 23. 24.  Hawaii Revised Statutes section 481A-3(b).

In order to 32 prevail, a complainant must generally prove ""injury,"" except where the complainant is the State 33 and only an injunction is sought.  Hawaii Case Law Under the Statutes Case law tends to illustrate the meaning of the statutes and clarify the kinds of situations that the statutes were intended to address. None of the Hawaii court opinions construing Hawaii Revised Statutes section 481A-3 or 480-2 deal with situations that closely resemble that of a call center failing to disclose its location to customers. Specifically, no Hawaii case was found involving misrepresentation of the geographic location of a portion of a provider's services. Instead, a Hawaii case was found that dealt with alleged misrepresentation of the geographic origin of a provider's goods. Other cases dealt with alleged misrepresentations of the providers themselves. Two of the cases were brought under section 480-2: Kukui Nuts of Hawaii, Inc. v. R. Baird & Co., Inc., 7 Haw. App. 598 (1990), and Star Markets, Ltd. v. Texaco, 945 F.Supp. 1344 (D Hawaii 1996). In Kukui Nuts, a seller of kukui nuts grown in Hawaii sought an injunction and damages in state circuit court against sellers of kukui nuts imported from Taiwan on account of unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive trade practices under Hawaii Revised Statutes 34 section 480-2. Specifically, the seller of Hawaii-grown kukui nuts claimed that the labeling on the imported kukui nuts sold by their competitors misrepresented the true geographic origin of the nuts. The substantive issue was whether foreign tourists purchasing the kukui nuts imported from Taiwan were likely to be confused into thinking that they were purchasing kukui nuts grown in Hawaii. The circuit court granted summary judgment to the sellers of the imported nuts, but the appellate court reversed the judgment. The appellate court stated that the question of whether an unfair or deceptive trade practice exists is a question of fact. From the appellate court's point of view, the descriptive labels on the Taiwan kukui nuts would clearly lead tourists to believe that the nuts were grown in Hawaii. Whether or not the origin labels were sufficient to overcome that question was a genuine issue of material fact that was left unresolved by the lower court's grant of summary judgment.  31. 32. 33. 34.

In its opinion, the Intermediate Court of Appeals notes that the seller of Hawaii-grown kukui nuts filed its complaint in September 1984. In 1987, the legislature amended Hawaii Revised Statutes section 480-2 by adding subsection (d), which allows only consumers and the State to bring actions under the section for unfair or deceptive acts or practices. The new subsection (d) had prospective effect only. Consequently, subsection (d) did not affect the seller's cause of action. Kukui Nuts, 7 Haw. App. at 605, note 6.  26   UNFAIR OR DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICE  In Star Markets, a supermarket business sought an injunction in federal district court on account of unfair methods of competition under Hawaii Revised Statutes section 480-2 against a gas station business that also operated convenience stores. Both the supermarket, ""Star Markets"", and the gas station, ""Star Mart"", used a red and white star logo. The substantive issue was whether customers of the ""Star Mart"" convenience stores were likely to be confused into thinking that the convenience stores were part of the ""Star Markets"" supermarket chain. The district court denied the convenience stores' motion to dismiss the supermarket's claim. The court held that the supermarket had standing to bring a section 480-2 claim for unfair methods of competition. Furthermore, the court held that the supermarket's likelihood of confusion allegations could support a section 480-2 claim for unfair methods of competition, regardless of whether those allegations could also support a deceptive acts or practices claim. Two other cases were brought under section 481A-3: Carrington v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 5 Haw. App. 194 (1984), and Hawaii Calls, Ltd. v. Perfumes Polynesia, Ltd., 399 F.Supp. 604 (D. Hawaii 1975). In Carrington, an artist sought an injunction in state circuit court against a department store on account of a trademark violation under Hawaii Revised Statutes chapter 482 and deceptive trade practices under Hawaii Revised Statutes chapter 481A. The artist used the mark ""Sunspots"" in combination with a descriptive polynesian ethnic classification, as labels for cards that depicted a drawing of a polynesian native against a background containing a circle, apparently representing the sun. The department store used the mark ""Sun Spots"" in conjunction with a logo depicting the silhouette of a bird in a yellow sun-like circle. The substantive issue was whether customers purchasing the department store's own brand of sports apparel were likely to be confused into thinking that they were purchasing sports apparel connected with the stationary and greeting card designs created by the artist. The circuit court granted summary judgment to the department store, and the appellate court affirmed the judgment. The appellate court examined the evidence in the light of eight factors relating to: (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) Similarity of the marks; Similarity of the goods; Relationship between the parties' channels of trade; Relationship between the parties' advertising; Class of prospective purchasers of the products; Evidence of actual confusion; Defendant's intent in adopting its mark; and Strength of the plaintiff's mark.  27   CALL CENTERS: A DUTY TO DISCLOSE THEIR LOCATION TO CUSTOMERS  The court then held that the evidence clearly indicated that, as a matter of law, there was no likelihood of confusion between the artist's ""Sunspots"" label and the department store's ""Sun Spots"" label. Therefore, it would be impossible for the artist to succeed on either the trademark infringement or the deceptive trade practice action. In Hawaii Calls, a radio program sought an injunction and damages in federal district court against a fragrance seller on account of trademark infringement under the federal Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. section 1051 et seq.), deceptive trade practices under Hawaii Revised Statutes chapter 481A, and unfair competition under the common law. Both the radio program and the fragrance were named ""Hawaii Calls."" The substantive issue was whether foreign tourists purchasing in Hawaii the fragrance ""Hawaii Calls"" were likely to be confused into thinking that they were buying fragrances associated with the once-popular domestic radio program ""Hawaii Calls."" Following a trial, the district court entered judgment for the fragrance seller. The court found that the radio program's service mark ""Hawaii Calls"" was no longer a strong mark and no longer entitled to the protection afforded a strong mark. Furthermore, the court could not find any confusion as to the source of the mark because the radio program did not manufacture or distribute goods. Accordingly, the court concluded that the fragrance seller's use of the trade mark ""Hawaii Calls"" did not constitute a deceptive trade practice, an unfair method of competition, or an unfair or deceptive practice. The court also recognized the fragrance seller's continued registration of the trade mark ""Hawaii Calls.""  Case Law from Delaware Under the Uniform Statute Although no Hawaii cases were found with regard to misrepresentations of ""geographic origin"" in connection with services, a possible case from out-of-state that addresses the issue is State ex rel. Brady v. Preferred Florist Network, Inc., 791 A.2d 8, 20-21 (Delaware Court of Chancery 2001). The case is from Delaware, which, like Hawaii, has also enacted the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act. Delaware enacted the 1964 model, while Hawaii enacted the 35 1966 revision. Brady involved a New Jersey florist who placed ""dummy listings"" of florists in local Delaware phone directories that suggested the dummy florists were located in Delaware. Phone calls from Delaware customers to the dummy listings were automatically forwarded to the New Jersey florist. The New Jersey florist then had the orders filled by actual local Delaware florists who were members of the network of florists maintained by the New Jersey florist. The state of Delaware sought an injunction, civil penalties, damages, and other relief in a Delaware state court against the New Jersey florist under the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act and a related consumer protection statute. The state of Delaware claimed that the ""dummy listings"" had a tendency or capacity to mislead or confuse consumers into believing that they were dealing with bona fide Delaware businesses, and in some cases neighborhood businesses, when in fact, they were dealing with an out-of-state business and a select few undisclosed 35. http://www.law.cornell.edu/uniform/vol7.html provides a list of the states that have enacted either the 1964 Act or the 1966 revision of the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act.  28   UNFAIR OR DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICE  Delaware florists. The state court denied the florist's motion to dismiss the state's complaint. The court explained that it could not conclude that there was no confusion as to the source of the goods being provided. That was a question of fact that would have to await the development of a more complete factual record.  The Relevance of the Geographic Origin of Call Centers The call center situation differs from these cases in a few fundamental aspects. Without legislation to recognize a call center's failure to disclose its location to customers as an unfair or deceptive trade practice, it does not appear likely that the courts, on their own, will recognize the failure to disclose as an unfair or deceptive trade practice. First, it is not the provider of the service who is alleged as being misrepresented. The provider is not the call center itself but the business that is using a call center to provide a service to the customer. These businesses include manufacturing companies, disease management services, computer hardware and software companies, credit collection services, product fulfillment services, disaster management services, software service organizations, or 36 telecommunications support services. The customer is primarily doing business with one of these types of companies, not with the call center itself. Stated otherwise, sections 480-2 and 481A-3 are probably intend ed to address situations in which a customer is likely to be confused into thinking that the customer is dealing with an American company when in fact the customer is dealing with a foreign company. The statutes do not appear to be intended to address situations in which the customer of a particular American company is likely to be confused into thinking that the call center of that company is located on American soil rather than in a foreign country. The call center situation superficially resembles the Delaware Brady case in which there was an issue of whether Delaware customers were likely to be confused into thinking they were phoning in orders to a Delaware florist when in fact they were phoning in orders to a New Jersey florist. However, the providers at issue in Brady were the florists. In the call center situation, the providers at issue are not the call centers themselves but the businesses that the customer is primarily dealing with, for example, the computer hardware and software company, the telecommunications support service, or the manufacturing company. Stated differently, Brady would be analogous to the call center situation if the misrepresentation focused on a Delaware florist's employees who commute to work from New Jersey and affect a Delaware accent when taking customer orders over the telephone. Second, the service itself is not alleged as being misrepresented. The services provided by a foreign call center are essentially the same as the services provided by a domestic call center. Moreover, the services of the call center are presumably not the primary service that the customer is purchasing. That primary service would be the service provided by the types of 36. From the definitions of ""call center"" in Hawaii Revised Statutes sections 209E-2, 237-29.8(d), and 23912(c).  29   CALL CENTERS: A DUTY TO DISCLOSE THEIR LOCATION TO CUSTOMERS  companies that use the call centers, be it disease management, credit collection, telecommunications support, or software service. Stated otherwise, section 480-2 or 481A-3 are probably intended to address situations in which a customer is likely to be confused into thinking that the customer is receiving, for example, disease management services when in fact the customer is receiving credit collection services. The statutes do not appear to be intended to address situations in which a customer receiving disease management services is likely to be confused into thinking that the call center of that company is located on American soil rather than in a foreign country. The call center situation superficially resembles the Kukui Nuts case in which there was an issue of whether foreign tourists were likely to be confused into thinking they were purchasing kukui nuts grown in Hawaii when in fact they were purchasing kukui nuts imported from Taiwan. However, the goods at issue in Kukui Nuts were the kukui nuts. In the call center situation, the services at issue are not the call center services, but the services of the provider that the customer is doing business with, for example, the computer hardware and software company, the telecommunications support service, or the manufacturing company. Stated otherwise, Kukui Nut s would be analogous to the call center situation if the misrepresentation focused on kukui nuts being sold by store salespersons feigning a local accent when in fact they are only recent arrivals to the islands. Thus, the likelihood of confusion being caused by a call center's failure to disclose its location is not the type of confusion that is presently of concern under section 480-2 or 481A-3. Therefore, if the Legislature desires to make such failure to disclose an unfair or deceptive trade practice, legislation would be necessary to declare that the failure to disclose does create the requisite likelihood of confusion and is in fact an unfair or deceptive trade practice.  30   Chapter 5 FINDINGS The Bureau's findings are as follows: (1) Under the Hawaii Revised Statutes, a ""call center"" is defined under certain tax and economic development laws as a business or operation that provides customer support by telephone for certain types of companies and services, but does not engage in telemarketing or sales. The companies and services served by the call centers include but are not limited to manufacturing companies and computer hardware and software companies; No statutes from Hawaii, the other states, or the federal government expressly or specifically address ""pending customer rights practices"" with regard to a call center's duty to disclose its location to customers. A 2003 bill from the New Jersey legislature addresses the specific issue of call center disclosure. The New Jersey legislature has not adopted the legislation; (3) The problem that proponents claim needs to be corrected by the requested proposed legislation involves foreign call centers. The media reports that employees in foreign call centers that serve American customers hold themselves out as being American. They adopt American accents and corporate culture, assume American-sounding names, stay knowledgeable on various cultural items relating to America, and carefully hide their location and true identities; Several rationales are given by proponents for the need for disclosure legislation. The key reason appears to be job protection. Specifically, the legislation will serve to protect American call center jobs from being outsourced to foreign countries. Other reasons given are the protection of national security, the protection of consumer privacy, and the promotion of customer satisfaction; There is no indication in local media and business reports that call center jobs in Hawaii are being outsourced or are at risk of being outsourced to foreign countries. Accordingly, job protection from outsourcing may not be the best fitting rationale for the proposed legislation, at least in Hawaii at this time. A more suitable rationale may be the promotion of customer satisfaction; Under the existing law on deceptive trade practices, a call center's failure to disclose its location does not seem to create the kind of likelihood of confusion that the laws were intended to prevent. Accordingly, if the Legislature seeks to prohibit call centers failing to disclose their location, legislation would be necessary to positively declare that the failure to disclose does in fact constitute a deceptive trade practice. Once the legislation is in place, any person likely to be 31  (2)  (4)  (5)  (6)   CALL CENTERS: A DUTY TO DISCLOSE THEIR LOCATION TO CUSTOMERS  damaged by the failure to disclose may be granted an injunction against the violation. Conceivably, the person claiming to be damaged could be a labor organization. There are no recommendations. Instead: (1) The proposed legislation requested under H.C.R. No. 128, H.D. 1, is presented at the end of chapter 2, without any endorsement, approval, or recommendation by the Bureau. It is offered only because the Bureau was directed by H.C.R. No. 128, H.D. 1, to draft legislation mandating call centers to disclose their location. The proposed legislation is based, with modifications, upon the amended version of the 2003 New Jersey bill, Assembly No. 3529. The proposed legislation applies to a call center that is owned and operated by a corporation or other business entity whose principal place of business is in the State. It requires the employees of the call center to disclose their location to Hawaii customers. No geographic limitations are placed on the location of the call center. The Bureau finds that limiting the applicability of the legislation to call centers owned and operated by Hawaii-based companies is necessary to avoid or minimize commerce clause and related constitutional problems.

""Consumers and businesses pay a heavy price in money and lost time because          of those who use the Internet to distribute deceptive commercial mailings          to people who never asked for them,"" Attorney General Christine Gregoire          said. ""We are pleased the Supreme Court has issued this strong endorsement          of the state's tough law to curb these practices.""          Today's decision involved a lawsuit filed by the Attorney General's          Office on Oct. 22, 1998. The state accused an Oregon man, Jason Heckel,          and his company, Natural Instincts, of violating the state's new anti-spam          law by sending unsolicited commercial e-mail, or ""spam,"" to millions of          Internet users. The e-mails were aimed at selling a booklet titled, ""How          to Profit from the Internet.""          Washington's law, which went into effect in June of 1998, was one of          the first in the nation to regulate the sending of spam. The law prohibits          sending unsolicited commercial e-mail that contains misleading information          in its subject line, uses a third party's domain name without permission          or misrepresents the message's point of origin.         The lawsuit alleged that Heckel used a misleading subject line that read,          ""Did I get the right e-mail address?"" to entice recipients to download          and read his entire message. The suit also alleged the defendant posted          an invalid return e-mail address to which recipients were unable to respond.         In March 2000, King County Superior Court Judge Palmer Robinson dismissed          the case against Heckel and his company on grounds the state law violated          the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Attorney General's Office          appealed that ruling directly to the state Supreme Court.         In its opinion today, the court found that ""... the only burden the Act          places on spammers is the requirement of truthfulness, a requirement that          does not burden commerce at all but actually 'facilitates it by eliminating          fraud and deception.' ""         The case will now be remanded to the Superior Court for trial.                             -30-                                     BACKGROUND  PAPER ON WASHINGTON          SUPREME COURT CASE                 CHALLENGING WASHINGTON'S ANTI-SPAM LAW                 State v. Heckel (Jason), d/b/a Natural Instincts         In 1998, the Washington Legislature passed the ""Unsolicited Commercial          Electronic Mail Act,"" RCW 19.190.020, which prohibits unsolicited          electronic mail that advertises consumer products with a false or misleading          subject line or return address. Such e-mail is more commonly known as          ""spam.""          The law addresses three consumer harms created by spam. First, recipients          are the victims of a deceptive consumer practice because they pay for          the Internet time and services that deliver the deceptive e-mail. Consumers          waste their on-line time downloading deceptive mail, and false subject          lines prevent them from making informed decisions on whether to delete          messages. Recipients also are unable to determine accurate addresses in          order to respond.          Second, persons whose addresses are misappropriated are harmed by receiving          floods of responding e-mails nominally directed towards the original sender          of the deceptive e-mail. The Legislature heard how a misappropriated e-mail          return address shut down a legitimate electronic site due to persons responding          by hitting ""reply"" and ""send.""         Finally, the consumer's Internet Service Provider (ISP) is harmed because          mass e-mailings clog systems and cause overloads, down time, and costs          associated with filtering deceptive e-mails.          Case Background         Jason Heckel is an Oregon resident who sent mass e-mails to addresses          that he obtained from various sources. His messages invited recipients          to send $40 by regular mail and he would send a booklet about ""How          to Profit from the Internet."" In some cases, Heckel failed to send          the 46-page booklet after consumers sent their money.         In June 1998, representatives of the Attorney General's Office met with          Heckel to advise him of his violations of RCW 19.190.020. On October 22,          1998, the Attorney General's Office filed suit against Heckel and his          company, Natural Instincts, after 20 subsequent complaints showed that          he had continued to send e-mails with misleading subject lines and false          return addresses.         On March 10, 1999, King County Superior Court Judge Palmer Robinson granted          the defendant's motion to dismiss the case on grounds that the state's          law violated the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Attorney          General's Office appealed that decision directly to the Washington Supreme          Court.         The Supreme Court heard oral argument in the case on March 20, 2001.          The issue presented to the court was whether Washington's prohibition          on commercial e-mail with deceptive subject lines and return addresses          violated the dormant Commerce Clause.          Washington argued that the court's analysis of whether Washington's law          violates the Commerce Clause should consider what it cost Heckel to comply          with the law. The state argued that he would simply have to refrain from          using misleading subject lines and return addresses.That burden on commerce          is not ""clearly excessive"" in light of the local benefits of          the law. In fact, Heckel has to alter the headers' return addresses to          make them deceptive, because bulk email programs normally send out the          actual return addresses that originate with the e-mails. Compliance with          the law normally creates no burden on those who use accurate headers and          subject lines.          Heckel argued that he cannot filter his mass e-mailings from reaching          Washington recipients, and even if he did, an out-of-state e-mail address          might be opened by a recipient temporarily in Washington. Accordingly,          Heckel cannot comply with Washington law except making his mass e-mailings          non-deceptive. Heckel argued that this creates an impermissible burden          on interstate commerce because Washington law might affect conduct that          occurs outside Washington.          What is the significance of the Supreme Court's decision?          The constitutionality of Washingon's anti-spam e-mail law has been upheld          as a result of today's decision. As a result, the state will be able to          continue to use this law to protect consumers.         What happens next?         The case will be remanded to King County Superior Court for trial.                                 Index"

Dole , 483 U.S. 203 (1987).    As plaintiffs alleged in their complaints and proved at trial, CIPA’s requirement that libraries employ blocking software on all their computers is an impermissible content-based restriction on speech, a prior restraint, vague, and overbroad.    In addition, CIPA imposes an unconstitutional condition on public libraries by distorting the usual functioning of those profoundly democratizing institutions and restricting the uniquely diverse medium of the Internet.    I.            CIPA VIOLATES THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS OF LIBRARY PATRONS AND THEREFORE CANNOT BE SUSTAINED AS A VALID EXERCISE OF CONGRESS’S SPENDING POWER.                      CIPA cannot be sustained as a valid exercise of Congress’s spending power because it induces libraries that receive Internet funding to violate the First Amendment.    As defendants concede, when Congress distributes funds to state and local government entities providing services, it cannot do so in a way that “induces [those entities] to engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional.”  South Dakota v. Dole , 483 U.S. 203, 210 (1987).    Defendants are therefore wrong when they suggest that the funding nature of CIPA’s restrictions remove this case from any heightened First Amendment scrutiny.    To the contrary, the focus of the inquiry is on whether the law induces libraries to violate the First Amendment, and the level of scrutiny is drawn from the body of established First Amendment doctrine.    Thus, there is no different First Amendment analysis under  Dole .    Strict scrutiny applies, and CIPA cannot satisfy the rigors of that analysis.    Thus, because CIPA will induce library recipients to violate the First Amendment, it must be invalidated.    A.                       The Provision of Internet Access in Public Libraries Lies at the Heart of the First Amendment.                                 Through CIPA, Congress has inflicted a profound double injury upon the First Amendment.    Not only does CIPA unduly restrict the most diverse, expansive medium ever created, it also compounds the problem by regulating that medium in one of the most democratizing, speech-enhancing institutions in America – the public library.    By targeting the intersection of these two First Amendment fora, CIPA ultimately weakens both, severely undermining the core constitutional values otherwise enhanced by the provision of Internet access in public libraries.                               1.                 Speech on the Internet Enjoys Maximum Constitutional Protection.                 The Internet is a unique, expansive medium for worldwide communication.    There is an enormous array of information available on the Internet, including art, literature, medical and scientific information, humor, news, religion, political commentary, music, and government information.    As the Supreme Court recognized in  Reno v. ACLU , 521 U.S. 844, 870 (1997), expression on the Internet is “as diverse as human thought.”    Indeed, with its unprecedented breadth and scope, the Internet facilitates “vast democratic forums.”    Id.  at 868.                  The Internet presents low entry barriers to anyone who wishes to provide or distribute information.    Unlike television, cable, radio, newspapers, magazines or books, the Internet provides an opportunity for those with Internet access to communicate with a worldwide audience.    Plaintiffs’ Proposed Findings of Fact 20 (hereinafter “PFF”). [1]    Currently, at least 400 million people use the Internet worldwide, including over 143 million Americans.    PFF 21.                    The World Wide Web (the “Web”) is the best known category of communication over the Internet.    The Web “allows users to search for and retrieve information stored in remote computers.”    Reno , 521 U.S. at 852.    Currently, it is estimated that the Web comprises approximately two billion Web “pages,” PFF 53, with about 1.5 million new web pages created each day, PFF 55.    “The Web is thus comparable, from the readers’ viewpoint, to . . . a vast library including millions of readily available and indexed publications.”    Reno , 521 U.S. at 853.                 Given the virtually boundless potential of expression on the Internet, the Supreme Court confirmed in  Reno v. ACLU  that “[t]his dynamic, multifaceted category of communication” is entitled to the highest level of First Amendment protection, without qualification.  Id.  at 870, 872.                              2.               Public Libraries Play a Fundamental Role in the Dissemination of Ideas and Information, Including Internet Speech.                      Public libraries occupy a unique place in our democratic society.    For many years, public libraries have served as invaluable resources for the communication and receipt of information and the free exchange of ideas.    Indeed, the public library, by its very nature, is “designed for freewheeling inquiry.”    Board of Education v. Pico , 457 U.S. 853, 915 (1982) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).    As such, the library is a “mighty resource in the free marketplace of ideas.”  Minarcini v. Strongsville City Sch. Dist. , 541 F.2d 577, 582 (6th Cir. 1976).                 As much as any institution, the public library has safeguarded the vital First Amendment right to receive speech and expression. [2]     That right “is vigorously enforced in the context of a public library, ‘the quintessential locus of the receipt of information.’”    Sund v. City of Wichita Falls , 121 F. Supp. 2d 530, 548 (N.D. Tex. 2000) (quoting  Kreimer v. Bureau of Police , 958 F.2d 1242, 1255 (3d Cir. 1992)).                    In its role as information provider, the public library is, for purposes of First Amendment analysis, a “limited public forum, a type of designated public fora.”    Kreimer v. Bureau of Police , 958 F.2d 1242, 1259 (3d Cir. 1992);  see also   Mainstream Loudoun v. Board of Trustees of the Loudoun County Library , 24 F. Supp. 2d 552, 563 (E.D. Va. 1998) (“ Mainstream Loudoun II ”);  Sund , 121 F. Supp. 2d at 548.    As the Third Circuit made clear in  Kreimer , libraries are designated “for expressive activity, namely, the communication of the written word.” 958 F.2d at 1259 (quotation and citation omitted).    Thus, “[w]hile the nature of the public library would clearly not be compatible with many forms of expressive activity, such as giving speeches or holding rallies, . . . it is compatible with . . . the receipt and communication of information through the Internet.”  Mainstream Loudoun II , 24 F. Supp. 2d at 563.                    The defendants have suggested that some library boards have defined their fora to exclude one type of content – sexually explicit speech – and can therefore mandate the use of blocking software without violating the Constitution.    That argument, however, is both legally and factually flawed.    As an initial matter, it flies in the face of fundamental First Amendment principles, which make clear that once the government dedicates a forum to a general, speech-promoting use – in this case, the communication and receipt of the broadest spectrum of information – it cannot limit that use by disfavoring certain expression.    See, e.g. ,  Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of the Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S. 819, 837 (1995) (holding that once the government creates a forum to facilitate private expression, it may not exclude the entire category of religious speech);  see also   infra  Part III.                    Nor does the Constitution permit libraries to redefine their missions on an  ad hoc  basis to justify censorship.    In defining its purpose as information-provider, the public library historically has offered a wide and diverse range of expression to the public and has prohibited exclusion of materials based on disfavored content or viewpoints.    PFF 94.    To that end, libraries continually reaffirm their central role in promoting intellectual freedom, and the vast majority of public libraries across the country – including all of the government’s library witnesses, PFF 93    –    have adopted or endorsed the Library Bill of Rights, Pls.’ Ex. 1, the Freedom to Read Statement, Pls.’ Ex. 9, and other policies safeguarding First Amendment rights.    As in the funding context, libraries cannot now recast their speech-enhancing mission “lest the First Amendment be reduced to a simple semantic exercise.”    Legal Services Corp. v. Velazquez , 531 U.S. 533, 547 (2001). [3]                  CIPA’s extensive, federally mandated incursion into the libraries’ speech-enhancing function necessarily undercuts the institutions’ primary purpose.    CIPA’s blocking mandate is particularly harmful in light of the crucial role libraries have played in making the extensive resources of the Internet available to the public.    Today, free Internet access is available in nearly every one of the 16,000 public library across the country. PFF 74.    As a result, over 14 million people in the United States use the public library for Internet access.    PFF 84.    For certain segments of the population, library Internet access is crucial.    As numerous government studies have demonstrated, the “digital divide” persists, and many groups, including minorities, low-income persons, the less-educated, and the unemployed, are far less likely to have home Internet access.    PFF 85-91.    Not surprisingly, library Internet use for those groups far exceeds that of the general population.    PFF 85-86.    In fact, for the many Americans who cannot afford a personal computer or network connections, public libraries offer the  only  means of gaining access to the Internet. PFF 86-91.                 The widespread availability of Internet access in public libraries is due, in large part, to the availability of public funding, including the funding programs regulated by CIPA.    As of 2000, nearly 50% of public libraries received e-rate discounts, and approximately 70% of libraries serving the poorest communities receive those discounts. PFF 91, 462.    Similarly, over 18% of public libraries receive LSTA or other federal grants, and more than 25% of libraries serving the poorest communities receive such grants.    PFF 482.    By conditioning federal funding on the installation and use of blocking software, CIPA transforms these democratizing programs into tools of nationwide, mandatory censorship.                              3.               Blocking Software Does Not Mirror Traditional Collection Development in Public Libraries.                      Faced with the undeniably speech-enhancing nature of the Internet and the public library’s indisputable status as a forum for freewheeling inquiry, the government has sought to cast CIPA’s blocking mandate as somehow analogous to classic library collection development decisionmaking.    That analogy, however, fails for a variety of reasons.                  First, librarians have absolutely no involvement in the blocking decisions made by third-party blocking software companies.    Those decisions are made by non-librarians who know nothing of a library’s existing physical collections, the communities served by libraries, or the criteria used by librarians in selecting physical materials.    In fact, because the software companies treat their blocking lists as proprietary and refuse to provide those lists to customers, PFF 6, 125, libraries installing blocking software  do not even know what Internet information they are withholding from the public .    The extremely limited, sporadic unblocking performed at public libraries, PFF 281-83, hardly cures this fatal flaw.                  Moreover, the selection of physical materials necessarily is limited by space and resource constraints inapplicable to the Internet.    For this reason, all libraries offering public Internet access provide patrons with innumerable useless Web sites that they undoubtedly would not include in their physical collections.    PFF 101.    While some libraries have suggested that Internet access suffers from its own resource limitations, in that there are a limited number of terminals available, they are of an entirely different and less severe character than those constraining physical collections and can be addressed by time limits.    In fact, blocking Internet access actually imposes its own resource limitations, not only because of the cost of the software, but also because the blocking and unblocking process creates delays in accessing information online.    PFF 104.                 To the extent classic collection development principles have any application in the Internet context, it is only through the selection of “recommended sites,” which many libraries offer as a means of directing patrons to particularly useful or interesting Internet information. PFF 305.    Just as physical collections necessarily are constrained by space and resource limitations, libraries can select and recommend only a small fraction of available Web sites.    If anything, it is these lists of    recommended sites – and not the unknown lists of block and unblocked sites – that most closely resemble the traditional selection of physical materials in libraries.                              Unlike recommended site lists, general Internet provision is more consistent with the    interlibrary loan process, through which libraries routinely make available to patrons materials and information not contained in the libraries’ physical collection.    As the undisputed evidence at trial made clear, interlibrary loan policy dictates that libraries assist patrons in borrowing materials from other libraries, regardless of whether the requested item falls within the borrowing library’s collection development standards.    PFF 98, 99, 339-40.    Just as an interlibrary loan request need not conform to the borrowing library’s physical selection criteria, patron Internet access need not comply with those criteria.    In both cases, the library is fulfilling its traditional role by providing patrons with the broadest access to available information.    PFF 14, 99, 101.                 Finally, blocking Internet access involves an active, rather than passive exclusion of certain types of content.    Because an Internet connection provides immediate access to the entire Internet so “no appreciable expenditure of library time or resources is required to make a particular Internet publication available” and indeed “a library must actually expend resources to restrict Internet access to a publication that is otherwise immediately available,” the blocking of Internet sites mandated by CIPA is akin to a library’s purchasing an encyclopedia or a magazine and tearing out or redacting some of its content.    Mainstream Loudoun v. Board of Trustees of the Loudoun County Library , 2 F. Supp. 2d 783, 793-94 (E.D. Va. 1998) (“ Mainstream Loudoun I ”).    When a library declines to carry a book in hard copy, it conveys no discernable message about the content of that book.    When a Web site is blocked on the library’s Internet terminals, however, the library (through a software company) lets patrons know that it expressly disfavors the site’s content.    B.              The Uncontroverted Evidence Presented at Trial Establishes that the Blocking Software Used to Comply with CIPA Prohibits Library Patrons from Accessing a Vast Amount of Protected Speech.                 The evidence presented at trial is unequivocal on a fundamental point:    the software required to comply with CIPA’s conditions blocks a substantial amount of speech far broader than the obscene, child pornography, and “harmful to minors” visual images prohibited by CIPA.                 The government concedes that none of the blocking software companies offers content categories that are limited – or indeed tied in any way – to CIPA’s legal definitions of obscenity, child pornography, or harmful to minors.    PFF 3, 114.    There is no judicial involvement in the blocking software companies’ decisions about which Web sites to block, and no attempt is made by these companies to conform their decisions to the legal definitions of speech that is obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors, or to take into account local community standards in making these determinations.    PFF 3, 4, 114-16. [4]                    To the contrary, the categories used by blocking software companies to block sexually explicit content cover a vast range of material that does not fall within CIPA’s prohibitions.    To begin with, although CIPA requires libraries to protect against access to “visual depictions,” no blocking software blocks images while allowing a patron to view the text.    PFF 192. [5]    Moreover, the category definitions applied by the filter companies make it inevitable that they will block much more speech than CIPA requires.    PFF3, 113-21, 157, 172-74.    These definitions include a significant amount of content (such as erotic texts or non-erotic nude images) that would not be considered harmful to minors (let alone obscene) under CIPA’s definition.    PFF113-21, 172-74.    And because the software does not differentiate adult use from use by minors, it inevitably blocks an additional large quantity of harmful to minors speech that is fully protected as to adults. [6]    Moreover, libraries can and do enable blocking software categories, such as N2H2’s “Tasteless” category, that will block an entire category of content that is wholly unrelated to the Act’s prohibited categories.    PFF 172-74.                 The overbroad sweep of the blocking software category definitions is compounded by the fact that the companies persistently block sites that clearly do not match even those definitions, a fact demonstrated by both plaintiffs’ and defendants’ experts.    The study performed by blocking software expert Benjamin Edelman and the three librarian experts showed that four popular blocking software products incorrectly blocked between 4,300 and 6,300 pages that would be of use or value in a public library.    PFF 9, 158, 200-19, 224-40.    It is undisputed that these pages represent only a small fraction of Web pages wrongly blocking by these blocking products.    PFF 9, 158.                 Both plaintiffs’ and defendant’s experts identified a number of Web pages that were incorrectly blocked by the software.    Examples include:    a page containing a report on “Male Sex Work & AIDS in Canada,” PFF 220; “kittyporn.com,” a parody site featuring pictures of kittens, PFF 221; a promotional site for the movie “The Opposite of Sex,”  id. ; a page from Salon.com, a popular online magazine, PFF 222; http://www.afraidtoask.com/index.html, the homepage of one of the plaintiffs’ Web site, which offers information on personal health issues, PFF 224; a Web site featuring links to informational and educational Web sites about menstruation, PFF 231; http://www.bi.org, a site serving the bisexual community, PFF 233; http://www.cancerftr.wkmc.com, the Web site for the Willis-Knighton Cancer Center in Shreveport, Louisiana, PFF 234; http://www.barcelonareview.com, an online journal of international contemporary fiction and poetry, PFF 236; http://www.girlsplace.com, a site devoted to providing news, health and recreational information to girls, PFF 237; http://www.muchlove.org, the Web site for a Southern California animal rescue organization, PFF 239; a site on teen sexual health, PFF 241; http://www.bored.com, a page on a Web site devoted to providing links to the “most interesting sites on the Web,” PFF 247; http://www.altheweb.com, which provides a brief biography of former Vice President Gore, PFF 249; http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com, PFF 251; and http://www.goodbyemag.com/nov97, the November-December 1997 issue of the Goodbye Magazine, an online magazine devoted to obituaries, PFF 257.                 That the overblocking errors made by blocking software are not merely isolated incidents, but instead are the result of limitations inherent to the products, was demonstrated by both Mr. Edelman and Dr. Nunberg.    As Dr. Nunberg explained, the enormous size and constantly changing content of the World Wide Web forces blocking software makers to rely on automated tools, cursory human review, and classification techniques that will inevitably result in a significant amount of misclassification.    PFF 129-52, 190-92.    Among other things, blocking software companies typically block at the top-level of a Web site and as a result the individual pages within that site will be blocked even if they do not meet the content category definition.    PFF 146-49, 189-90.    And, even though content on certain sites may change daily or hourly, blocking software makers do not regularly re-review sites to ensure the accuracy of their classifications.    PFF 150-52, 191.    Further, certain architectural properties of the Web require blocking software companies to use a number of techniques, such as IP address blocking, and the blocking of so-called “loophole sites,” that inevitably block a large amount of protected speech.    PFF 42-45, 70-73, 186-89, 196-98.                 At trial, not only did defendants fail to refute plaintiffs’ evidence concerning the persistent and significant overblocking endemic to blocking software, they bolstered that evidence through their own witnesses.    In his study of the Internet access logs of three libraries using blocking software to comply with CIPA, defendants’ expert witness Cory Finnell found that of the sites blocked by these libraries, up to 15% were wrongly blocked.    PFF 10, 159.    To be sure, Mr. Finnell’s results underestimate the actual percentage of wrongly blocked sites, both because of the numerous methodological flaws in his study and the fact that he judged the effectiveness of the blocks according to the blocking software companies’ categories – which, as plaintiffs have explained, are much broader than the images prohibited by CIPA.    In any event, even accepting Mr. Finnell’s estimated range of overblocking of 7% to 15%, PFF 10, 159, extrapolating those numbers means that in Greenville, South Carolina alone, thousands of patrons would be wrongly denied access to protected speech on the Internet every year.    PFF 162. [7]    And based on Mr. Finnell’s estimates, the use of mandatory blocking software in all of America’s libraries will wrongly block millions of access attempts to Web content that does not even meet the relaxed standards of blocking software companies.    PFF 11, 166. [8]    By the defendants’ own estimates, then, the blocking software used to comply with CIPA will block library patrons’ access to an enormous amount of Internet speech that should not be blocked according to either the law or the blocking software’s own categories.                 Although overblocking affects a wide variety of Web sites, the evidence showed that blocking software tends to block disproportionately sites dealing with gay-related issues, safe sex, sexual health, and family planning.    PFF 220, 222, 230, 242, 245, 246, 347. For example, in his extremely limited study of blocking products, defendants’ expert witness Chris Lemmons found that the software wrongly blocked sites such as lesbian.org, lesbian.com, sexrespect.com, and condomania.com, a site on teen sexual health, and a site discussing “The Bible and the Homosexual.” PFF 241-46.                 Finally, the evidence at trial demonstrated that in addition to its overblocking problems, blocking software also fails to block a significant number of sexually explicit sites that arguably fall within CIPA’s categories.    Plaintiffs’ experts explained that due to the enormous size and exponential growth of the Web, it is simply impossible for blocking software companies to keep up with the number of new sexually explicit sites.    PFF 264-76.    Because of inherent limitations associated with blocking software, these companies will fail to “harvest” and classify a substantial number of sexually explicit sites – for example, foreign language sites, and sexually explicit sites that cannot be found through spidering or other harvesting techniques.    Id.    That blocking software regularly fails to catch all sexually explicit Internet material was confirmed by the government’s own experts.    PFF 267.    C.              CIPA’s Content-Based Restriction on Speech Fails Strict Scrutiny.                      By its terms and effect, CIPA imposes a content-based restriction on speech that is subject to strict scrutiny.    CIPA’s requirement that libraries take steps to prevent patron access to visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors draws a line between prohibited and acceptable speech on the basis of its content.    To comply with CIPA, libraries must install commercial blocking software – the only feasible “technology protection measure” available to libraries to comply with CIPA’s certification provisions – that blocks Web pages according to their content.    Libraries that enable categories such as “adult/sexually explicit” and “nudity” will block patrons from viewing Web pages because of the content of those pages. [9]    Because, as explained above,  see   supra  Part I.A.2, public libraries are public fora, CIPA’s content-based restrictions on Internet access in libraries cannot be upheld unless they satisfy the most exacting scrutiny.    See   Perry Educ. Ass’n v. Perry Local Educators’ Ass’n , 460 U.S. 37, 45 (1983). [10]                   “Content-based regulations are presumptively invalid.”    R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul , 505 U.S. 377, 382 (1992) (citing  Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N.Y. State Crime Victims Bd. , 502 U.S. 105, 115 (1991));  see also   United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc. , 529 U.S. 803, 817 (2000) (“When the Government seeks to restrict speech based on its content, the usual presumption of constitutionality afforded congressional enactments is reversed.”);  Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement , 505 U.S. 123, 134 (1992) (“This Court has held time and time again:    ‘Regulations which permit the Government to discriminate on the basis of the content of the message cannot be tolerated under the First Amendment.’”) (quoting  Regan v. Time, Inc. , 468 U.S. 641, 648-49 (1984)).    The presumption against CIPA’s content-based distinction is not changed because it targets sexually explicit speech.    To the contrary, it is well settled that sexually explicit speech that does not fall within the narrow categories of unprotected expression is entitled to First Amendment protection. [11]    Therefore, CIPA’s provisions must be stricken unless they are narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest “without unnecessarily interfering with First Amendment freedoms.”    Sable Communications of California, Inc. v. FCC , 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989) (quoting  Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment , 444 U.S. 620, 637 (1980)).    “When the Government restricts speech, the Government bears the burden of proving the constitutionality of its actions.”    Playboy , 529 U.S. at 816;  Reno , 521 U.S. at 879.                  As the evidence at trial plainly establishes, CIPA will result in the suppression of a vast amount of Internet content and thus is far from narrowly tailored to serve the government’s interest in prohibiting adults’ access to images that are obscene or show child pornography.    By using blocking software companies’ categories to comply with CIPA, libraries will block an enormous amount of content that does not even approach the narrow confines of illegal speech for adults, as well as a substantial amount of speech that cannot be considered harmful to minors.    Sexually explicit text, which is not covered by CIPA, will nonetheless be blocked because all currently available blocking software cannot block images only.    Further, the tendency of blocking software companies to seek to satisfy the least tolerant consumer “means that any communication . . . will be judged by the standards of the community most likely to be offended by the message.”    Reno , 521 U.S. at 877-78. [12]    These characteristics of blocking software would be enough, standing alone, to render CIPA’s restrictions constitutionally overbroad.    But as the unequivocal evidence at trial showed, these products block a far wider range of fully protected speech.    Such overblocking, as both the plaintiffs’ and the defendants’ experts demonstrated, is not constitutionally  de minimis ; rather, the use of blocking software in libraries will lead to the wrongful blocking of millions of attempts to access information each year.    PFF 11, 166.                 CIPA thus takes a meat ax approach to an area that requires far more sensitive tools.    As a result, the law does not even approach the level of narrow tailoring required by the First Amendment.    As the Supreme Court has explained, “the line between speech unconditionally guaranteed and speech which may legitimately be regulated, suppressed, or punished is finely drawn.    Error in marking that line exacts an extraordinary cost.”  Playboy , 529 U.S. at 817-18    (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).                 Contrary to defendants’ suggestion, the overbroad reach of the blocking software is not remedied by the ability of libraries to customize the software products.    Although libraries may choose which categories to enable, and have the ability to override manually the software’s blocked sites list, it is simply impossible, as a practical matter, for librarians to winnow the software’s blocking lists to block only those images covered by CIPA.    Significantly, librarians do not have access to the blocked site lists of the software makers, and thus cannot review the lists to determine whether particular sites should be blocked or not.    PFF 6, 125.    Rather, the discovery of wrongly blocked sites is left up to trial and error.    Given the hundreds of thousands of sites that may be contained on blocking lists, the fact that librarians may be able to unblock even hundreds of sites using this method would not fix the significant amount of unjustified blocking produced by the software.                 Nor do the Act’s disabling provisions cure the overbroad reach of CIPA’s restrictions.    As an initial matter, there are numerous technical constraints that make it difficult, if not impossible, to tailor blocking software so that it complies with CIPA.    PFF 297-301.    Consequently, libraries face serious technical obstacles to implementing the Act’s disabling provisions.                    More fundamentally, because of the stigma created by the requirement that a patron seek a librarian’s approval before accessing a blocked site, the disabling provisions are essentially ineffective.    Indeed, the disabling provisions  exacerbate  the constitutional infirmities of the law by imposing an unconstitutional stigma and chilling effect on requesting library patrons.    In a variety of contexts, the Supreme Court has recognized the severe chilling effect of forcing citizens to publicly and openly request access to disfavored, though constitutionally protected, speech.    See, e.g. ,  Denver Area Educ. Telecomm. Consortium, Inc. v. FCC , 518 U.S. 727, 754 (1996) (noting that “written notice” requirement for access to “patently offensive” cable channels “will further restrict viewing by subscribers who fear for their reputations should the operator, advertently or inadvertently, disclose the list of those who wish to watch the ‘patently offensive channel’”);    Lamont v. Postmaster General , 381 U.S. 301, 307 (1965) (striking requirement that recipients of Communist literature notify the Post Office that they wish to receive those materials).                 Plaintiffs’ patron and librarian witnesses testified that patrons would be unlikely to request unblocking of sites on sensitive topics because of the stigma attached to making such a request.    PFF 277-79.    This testimony is confirmed by common sense:    it is hardly speculative to conclude that people will be reluctant to pursue the Act’s disabling provisions if it requires them to reveal controversial, embarrassing, or sensitive facts.    Along with basic notions of privacy, most people are aware that blocking software often block access to materials that, although constitutionally protected, are undesirable, offensive, or reprehensible to some.    Indeed, the premise that patrons will not use the Act’s disabling provisions because of the stigma attached to making unblocking requests was supported by the experience of defendants’ own library witnesses.    PFF 280-83.    In Greenville, for example, the library received only 28 requests for unblocking during the nearly two years it has used blocking software, PFF 282;  see also  PFF 281, 283, despite the fact that during that same time, using the estimates of Mr. Finnell, there were tens of thousands of access requests that were wrongly blocked by Greenville’s blocking software.    The logical inference to be drawn from this example is that patrons are deterred from asking librarians to unblock sites.    Thus, CIPA’s disabling provisions do not solve the Act’s unconstitutionally broad restriction on speech. [13]                 Just as CIPA is not narrowly tailored to serve the government’s goal of preventing access to illegal obscenity and child pornography, CIPA cannot be justified as a means to protect children.    CIPA is primarily defended as a means to protect minors from exposure to sexually explicit material in the public library.    See  S. Rep. No. 106-141, at 7 (1999) (important purpose of CIPA is that of “protecting  children  from exposure to sexually explicit material”) (emphasis added);  id.  at 1 (“The purpose of this bill is to protect America’s  children  . . .”) (emphasis added).    Because a law that prohibits speech to protect minors is by definition targeted at the content of that speech, this justification confirms that CIPA must satisfy strict scrutiny.    Playboy , 529 U.S. at 811 (“The overriding justification for the regulation is concern for the effect of the subject matter on young viewers.    Section 505 is not justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech.” (internal quotations and citations omitted);  Reno , 521 U.S. at 868 (“And the purpose of the CDA is to protect children from the primary effects of ‘indecent’ and ‘patently offensive’ speech, rather than any ‘secondary’ effect of such speech.    Thus, the CDA is a content-based blanket restriction on speech . . . .”).                 CIPA’s broad restriction on adult speech cannot be justified solely by reference to the government’s interest in protecting children.    Although the Supreme Court has “repeatedly recognized the governmental interest in protecting children from harmful materials[,] . . . that interest does not justify an unnecessarily broad suppression of speech addressed to adults.    As we have explained, the Government may not ‘reduc[e] the adult population . . . to . . . only what is fit for children.’”    Reno , 521 U.S. at 875 (citations omitted).    But that is precisely what CIPA does:    it requires libraries to ban adult patrons’ access to a vast amount of Internet content in the name of protecting children from viewing sexually explicit material.    “Surely, this is to burn the house to roast the pig.”    Butler v. Michigan , 352 U.S. 380, 383 (1957);  see also   Denver Area , 518 U.S. at 759;  Sable , 492 U.S. at 128;  Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp. , 463 U.S. 60, 74 (1983) (“The level of discourse reaching a mailbox simply cannot be limited to that which would be suitable for a sandbox.”);  ACLU v. Reno , 217 F.3d 162, 173 (3d Cir. 2000).    As the Supreme Court in  Reno  explained:    In order to deny minors access to potentially harmful speech, the CDA effectively suppresses a large amount of speech that adults have a constitutional right to receive and to address to one another.    That burden on adult speech is unacceptable if less restrictive alternatives would be at least as effective in achieving the legitimate purpose that the statute was enacted to serve.         521 U.S. at 874;  see also   Playboy , 529 U.S. at 814 (“[E]ven where the speech is indecent and enters the home, the objective of shielding children does not suffice to support a blanket ban if the protection can be accomplished by a less restrictive alternative.”).                 The remaining interest advanced by defendants in support of CIPA – the interest in preventing library patrons from engaging in behavior related to viewing sexually explicit material or otherwise offending other patrons by viewing such material in the public library – also fails to satisfy strict scrutiny.    “This justification focuses  only  on the content of the speech and the direct impact that speech has on its listeners.”    Boos v. Barry , 485 U.S. 312, 321 (1988) (opinion of O’Connor, J.).    Such a justification always warrants strict scrutiny.    See   id. ;  Playboy , 529 U.S. at 812-13;  Reno , 521 U.S. at 868;  Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement , 505 U.S. 123, 134 (1992);  Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. New York State Crime Victims Bd. , 502 U.S. 105, 118 (1991).    Indeed, the government’s purported interest in shielding others from a viewer’s reaction to speech is in itself suspect.    “[T]he Constitution does not permit government to decide which types of otherwise protected speech are sufficiently offensive to require protection for the unwilling listener or viewer.    Rather . . . the burden normally falls upon the viewer to ‘avoid further bombardment of (his) sensibilities simply by averting (his) eyes.’”    Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville , 422 U.S. 205, 210-11 (1975).    “Where the designed benefit of a content-based speech restriction is to shield the sensibilities of listeners, the general rule is that the right of expression prevails, even where no less restrictive alternative exists.    We are expected to protect our own sensibilities ‘simply by averting [our] eyes.’”    Playboy , 529 U.S. at 813 (quoting  Cohen v. California , 403 U.S. 15, 21 (1971)).                 Because CIPA’s ban on speech is so wide, and includes a significant amount of Internet speech that is in no way related – much less tailored – to the images CIPA seeks to prohibit, the law fails strict scrutiny even without the existence of less restrictive alternatives.    See   id.    At the very least, “[t]he breadth of this content-based restriction of speech imposes an especially heavy burden on the Government to explain why a less restrictive provision would not be as effective as [CIPA].”    Reno , 521 U.S. at 879.    Defendants have wholly failed to carry their burden of showing the absence of any less restrictive alternative that could further their interests “without unnecessarily interfering with First Amendment freedoms.”    Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment , 444 U.S. 620, 637 (1980);  see also   Mainstream Loudoun II , 24 F. Supp. 2d at 566-67 (finding numerous less restrictive alternatives to mandatory blocking of Internet access in public library).                  At trial, plaintiffs identified a number of alternative methods that, used alone or in conjunction, would further the government’s stated interests in a manner far less burdensome on protected speech than the mandatory use of blocking software for all adults and all minors regardless of age.    These alternatives include the  optional  use of blocking software; policies under which parents decide whether their children will use terminals with blocking software; the use of blocking software only for younger children (either restricted to children’s areas or through age identification policies); enforcement of local Internet use policies; training in Internet usage; steering patrons to sites selected by librarians; installation of privacy screens or recessed monitors; and the segregation of unblocked computers or placing unblocked computers in well-trafficked areas.    PFF 303-09, 311-17. [14]                    These less restrictive alternatives may not be perfect, but the government failed to prove that they are sufficiently ineffective to justify Congress’s decision to opt in favor of mandatory blocking software everywhere.    To the contrary, 93% of America’s libraries manage Internet-related issues without mandating such software for adults, [15]  and plaintiffs’ libraries testified that they use many of the alternatives and receive few complaints.    PFF 2, 309.    At most, defendants presented two library witnesses who testified to unsuccessful experiences using privacy screens.    But not one of the defendants’ library witnesses explored the feasibility of using all of the other available options, or some combination of those options, including less restrictive use of blocking software (such as parental permission).    See   Playboy , 529 U.S. at 824 (“A court should not assume a plausible, less restrictive alternative would be ineffective; and a court should not presume parents, given full information, will fail to act.”).    At the same time, of course, blocking software is itself only marginally effective.    Although the Greenville library witnesses testified that the library’s previous attempts to address problems related to patrons viewing sexually explicit Web sites had been ineffective, those problems persisted even  after  Greenville installed its blocking software.    See  Defs’ Ex. 134.    The testimony of plaintiffs’ and defendant’s expert witnesses, moreover, showed that blocking software regularly fails to block the material prohibited by CIPA.    PFF 12, 264-76.    At best, installation of blocking software will delay a patron’s effort to locate sexually explicit Web sites; there will still be a multitude of such sites accessible to determined users of Internet terminals in libraries.    Given the serious questions about the general efficacy of blocking software, and the near absence of evidence concerning the effectiveness of the proposed alternatives, defendants have utterly failed to carry their burden of showing that CIPA is the only effective means for serving the government’s interest (assuming that interest could ever justify such a broad suppression of speech).                 Further, it is not as if Congress was unaware of less restrictive alternatives when it passed CIPA.    The legislation containing CIPA also contained the “Neighborhood Children’s Protection Act,” or “NCIPA,” which unlike CIPA applies only to minors and requires schools and libraries to hold a public hearing and adopt and implement an Internet safety policy that addresses: “access by minors to inappropriate matter on the Internet”; “the safety and security of minors” when using email, chat rooms, etc. ; “unauthorized access, including so-called ‘hacking,’ and other unlawful activities by minors online”; unauthorized disclosure of minors’ personal information; and “measures designed to restrict minors’ access to materials harmful to minors.” 47 U.S.C. § 254(l).    NCIPA’s provisions present a plausible, less-restrictive alternative to CIPA, in that under NCIPA, libraries must address and make localized decisions about Internet-related issues, [16]  perhaps employing some of the alternatives suggested by plaintiffs.    Congress’s knowledge of NCIPA renders defendants’ argument that CIPA is the only effective means for furthering the government’s interest that much more suspect.    See   Playboy , 529 U.S. at 816.                 Finally, for the same reasons that CIPA’s lack of narrow tailoring fails strict scrutiny, the law is unconstitutionally overbroad.    Overbreadth and narrow tailoring are in some senses flip sides of the same coin; a restriction that is overbroad and suppresses a substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech is, by definition, not narrowly tailored.    See, e.g.,   Board of Trustees of the State University of New York v. Fox , 492 U.S. 469, 482 (1989) (“Quite obviously, the rule . . . that a statute . . . must be ‘narrowly tailored’ . . . prevents a statute from being overbroad.”).    CIPA is therefore invalid under First Amendment overbreadth doctrine, which requires the facial invalidation of statutes that prohibit some  unprotected  speech but by their scope also reach a substantial amount of constitutionally  protected  speech.     Broadrick v. Oklahoma , 413 U.S. 601, 612 (1973);  United States v. Kalb , 234 F.3d 827, 834 (3d Cir. 2000),  cert. denied , 122 S. Ct. 918 (2002);  Kreimer , 958 F.2d at 1265. “In such cases, it has been the judgment of [the Supreme] Court that the possible harm to society in permitting some unprotected speech to go unpunished is outweighed by the possibility that protected speech of others may be muted and perceived grievances left to fester because of the possible inhibitory effects of overly broad statutes.”    Broadrick , 413 U.S. at 612.                 D.              CIPA Imposes an Unconstitutional Prior Restraint on Speech.                  CIPA is unconstitutional for the additional reason that its blocking mandate imposes an unlawful prior restraint by effectively silencing speech prior to its dissemination in public libraries, and prior to any judicial determination of the proper level of protection afforded that speech.    By delegating the authority to restrict speech to third-party, non-governmental actors who will not reveal what they are censoring, moreover, CIPA exacerbates the constitutional infirmities inherent in any prior restraint.    CIPA’s disabling provisions inflict further First Amendment injury by vesting librarians with unbridled discretion to undo selectively the blocking companies’ censorship decisions.    1.                                    CIPA’s Basic Blocking Requirements Create an Ongoing System of Unlawful Prior Restraint.                      Even assuming, contrary to the overwhelming evidence presented at trial, that the “technology protection measures” identified in CIPA block  only  sexually explicit Web sites, CIPA still would impose an unlawful prior restraint on protected expression.    As noted above,    sexually explicit speech that does not fall within the narrow categories identified in CIPA is entitled to First Amendment protection.    For this reason, government entities – including public libraries – must apply strict, exacting standards when attempting to identify whether speech is unprotected or “illegal.”    See, e.g. ,  Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan , 372 U.S. 58, 66 (1963) (“[The Supreme Court’s] insistence that regulations of obscenity scrupulously embody the most rigorous procedural safeguards is . . . but a special instance of the larger principle that the freedoms of expression must be ringed about with adequate bulwarks. . . . [T]he line between speech unconditionally guaranteed and speech which may legitimately be regulated is . . . finely drawn. . . . The separation of legitimate from illegitimate speech calls for sensitive tools.”) (quotation and citation omitted);  see also, e.g. ,  Playboy , 529 U.S. at 817-818.    As with other prior restraints, however, CIPA impermissibly mandates that government entities silence expression prior to its dissemination, and well in advance – indeed, in the absence – of any judicial review of the speech in question.    Without proper procedural safeguards – which are not only insufficient, but actually non-existent here –    CIPA’s blocking requirements cannot stand.    See, e.g. ,  FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas , 493 U.S. 215, 227 (1990) (listing procedural requirements necessary to guard against unconstitutional prior restraints, including brevity of actual restraint, expeditious judicial review of decision, censor bearing burden of going to court and burden of proof);  Freedman v. Maryland , 380 U.S. 51, 59 (1965).                 CIPA’s federally mandated system of prior restraints is not insulated from review merely because the information in question may be available to some patrons elsewhere.    “[O]ne is not to have the exercise of his liberty of expression in appropriate places abridged on the plea that it may be exercised in some other place.”  Reno , 521 U.S. at 880 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).    See, e.g. ,  City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publishing Co. , 486 U.S. 750 (1988) (striking down as prior restraint city ordinance requiring a permit to place newspaper boxes on city sidewalks, despite the availability of alternate means to distribute newspapers);    Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad , 420 U.S. 546, 556 (1975) (invalidating exclusion of the musical “Hair” from a municipal auditorium, and stating:    “Even if a privately owned forum had been available, that fact alone would not justify an otherwise impermissible prior restraint. . . .    Thus, it does not matter for purposes of this case that the board’s decision might not have had the effect of total suppression of the musical in the community.”);  Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. City of Dallas , 390 U.S. 676, 688 (1968) (noting that evils of prior restraints “are not rendered less objectionable because the regulation of expression is one of classification rather than direct suppression”);  Bantam Books , 372 U.S. at 66-67 (invalidating as prior restraint scheme of “informal censorship,” notwithstanding fact that “morality” commission did not have enforcement powers and did not actually seize or ban any books);  Mainstream Loudoun II , 24 F. Supp. 2d at 569 (finding filtering policy to be a prior restraint, and rejecting argument that prior restraint doctrine is “limited to situations in which a government tries to restrict all speech within its jurisdiction”).                      Nor can the government shield CIPA’s prior restraints from constitutional review simply by relying on the inapt analogy to traditional collection development policies.    As noted above,  see   supra  Part I.A.3, that analogy fails for a variety of reasons.    For example, unlike with standard collection development, where trained library staff make selection decisions using their knowledge of available resources and the needs of their communities, a library purchasing and installing commercial blocking software cannot even learn what Internet information actually will be blocked and what will be made available to patrons.    Indeed, by requiring libraries to delegate these crucial gatekeeping decisions to third-party software companies, CIPA effectuates an even more egregious system of ongoing prior restraints.    The Supreme Court rejected a similar delegation of First Amendment decisionmaking authority in  Bantam Books .    In that case, the Court addressed a challenge to Rhode Island’s “Commission to Encourage Morality in Youth,” whose purpose was to “educate the public” on materials “containing obscene, indecent or impure language,” and “to investigate and recommend the prosecution of all violations” of the state’s obscenity laws.    Bantam Books , 372 U.S. at 59-60.    Although the Commission had no formal enforcement or arrest power, it notified distributors that their books or magazines had been reviewed by the Commission and were deemed “objectionable for sale, distribution or display to youths under 18 years of age.”  Id.  at 61.    The Supreme Court ultimately invalidated the Commission’s activities as a type of “informal censorship,”  id.  at 71, rejecting the claim that constitutional strictures did not apply because the Commission did not “regulate or suppress obscenity but simply exhort[ed] booksellers and advise[d] them of their legal rights.”     Id.  at 66.    The Court explained:                   This contention, premised on the Commission’s want of power to apply formal legal sanctions, is untenable.    It is true that appellants’ books have not been seized or banned by the State, and that no one has been prosecuted for their possession or sale.    But though the Commission is limited to informal sanctions – the threat of invoking legal sanctions and other means of coercion, persuasion, and intimidation – . . . the Commission deliberately set about to achieve the suppression of publications deemed ‘objectionable’ and succeeded in its aim.         Id.  at 66-67.    As with the prior restraint in  Bantam Books , CIPA places the initial, unreviewable decision delineating protected from unprotected speech in the hands of non-governmental actors.    In fact, CIPA extends the problem one step further, by conferring restrictive powers on private    companies that refuse to disclose the results of their censorship decisions. PFF 6, 125.    Even if filtering companies attempted to conform their blocking decisions to CIPA’s three categories – which they indisputably do not,  see  PFF 3, 114, CIPA’s blocking mandate would be constitutionally intolerable.                 That courts have upheld statutes criminalizing the distribution or display of obscene or harmful to minors materials hardly justifies CIPA’s ongoing prior restraints. Unlike criminal laws, which necessarily incorporate a host of procedural guarantees to protect against unconstitutional enforcement, prior restraints present the real danger of unreviewable limitations on speech.    For this reason, the Supreme Court repeatedly has held that                    [t]he presumption against prior restraints is heavier – and the degree of protection broader – than that against limits on expression imposed by criminal penalties.    Behind the distinction is a theory deeply etched in our law: a free society prefers to punish the few who abuse rights of speech after they break the law than to throttle them and all others beforehand.    It is always difficult to know in advance what an individual will say, and the line between legitimate and illegitimate speech is often so finely drawn that the risks of freewheeling censorship are formidable.         Southeastern Promotions , 420 U.S. at 558-59.    See also, e.g. ,  Nebraska Press Ass’n v. Stuart , 427 U.S. 539, 559 (1976) (“A criminal penalty . . . is subject to the whole panoply of protections afforded by deferring the impact of the judgment until all avenues of appellate review have been exhausted . . . .    A prior restraint, by contrast, . . . has an immediate and irreversible sanction.     If it can be said that a threat of criminal or civil sanctions after publication ‘chills’ speech, prior restraint ‘freezes’ it at least for the time.”);  Vance v. Universal Amusement Co. , 445 U.S. 308, 316 (1980) (describing prior restraints as “more onerous and more objectionable than the threat of criminal sanctions”);  Mainstream Loudoun II , 24 F. Supp. 2d at 568-69 (“[E]ven unprotected speech cannot be censored by administrative determination absent sufficient standards and adequate procedural safeguards.”).    2.                                    CIPA’s Disabling Provisions Establish Additional Prior Restraints on Protected Expression.                                  Although defendants repeatedly look to the disabling provisions as a way to cure CIPA’s unconstitutional breadth, they conveniently gloss over the permissive nature of those provisions.    CIPA merely allows, but does not require, library authorities to disable Internet filtering software.    See  20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)(3) and 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6)(D) (providing that authorities “ may  disable the technology protection measure”) (emphasis added).    Nothing prevents a library authority from denying a disabling request for any reason (or no reason at all), and there are no procedures for an appeal or review of the decision.    Accordingly, the disabling provisions fall within the long-disfavored category of statutes that “vest[] unbridled discretion in a government official over whether to permit or deny expressive activity.”    City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publ’g Co. , 486 U.S. 750, 755 (1988).                    Like a standardless licensing scheme, CIPA’s disabling provisions place the library authority in the role of speech gatekeeper, whose decisions are neither constrained by any defined standards nor reviewable by a court.    “The First Amendment prohibits the vesting of such unbridled discretion in a government official.”  Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement , 505 U.S. 123, 133 (1992).    See also, e.g. ,  Southeastern Promotions , 420 U.S. at 553 (“[T]he danger of censorship and of abridgment of our precious First Amendment freedoms is too great where officials have unbridled discretion over a forum’s use.”);  Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham , 394 U.S. 147, 150-51 (1969) (noting “the many decisions of this Court over the last 30 years, holding that a law subjecting the exercise of First Amendment freedoms to the prior restraint of a license, without narrow, objective, and definite standards to guide the licensing authority, is unconstitutional”).                  Defendants’ arguments challenging plaintiffs’ ability to bring a facial challenge to the disabling provisions simply miss the mark.    Defendants’ hope that library authorities will exercise their discretion in lawful ways is simply irrelevant to the constitutional question whether the law grants unfettered discretion to government officials over speech.    As with other prior restraints, the evils of the unbridled discretion in CIPA’s disabling provisions “engender identifiable risks to free expression that can be effectively alleviated only through a facial challenge.”  City of Lakewood , 486 U.S. at 757;  see also   id.  at 755-56 (citing numerous cases sanctioning facial challenges to laws granting officials unfettered discretion to regulate speech).                    In any event, the dangers of such unbridled discretion were illustrated by myriad inconsistencies in the disabling policies of the government’s library witnesses in this case.    In the Tacoma Public Library, for example, library staff will not unblock access to the Playboy.com Web site for adults, even though the library offers children unlimited access to Playboy magazine on microfiche. PFF 295.    Similarly, staff making disabling decisions in the Tulsa, Oklahoma library would not unblock access to a sexually explicit photograph on that Internet, even though the same photograph is available, unrestricted, in the library’s print collection.    Id.    Even if the evidence in this case indicated that the government library witnesses thus far have exercised their disabling authority in speech-protective ways, CIPA’s standardless disabling provisions would, on their face, be unconstitutional.    That the disabling process in libraries using blocking software is rife with inconsistencies simply underscores the constitutional dangers posed by those provisions.                 E.               CIPA’s Disabling Provisions Are Unconstitutionally Vague.                 CIPA’s disabling provisions are also unconstitutionally vague because they “fail[] to give the ordinary citizen adequate notice of what is forbidden and what is permitted.”    City of Chicago v. Morales , 527 U.S. 41, 56 (1999) (plurality opinion).    There simply is no way for librarians to apply in any consistent manner the determination of what constitutes “bona fide research or other lawful purposes.”    The disabling provisions, moreover, impose no requirements on, but merely “ allow  library officials and local administrators to provide access to materials,” further increasing the likelihood of inconsistent application.    See, e.g. ,  Grayned v. City of Rockford , 408 U.S. 104, 108-09 (1972) (“[I]f arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them.     A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an  ad hoc  and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory applications.”) (footnotes omitted).                    Recognizing the impossibility of deciphering CIPA’s disabling provisions with any precision, the government refused at trial to offer any interpretation of that language. [17]    Instead, in an effort to save the statute, the defendants eviscerated CIPA’s central requirements by declaring that libraries can offer  any interpretation whatsoever  for the Act’s disabling provisions, including one that sweeps within the “bona fide research” language “any time anybody wants to see hard core pornography.” 4/4/02 Tr. at 157.    This reading of the disabling provisions would render the entire statute essentially meaningless.    If the defendants’ present interpretation of the statute properly could be read into the Act, and if it meant that library authorities must take a patron’s one-time reasonable assurance at face value without any ability to monitor or test that assurance, then the disabling exception would swallow CIPA’s blocking requirement and make it a nullity. [18]    See, e.g. ,  Beck v. Prupis , 529 U.S. 494, 506 (2000) (noting “longstanding canon of statutory construction that terms in a statute should not be construed so as to render any provision of that statute meaningless or superfluous.”);  Williams v. Taylor , 529 U.S. 362, 404 (2000) (“It is . . . a cardinal principle of statutory construction that we must ‘give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.’”) (citations omitted).    All adult patrons simply could declare their lawful intent at the outset, and the blocking software would never be turned on.    If, on the other hand, library authorities were forced to make individualized determinations based on each patron’s particular disabling request, the disabling provisions effectively would create a system of unconstitutional prior restraints, as described above.                 Furthermore, the defendants cannot, as a legal matter, cure the disabling provisions’ flaws simply by offering a favorable interpretation that does not appear in the Act itself.    As the Supreme Court has explained, the defendants’  post hoc  reading of the statute     presumes th[at] [government officials] will act in good faith and adhere to standards absent from the ordinance’s face.    But this is the very presumption that the doctrine forbidding unbridled discretion disallows. . . . The doctrine requires that the limits the [government] claims are implicit in its law be made explicit by textual incorporation, binding judicial or administrative construction, or well-established practice. . . . This Court will not write nonbinding limits into a silent . . . statute.    City of Lakewood , 486 U.S. at 770.    See also, e.g. ,  Morales , 527 U.S. at 63-64 (fact that police department issued a “general order” limiting scope of loitering statute not a “sufficient limitation on the ‘vast amount of discretion’ granted to the police”);  Reno , 521 U.S. at 884 n.49 (“It would certainly be dangerous if the legislature could set a net large enough to catch all possible offenders, and leave it to the courts to step inside and say who could be rightfully detained and who should be set at large.    This would, to some extent, substitute the judicial for the legislative department of the government.”) (internal quotations and citation omitted).                 The defendants offer another strained reading of the Act’s disabling language in an effort to avoid the fact that only one of the government’s library witnesses even arguably complies with CIPA’s requirement that blocking software be installed on all library computers, including staff computers.    PFF 293.    According to the defendants, leaving staff computers permanently unblocked satisfies the disabling provisions because the need to check patron disabling requests always constitutes a    “bona fide research or other lawful purpose.”    PFF 291, 293.    Again, defendants’ new interpretation fails for several reasons.    First, all but one of the testifying libraries offer unblocked access even to staff that have no involvement in the patron disabling process. PFF 293.    Second and more importantly, the FCC’s binding interpretation of CIPA expressly rejects the suggestion that libraries can leave staff computers permanently unblocked, for any reason.  See   In re Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service , CC Docket No. 96-45, Report and Order, FCC 01-120, ¶ 30    (rel. Apr. 5, 2001) (“CIPA makes no distinction between computers used only by staff and those accessible to the public.    We therefore may not provide for any exemption from CIPA’s requirements for computers not available to the public.”).                 Defendants appear to suggest that there will be no danger of arbitrary or inconsistent enforcement of the disabling provisions, because libraries need not make disabling decisions on a “case-by-case” or “individualized” basis.    Again, this interpretation is wrong for several reasons.    First, as noted above, CIPA itself contains none of these limitations on the libraries’ discretion, and “we must assume that the ordinance means what it says.”  Morales , 527 U.S. at 63.    Second, the Act, even as newly written by the defendants in this litigation, still would be unclear as to what constitutes “bona fide research” or “other lawful purpose” sufficient to avoid case-by-case determinations.    Would a one-time oral statement by a patron suffice, or must the patron make this assurance prior to each individual Internet session?    Can a patron provide the “reasonable assurance” simply when she signs up for a library card?    How much discretion does the library authority have to believe or disbelieve the patron’s “reasonable assurance”?    Is the determination based on the patron’s purpose or the site’s lawfulness?    A.          CIPA Is Facially Invalid.                      Defendants’ argument that plaintiffs’ facial challenge fails because some libraries already use mandatory blocking products is wrong as a matter of fact and law.    First, contrary to defendants’ suggestion, the evidence shows that the library witnesses presented by the government use blocking software in a manner that is constitutionally flawed for the same reasons that, as plaintiffs demonstrate herein, render CIPA facially invalid. [19]    Second, even if defendants had established that certain libraries conceivably could comply with CIPA without running afoul of the First Amendment, that would not defeat plaintiffs’ facial challenge to the law.    It is well-settled that First Amendment overbreadth claims constitute an exception to the general rule that in challenging legislation on its face, “the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the [law] would be valid.”    United States v. Salerno , 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987).    Thus where, as here, plaintiffs assert that the law threatens to chill free speech – because it will censor a substantial amount of protected speech, because it is vague, and because the law creates a prior restraint – plaintiffs need not show that every library seeking to comply with CIPA will violate the First Amendment.    See   Morales , 527 U.S. at 79 n.2 (“As  Salerno  noted, the overbreadth doctrine is a specialized exception to the general rule for facial challenges, justified in light of the risk that an overbroad statute will chill free expression.”) (Scalia, J., dissenting);  Reno , 521 U.S. at 893-94 ( Salerno  rule does not apply to facial attack on Communications Decency Act on the grounds of overbreadth) (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part);  Artway v. Attorney General of New Jersey , 81 F.3d 1235, 1252 n.13 (3d Cir. 1996) ( Salerno  rule does not apply to First Amendment challenges based on overbreadth);  cf.   Morales , 527 U.S. at 55-56 (voiding criminal law for vagueness even though constitutional applications were possible) (plurality). [20]                 It makes no difference that the law challenged in this case involves federal funding subject to analysis under  South Dakota v. Dole .    The First Amendment exception to the  Salerno  rule is premised on the recognition that even if the government may enforce a law restricting speech in a constitutional manner in some instances, the potential that the law can be used to restrict a substantial amount of protected speech requires invalidation of the law under the First Amendment.    See   Morales , 527 U.S. at 79 n.2 (Scalia, J., dissenting);  see also   Broadrick v. Oklahoma , 413 U.S. 601, 612-13 (1973).    That principle applies equally here:    the remote possibility that some libraries may be able to comply with CIPA without violating the First Amendment does not change the fact that CIPA’s provisions are so facially overbroad that they will induce libraries to use blocking software that will violate the First Amendment rights of patrons and Internet speakers.    The defendants’ argument that the First Amendment exception to  Salerno  is inapplicable to Congress’s decision to fund the type of expressive activity involved here is both untenable and unsupported by any precedent. [21]    II.          CIPA IMPOSES UNCONSTITUTIONAL CONDITIONS ON THE RECEIPT OF FEDERAL FUNDS.                      In addition to unlawfully inducing public libraries to violate the constitutional rights of patrons, CIPA also violates the First Amendment by imposing unconstitutional conditions on the libraries’ receipt of federal funds.    CIPA both distorts the usual functioning of public libraries and extends significant speech restrictions to privately funded Internet access.    Here, as in  Legal Services Corp. v. Velazquez , 531 U.S. 533 (2001), “the program presumes that private, nongovernmental speech is necessary, and a substantial restriction is placed upon that speech.”    Id.  at 544. [22]                    A.               CIPA Distorts the Usual Functioning of the Public Library.                 The Supreme Court has made clear that the mere fact that a restriction on speech is part of a spending program does not insulate it from First Amendment scrutiny.    In a series of decisions including  Rust v. Sullivan , 500 U.S. 173 (1991), and most recently  Velazquez , the Court has drawn a distinction between situations in which the government acts as a speaker and those in which the government “‘does not itself speak or subsidize transmittal of a message it favors but instead expends funds to encourage a diversity of views from private speakers.’”    Velazquez , 531 U.S. at 542 (quoting  Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of the Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S. 819, 834 (1995)).    “When the government disburses public funds . . . to convey a governmental message, it may take legitimate and appropriate steps to ensure that its message is neither garbled nor distorted by the grantee.”    Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of the Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S. 819, 833 (1995).    But this “latitude for government speech” does not apply “to subsidies for private speech in every instance.”    Velazquez , 531 U.S. at 541.    Instead, when a government program is “designed to facilitate private speech, not to promote a governmental message,” the First Amendment applies with full force.    Id.    In such cases, “Congress cannot recast a condition on funding as a mere definition of its program in every case, lest the First Amendment be reduced to a simple semantic exercise.”  Id.    Like the spending program restrictions invalidated under the First Amendment in cases such as  Velazquez ,  Rosenberger , and   FCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal. , 468 U.S. 364 (1984), CIPA falls squarely into this latter category.                  Unlike the program upheld in  Rust ,   this case does not involve government speech.    Rust  involved a challenge to the Title X family planning program, which provided that “‘[n]one of the funds appropriated under this subchapter shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning.’”  Rust , 500 U.S. at 178 (citation omitted).    This had been interpreted to bar grantees from counseling patients about abortion.    Id.   at 198.    As the Court later explained, “the counseling activities of the doctors under Title X amounted to governmental speech.”    Velazquez , 531 U.S. at 541.    When the Government acts as speaker, it necessarily has latitude to dictate the content of the speech.    For example, “[w]hen Congress established a National Endowment for Democracy to encourage other countries to adopt democratic principles . . . , it was not constitutionally required to fund a program to encourage competing lines of political philosophy such as communism and fascism.”    Rust , 500 U.S. at 194.                    By contrast, when a government program is “designed to facilitate private speech” or to “encourage a diversity of views,” the government is not free to restrict speech based on its content or viewpoint.    Velazquez , 531 U.S. at 542;  League of Women Voters , 468 U.S. at 383, 392, 395;  see also, e.g., Brooklyn Institute of Arts & Sciences v. City of New York , 64 F. Supp. 2d 184 (E.D.N.Y. 1999).    For this reason, in  Velazquez   the Court struck down a law that prohibited attorneys funded with federal money through the Legal Services Corporation from making specified legal arguments that the Congress disfavored.    The “salient” fact that distinguished  Velazquez  from  Rust  was that the Legal Services Corporation was “designed to facilitate private speech,” not to act as a conduit for the government’s message.    Velazquez , 531 U.S. at 542.    Likewise, in  Rosenberger , the Court invalidated the University of Virginia’s refusal to fund student newspapers espousing a religious viewpoint when it funded other newspapers, explaining that “[w]hen the University determines the content of the education it provides, it is the University speaking, and we have permitted the government to regulate the content of what is or is not expressed when it is the speaker or when it enlists private entities to convey its own message. . . . It does not follow, however . . . that viewpoint-based restrictions are proper when the University does not itself speak or subsidize transmittal of a message it favors but instead expends funds to encourage a diversity of views from private speakers.”    515 U.S. at 833-34 (citations omitted).    And in  FCC v. League of Women Voters of California , the Court invalidated a prohibition against “editorializing,” regardless of viewpoint, by publicly funded broadcasters, noting that the broadcasters “are engaged in a vital and independent form of communicative activity.” 468 U.S. at 378.                 A key factor in identifying impermissible restrictions on private speech in funding programs is whether “the Government seeks to use an existing medium of expression and to control it, in a class of cases, in ways which distort its usual functioning.”    Velazquez , 531 U.S. at 543.    “Where the government uses or attempts to regulate a particular medium,” courts should look at the medium’s “accepted usage in determining whether a particular restriction on speech is necessary for the program’s purposes and limitations.”    Id.    Thus, in  FCC v. League of Women Voters of California , the Court considered “the dynamics of the broadcast industry in holding that prohibitions against editorializing by public radio networks were an impermissible restriction, even though the Government enacted the restriction to control the use of public funds.”    Velazquez , 531 U.S. at 543.    “The First Amendment forb[ids] the Government from using [a] forum in an unconventional way to suppress speech inherent in the nature of the medium.”    Id.                 Like these cases, CIPA does not involve government speech, and “[t]he private nature of the speech involved here, and the extent of [the Act’s] regulation of private expression, are indicated . . . by the circumstance that the Government seeks to use an existing medium of expression and control it . . . in ways which distorts its usual functioning.”    Id.    The blocking software mandated by CIPA fundamentally distorts the normal functioning of the marketplace of ideas that is the Internet.    See   supra  Part I.A.1.    In no way, therefore, can the vast majority of speech on the Internet be described as conveying a government-sponsored message.    Regardless of the setting, the material available on the Internet is so diverse that there can be “no programmatic message of the kind recognized in  Rust .”  Velazquez , 531 U.S. at 548.                 And in fact, as discussed above,  supra  Part I.A.2, the placement of the Internet terminals at issue here in public libraries undercuts, rather than supports, the government’s defense. CIPA would also distort the normal functioning of public libraries, whose traditional mission is to provide a broad range of information to meet patrons’ individual interests and needs, not to tell patrons what to read or think.    PFF 92-107.    Public libraries serve primarily as fora for private speech, not mouthpieces for government propaganda.    That over 93% of public libraries have rejected mandatory blocking policies,  see  PFF 2, 309, confirms that CIPA’s requirements fall well outside the usual functioning of public libraries.                  CIPA’s flaws also egregiously distort the usual functioning of public libraries and their ability to determine, on a local level, what information to provide to their communities.    PFF 102, 107.    Just as the statute struck down in  Velazquez  constrained attorneys in making choices central to the performance of their professional duties, CIPA unduly restricts librarians in exercising basic professional judgments about how and to what extent information and ideas will be made available to the public.    PFF 102, 106.    In  Velazquez , the Court facially invalidated a funding condition that required recipients to make one particular professional choice, the decision not to challenge existing welfare law.    Similarly, CIPA unlawfully requires e-rate and LSTA recipients to make one particular professional choice:    the decision to mandate blocking software for all patrons.    As the Supreme Court recently explained, “Technology expands the capacity to choose; and it denies the potential of this revolution if we assume the Government is best positioned to make these choices for us.”    Playboy , 529 U.S. at 818. [23]                 B.               CIPA’s Speech Restrictions Impermissibly Extend Beyond Federally Funded Internet Service.                 In addition to the unconstitutional conditions described above, CIPA’s restrictions unlawfully cover library Internet access not even subsidized by the federal funding programs.    Under the statute, a public library participating in the e-rate or LSTA funding programs must certify that blocking software operates on “ any  of its computers with Internet access” during “ any use  of such computers,” 20 U.S.C. § 9134(f)(1)(B) and 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(6)(C) (emphasis added).    Thus, the law requires libraries to block speech even on computers and Internet connections wholly paid for with non-federal money.    PFF 82, 341.    This is unconstitutional under  League of Women Voters , in which the Court found fatal the fact that the statute did not permit public broadcasting stations “to segregate its activities according to the source of its funding” or “to establish ‘affiliate’ organizations  which could then use the station’s facilities to editorialize with nonfederal funds .”    468 U.S. at 400 (emphasis added);  see also   Rust , 500 U.S. at 196-97.                    The government has argued that nothing prevents a library or library system from having a “separate set of facilities” which would offer uncensored Internet access.    In the first place, there is nothing to support the government’s reading of the statute, which plainly requires a library to certify that it has installed filters on “ any  of its computers with Internet access.”    The government has promulgated no regulations to this effect, nor has it given any binding guidance as to how “separate” those facilities would have to be (e.g., is it enough that the computers be at a separate room in the same library, or is a separate building required?).    But more generally, nothing in  League of Women Voters  prevented the people who worked at the public broadcasting station from building an entirely “separate set of facilities” with non-federal money; the question was whether they could “use the station’s facilities to editorialize with nonfederal funds,” so long as steps were taken to ensure that the federal money was not used to subsidize the editorializing.    468 U.S. at 400.    Similarly, nothing about the law in  Velazquez  prevented the Legal Services lawyers from opening entirely separate private legal services centers across town from the ones that received federal money, yet that did not save the law.    Moreover, the government has conceded that “it would be unusual indeed for a library to be in the position of having separately-funded connections to the Internet in the same facility as those which are federally funded.” Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss, at 41.    It is simply unrealistic to expect that a public library would have the funds to build entirely separate buildings for the purpose of providing uncensored access; indeed, if a library had that much money, it could turn down the federal money in the first place and avoid the trouble of building a new, separate facility.    III.         CIPA IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AS TO MINORS.                                   CIPA’s constitutional infirmities apply with almost equal force to library patrons who are minors.    Minors plainly enjoy First Amendment rights to receive information.    See, e.g. ,  Pico , 457 U.S. at 867-68 (plurality opinion);  Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville , 422 U.S. 205, 213-14 (1975) (“In most circumstances, the values protected by the First Amendment are no less applicable when government seeks to control the flow of information to minors.”).    Although the government can proscribe a wider range of sexually explicit material for minors, restrictions of minors’ speech must in other respects satisfy First Amendment scrutiny.    Thus, outside those particular areas that have been recognized as a legitimate target of regulation with regard to minors, the government cannot impose content-based distinctions or prior restraints without satisfying strict scrutiny.    See   Erznoznik , 422 U.S. at 213-14 (“Speech that is neither obscene as to youths nor subject to some other legitimate proscription cannot be suppressed solely to protect the young from ideas or images that a legislative body thinks unsuitable for them.”).                 For many of the same reasons that CIPA violates the First Amendment rights of adult library patrons, its restrictions violate the speech rights of minors.    Categories offered by blocking software companies for libraries to comply with CIPA cover a large amount of Internet content that would not be considered harmful to minors under any standard.    PFF 3, 114.    And the substantial overblocking mistakes made by blocking software apply with equal force to young library patrons.    For example, the software has been found to have blocked sites such as http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com, PFF 251; http://www.thesoccersite.co.uk, PFF 254; http://www.lakewood-lancers.org/index.htm (alumni listing for Lakewood High School in Lakewood, California), PFF 259; and http://www.hemlbros.com/index.htm (page describes the book “Piano Playing and Songwriting in 3 lessons), PFF 258.    Moreover, because the blocking software products fail to distinguish between a six-year-old and a sixteen-year-old in determining which Web sites are considered sexually explicit, blocking software will restrict the access of older minors to sites on such important and sensitive topics as sexual health and sexual identity. [24]    As the testimony of plaintiff Emmalyn Rood so compellingly demonstrated, public library Internet access may be a teen’s only viable source of such information – which, although possibly sexually explicit, is nonetheless fully protected by the Constitution.    CIPA is therefore unconstitutional as to minors because it draws a content-based distinction that is not narrowly tailored to the government’s interest in preventing minors’ access to unprotected sexually explicit material, and because it effects a prior restraint on minors’ access to speech.                    Indeed, in one important respect, the law is even more constitutionally problematic with respect to minors.    Unlike adults, minors cannot invoke the disabling provisions for libraries covered by the Act’s e-rate requirements (which cover the vast majority of the funds at issue here).    See  47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(5)(D) (authorities “may disable the technology protection measure concerned,  during use by an adult ”) (emphasis added). [25]    Thus, a teen patron doing research on sexual health issues who seeks sites that are blocked has no right to ask the librarian to disable the software.    This outright ban on disabling applies  even when parents give explicit permission and consent for their children to see the blocked sites .    There is simply no legitimate justification for such a prohibition.    In  Reno , the Court’s invalidation of the CDA rested in part on the absence of an exception in the law for instances in which parents consented to their children viewing the prohibited material.    521 U.S. at 865.    As the Court explained, the government’s legitimate interest in protecting minors from viewing certain materials is tied – and finally subordinate – to parents’ ultimate authority over the care and well-being of their children.    See   id.  at 865 n.31 (“It is cardinal with us that the custody, care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder.”) (quoting  Prince v. Massachusetts , 321 U.S. 158, 166 (1944));  see also   Playboy , 529 U.S. at 811 (“[T]he government disclaims any interest in preventing children from seeing or hearing it with the consent of their parents . . . .”);  Fabulous Assocs., Inc. v. Pennsylvania Pub. Util. Comm’n , 896 F.2d 780, 788 (3d Cir. 1990) (“The responsibility for making [decisions about whether to unblock home telephone access to sexually explicit speech] is where our society has traditionally placed it – on the shoulders of the parent.”).    Thus where, as here, CIPA both prohibits minors from viewing constitutionally protected material and interferes with the right of parents to determine the circumstances in which their children should be permitted to view sexually explicit materials, the law is squarely at odds with the Constitution.    See   Reno , 521 U.S. at 865;  Bolger , 463 U.S. at 74-75.                 By its terms, CIPA also imposes an unconstitutional prior restraint on minors.    There is no support in the case law for relaxing the prior restraint standards as they apply to children.    Loosening such standards, moreover, could be justified only to  facilitate  parental authority over the care of children – and not, as here, to  override  that authority.    CIPA simply cannot be justified as a legitimate regulation of minors’ First Amendment rights.                  On this record, therefore, CIPA violates the constitutional rights of minors as well as adults. In the event the Court reaches a contrary conclusion, however, CIPA’s severability provisions allow the Court to invalidate the law as it applies to adults without disturbing its provisions with respect to minors.    “The inquiry into whether a statute is severable is essentially an inquiry into legislative intent.”  Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians , 526 U.S. 172, 191 (1999) (citation omitted).    Here, Congress has made its intent clear, in a “separability” clause applicable to each of the individual sections of CIPA, that invalidation of some of the law’s provisions, or its application to certain individuals, should not disturb the validity of the remaining parts. [26]    It is textually possible to invalidate CIPA’s requirements as they relate to adults while leaving the provisions applicable to computer use by minors intact.    Thus, if this Court concludes that CIPA’s requirements are unconstitutional as to adults but valid as to minors, the Court could, consistent with Congress’s intent, sever the statute to reflect that holding.      CONCLUSION                 For the foregoing reasons, CIPA should be declared unconstitutional and permanently enjoined.                         Respectfully Submitted,                                                   COUNSEL FOR ALL ALA PLAINTIFFS:                            COUNSEL FOR ALL MULTNOMAH                                                                                               PLAINTIFFS:               _______________________________                          ____________________________________    Paul M.

B.          CIPA’S CONTENT-BASED RESTRICTION ON INTERNET SPEECH IN THE LIBRARY VIOLATES THE FIRST AMENDMENT.         A.              This Is a First Amendment Case.                 Plaintiffs’ opening brief explains why traditional First Amendment doctrine governs plaintiffs’ challenge to CIPA.    Thus, CIPA must satisfy strict scrutiny, and plaintiffs need not show that every library seeking to comply with CIPA will violate the First Amendment in order to prevail on their facial challenge.    Although conceding that First Amendment claims are an exception to the general rule for facial challenges, the government blithely declares that this is not “a First Amendment case,” but rather must be analyzed under  South Dakota v. Dole .    See  Defs.’ Post-Trial Br. at 17 n.11.    But defendants cannot seriously pretend that this is not a First Amendment case; and as plaintiffs have already explained, the relevant analysis under  Dole  here  is  the First Amendment.    Defendants acknowledge that  South Dakota v. Dole  forbids Congressional funding schemes that induce recipients to violate the constitutional rights of third parties.    See  483 U.S. 203, 210 (1987).    In this case, plaintiffs have shown that CIPA is facially overbroad because it requires libraries to use blocking software that necessarily will result in the impermissible suppression of a substantial amount of protected speech.    See, e.g. ,  Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition , 2002 WL 552476, __ S. Ct. __, at *7 (U.S. Apr. 16, 2002) (“The Constitution gives significant protection from overbroad laws that chill speech within the First Amendment’s vast and privileged sphere.    Under this principle, [a law] is unconstitutional on its face if it prohibits a substantial amount of protected expression.”).    The statute thus creates a significant risk that it will induce libraries to violate the First Amendment rights of its patrons.     As such, CIPA cannot be sustained on its face as a valid exercise of Congress’s spending power under  Dole , regardless of whether an individual library could implement CIPA’s requirements in a way that did not violate the First Amendment.    Defendants’ argument to the contrary turns the overbreadth doctrine on its head.    B.              Internet Speech in Public Libraries Is Fully Protected by the First Amendment.                      In an attempt to shield CIPA from any serious constitutional scrutiny, the defendants mischaracterize the nature of both the Internet and the public library, arguing for an analysis that is legally and factually flawed and would render the substantial amount of overblocking in libraries essentially irrelevant.                    The defendants concede, as they must, that “the physical space of the library is itself a public forum.”    Defs.’ Post-Trial Br. at 21.    Defendants then attempt to escape the implications of this conclusion – including, for example, the strict scrutiny applied to speech regulations in such a forum,  see, e.g. ,  Perry Educ. Ass’n v. Perry Local Educators Ass’n , 460 U.S. 37, 45-46 (1983)    – by arguing that the library’s provision of information via the Internet somehow  limits  the speech-enhancing nature of the library forum.    Defs.’ Post-Trial Br. at 18-26.    This contention is meritless, for several reasons.                    As an initial matter, the defendants cannot possibly define the public forum characteristics of the library in such a way as to exclude the library’s central purpose, the provision of information.    If, as the defendants admit, the library is a public forum for certain designated purposes, it is difficult to conceive how those purposes could fail to include “the communication of the written word,”  Kreimer v. Bureau of Police , 958 F.2d 1242, 1259 (3d Cir. 1992), and patrons’ associated “constitutionally protected interest in receiving and reading written communications.”    Id.  at 1262.    Even if the public library is not a public forum for some purposes – for example, giving speeches or public assembly – the library remains, without question, “the quintessential locus of the receipt of information.”    Sund v. City of Wichita Falls , 121 F. Supp. 2d 530, 548 (N.D. Tex. 2000) (quoting  Kreimer , 958 F.2d at 1255). [27]                 Next, it would strain both logic and First Amendment jurisprudence to conclude that a public forum, such as the library, becomes  less  constitutionally relevant when it advances its speech-disseminating mission through the diverse medium of the Internet.    Far from being “inconsistent with expressive activity,”  Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense and Educ. Fund , 473 U.S. 788, 803 (1985), the Internet embodies the  essence  of expressive activity.    See, e.g. ,    Reno v. ACLU , 521 U.S. 844, 870, 872 (1997).    If libraries are public fora designated for the communication and receipt of information, the Internet surely amplifies that mission by vastly expanding the amount of materials available to patrons.    See, e.g. , PFF 74-76; Pls.’ Joint Supplemental Findings of Fact ¶ 30.                 That it may be permissible for a library “to limit its Internet service  solely  to websites selected by library staff,” Defs.’ Post-Trial Br. at 23, is beside the point. [28]    In fact, as with traditional public fora such as parks and streets, a library need not offer any Internet access at all.    But although the library is under no constitutional obligation to provide any public Internet access, or to expand public Internet service beyond the limited offering of selected recommended sites, “as long as it does so it is bound by the same standards as apply in a traditional public forum.”    Perry , 460 U.S. at 46. “Reasonable time, place and manner regulations are permissible” – such as content-neutral limitations on patron use of chat rooms, or time limits on computer use – but “a content-based prohibition must be narrowly drawn to effectuate a compelling state interest.”    Id.  at 60.    As plaintiffs have demonstrated, CIPA falls well short of these requirements.                  In seeking constitutional latitude for CIPA’s sweeping restrictions, the defendants argue that the relevant forum in this case is “the library’s collection of materials to be made available to the public.”    Defs.’ Post-Trial Br. at 20.    Even accepting that definition, however, libraries historically have “made available to the public”  both  materials in the libraries’ physical collection – which necessarily are limited by resource and space limitations, PFF 104 –  and  materials and information from other sources, through, for example, bibliographic access tools and interlibrary loan programs.    PFF 98. [29]    As with interlibrary loan, a library providing broad Internet access (beyond simple recommended site lists) opens a window to an enormous amount of information not otherwise available in the library’s physical collection. [30]    When doing so, the library cannot, consistent with the First Amendment, selectively close that window to one type of disfavored content. [31]                    Defendants’ theory that libraries can comply with constitutional strictures simply by defining their fora to exclude one category of speech – so-called “pornographic” materials, Defs.’ Post-Trial Br. at 1, 22 – fails for two additional reasons.    First, accepting defendants’ argument would render  every  governmental speech restriction permissible once the state describes the relevant forum to incorporate that restriction.    But as plaintiffs have already explained, as in the funding context, the government cannot recast a speech limitation as a mere forum definition, “lest the First Amendment be reduced to a simple semantic exercise.”    Legal Services Corp. v. Velazquez , 531 U.S. 533, 547 (2001). [32]                   Second, even if it were legally sound, defendants’ theory – indeed, much of their defense of CIPA – rests on the faulty premise that blocking software actually blocks only a limited class of Internet speech.    The government declares that instances in which these products block non-sexually explicit sites “are relatively rare.”    Defs.’ Post-Trial Br. at 39.    That assertion is flatly contradicted by the overwhelming evidence presented at trial, which shows that overblocking is a rampant, unsolvable problem.    See  Pls.’ Post-Trial Br. at 10-14.    Indeed, even the government’s own experts confirmed that, if used in public libraries nationwide pursuant to CIPA’s requirements, blocking software would improperly block millions of access attempts every year.    See  PFF 11, 166. [33]    The undisputed evidence demonstrates that the erroneous blocks cover a wide array of non-pornographic information that is perfectly appropriate for use in any public library.    PFF 213-15.    Thus, even if the government could disregard basic First Amendment principles and library practice, and could redefine the relevant library forum to include everything but so-called “pornography,” [34]  CIPA’s broad mandate still would not pass constitutional muster.                 C.              The Government’s Own Evidence Demonstrates Why CIPA Fails Strict Scrutiny.                      In light of the overwhelming evidence of blocking software’s broad censorial sweep, defendants have failed to carry their burden of showing that CIPA’s restrictions are narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest.    Contrary to the government’s contention, the practices of its library witnesses do not accomplish narrow tailoring.    Defendants argue that the experience of these witnesses demonstrates that libraries can sufficiently customize blocking software to ameliorate any overblocking errors.    But Mr. Finnell’s study shows that even with efforts to tailor the software, these libraries still block a substantial number of innocuous sites that are protected for both adults and minors.    PFF 159-163.    In an effort to minimize the impact of these overblocking numbers, the government relies in large part on testimony by David Biek of the Tacoma Public Library that his library’s software correctly blocks 98% of the time.    Yet the government fails to acknowledge that Mr. Biek’s self-serving assessment of the performance of his library’s blocking software is entirely unsupported by any data, and is directly contradicted by Mr. Finnell’s findings.    Indeed, Mr. Finnell’s analysis of the Tacoma logs indicated an overblocking rate that was over three times higher than Mr. Biek’s estimate.    PFF 160, 167.                 Defendants simply have not justified such a substantial infringement on protected speech.    The government asserts that CIPA’s provisions further libraries’ interest in protecting against illegal materials, but it has not shown (and cannot show) that this interest justifies such a wide-ranging suppression of fully protected speech.    See   Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition , 2002 WL 552476, at *13 (“The argument, in essence, is that protected speech may be banned as a means to ban unprotected speech.    This analysis turns the First Amendment upside down.    The Government may not suppress lawful speech as the means to suppress unlawful speech.”);  see also, e.g. ,  United States v. Playboy Entm’t. Group , 529 U.S. 803, 817-18 (2000). [35]    Likewise, as plaintiffs explain in their opening brief, the government’s purported interest in protecting children from exposure to sexually explicit materials cannot justify a blanket ban on adults’ access to such constitutionally protected speech.    See   Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition , 2002 WL 552476, at *11 (“[S]peech within the rights of adults to hear may not be silenced completely in an attempt to shield children from it.”).    All of the government’s library witnesses apply the same blocking standards to adults and minors, [36]  thereby “reduc[ing] the adult population . . . to reading only what is fit for children.”    Butler v. Michigan , 352 U.S. 380, 383 (1957);  see also   Reno v. ACLU , 521 U.S. 844, 877 (1997);  Denver Area Educ. Telecomm. Consortium, Inc. v. FCC , 518 U.S. 727, 759 (1996);  Sable Communications of California, Inc. v. FCC , 492 U.S. 115, 128 (1989);  Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp. , 463 U.S. 60, 74 (1983).    And there simply is no legitimate government interest in preventing adult patrons from accessing sexually explicit speech that is protected by the First Amendment.    Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition , 2002 WL 552476, at *7 (“It is also well established that speech may not be prohibited because it concerns subjects offending our sensibilities.”). [37]    Even if there were, that would not justify CIPA’s broad censorship of non-sexually explicit speech.                    The government’s defense of CIPA breaks down altogether when it comes to its burden of showing the absence of less restrictive alternatives.    Defendants and their library witnesses claim that the use of mandatory blocking software for all patrons is justified to protect children from exposure to harmful to minors material.    But there is no evidence that any of these libraries has ever tried, much less considered, the most obvious less restrictive way of furthering this purported purpose:    using blocking software only during use by young children, with provisions allowing for parental consent.    Thus, while Mr. Biek claims that mandatory blocking software was needed at his library to address the problem of teenagers accessing sexually explicit material on the Internet, Tacoma never tried using blocking software only for minors.    The government therefore cannot claim that CIPA’s requirement of mandatory blocking software is the only effective means for furthering its interests because it has not even explored, much less proven the ineffectiveness of, these other options.                    Not only have defendants failed to show that no other less restrictive alternatives exist, they have not shown that blocking software is very effective at furthering the government’s claimed goal of preventing the display of “hard core pornography.”    The government’s brief essentially ignores the evidence that blocking products consistently fail to block a large amount of the materials targeted by CIPA.    See  PFF 12, 264-76.    Even the very limited study of government expert Chris Lemmons concluded that four commonly used blocking products failed to block 8% of 200 “hard core pornographic” sites chosen by Lemmons, with one of the most popular products, Cyber Patrol, failing to block over 17% of those sites.    DPF 305, 308.    That the implementation of mandatory blocking software is not effective at stopping individuals from accessing sexually explicit content on the Internet is demonstrated by the Greenville library, where complaints about such instances persisted even  after  Greenville installed its blocking software.    See  Defs’ Ex. 134.    Indeed, defendants concede that the blocking software does not solve the purported problem of patrons accessing sexually explicit Web content.    Defs.’ Post-Trial Br. at 29.    D.              CIPA’s Disabling Provisions Compound Its Constitutional Problems.                 Plaintiffs already have shown that the provisions in CIPA allowing librarians to disable blocking software for “bona fide research or other lawful purposes” compound, rather than alleviate, CIPA’s constitutional infirmities.    The government’s brief confirms this.    First, in an attempt to salvage the statute’s vagueness problems, the government asserts that the “bona fide research” language would permit a librarian to disable blocking software for a “pornography researcher.”    Defs.’ Post-Trial Br. at 49.    But the government goes on to suggest that under the same provision, a librarian would properly deny an identical request by an adult patron seeking disabling “for his own recreation.”    Id.  at 49 n.37.    The government’s interpretation of the statutory language flies in the face of its argument that the “bona fide research” language invites no individualized determinations into the propriety of a patron’s disabling request.    Under the government’s scenario, how would a librarian determine and verify whether the patron was seeking access to blocked sites for “pornography research” rather than “recreation”?    Would a permission slip be required?    The government’s hypotheticals make clear that the disabling provisions empower – and indeed require – librarians to make the kind of  ad   hoc  and subjective judgments that create the danger of arbitrary and inconsistent applications of the law.    As a result, the disabling provisions are hopelessly and unconstitutionally vague.    See, e.g. ,  Grayned v. City of Rockford , 408 U.S. 104, 108-09 (1972).                 Second, the defendants’ contention that the disabling provisions will have no chilling effect on library patrons’ speech once again rests upon a distortion of the nature of plaintiffs’ claims.    See  Defs.’ Post-Trial Br. at 46.    Contrary to defendants’ assertion, the right at issue is not an absolute right to receive speech anonymously, but the right of library patrons not to have to petition the government for access to disfavored speech to which they are lawfully entitled.    See   Denver Area , 518 U.S. at 754;    Lamont v. Postmaster General , 381 U.S. 301, 307 (1965);  Sund v. City of Wichita Falls , 121 F. Supp. 2d 530, 551 n.23 (N.D. Tex. 2000);  Mainstream Loudoun v. Board of Trustees of the Loudoun County Library (“Mainstream Loudoun I”) , 2 F. Supp. 2d 783, 797 (E.D. Va. 1998). [38]    The experience of the government’s testifying witnesses shows that librarians may look with disfavor upon certain types of speech in making disabling decisions, even if that speech is fully protected by the Constitution (and indeed, even if the Web content is indistinguishable from material in the library’s non-digital collection).    Thus Mr. Biek testified that he would not disable Playboy.com for a 45-year-old physician, even though his library offers unrestricted access to Playboy, even for children, elsewhere in the library collection.    See  Biek 3/28/02 at 135; PFF 295.    The deterrent effect of wholly discretionary disabling is evident in the strikingly low number of unblocking requests received by these libraries.    See  PFF 280-83.                 Third, defendants concede that the distinction between the e-rate disabling provisions (which do not allow disabling for minors under any circumstances) and the LSTA disabling provisions (which allow disabling for adults and minors) is wholly irrational.    Defs.’ Post-Trial Br. at 48.    Plaintiffs’ opening brief demonstrates that the e-rate provisions’ total ban on disabling for minors – even with parental consent – imposes an impermissible prior restraint on minors and unjustifiably burdens their First Amendment rights and the rights of their parents.    Defendants do not even attempt to defend this restriction; to the contrary, they admit that there is no rational basis for it.    Accordingly, the e-rate provisions’ ban on disabling for minors plainly cannot be sustained as a valid restriction of minors’ speech.         II.               CIPA’S UNCONSTITUTIONAL CONDITIONS ARE FATAL TO THE ACT.                      Defendants raise a number of arguments to justify the egregiously unconstitutional conditions imposed by CIPA, none of which saves the statute.    As an initial matter, defendants focus on the open question whether libraries, as public entities, have independent First Amendment rights.    Defs.’ Post-Trial Br. at 53-57.    But this determination is unnecessary to the Court’s resolution of plaintiffs’ claims.    Libraries plainly have standing to assert their patrons’ rights,  see  Pls.’ Post-Trial Br. at 38 n.20.    In addition, public libraries are best positioned to challenge the use of the federal government’s spending power to conscript them into a massive distortion of private communication in an area specifically designed to “encourage a diversity of views.”    Velazquez , 531 U.S. at 542;  Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of the Univ. of Va. , 515 U.S. 819, 834 (1995). [39]                   The tenuousness of the defendants’ position is highlighted by their desperate reliance on a supposed “educational purposes” limitation in the e-rate program. [40]    Defs.’ Post-Trial Br. at 62 (arguing that “educational purposes” limitation “fundamentally distinguishes this case from  Velazquez ”).    It goes without saying that public libraries provide information not only for educational purposes, but also for recreational, professional, and other purposes, PFF 95; the defendants did not even attempt to refute this fundamental point at trial, because they could not.    Of course, Internet service in public libraries – including that funded in whole or part by e-rate discounts – necessarily includes the daily, continuous provision of non-educational online materials.                    There is no indication, moreover, that e-rate funding has ever been limited to educational purposes.    As the defendants concede, the FCC has never denied any library e-rate discounts because the Internet access provided by the library failed to meet the “educational purposes” requirement of the universal service statute.    PFF 469. [41]     Having ignored this provision throughout the history of the e-rate program, the government cannot now invoke some dormant “limitation” to suit its present censorial purposes. [42]    Cf.    Barnhart v. Walton , 122 S. Ct. 1265, 1270 (2002) (when construing statute, Court places great weight on agency’s historical interpretation (citing  North Haven Bd. of Educ. v. Bell , 456 U.S. 512, 522, n. 12 (1982))).                 Furthermore, contrary to the defendants’ suggestion that unconstitutional conditions attach only where a condition amounts to viewpoint discrimination, Defs’. Br. at 60-61, content-based funding conditions undoubtedly are constitutionally suspect.    The invalidated regulation in  FCC v. League of Women Voters , 468 U.S. 364 (1984), for example, was merely content-based, restricting  all  “editorializing” by recipients, regardless of viewpoint.    See   id.  at 383 (“[T]he scope of § 399's ban is defined solely on the basis of the content of the suppressed speech.”);  id.  at 384 (“[T]he First Amendment’s hostility to content-based regulation extends not only to restrictions on particular viewpoints, but also to prohibition of public discussion of an entire topic.” (quoting  Consolidated Edison Co. v. Public Service Comm’n of NY , 447 U.S. 530, 537 (1980))).                 Defendants, moreover, offer little justification for the unduly broad reach of CIPA’s conditions, which extend to  privately  funded Internet service in libraries.    See  Pls.’ Post-Trial Br. at 44-46.    As in  League of Women Voters , CIPA impermissibly requires a library receiving e-rate discounts or LSTA grants to block  all  Internet access, even if the recipient “receives only 1% of its overall income from [federal] grants.”    468 U.S. at 400.                    Defendants’ heavy reliance on government speech cases such as  Rust v. Sullivan , 500 U.S. 173 (1991), and  Regan v. Taxation With Representation , 461 U.S. 540 (1983), is wholly unavailing.    As the Supreme Court repeatedly has made clear, where, as in  Rust  and  Regan , the funds at issue merely advance government speech, rather than facilitating a broad range of private speech, the analysis is “altogether different.”    Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System v. Southworth , 529 U.S. 217, 235 (2000) (distinguishing  Rust  and  Regan ).    See also, e.g. ,    Velazquez , 531 U.S. at 541 ( Rust  concerned program that “amounted to governmental speech”);  Rosenberger , 515 U.S. at 833 (government in  Rust  “used private speakers to transmit specific information pertaining to its own program”).    The public library, on the other hand, is “designed for freewheeling inquiry,” [43]   Board of Educ. v. Pico , 457 U.S. 853, 915 (1982) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting), and therefore may not be profoundly distorted through funding conditions like those in CIPA.    Velazquez , 531 U.S. at 541;  Rosenberger , 515 U.S. at 833-34;  League of Women Voters , 468 U.S. at 378, 383, 392, 395.    III.         THE INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS’ CLAIMS ARE RIPE.                 Contrary to defendants’ repeated assertions, the claims of the individual plaintiffs in this case are ripe for review.    The evidence shows that the individual patron plaintiffs regularly use the library for information to which they will be wrongly denied access if CIPA is upheld, given the record on blocking software.    See  PFF 343-351; 389-400; 422-438.    Likewise, it is undisputed that all of the Web sites of the individual plaintiffs have been blocked by at least one popular blocking product, and these plaintiffs have a realistic fear that they will continue to be blocked.    PFF 210, 352-56; 439-59.    In any event, defendants’ ripeness argument is nothing more than a variation on their refusal to recognize that the plaintiffs in this case assert First Amendment facial challenges to CIPA.    Where, as here, a law threatens to suppress a substantial amount of protected speech, plaintiffs may bring a pre-enforcement challenge, even if they have not suffered – or would not suffer – constitutional injury under those laws.    See   Virginia v. American Booksellers Ass’n , 484 U.S. 383, 393 (1988);  Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement , 505 U.S. 123, 129 (1992);  City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publ’g Co. , 486 U.S. 750, 755-56 (1988);  Members of the City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent , 466 U.S. 789, 798-99 (1984);  see also   Presbytery of Orthodox Presbyterian Church v. Florio , 40 F.3d 1454, 1463-64 (3d Cir. 1994) (facial challenge to statute on First Amendment grounds was ripe);  Planned Parenthood v. Farmer , 220 F.3d 127, 148 (3d Cir. 2000) (“Federal court review is not foreclosed merely because there is a pre-enforcement challenge to a state statute.”).                 Moreover, the concerns underlying the ripeness doctrine simply are not present here.    Defendants do not dispute that the facial claims of the other plaintiffs are ripe in this case, and that the Court may adjudicate those claims, based on the extensive record developed at trial. [44]    Thus, the “basic rationale of the ripeness requirement” – “‘to prevent the courts, through the avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements,’”  Artway v. Attorney General of State of New Jersey , 81 F.3d 1235, 1246-47 (3d Cir. 1996) (quoting  Abbott Labs v. Gardner , 387 U.S. 136, 148 (1967)) – is not implicated.    Because this Court will resolve the common claims of all plaintiffs, and because the record establishes the particular claims of the individual plaintiffs with sufficient concreteness, defendants’ ripeness arguments must be rejected.    CONCLUSION                 For the foregoing reasons, CIPA should be declared unconstitutional and permanently enjoined.                         Respectfully Submitted,     COUNSEL FOR ALL ALA PLAINTIFFS:                            COUNSEL FOR ALL MULTNOMAH                                                                                               PLAINTIFFS:          _______________________________                          ____________________________________    Paul M.

The copy continues: ""The Internet caused the problem. It's only fitting it should also provide the solution."" As it happens, the advertiser is offering remote management of network security. But the slogan would serve just as well for dozens of other electronic products and services that promise to address the manifold anxieties that the Internet gives rise to--anxieties about hackers, threats to privacy, spam, rumors, commercialism, pornography, fraud, lost work time, or simply the difficulty of finding your way around cyberspace. For every article raising the alarm about one or another of these problems, there's a clutch of software engineers sitting in a loft somewhere trying to turn the concern into a market opportunity.          It's an understandable response, given the remarkable achievements of the technology and the hype that    accompanies every new innovation. But it can also lead to misguided or even irresponsible decisions, as people naively trust the technology to right its own wrongs. It's one of the more dangerous guiding principles of the new economy: The remedy for the abuse of digital technology is more digital technology.          The problem is nowhere more evident than in the frenzy to equip homes, schools, libraries, and workplaces with blocking technology--the programs described as ""content filtering software"" by their makers and as ""censorware"" by their critics. They go by suggestive names like CYBERsitter, SafeClick, Cyber Patrol, NetNanny, SurfWatch, and I-Gear. It's a good business to be in right now. A recent report by the research firm IDC estimates that the content filtering market exceeds $150 million a year right now and will reach $1.3 billion by 2003. Parents have been buying the software to protect their children, and search engines and Internet service providers (ISPs) have been offering blocking as a subscriber option. Corporations have been using the software to block employees' access to pornography (often citing the threat of sexual harassment charges) or, more generally, to restrict access to any non-work-related Web sites. Schools and libraries have been installing the software, sometimes reluctantly, in response to state and local laws that require its use, and federal legislation mandating filters is in the offing.          One reason for the enthusiasm about filters is that they can be seen as a benign alternative to legislative restrictions on speech or access. Such laws generally prove to be unconstitutional--like the Communications Decency Act, which was overturned in 1997. [See Marjorie Heins, ""Screening Out Sex: Kids, Computers, and the New Censors,"" TAP, July-August 1998.] In fact, when the Third Circuit Court suspended enforcement of the 1998 Child Online Protection Act in February 1999, it cited filters as a less restrictive alternative. Advocates of filters argue that since the software is a commercial product that people adopt voluntarily, questions of censorship can't arise. As the director of one service provider that uses the software put it, ""The First Amendment is not concerned with the capricious acts of individuals but rather with ... the danger posed by the enormous power wielded by the federal government.""          Even so, filters have their critics, particularly among civil libertarians and librarians. They argue that requiring filters in schools or libraries can itself be a form of censorship, even if the lists of sites they block are compiled by private companies--a view that was supported in 1998 by a federal district court in Virginia. Filtering advocates have responded that First Amendment concerns don't override the custodial responsibilities of the school or library. In the words of South Carolina Attorney General Charlie Condon, ""A public library can constitutionally filter filth from the eyes of children."" But ""filth"" is in the eye of the beholder, and all filters go well beyond blocking hard-core porn, both inadvertently and by design.          Of course, First Amendment considerations aren't relevant when individuals or private organizations use filters. But there are other reasons why filters might make us uneasy. In corporate settings, the use of filters is part of a growing tendency to restrict employee privacy, along with e-mail monitoring and other forms of electronic surveillance. These steps may be legal if workers are appropriately notified in advance, but they're a poor substitute for more direct evaluations of employees' productivity. And they can intensify workers' disaffection and alienation, an effect that's exacerbated by the heavy-handed condescension with which employers often try to sweeten the pill. Take the Dilbertesque explanation that one Fortune 500 company offered its employees when it began filtering their Web use a while ago: ""Imagine yourself surfing the Web and you come across a link that says, 'Click here for cool stuff.' You    click on the link and are suddenly presented with a site that has less than suitable pictures for a business    environment. If this has ever happened to you, we have good news... ."""

Hall, Ph.D., (Complainant) filed a complaint of retaliation against the U.S. Army, Dugway Proving Ground (""Dugway"" or ""Respondent"").  (ALJX 1)  Complainant, a Dugway chemist, alleges that he has been subjected to a pattern of retaliatory treatment at work culminating in his forced retirement on June 12, 1997, and has been otherwise discriminated against as a result of his having engaged in activity protected under the employee protection provisions of the whistleblower statutes involved herein.  This complaint was investigated by OSHA and referred to the Office of Administrative Law Judges under cover letter dated April 17, 1997.  (ALJX 2)      A fifty-seven (57) day hearing was held before the undersigned commencing on June 7, 2001 in Salt Lake City, Utah.  All parties were present, had the opportunity to present evidence, and to be heard on the merits.

I. CONCLUSION       While there have been fifty-seven (57) days of hearings and while the record consists of a plethora of documents, this whistleblowing case boils down to the following simple conclusion:      David W. Hall, Ph.D., is a dedicated, conscientious and highly-motivated public citizen who has manifested these qualities throughout his many years as a public servant, no matter the task assigned.      Many administrations, beginning at the highest levels of the federal government and continuing with the current President, have consistently encouraged federal employees to report examples of waste, fraud or abuse, or to engage in so-called whistleblowing, and such employees have been told they may do so with impunity and without fear of reprisals, retaliation, harassment and/or disparate treatment.  This ""no fear"" attitude is especially important today, given the events on ""9/11"".      While employees are encouraged to use the chain-of-command, they are also told they may make their complaints to third-parties, should their internal complaints not bring about the necessary correction.  Dr. Hall numerous times attempted to utilize the chain-of-command but each attempt not only produced a lack of results but also brought about instances of reprisals, harassment, retaliation and disparate treatment.      Dr. Hall, frustrated with the futility of his internal complaints, then went outside his chain-of-command and reported his public safety and public interest concerns to third-parties, usually to appropriate officials of the State of Utah (""State"").  These reports similarly resulted in blatant instances of reprisals, harassment, retaliation, disparate treatment, as well as shunning by his co-workers.  [Page 9]     The record reflects that one of his miliary supervisors actually placed him under a ""gag"" order whereby he was told in writing that he could not go outside his agency with his complaints.  In this regard,  see  TR at 5889-5890.  In my many years of presiding over these cases, I have seen such restriction only once before.  The etiology, motivation and source for that written restriction will be further discussed below.      The totality of this closed record ineluctably lends to the conclusion that Dr. Hall had engaged in protected activities, that the Respondent, through its agents and employees, knew of such activities and that Dr. Hall experienced adverse personnel actions primarily because of such activities.      That is this case in a ""nutshell.""  I shall now further explicate my reasons for the above  CONCLUSION .      Dr. David W. Hall was employed as a chemist at the U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground from 1987 until his forced retirement in 1997.  The mission of Dugway is to test the equipment of the U.S. Armed Forces, especially the equipment used to protect against chemical and biological agent attacks by the enemies of the United States.  Dugway also tests conventional munitions and uses meteorological assets in support of the test mission.  It also supports the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on some testing.  (TR 8411)  During his tenure Dr. Hall raised a number of concerns with Dugway management and State environmental agency officials, among others, regarding potential and apparent violations of several environmental statutes, including matters relating to detection, identification, potential environmental release of, and potential human exposure to, chemical warfare agents and other hazardous and toxic chemicals.       After a series of hostile and adverse  actions were taken against him by Dugway, Dr. Hall filed a complaint with the Department of Labor in February of 1997 under the employee protection provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) and the Clean Air Act (CAA) asserting that Dugway had retaliated against him via,  inter alia , a hostile work environment and suspension of his security clearance.  (ALJX 1)  Dr. Hall alleged that Dugway retaliated against him because he had raised concerns regarding potential violations of environmental laws at Dugway involving hazardous wastes, hazardous substances, and chemical warfare agent.  (ALJX 1)  These employee protection provisions of the environmental statutes prohibit discrimination against an employee because the employee has filed, instituted, or caused to be filed or instituted any proceeding under the Act or has testified or is about to testify in any proceeding resulting from the administration or enforcement of the provisions of the Acts.   [Page 10]     Dr. Hall was forced retire in June of 1997, earlier than he had planned, due to the hostile work environment and threat of imminent action by Dugway to terminate his employment.  Dr. Hall, based on his doctor's advice,  concluded at that point that it would be intolerable to continue working at Dugway under the circumstances and that such continued work would adversely impact his physical and mental health. By that point in time, Dr. Hall had lived through ten years of hostile treatment which included an involuntary reassignment, lowered performance evaluations, negative comments on his performance evaluations, overt hostility from management including being called a traitor by an Army General, several uncalled for mental examinations, false allegations of misconduct of which he was cleared only to have the same old allegations raised against him years later, disparate treatment regarding working conditions, termination of his surety program (CPRP) approval without notice to him, suspension and recommended revocation of his security clearance following a short notice review by Dugway using irregular procedure, and direct threats from management of termination of his employment if his performance did not improve during a time when the tasks he was assigned and the performance standards being applied were set up to be impossible for him to meet, all part of a conspiracy against him.      An investigation was conducted by the DOL and a hearing was timely requested.  (ALJX 4)  A  number of continuances were requested by Dr. Hall and granted due to serious health problems that Dr. Hall was experiencing.  (ALJX 9A, ALJX 15, ALJX 31)  Trial eventually began on June 7, 2001 and initial motions were heard by this ALJ, including  Complainant's Motion for Default Judgment , a motion which was denied.  The trial was unusually long and demanding, taking some fifty-seven (57) trial days plus several days of depositions for purposes of testimony to be placed in the trial record.  The last day of formal proceedings was December 14, 2001. 1     The parties were given several extensions to present evidence in support of their respective positions and the record was closed on May 28, 2002.    [Page 11]   II. SUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE AND FINDINGS OF FACT        A. DR. HALL'S EMPLOYMENT, PROTECTED ACTIVITIES, AND JURISDICTION           1. Dr. Hall's Employment at Dugway       It is undisputed that Complainant Dr. David Hall was a civilian chemist employed by  the Respondent Dugway from 1987 until his forced retirement in 1997.  It is also undisputed that Dr. Hall's duties at Dugway involved him from time to time in research, analysis (both academic and laboratory), and preparing reports and recommendations regarding identification and detection, toxicity, environmental fate and other characteristics of chemical warfare agents.  It is likewise undisputed that Dr. Hall's duties at Dugway involved him in the study of, and making of recommendations regarding, methods for detecting these chemical agents in various media and munitions under various conditions, and in conducting and evaluating tests of various methods and materials proposed for use in defending against hostile use of chemical warfare agents and for neutralizing chemical agents.  Dr. Hall, during his tenure at Dugway, raised a number of environmental concerns with Dugway managers and State environmental agency officials, among others.  Several significant examples of Dr. Hall's reported concerns are summarized and discussed below.  Dugway managers responded, directly and indirectly, with hostility and a series of adverse actions which are identified below.  A number of pieces of direct evidence along with a substantial pattern of circumstantial evidence, identified and discussed below,  supports a direct conclusion as well as an inference that Dugway took those actions against Hall primarily because of his protected activities.            2. Dr. Hall's Protected Activities     Inadequate Triple X Decontamination Method for Chemical Warfare Agents       Dr. Hall, starting in the 1987 and continuing through 1997, reported internally to Army officials and externally to the State agency his environmental and public health concerns and compliance issues regarding chemical warfare agent contact hazards that remain after application of Army triple X decontamination methods to agent contaminated materials.  (TR 2214, 1163, 1380, 1385, 1402, 1653 [Hall]; CX 21)  Dr. Hall's reported concern was that the Army failed to properly decontaminate materials, including waste materials, contaminated with chemical warfare agents, and its failure to adequately test materials for residual agent contamination after attempts at decontamination.  Dr. Hall's concern included the Army's failure to warn and protect individuals coming into contact with chemical warfare agent contaminated materials that despite having been subjected to triple X decon methods, they continue to have residual agent contamination undetected below the surface.  Dr. Hall's concern included that due to the residual agent contamination below the surface and the inadequacy of triple X decon procedures in dealing with same, it may be impossible to decontaminate some items and these items were not being properly labeled to describe the hazards they posed and were not being properly disposed of by the Army pursuant to RCRA, apparently because of the expense involved.  [Page 12]     As there is an on-going need at Dugway and other chemical warfare facilities to do testing, disposal, and handling of chemical weapons and chemical warfare agent, inevitably, like in any industrial environment, problems occur, spills occur, and clothing and equipment get contaminated.  As the material gets contaminated, this becomes a significant hazardous waste disposal problem, and a very dangerous one.  Thus, the Army needs efficient economical ways of decontaminating equipment and clothing so that it can either be reused or properly disposed of without endangering the environment, the workers or the public.        The Army has historically relied on a triple X chemical decontamination approach, which is intended to make the contaminated material safe for disposal and handling.  The problem that Dr. Hall disclosed was that, even though the chemical treatment may be effective in eliminating the vapor hazard in large part from the contamination on the surface, unfortunately for everyone concerned, the chemical warfare agent penetrates below the surface and remains there to be a skin contact hazard and also to be a reservoir of chemical warfare agent to continue to let off gas and pose some vapor hazard.  Dr. Hall continually pointed out that the Army had a misplaced reliance on this decontamination method, and would have to either find some other way of truly decontaminating the material or face up to the fact that a continuing skin contact hazard existed on all this material and that it would have to be treated accordingly.      Respondent cites as a general thesis that some of Dr. Hall's claims of protected activities are not cognizable under the six (6) environmental statues involved herein and that claims under non-environmental army regulations also are not cognizable under these statutes;  e.g. , the complaint about incompatible storage in 1987-1989; the complaint about inadequate triple X decontamination; and claims related to the design and effectiveness of troop combat equipment,  i.e. , the M-17 and M-40 protective masks.  Moreover, Respondent submits that any complaint about tests conducted before passage of RCRA, CERCLA, TSCA, CAA, CWA and SDWA are likewise not cognizable,  i.e. , the test plan requiring soldiers to crawl through an area contaminated by Lewisite and mustard mines.  (CX 152; TR 4955-59)  These issues and defenses will be discussed below.  [Page 13]   Improper Storage of Incompatible Ignitable and Explosive Hazardous Waste Chemicals       In the 1987 through 1992 time period, Dr. Hall reported internally to Army officials and externally to the State and to OSHA his environmental and public health concerns and compliance issues regarding improper storage of incompatible, ignitable, explosive and reactive waste chemicals.  (TR 11365)  This improper chemical storage was not only an OSHA violation, but also a RCRA violation because of the potential for the uncontrolled release of toxic chemicals into the environment resulting from improper hazardous waste storage.  (CX 68, 71)  Dr. Hall reported this problem in 1987, 1988, and 1989 without success in getting the matter addressed by Dugway despite an OSHA inspection,  see  CX 69, CX 74, CX 75, CX 39 and CX 50, and he then felt compelled to bring the matter to the State's, EPA's and OSHA's attention for enforcement.  (CX 81)  This improper waste chemical storage issue was investigated by OSHA on Dr. Hall's complaint.  OSHA found violations, and enforcement action was taken against Dugway.  (CX 40, CX 60, CX 61, CX 62)      Nonetheless, some of these chemicals that had been improperly stored, by some difficult to explain circumstance, found their way into the hands of an employee, who then moved those chemicals improperly to his residential quarters, a scenario which made it a much more dangerous situation, and he continued to store the chemicals illegally until that was later discovered.  (CX 41, CX 42)    Dumping of Toxic and Hazardous Chemicals Down the Dugway Chemical Laboratory Drain       In the 1987-1988 time period, Dr. Hall reported his concern over a Dugway practice of disposing of waste solvents and other laboratory chemicals down the Dugway chem lab drain and into the non-permitted sewer system.  (Hall Deposition [RX 116], June 5, 2001 p 15-17, 21-22)  The Chemical Laboratory Division was instructed by Dugway to dispose of solvents and other chemicals down the drains and calculate amounts disposed as though Dugway were on a permitted sewer system when, in fact, Dugway was not.  ( Id. )  Hall disclosed to Don Verbica at the State (and later internally) this problem of Hall's employer (unnamed and unknown to Verbica at that time) dumping solvents down the drain and into the sewer system, a practice which was not permitted.  ( Id. )  Verbica immediately stated that Hall must be from Dugway because Dugway was the only such facility without a permitted sewer system.  ( Id. )  Dugway has admitted the practice of dumping chemicals down the drain, including chemicals that had been used to decontaminate or clean agent contaminated materials, and that the State environmental agency stopped the practice because the waste chemicals dumped down the drain were considered chemical warfare agent waste.  (TR June 11 p 142-43; TR June 12 p 30, 120, 121)  [Page 14]     Complainant had a reasonable belief that the discharge of the sodium hydroxide and ethyl alcohols residue going out the sink related to toxic and hazardous material, thereby constituting a violation of the SDWA.  That no administrative or judicial action had taken place against such discharge until this time is no defense herein.  Also Complainant reasonably believed that such discharge would adversely affect the drinking water at Dugway.  I agree with Complainant that Ms. Carol Nudell knew about and condoned and approved this practice.  There is evidence that she may even have directed such discharge.    Site Contaminated with Mustard and Lewisite Agents from Experiments with Soldiers       Dr. Hall disclosed internally and to the State that there existed a contaminated site near the Carr Facility, which should also be a restoration site similar to Simpson Butte, because mines containing a mustard/Lewisite mixture had been exploded in a field and soldiers in protective equipment were required to crawl through it to test the efficacy of their protective equipment.  (Hall Deposition [RX 116], June 5, 2001 p 8-9)    Defective Chemical Warfare Agent Gas Masks       In the 1990 time period, Dr. Hall reported  internally to Army officials issues regarding use of a silicone rubber gas mask that was defective in allowing chemical warfare agent to be absorbed and penetrate through the mask.  (TR 2216-2220 [Hall])  This silicone mask would absorb agent and allow agent to penetrate the mask making it non-protective.  ( Id. )  Hall raised this concern at a meeting at another Army chemical/military facility at Aberdeen, Maryland and was never again allowed to attend such meetings.  ( Id. )  Hall was informed by workers performing tests on this mask that they were improperly instructed to fake the agent penetration tests by putting the agent on the glass part rather than the silicone part of the masks.  ( Id. )  This mask, the M-40 without the later added protective covering or plate (added to solve the agent penetration problem Hall had identified) is the mask Hall understood was to be used and was used in the Gulf War.  ( Id. ) This mask is also used by civilian responders in RCRA and CERCLA emergency response situations at Dugway.  ( Id. )        Mr. Steelman recalled Hall raising the concern about the masks, recalled that silicone gas masks were made and tested and some were fielded.  (TR June 12 p 28 [Steelman])  He presumed that these masks were fielded during the Gulf War.  ( Id. )        Dr. Harvey recalled testing that showed that silicone rubber absorbed chemical warfare agent vapor quite efficiently compared to other materials ( i.e.  was one of the worst factors of the materials tested from the point of view of being used as a protective material).  (TR June 13 p 24-26 [Harvey])        Union President Michael LeFevre testified that he learned that the M-40 mask allowed fast penetration by liquid agent because of the silicone rubber formulation, and he became concerned about that situation.  (TR 4320-4334)  This mask was standard issue for the military and Dugway at the time, just before the Gulf War, and would be the mask to be used to respond to an agent incident at Dugway at that time and, presumably, the mask used by most of the troops in the Gulf War.  ( Id. )  Mr. LeFevre took his concerns to the Commander Colonel King and received an explanation that LeFevre considered outrageous -- basically do not raise the issue because it will hurt morale and hope that only agent vapor and not liquid is encountered in the battlefield.  ( Id. )  The project manager for the mask was working on a corrective fix for the mask but it could not have been implemented until after the Gulf War.  ( Id. )  [Page 15]   Chemical Warfare Agent Lewisite and Contamination at the Simpson Butte Site       In the 1992-1995 time period, Dr. Hall reported  internally to Army officials both in and out of the chain-of-command and externally to the State agency his environmental and public health concerns and compliance issues regarding the existence of chemical warfare agent Lewisite contamination at the Simpson Butte area at Dugway, and the potential for reformation of some forms of Lewisite after disposal and even after attempted decontamination.  (TR 11301-11307; Hall Deposition [RX 116], June 5, 2001 p 10-12; TR June 12 [Steelman] p 12; CX 77, CX 78, CX 79, CX 82, CX 83, CX 84, CX 85, CX 86)  Dugway was, in fact,  misrepresenting to State regulators that there was no free Lewisite present at the site and only harmless byproducts were present, an assertion which was not the case.  (Hall Deposition [RX 116] June 5, 2001 p 11)      Dr. Hall raised this very important concern with his management directly, and with the State, that one of the chemical warfare agents that had been used in past years called Lewisite, which is an arsenic-based chemical warfare agent, after it has been disposed of in the environment for years and notwithstanding attempts to decontaminate it, could nonetheless revert back to actual Lewisite chemical warfare agent in the environment and that certain byproducts of Lewisite are dangerous in their own right.  (TR 11314 through 11317; Hall Deposition [RX 116], June 5, 2001 p 10-11; TR June 12 [Steelman] p 12)      As could be expected, this concern certainly was not welcome news for the Army, as the generator and disposer of the Lewisite wastes, because such reformation of Lewisite in the environment from past disposal would result in increased cleanup and disposal liability and costs under CERCLA, as well as reflect CERCLA hazardous substance release reporting violations, and also result in noncompliance with RCRA hazardous waste requirements which mandate containment and very specific ways of disposing of hazardous waste, especially waste that is as toxic as Lewisite.  The existence of such reformed Lewisite uncontrolled in the environment could create an imminent hazard to public health and the environment which is subject to an legal actions for injunctive relief  under RCRA, 42 U.S.C. Sections 6972(a)(1)(B) and 6973.      The Lewisite reversion issue became focused in a particular incident or problem known as Simpson Butte where there was in fact some Lewisite waste that had been disposed of historically.  There had been a historical attempt to decontaminate it, and Dr. Hall and his colleagues were tasked to investigate that particular issue.  Dr. Hall reported that the Lewisite was present at the site and Lewisite degradation products were present that were capable of reverting back to Lewisite, even though an attempt had been made at decontamination.  (TR  11301-11307; TR 11314 - 11317; Hall Deposition [RX 116], June 5, 2001 p 10-11)  One of the dangers Hall pointed out was that the site material sent to labs as samples could contain material that would revert back to free Lewisite posing a danger to lab workers, a fact about which they were not informed.  (Hall Deposition [RX 116], June 5, 2001 p 11)  [Page 16]     On the other hand, Respondent submits that complaints or comments about the former Lewisite Demilitarization Site do not violate any of the six (6) statutes herein for the following reasons:  (1) Complainant's complaints about this were made in 1995, about 1 years before the February 12, 1997 effective date of the military munitions rule under RCRA; (2) Respondent now candidly concedes that the Lewisite breakdown products of L-2 and/or L-3 were really worker safety issues, not CAA matter,  citing   Kemp v. Volunteers of America , ARB Case No. 00-069; (3) However, that it occurred at an uninhabited remote site and Dugway is no defense, and I so find and conclude.    Potential Violations Regarding Agents GA, GF and QL       In 1994 and 1995, Dr. Hall raised concerns internally with Dugway that Dugway was handling one or more agents for which they were not permitted under RCRA by the State, and certain inadequacies existed in test procedures for one or more chemical agents.  (CX 7, CX 88-92, CX 95, CX 97, CX 98)  Dugway admitted that Dugway's RCRA permit did not authorize handling agent GA, although Dugway was handling or had plans to handle GA.  (TR June 12 p 14 [Steelman])      I note that Respondent here argues in the alternative that no violation of any of the six (6) statutes has occurred and/or that ""potential violations"" are not violations of these statutes.  I disagree - it is only necessary that a complainant have a reasonable belief that the situation constituted a violation - he/she still retains the protected status even if the situation is determined later not to be a violation.  I would also note at this point that it was reasonable for Dr. Hall to believe that the handling of GA in the manner to which he credibly testified was a violation of RCRA, and I so find and conclude.    Mustard Gas (Agent HD) Contamination at the Carr Red Dirt Site       From 1995 through 1997, Dr. Hall reported  internally to Army officials and externally to the State and federal EPA his environmental and public health concerns and compliance issues regarding the Carr Red Dirt site having mustard agent contamination.  (TR 11301; Hall Deposition [RX 116], June 5, 2001 p 6-10, 18, 20, 41-43)  Hall's 1995 concerns were a more substantial follow-up to earlier concerns Hall had in 1987 that Dugway was improperly controlling the analytical work to prevent a valid determination of whether the Carr Red Dirt did contain chemical warfare agent.  (Hall Deposition [RX 116], June 5, 2001 p 26-28)       The Carr Red Dirt pile was stored in the open environment from at least 1988 to 1995.  (Hall Deposition [RX 116], June 5, 2001 p 18-20)  It was the subject of an inquiry by the Army as to whether or not it continued to contain chemical warfare agent given the passage of time.  (Hall Deposition [RX 116], June 5, 2001 p 6; CX 44)  This vapor and contaminated dust was free to blow in the wind, as the weather would permit, and the agent was detectable by smell.  ( Id. )  If it were to be transported or disturbed, the presence of mustard agent would be important to know because if it were handled improperly, the disturbing actions would lead to release into the environment of the dust particles with the mustard agent attached, to blow wherever the wind would take it:  into living areas, off-site into public areas, into the water supply, into the air being breathed, and so forth.  These circumstances posed a potential uncontrolled release of a very toxic chemical warfare agent.  Contractor workers had alleged that they had been exposed to mustard agent while working at the location of the Carr Red Dirt, reflecting Dugway's potential liability for damages if Dr. Hall's concerns proved correct that mustard agent was present.  (CX 43)  [Page 17]   Defective PINS Device for Identifying the Contents of Recovered Chemical Munitions       In the 1994-1997 time period, Dr. Hall reported  internally to Army officials both in and out of the chain-of-command and externally to State and Federal officials his environmental and public health concerns and compliance issues regarding inadequacies in the PINS device, which was relied on to identify and characterize the unknown hazardous waste contents of used and discarded range-recovered chemical and conventional weapons. (TR 11301 through 11307; TR 2946)  The PINS device failed on occasion in finding explosives in munitions because of its very poor sensitivity to the element nitrogen, which is present in high percentage in explosives.  The PINS development was part of the program to develop the MMD (Munitions Management Device) and the related Drill and Sample Program.      Dr. Hall's concerns included the important fact that the MMD was going to be relying in part on the PINS device, the portable isotopic neutron spectrometer, which Dr. Hall was reporting did not provide complete and accurate information on the chemical contents of unknown munitions.  (TR  11301  through 11307)  The Drill and Sample PINS Validation Study was a major part of the MMD1 program, and was intended to make it easier to get the State to permit MMD1 when the time came for that.  Dr. Hall disclosed that the Army was misrepresenting the accuracy of the PINS device, an important point as the device was to be relied upon in identifying the unknown contents of munitions.  Of course, the mishandling of a munition based on inaccurate information as to its contents could lead to an explosion and the release of highly toxic chemical warfare agent into the environment, and I so find and conclude.       The MMD device was intended to be used to deal with the rather large Army problem of dealing with old discarded munitions, unexploded ordnance - bombs, rockets, and so forth- found ""in the field"" (sometimes in backyards of civilian residences) which, because of their having been discarded in the past, were not easily identified as to their contents, or as to the risk posed by the munition or whether the munitions have to be exploded or burned on the spot, in the open environment, or whether it is safe to transport them for some more sophisticated means of disposal.  Dr. Hall informed the Army that their attempted solution to this problem apparently would not work because they could not accurately identify the contents of these unknown munitions with the PINS device.  Even though the Army characterized the Drill and Sample Program initially, before Dr. Hall's whistle blowing, as a ""validation"" program for the PINS device, the program basically produced evidence that the device was not as effective as planned and the Army later changed its characterization of the Drill and Sample Program and dropped the idea that its purpose was validation of PINS.  (CX 115, CX 146)  [Page 18]     The State, in response to Dr. Hall's reporting, required when the Carr Red Dirt was moved, that workers wear proper protective equipment and that monitoring be done.  (Hall Deposition [RX 116], June 5, 2001 p 9)  Dugway Commander Col. Como eventually acknowledged by an email memo to all employees that some amount of agent had been found in the Carr Red Dirt.  ( Id. )      I note that Respondent refers to ""game playing"" by Complainant on the Drill and Sample/PINS project.  However, Respondent now candidly concedes that Complainant was correct in stating that CK - a nonstimulant - was in one of the munitions, a concession that confirms Complainant's main argument as to the lack of reliability of PINS.  Furthermore, I agree with Complainant that Dugway had unquestioning faith in the PINS technology, and that is the main problem that Dr. Hall had with the PINS device, and I so find and conclude.      I also agree with Complainant that he was not an author of the Final Drill and Sample Report as he had been taken off the project.  That the Appendix contained some of his suggestions did not make him an author of the final report - this is more than just playing semantics - this deals with integrity.    Violations Involving the Lakeside Bomb       In the 1995-1997 time period, Dr. Hall reported internally to Army officials both in and out of the chain-of-command and externally to State and federal officials his environmental and public health concerns and compliance issues regarding the Lakeside bomb, a 750-pound bomb that was erroneously thought to contain nonhazardous waste, when, in fact, it turned out to contain hazardous waste.  (Hall Deposition [RX 116], June 5, 2001 p 97; CX 8)  That bomb was part of The Drill and Sample Program and was one particular example of the difficulties the Army was having in identifying the chemical contents of unknown munitions.  In this case the misidentification resulted in the illegal transport of a hazardous waste without the required manifest.  (TR p 2947-2949)  The essence of Dr. Hall's concerns reported to Dugway managers about the PINS device was that the Army just was not yet able to properly characterize its munitions waste using the PINS device.  (Hall Deposition [RX 116], June 5, 2001 p 97)  The Lakeside Bomb was a prime example of it, and that failure led to a violation of RCRA, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, in that instance, and I so find and conclude.     Misidentification of the Chemical Contents of the M79 Mystery Bomb       In the 1995-1997 time period, Dr. Hall reported internally to Army officials and externally to the State environmental and public health his concerns and compliance issues regarding the M79 mystery bomb and the PINS device defect due to its failure to detect nitrogen in the bomb and its failure to identify the actual fill.  (TR June 12 p 44-45 [Steelman])  The actual fill (contents) turned out to be, based on Dr. Hall's work, Cyanogen chloride, rather than the initial mistaken characterizations by others in reliance on the PINS.  ( Id. )  Had the Army staff dealing with the bomb at that time had some type of perceived emergency with the munitions, they might well have added bleach decontaminant, which could have resulted in a highly exothermic reaction, a not unlikely scenario.  An Army study made it clear that use of a bleach decon could have resulted in harm to the workers.  [Page 19]   Concerns Regarding The Chemical Agent BZ Bomblets Study       In the 1994-1997 time period, Dr. Hall reported  internally to Army officials both in and out of the chain-of-command and externally to the State environmental and public health agency his health concerns and compliance issues regarding the BZ bomblets specifically and the Drill and Sample Program generally, including his concerns regarding inadequate decontamination methods for agent BZ.  The BZ Bomblet study was a smaller program under the larger MMD1 program, and was not part of the Drill and Sample PINS Validation study.      In 1997, the year that Dr. Hall eventually was forced to retire out of a concern that he was about to be terminated and that his health was being seriously hurt by the retaliation, he continued to engage in his protected activities on the Drill and Sample Program, the PINS device, the MMD device, and the BZ Bomblets.  Dr. Hall's whistleblowing, while classic in many respects, takes on particular significance in light of the subject matter.  The chemical warfare agents involved are intentionally manufactured by the military to be as toxic as possible to human beings for the purpose of disabling the enemy.  These agents are more dangerous than even the more toxic hazardous waste that one encounters at Superfund and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act sites.  These agents are uniquely and extremely toxic and designed to be so specifically to the human species.      Respondent points out that it was unable to get Complainant to complete the BZ treatability report and that it properly informed Complainant of the seriousness of his nonperformance in early 1997.      I disagree with this argument because Dr. Hall's performance was delayed by the obstacles to which he was subjected by his supervisors and those of his co-workers who participated in the conspiracy against Dr. Hall.  Moreover, I disagree with Respondent because Mike LeFevre is a knowledgeable union official, was well aware of what was going on in the so-called Ditto Technical Area, especially as it was impacting Dr. Hall, and favorably testified for Dr. Hall at the hearing, thereby jeopardizing his future prospects at Dugway. 2         I note that Respondent posits that the tasks assigned to Dr. Hall were proper and not that complicated.  However, while this may be partially true, the fact remains that obstacles were placed in Dr. Hall's way - he was frustrated at every turn by the actions of his supervisors and certain co-workers who were viewed as ""team players"" all of whom were part of the conspiracy against him.          3. Jurisdiction       Respondent submits that this Court has no jurisdiction over any of the complaints filed by Dr. Hall (1) because the military affairs of the U.S. Army cannot be reviewed or second - guessed by this tribunal, (2) because the Respondent is not subject to any of those six (6) statutes as Congress has not waived sovereign immunity for the employee protection provisions of these statutes and (3) because these alleged violations only involve state environmental provisions that actually are more stringent than the U.S. Code provisions.  [Page 20]     I disagree and this Court's ruling and discussions relating to these issues are reflected in the official hearing transcripts, and those portions are incorporated herein by reference.  Each of the statutes will now be further discussed.    RCRA Jurisdiction       The DOL's jurisdiction for hearing Dr. Hall's complaint under RCRA is apparent from numerous exhibits and abundant testimony in the record as most of Dr. Hall's protected activities involved potential violations of hazardous waste laws (the chemical warfare agents were and are classified as RCRA hazardous wastes).  Dugway had a RCRA hazardous waste permit.  (TR June 12 p 21)  The lab chemicals improperly disposed of down the lab drains until Dr. Hall and the State stopped the practice clearly were RCRA wastes.  (Hall Deposition [RX 116], June 5, 2001 p 21-22; TR June 11 p 142-43; TR June 12 p 30, 120, 121)  The agents and agent contaminated wastes are RCRA wastes.  (TR 2933)  The Lewisite (because of its arsenic content) and the mustard agent contaminants found at the Simpson Butte site, the Carr Red Dirt Site, and the mustard/Lewisite mine testing site are RCRA regulated wastes, and would also be subject to enforcement action under RCRA's imminent and substantial endangerment provisions.  (TR 2960 [Moran regarding Carr Red Dirt being a RCRA issue]; 40 C.F.R. part 261; 42 U.S.C. Sections 6972(a)(1)(B), 6973)  The BZ bomblets were also RCRA regulated hazardous wastes at a minimum because of the reactive-explosive-ignitable components of the bomblets.  The PINS device was being relied on by Dugway to identify whether or not certain munitions contained chemical warfare agent waste, which is a RCRA regulated waste (P999 and F999 RCRA waste codes in Utah).    Safe Drinking Water Act and Clean Water Act Jurisdiction       Safe Drinking Water Act and Clean Water Act jurisdiction also exists in this case.  One example of Dr. Hall's protected activity that invokes such jurisdiction is his reporting of disposal of waste chemicals down the Dugway chem lab drain and into the non-permitted sewer system and unlined lagoon.  (Hall Deposition [RX 116], June 5, 2001 p 15-17, 21-24)  As already noted above, Dugway has admitted the practice of dumping chemicals down the drain and that the State environmental agency stopped the practice because the waste chemicals dumped down the drain were considered chemical warfare agent waste.  (TR June 11 p 142-43; TR June 12 p 30, 120, 121)  These chemicals eventually discharged into an unlined pond or lagoon (Hall Deposition [RX 116], June 5, 2001 p 21-24),  i.e. , into the environment where the chemicals could migrate to groundwater or surface water ( Id. ), and I so find and conclude.      The Clean Water Act was enacted, ""to restore and maintain the chemical, physical and biological integrity of the Nation's waters. . . . [I]t is the national goal that the discharge of pollutants into the navigable waters be eliminated by 1985[.]"" 33 U.S.C. § 1251(a).  To achieve that goal, Congress enacted, among other provisions, Section 301(f) of the Clean Water Act which provides, in pertinent part: ""Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, it shall be unlawful to discharge  any   . . . chemical . . . warfare agent . . . into the navigable waters.""  33 U.S.C. 1311(f) (emphasis added).  Thus, even a tiny amount of agent migration into surface water as a result of the Dugway practice of dumping chemicals down the drain and allowing uncontrolled agent land disposal sites to go unremediated would be a violation of the CWA, and I so find and conclude.  [Page 21]     Hall's reporting of Lewisite contamination at uncontrolled disposal sites at Dugway also invokes the SDWA and CWA because of the potential for the migration of contaminated rainwater into groundwater and surface water sources.  The potential for such runoff of Lewisite chemical warfare agent contamination at Dugway is documented in the record.  (CX 82; TR June 19 p 1388-97)  Contaminants, including visible discoloration that was not identified, as well as chemical warfare agents or their breakdown products, were found in water wells and ground water at Dugway and may have migrated into the wells and ground water as a result of the past uncontrolled land disposal of chemical agents and other chemicals. (TR 3095-3104)  This further solidifies jurisdiction under the SDWA, and CWA, as well as under RCRA and CERCLA.  Under the circumstances, Dr. Hall's concerns that dumping chemicals down the drain into sewers and unlined lagoons, and allowing old chemical agent dump sites to go unremediated, posed a risk of ground water and surface water contamination, and therefore a potential drinking water threat, had a reasonable basis, and I so find and conclude.    CERCLA Jurisdiction       Dr. Hall's internal and external reports regarding old chemical agent, waste and munitions land disposal sites where chemical warfare agents HD (mustard) and Lewisite could still be present uncontrolled in the environment invokes the jurisdiction of CERCLA.  These sites whose existence and/or details of their contamination were disclosed to the State and internally to Dugway officials by Dr. Hall included the Simpson Butte site, the Carr Red Dirt site and the site near the Carr facility contaminated with mustard and Lewisite from the experiments done with soldiers in the agent mine field there.  Dr. Hall raised the issue as to whether the mine field site should also be a restoration (cleanup) site similar to Simpson Butte.  (Hall Deposition [RX 116], June 5, 2001 p 8-9)  Old land disposal sites containing dangerous chemicals are subject to remedial and enforcement action by EPA under CERCLA.  42 U.S.C. Sections 9604, 9605, 9606, 9607, 9613, 9616; 40 C.F.R. part 300 (National Contingency Plan regulations implementing CERCLA). Releases of hazardous substances into or from such sites are required to be promptly reported under CERCLA. 42 U.S.C. Section 9603.  Lewisite and its byproducts would be regulated as a hazardous substance under CERCLA and a hazardous waste under RCRA because of the arsenic content, and I so find and conclude.  40 C.F.R. part 300; 40 C.F.R. part 261.    Clean Air Act Jurisdiction       A number of Dr. Hall's protected activities involved concerns that chemical warfare agent was present uncontrolled in the open environment, such as Lewisite at the Simpson Butte site and Mustard agent at the Carr Red Dirt site, where release to the air was not only possible but unavoidable due to vapor release via volatilization and contaminated dust/particulates releases via  the wind.  The Carr Red Dirt pile, stored in the open environment, was the subject of an inquiry by the Army as to whether or not it continued to contain chemical warfare agent given the passage of time.  (Hall Deposition [RX 116], June 5, 2001 p 6-8)   [Page 22]     Vapor and contaminated dust from the site was free to blow in the wind as the weather would permit and the agent at the site was detectable by smell and by air testing, confirming some release to the air.  ( Id. )  Dr. Hall had detected the odor of mustard agent coming off the Carr Red Dirt in 1988 and the dirt was left on site until at least 1995, presumably releasing agent to the air over that entire seven year period.  ( Id. )  The State, in response to Dr. Hall's reporting, required when the Carr Red Dirt was moved that workers wear proper protective equipment and that monitoring be done.  ( Id.  at p 9)        Dr. Hall had a good faith belief that releases to the air of agent from the Carr Red Dirt posed at least a potential violation of the Clean Air Act, and I so find and conclude.  ( See ,  e.g. , Hall Deposition [RX 116], June 5, 2001 p 37, 39, 64)      Dr. Hall also raised concerns regarding the improper storage of waste chemicals which could have caused a fire and explosion and subsequent release of toxic chemicals to the ambient air.  Once released to the air in such an incident, or from wind at the uncontrolled dump sites, there is nothing to prevent the wind from carrying the contaminants off-site, as occurred during the 1968 so-called Dugway sheep kill incident where chemical agent released to the air on-site traveled off-site and killed several thousand sheep, an event well documented in this closed record.        B. DUGWAY'S KNOWLEDGE OF DR. HALL'S PROTECTED ACTIVITIES       At the outset Respondent posits that Dr. Hall has offered no evidence that Respondent was aware that he had reported alleged environmental violations to any of the four (4) divisions of the Utah Division of Environmental Quality.  I disagree and the Respondent's actual knowledge of Dr. Hall's protected activities through its military personnel and civilian employees will now be discussed.      Dugway management clearly knew of Dr. Hall's protected activities because, as established throughout  this trial record, including at transcript cites given above in the discussion of each protected activity of Dr. Hall, Dr. Hall brought his concerns directly to his management.  He also brought concerns to the State, who then indirectly, sometimes unintentionally, informed his management that Dr. Hall was disclosing his concerns to them.  Sometimes this State disclosure of Dr. Hall's protected reporting to them occurred because of the rather unique issues that Dr. Hall raised internally, and then raised with the State, which then resulted in State follow-up with Dugway.  Even though the State may have attempted to protect his anonymity, the nature of the issue being disclosed sometimes led to managers at Dugway essentially seeing Dr. Hall's hand in the concerns brought to them by the State.  [Page 23]     In the early days of Dr. Hall's protected activity, he was doing this protected activity very openly.  He was attempting to get the problem resolved internally.  He was not attempting to hide his concerns from management. Dugway management was very well aware that Dr. Hall was raising these concerns.  For example, Dr. Hall testified in August of 1991 in an Army investigation of the improperly stored waste chemicals, and there was no doubt in the Army's mind at that time that it was Dr. Hall who had raised these concerns to OSHA, because he told them directly, during their own inquiry.  (CX 60, CX 61)  Dr. Hall informed Dugway managers of his Safe Drinking Water Act and Clean Water Act concerns with Dugway dumping waste chemicals down its drains into an unpermitted sewer system and into unlined lagoons.  (Hall Deposition [RX 116], June 5, 2001 p 68, 76-77)  Dugway managers were informed of Dr. Hall's RCRA concerns throughout his tenure at Dugway, and I so find and conclude.  (Hall Deposition [RX 116], June 5, 2001 p 89-93)      Notwithstanding his discomfort in reporting concerns to management in the later years of his tenure at Dugway, Dr. Hall nonetheless continued making protected reports directly to Dugway management.  For example, in the 1995-1997 time period, Dr. Hall reported his concerns about the Carr Red Dirt containing mustard agent directly to Army officials within and outside his chain-of-command, and reported to State officials in the presence of Army officials.  (Hall Deposition [RX 116], June 5, 2001 p 41-45, 67)  Hall also reported his concerns about the Simpson Butte Lewisite contamination directly to his Dugway managers.  (Hall Deposition [RX 116], June 5, 2001 p 47; TR June 12 [Steelman] p 12)  On the BZ bomblets issue, a portion of Hall's concerns were directly expressed in his draft reports which were submitted to management and on which management made written comments.  (Hall Deposition [RX 116], June 5, 2001 p 55; CX 27, CX 30, CX 32, CX 33)  Dr. Hall reported his concerns about the defects of PINS and about the Lakeside bomb directly to management as well as to the State, and I so find and conclude. (Hall Deposition [RX 116], June 5, 2001 p 97; CX 4, CX 10, CX 34, CX 80, CX 99, CX 108)      In January 1996, Colonel Kiskowski called Dr. Hall into a meeting with Dr. Hall's supervisors.  Among other things, at this time the Colonel informed Dr. Hall via ""counseling"" that Dr. Hall should not be testifying to Congress or to compliance agencies such as the State or EPA, or even to Mr. Skeen's office, the Dugway legal office, about his concerns, at least without going first to his management and giving them the information first.  (TR 5889-5890)  If Colonel Kiskowski had not known of Dr. Hall's prior protected reporting to Congress, the State environmental agency and others, there would have been no need for the Colonel to conduct this ""counseling session.""  I actually view this ""counseling"" as the imposition of a gag order.      In this same January, 1996 meeting, Colonel Kiskowski discussed with Dr. Hall and Hall's supervisors the results of Dugway's internal investigation of Hall's internally reported concerns about the Lakeside Bomb, BZ, and Simpson Butte issues.  (TR 5889-5890)  This meeting evidences management's clear knowledge of these protected activities of Dr. Hall given that management was requested to investigate them by Dr. Hall, did so, and reported back to Dr. Hall (although a gag order was not the response or relief for which Dr. Hall was looking.)  [Page 24]     Dr. Hall happened to overhear one of his managers say on the telephone that Dr. Hall could not be trusted to not report events to the State of Utah, an opinion which showed that Dr. Hall's reporting to the State of Utah was a concern to his managers and, most important, that they knew he was doing it.  (Hall Deposition [RX 116], June 5, 2001 p 110-111)  The Dugway environmental office knew Hall was reporting to the State (TR 2932 [Moran]), and I so find and conclude.        C. ACTIONS TAKEN BY DUGWAY AGAINST DR. HALL      On the basis of the totality of this closed record, I find and conclude that Dr. Hall was subjected to a number of hostile and adverse actions by Dugway.  The more obvious ones included:      *Successful and unsuccessful attempts to lower Dr. Hall's performance ratings and the addition of negative statements to the performance ratings;  (Hall Deposition [RX 116], June 5, 2001 p 118-119, 123-124;)        *Reassignment and detailing of Dr. Hall to the Joint Contact Point, also known as the Joint Operations Directorate or JOD.  (RX 126)  Detailed effective June 10, 1991 from chemist GS-1320-12 Step 5 in Chemical Technology Branch in the Chemical Laboratory Division in the Materiel Test Directorate to the position of Operations Research Analyst GS-1515-12 Step 5 in the Joint Operations Directorate.  The Position Number was 03893.  The Request for Personnel Action on OPM Standard Form 52-8 stated, ""Detail not to exceed one year.""  Dr Hall, on being detailed to JOD, ostensibly to maximize his chance of promotion, however, was not presented with an adequate job description under the then applicable rules of the Office of Personnel Management, and after arrival at JOD Hall's 1 year detail was changed to 120 days.  Dr. Hall, shortly after arriving in JOD, was assigned by Mr. Chinn to learn how to do statistical analyses.  Although consistent with a one year or permanent job in JOD, this assignment was inconsistent with a detail of 120 days in that the learning curve detracted from other tasks on which either Mr. Chinn or Directorate Chief Dr. Christiansen wanted Hall to work at a higher priority.  Upon precipitous termination of the detail to JOD only days after Hall participated in the late August 1991 Army 15-6 investigation by COL Arthur Kelly of White Sands Missile Range, Hall was not restored to his normal job in the Chemical Laboratory, but was assigned to work under Mr. Steelman in Test Management Division, where Hall's chances of success would have been poor;      *Imposition of additional tasks on Dr. Hall and then criticizing him for taking time from his initial assignments to work on the new priorities;      *Removal of Dr. Hall's approval in the CPRP program more than once, and once without notice to Dr. Hall.  The CPRP is a surety program, not a security clearance technically, but similar to it, that is required for personnel working with chemical warfare agent, and necessary for him to do his job;  [Page 25]     *Administrative termination and medical termination/restriction/suspension of Dr. Hall's CPRP approval.  Hall was temporarily disqualified 13 June 96 and Administratively terminated 9 July 96.  As of June 4, 1996, the Clinic doctor signed off on ""no change in PRP status,"" even after Hall had been carried to Clinic by ambulance for the ""dizzy spell."" The Dugway form reflecting these events was not given to Hall at the time or pre-trial notwithstanding his attorneys' requests for his files.  Hall was medically temporarily disqualified with no notice and no opportunity to have input from his own doctors, followed by administrative removal;      *Prohibiting Dr. Hall from working at home notwithstanding his health problems, while allowing others to do so;      *Suspension of his security clearance;      *Requiring Dr. Hall to undergo two mental health exams in 1989 and another mental health exam in 1996;      *Commander's recommendation to revoke permanently Dr. Hall's security clearance; (TR June 11 p 6-7, 71-77; RX 1, RX 2, RX 3, RX 4; RX 127);      *Negative comments on Dr. Hall's performance evaluations.  Even when he managed to persuade his supervisors to maintain an adequate rating on the evaluation, they continued to give him very negative comments on the evaluations;      *Requiring Dr. Hall to undergo a new background investigation and security clearance review in 1995-1996, although the applicable regulation did not require such, and then raising old previously resolved allegations against Dr. Hall in that review;      *Threatened termination of Dr. Hall's employment;      *Imposing impossible standards by a hostile and arrogant technical editor to prevent completion of a technical report so that lateness of the report could be used as a basis to challenge Dr. Hall's performance and threaten Dr. Hall with termination of his employment;      *Biasing the evaluations of mental health professionals by providing negative information regarding Dr. Hall without providing notice to Dr. Hall or an opportunity to rebut same, including negative ratings of work performance inconsistent with and not reflected in Dr. Hall's official performance evaluations;      *Failure to offer Dr. Hall the same accommodations for health problems offered other employees, including Respondent's failure to assist Dr. Hall in filing an FECA claim prior to retirement;  [Page 26]     *LTC Kiskowski arranged for a meeting with Hall shortly after Hall encountered Kiskowski in a hallway in Kuddes building on a Thursday and happily told Kiskowski that he was soon to return to work and could crank out the BZ report and help on many other reports.  (Hall Deposition [RX 116], June 5, 2001 p 105)  Kiskowski's meeting on February 11, 1997 was unpleasant, with Kiskowski expressing anger at Hall.  (Hall Deposition [RX 116], June 5, 2001 p 99)  After the meeting, Mr. Steelman had Hall sign a memo dated February 10, 1997 which criticized Hall's performance and implied that adverse actions would soon follow if Hall could not work full days and turn out the work;      *Creation of a hostile work environment in an effort to force Dr. Hall's resignation. Expressions of anger and hostility toward Dr. Hall and his protected activities and the actions listed above along with use of slander, innuendo and breaches of privacy and confidence to impugn Dr. Hall's reputation created a hostile work environment that became intolerable;      *A Gag order prohibiting reporting to Congress and environmental agencies at least without first going through the chain-of-command.  (TR 5889-5890; TR June 11 p 18-20)  Only Dr. Hall received such an instruction personally in a meeting with from Colonel Kiskowski.  (TR June 11 p 20)      *Dugway forced Complainant to retire via this hostile work environment and the persistent pattern of adverse actions identified above.  (RX 124)  Dr. Hall could see the clear handwriting on the wall.  He tolerated a number of hostile and adverse actions for almost ten (10) years, was told directly to stop engaging in reported activity to Congress and the agencies, was threatened with termination, and had his clearance suspended and recommended to be revoked. His doctors advised him that he should take himself out of that hostile environment or face more serious adverse impacts on his mental and physical health.  In his own judgment it was clear that he should not wait to be terminated for his health and his professional future.  This set of circumstances represents a sufficient factual prerequisite for what is recognized in the law as constructive discharge or, in this case, as a result of Dr. Hall's wise but reluctant decision to mitigate damages, a forced retirement.  There was a continuing pattern of repeated protected activities by Complainant and repeated adverse actions in response by the Respondent.  The pattern reached a level of a constructive discharge or forced retirement only in the 1996-1997 time frame because of the cumulative effect on Complainant's mental and physical health.  Dr. Hall had tolerated this hostility for years, had worked with the State, made some adjustments in his style to become less aboveboard to try to minimize the stress and retaliation but it just came to the point in 1996 and 1997 that it was no longer tolerable, and I so find and conclude.        D. DUGWAY'S MOTIVE AND INTENT IN TAKING ACTIONS AGAINST DR. HALL       On the basis of the totality of this closed record, I find and conclude that the evidence of Dugway's retaliatory motive in Dr. Hall's case is abundant and blatant.  As one example, General Aiken called Complainant a traitor in 1990 for reporting environmental and safety violations to the Inspector General and DOD.  (TR p 5889-5890 [Hall]) Colonel Kiskowski was present back in those days and overheard General Aiken's remark and later told Dr. Hall in a January, 1996 meeting that Hall's reputation had preceded him and made reference to having heard General Aiken's remark.  ( Id. )  On this issue I credit Dr. Hall's credible testimony as to who said what and when.   [Page 27]     A Dugway manager, Dr. Condie, in a phone conversation overheard by Dr. Hall, referred to Dr. Hall as one who cannot be trusted to not report his concerns or complaints to the State.  (Hall Deposition [RX 116], June 5, 2001 p 110-111)  The same manager reported that Dr. Resnick, Condie's supervisor, instructed him to ""Turkey farm"" Dr. Hall.  (TR p 9707 [Condie])  Another manager, Mr. Steelman, testified that Resnick had expressed complaints and hostility towards Dr. Hall to other supervisors and had instructed Condie to ""Turkey farm"" Dr. Hall to get him out of the way.  (TR June 12 p 42 [Steelman])      Another blatant example of direct evidence of Dugway's retaliatory motive is the discussion Dr. Hall had with his supervisor on being immediately transferred out of the Chem lab in 1991 after disclosing to OSHA and the State improper storage of waste chemicals at Dugway.  Dugway managers were upset with Dr. Hall because he reported violations concerning improper storage of waste chemicals prompting Col. Ertwine to transfer Dr. Hall out of the chem lab, while candidly explaining to Dr. Hall that the transfer had to be made to appear as if it were not in retaliation for Dr. Hall having reported the violations to OSHA.  (CX 63)  At that early stage in Dr. Hall's protected activities, Dugway was already conscious of and wary about its potential liability for retaliation against an employee who raised environmental and safety concerns, and I so find and conclude.      One indication of Dugway's retaliatory motive regarding Dr. Hall's whistleblowing can be gleaned from the fact that during the same time frame that Dr. Hall was raising concerns about the presence of mustard agent in the Carr Red Dirt, Ms. Carol Nudell, on behalf of the Army, was attempting to get removed from the public the report that had been created on the Carr Red Dirt issue, a report which showed mustard agent contamination.  (Hall Deposition [RX 116], June 5, 2001 p 74-75)      Later in Dr. Hall's career at Dugway, in April 1997, close in time to his protected activities on the BZ, PINS and Simpson Butte issues, Dugway managers, after ordering Dr. Hall to submit to a fitness for duty exam, were informed by Dr. Hall that he was being treated differently than other employees because there was another chemist who had missed much work because of health problems and was not required to submit to such an exam.  Dugway managers were not discouraged by this observation and promptly ordered the other chemist to submit to a fitness for duty exam, explaining to the other chemist, Dr. Peter Harvey, that they were requiring him to submit to the exam so as to avoid the appearance of disparate treatment of another employee (whom Dr. Harvey knew to be Dr. Hall).  (CX 45, CX 46; TR June 13 p 27-30 [Harvey])  Fortunately, Dr. Harvey maintained notes and records of the conversations at the time.  (CX 45, CX 46)  This request for a fitness for duty exam imposed first on Dr. Hall was one of the precipitating factors in Dr. Hall finding continued employment at Dugway so intolerable that he felt compelled to retire early, and he gave notice thereof the following month.  Clearly the initial notice to Dr. Hall was disparate treatment and the later Dugway attempt to cover up this fact caused a dedicated employee, apparently disabled from his work at Dugway, to be fired and suffer economic loss and psychological distress as well, although Dr. Harvey was assisted in his departure by Dugway to minimize the consequences to him, while Hall was not given such assistance, and I so find and conclude.  (TR June 13 p 30-35 [Harvey])  [Page 28]     Perhaps equally disturbing, and during this same critical time frame just prior to Dr. Hall's decision to retire, is the decision by Dugway Commander Colonel Como to recommend revocation of Dr. Hall's security clearance after reviewing a packet of information submitted to him by Mr. Bowcutt for the purpose of informing Colonel Como's decision on Dr. Hall's clearance which packet included, of all things, prominently placed and referenced, Dr. Hall's February, 1997 DOL whistleblower complaint.  (TR June 11 p 71-77 [Como]; RX 1, RX 2, RX 3, RX 4)  The cover note for the packet directed the Commander's attention to the fact that such a whistleblower complaint had been filed.  ( Id. ; RX 4)  Colonel Como at trial clearly identified the packet which included Dr. Hall's DOL complaint as the information he read completely and considered in making his decision to recommend revocation of Dr. Hall's security clearance.  (TR June 11 p 71-77)  This is perhaps one of the most blatant admissions of an employer in a whistleblower case to date, acknowledging, as it does, that one of the key adverse actions contributing to Dr. Hall's forced early retirement was made by Dugway at least in part because Dr. Hall had filed an environmental whistleblower complaint with the DOL pursuant to the federal environmental statute employee protection provisions (which, of course, is itself protected activity).      Colonel Como admitted that he knew Dr. Hall had the right and an opportunity to respond before a final decision was made on his security clearance but Colonel Como recommended revocation of Dr. Hall's clearance without waiting to review Dr. Hall's response.  (TR June 11 p 77)      While these circumstances, and the referenced testimony and documents are clear enough, if there was any remaining doubt that Dugway would retaliate against an employee for reporting an environmental violation, one need look no further than Dugway's actions towards Ms. Judy Moran, as reflected in Dugway's own records.  Ms. Moran was an environmental compliance officer at Dugway and Dugway records reflect unambiguously that twice Dugway took disciplinary action against Ms. Moran explicitly because she also reported potential environmental violations and dangers to the State.  (CX 131; TR 3354-3357; TR 2941-2945; TR 3095)  Further, Ms. Moran credibly testified that based on her experience as a Dugway environmental compliance officer, if Dugway thought they would not be caught, they would conceal and not report environmental violations to the State.  (TR 2935-2936)      As already noted above, during the January 1996 meeting with Colonel Kiskowski and Dr. Hall's supervisors, the Colonel informed Dr. Hall via ""counseling"" that Dr. Hall should not be testifying to Congress or to compliance agencies such as the State or EPA, or even to Mr. Skeen's office, the Dugway legal office, about his concerns, at least without first going to his management and giving them the information.  (TR 5889-5890; TR June 11 p 18-20)  Dr. Hall took this communication for what it was,  i.e. , the imposition of a gag order in a hostile work environment.  If Colonel Kiskowski had not known of Dr. Hall's prior protected reporting to Congress, the State environmental agency and others or was not concerned about them, there would have been no need for the Colonel to conduct this ""counseling session,"" and I so find and conclude.   [Page 29]     The general attitude of Dugway towards employees who report concerns outside the chain-of-command was made clear by General Aiken in a public statement.  General Aiken stated in the Dugway newsletter that he had a deep concern with employees who reported concerns to the Inspector General's Office outside their chain-of-command.  (CX 59) 3     There was a clearly stated Dugway policy from the top down that required reporting of environment violations and concerns through the ""chain-of-command"" first, and treated employees who reported environmental concerns outside the chain-of-command to the State, EPA, OSHA, Congress, the IG, or even the Dugway JAG or Environmental Office as disloyal, disobedient and subject to disciplinary action.  (TR 2954 [Moran]; TR June 11 p 18-20 [Stansbury]).      There were a number of instances of the use by Dugway of irregular procedures regarding Dr. Hall.  One was Dugway's failure to notify Dr. Hall that his CPRP approval has been terminated.  Dr. Hall not only was removed from the CPRP Program, the program in which one has to be involved to access areas where chemical warfare agent is present, which access, of course, was necessary for him to do his job, but he was removed from the program without his knowledge.  ( Id. )       Another major example of irregular procedure and disparate treatment involved Dugway requiring Dr. Hall to submit to a new background investigation on the excuse that newly changed regulations required it when in fact the regulation in question exempted Dr. Hall as an employee who had a valid background investigation within five years of having been placed in a chemical duty position and who had no break in federal service.  (RX 19)  Dugway's own Surety officers called by Dugway to testify confirmed Complainant's reading of the regulation to exempt employees in Dr. Hall's situation.        Dr. Hall was never informed, and found out for the first time during trial, that his CPRP had been suspended, restricted or terminated for medical reasons.      One of the most offensive actions by Dugway also strongly evinces retaliatory motive.  Dugway, after falsely accusing Dr. Hall of sexual harassment during his first few years of employment and protected activity, and even after Dr. Hall was cleared of any wrong-doing and assured in writing by the then Commander Colonel Cox that his record was clear (CX 14), raised the old allegations from earlier years later in 1996 in an attempt to influence adversely the outcome of the third mental exam and adversely affect the outcome of Dr. Hall's CPRP and security clearance review.  Dugway continued to pursue unreasonably such unfounded allegations throughout the trial, notwithstanding that no complaining witness could be produced (because there was no sexual harassment to complain of), and notwithstanding a caution from this Administrative Law Judge that the alleged sweater incident was not viewed as an unwarranted touching by the individual.  This entire episode will be further discussed below.  [Page 30]     Another irregular procedure example is Dugway's failure to erase from Dr. Hall's records the temporary disqualification of Dr. Hall from CPRP after Dr. Hall was reinstated, a failure contrary to Army regulations and policy that require such erasure.       Another prime example of irregular procedure in Dugway's treatment of Dr. Hall was the hastily called meeting by Colonel Kiskowski with Dr. Hall in February, 1997 in which Kiskowski became angry with Hall and threatened termination of Hall's employment.  There was a complaint made by the union after that meeting that this was improper procedure by management to have on such short notice a meeting with an employee to discipline the employee.  Commanding Colonel Como later wrote a memo directing Dugway managers to cease such conduct and to honor the agreement with the Union to give adequate notice of such meetings.  (TR June 11 p 63; CX 11)      Another irregular procedure is evidenced in the attempts by managers at Dugway Proving Ground to provide biased information and to withhold information from the medical doctor doing the third mental examination, Dr. McCann, related to the surety (CPRP)/security clearance review by Dugway of Dr. Hall in order to achieve a predetermined result:  a removal of Dr. Hall's security clearance.  Dr. Hall was not told what information had and had not been provided to Dr. McCann and was given no opportunity to rebut it.  Interestingly, when questioned closely regarding the nature of the communications and information provided to Dr. McCann by Dugway, Dr. McCann's records came up missing, preventing Complainant even to this day from learning what actually transpired, and I so find and conclude.        In addition, there was disparate treatment in the manner in which the security clearance review was applied, to Complainant's disadvantage.  Dr. Hall was told filing his Form 398-2 paperwork was urgent, and he had to fill this information out within a few days.  He did so, and then he came to learn later that his colleagues, whom he was told would have to undergo the same procedure, had not been required to fill out those forms and submit to that review in some cases for at least two years afterwards.  Thus, the sense of urgency applied only to Dr. Hall, and I so find and conclude.       Notwithstanding having been cleared after two prior mental exams, Dr. Hall was threatened with, and forced to undergo, a third mental exam later in his career as part of his security clearance investigation, notwithstanding the fact that his prior mental exams had been passed successfully, and that no concern about those mental exams had been raised in the intervening years for security clearance purposes.  It was only during the last years of his more intense whistle blowing and the Army's more intense retaliation, 1995, 1996 and 1997, that the Army chose to raise from the grave the issue of the mental exams and old long resolved allegations and reinsert them into the new security clearance review, although Colonel Cox, in 1991, had assured Dr. Hall that he had a clean slate at Dugway.  (CX 14)      There was disparate treatment of Dr. Hall in regard to being required to submit to mental examinations when employees who had engaged in similar or more serious conduct were not required to submit to such exams.  [Page 31]     Irregular procedures and changing reasons for Dugway's actions against Dr. Hall, which evidence retaliatory motive, are reflected in Dugway's conduct in first rating Dr. Hall as fully successful or higher on all of his performance appraisals but then giving contradictory performance information to the mental health professionals examining Dr. Hall, and later at trial attempting to provide an entirely different performance rating for Dr. Hall using a 1-10 comparative or personal potential based system never adopted at Dugway.       Dugway received the notification of the DOL/OSHA investigation on February 24, 1997.  The hostile adverse actions continued and intensified at that point in  time, including the Commander's decision to recommend revocation of Hall's security clearance which occurred about 3 weeks later.  (TR June 11 p 71-72)  Shortly after Dugway received notice of Hall's DOL complaint, Dr. Brimhall handed Hall his review of the BZ report first draft and expressed concern for something unpleasant awaiting Hall at the Editor's office.       The reasons given for his lowered performance evaluations were pretext, they were false and specious, and I so find and conclude.  In some cases, Dr. Hall, protesting those lowered evaluations, actually was able to have other managers intervene and have those performance evaluations increased above what the initial management rating was.       Dugway's assertions of poor performance by Dr. Hall due to late reports were pretext because other employees had late reports without receiving threats of termination and in Dr. Hall's case, the lateness was due to the health impacts of Dugway's retaliation on Dr. Hall and orchestrated imposition of performance standards for the BZ report through managers and the technical editor that were impossible to meet, all of which are part of the conspiracy against Dr. Hall by the ""team players"" at Dugway.    III. ARGUMENT AND DISCUSSION       An important issue in these cases is the credibility of the Complainant and that of his witnesses.  Respondent's essential thesis on this issue is that Dr. Hall simply is not credible, that he has changed his version of events over the years, that his witnesses had motives to give biased testimony against the Respondent.  As specific examples, Respondent submits that several times Dr. Hall has changed his story; Michael LeFevre, the union official, was biased against Colonel Kiskowski; Tom See is Mr. LeFevre's father-in-law; Dr. Peter Harvey is a friend and colleague of Dr. Hall; Judy Moran is also biased against Respondent because she had also received a letter of reprimand from her supervisor; Gary Bodily offered little evidence of value; Charlie Warr also offered little evidence of value, other than describing Dr. Hall as ""flakie""; Mr. Biltoft, as another union official, was also antagonistic toward the Respondent; and Marty Gray, a Utah state employee, was surprised at the amount of personal information Dr. Hall put into his e-mails to him and other Utah employees.      Other examples cited by the Respondent with reference to Dr. Hall are as follows:      Complainant has lied, exaggerated, played word games and changed his story to prevail in this action.  Complainant is an employee who overreacted to the risks posed by test activities at Dugway.  Complainant is misguided just like ""Chicken Little"" - he misunderstood the facts due to paranoid tendencies or just plain lied.  [Page 32]     As the hearing proceeded, according to Respondent, it became clear that Complainant had a problem with telling the truth, exaggerating and distorting events, experienced memory loss and lied about the facts, according to Respondent, who has also accused Complainant's counsel of changing his arguments several times during the course of the hearing.  Respondent also posits that Dr Hall has exaggerated the importance of the Simpson Butte Demilitarization Site - as can be seen in his memo (CX 77), Respondent describing Complainant's selective memory as his main problem.      Respondent also suggests that some employees understandably tried to avoid Complainant due to his personality and behavior, but such avoidance or shunning was not due to his whistleblowing.      I disagree very strongly.      This Administrative Law Judge, allowing for the usual hyperbole found in an attorney's brief, simply cannot believe that counsel truly believes those statements.  This is akin to saying, ""everyone else is correct, only the whistleblower is wrong.""      Respondent also submits that Complainant is arrogant and abrasive and cannot get along with his co-workers - -      I disagree as he is very intelligent, dedicated and conscientious individual.  However, such arrogance can be attributed to Ms. Christina Wheeler, Dugway's Technical Editor, and her arrogance was manifested in her testimony before me, as even a cursory reading of her testimony will reflect that aspect of her personality - - it's quite obvious that she took pleasure in criticizing and humiliating and deprecating the work of Ph.D. chemists.  That Ms. Wheeler may have treated others in that fashion is no defense herein, as it is apparent that she also was out to get Dr. Hall.      Complainant's co-workers went out of their way to make his life at Dugway as miserable as possible simply because he was not a ""team player.""  While the term ""team player"" has a positive connotation in sports, it is a pejorative team in referring to one who has engaged in protected activities, and I so find and conclude.      While Respondent's counsel refers to Complainant as being a perjurer, I strongly disagree.  I observed Complainant's demeanor during fifty-seven (57) days of trial and I have credited his testimony, and any confusion as to dates or events can simply be attributed to the passage of time.  Fortunately, Dr. Hall kept good notes as to who said what and when, and even tape recorded certain conversations that put those conversations into proper perspective.  Here I refer specifically to the tape of Dr. Hall's evening telephone talk with Ms. Deanna Dalton Carlson, a friend to this date, notwithstanding the actions and pressures of certain at Dugway to drag her into that conspiracy against Dr. Hall.  Ms. Carlson is the other individual in the so-called sweater incident.  [Page 33]        A. BURDEN OF PROOF       The burden of proof in whistleblower cases has been well described in prior decisions of the OALJ and ARB.  As I wrote in one of my more recent decisions:        In order to establish a  prima facie  case of unlawful  discrimination, a complainant must show that he engaged in protected activity, that he was subjected to adverse action, and  that the respondent was aware of the protected activity when it took the adverse action. A complainant also must present evidence sufficient to raise the inference that the protected activity was the likely reason for the adverse action.   Dartey v. Zack Co. , Case No. 80-ERA-2, Sec. Dec., Apr. 25, 1983.  Viewing all of the evidence as a whole, the Complainant has  shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, that she was discriminated against for engaging in protected activity.   See   Boudrie v. Commonwealth Edison Co. , 1995-ERA-15 (ARB Apr. 22, 1997);  Boytin v. Pennsylvania Power & Light Co. , 1994-ERA-32 (Sec'y Oct. 20, 1995);  Marien v. Northeast Nuclear Energy Co. , 1993-ERA-49/50 (Sec'y Sept. 18, 1995).  To carry that burden Complainant must  prove that Respondent's stated reasons for reprimanding Complainant are pretext,  i.e. , that they are  not the true reasons for the adverse action and that the protected activity was.   Leveille v. New York Air Nat'l Guard , 1994-TSC-3/4 (Sec'y Dec. 1, 1995);  Hoffman v. Bossert , 1994-CAA-4 (Sec'y  19, 1995).    Migliore v. Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management , 1998-SWD-3, 1999-SWD-1, 1999-SWD-2 (ALJ RDO August 13, 1999).      As I also wrote in another decision:    In order for [Complainant] Anderson to prevail, she must establish the following:    ...   B. That she was engaged in a protected activity.     C. That she was discriminated against or received disparate treatment by Metro.     D. That Metro knew of the protected activity when it took the adverse action.     E. The protected activity was the reason for the adverse action.      See   Trimmer v. U.S. Dept. of Labor , 174 F.3d 1098, 1101 (10th Cir. 1999);  Carrol v. U.S. Dept. of Labor , 78 F.3d 352, 356 (8th Cir. 1996);  Simon v. Simmons Foods, Inc. , 49 F.3d 386, 388 (8th Cir. 1995).   [Page 34]         The traditional preponderance of evidence standard is to be used in complaints under environmental whistleblower statutes.  See Martin v. Dept. of the Army , ARB No. 96-131 at 6 (July 30, 1999) and  Ewald v. Commonwealth of Virginia , Case No. 89-SDW-1 at 11 (April 20, 1995).         Once a complainant has proved all the elements of the  prima facie  case by a preponderance, the respondent may rebut the  prima facie  case by presenting evidence that it had a legitimate non-discriminatory motive for the action taken.   See   Carroll v. Bechtel Power Corp. , 91-ERA-46 (Sec'y February 15, 1995)(setting out the general legal framework)  ""In any event, the complainant bears the ultimate burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he was retaliated against in violation of the law. ( Id .) and  Agbe v. Texas Southern University , ARB No. 98-072 (July 27, 1999)(respondent does not carry the burden of proving a negative proposition, that it was not motivated by complainant's protected activities when it took the adverse action. Throughout, complainant has the burden of proving that the employer was motivated, at least in part, by complainant's protected activities).  Once the respondent produces evidence that the complainant was subjected to the adverse action for legitimate non-discriminatory reasons, the rebuttable presumption created by complainant's  prima facie  showing drops from the case.   Carroll  at 6.         There is one variant to this format.  Where an employee establishes by a preponderance that illegitimate reasons played a part in the employer's adverse action, the employer has the burden of proving by a preponderance that it would have taken the adverse action against the person for the legitimate reason alone. ( Id. )  This is known as a dual motive case.  If there is rebuttal, the complainant, to prevail, must demonstrate that the proffered reason for the adverse action is not the real reason by showing that discriminatory reasons more likely motivated the action or that the proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.   Texas Dept. of Comm. Affairs v. Burdine , 450 U.S. 248, 256 (1981); If the trier of fact decides there are dual motives, the respondent cannot prevail unless it shows it would have reached the same decision in the absence of protected conduct.  Young v. CBI Services, Inc.,  88-ERA-8 (Sec'y Dec. 8, 1992), slip op. at 6.     Anderson v. Metro Wastewater Reclamation District , ARB No.: 98-087, Case No.: 1997-SDW-7 (ALJ RDO Sept. 18, 2001).        B. DR. HALL IS AN EMPLOYEE COVERED UNDER, AND DUGWAY IS AN EMPLOYER COVERED UNDER, THE FEDERAL ENVIRONMENTAL STATUTES' EMPLOYEE PROTECTION PROVISIONS, THAT IS, THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR  HAS JURISDICTION OVER THE COMPLAINTS FILED BY DR. HALL, AND DR. HALL ENGAGED IN PROTECTED ACTIVITIES UNDER THESE STATUTES          1.Sovereign Immunity Has Been Waived under All but One of the Applicable Federal Statutes       Respondent appears to concede that the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and the act which it amended, the Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA), apply here and that the Army is not immune from actions under those acts, including under the employee protection provisions.  The case law and the Federal Facilities Compliance Act at 42 U.S.C. 6961 make this clear.  The case law, including decisions by the ARB, one of which is quoted below, also makes clear that several other federal environmental statutes at issue here also contain an explicit waiver of sovereign immunity (all but TSCA).  [Page 35]   Jurisdiction Over a Federal Government Entity       On the basis of our review of pertinent law, I find and conclude that this forum does have jurisdiction over a federal government entity and that Respondent is covered by and subject to all but one of the statutes before me.  As I wrote in one of my decisions:    As an entity of the United States government, the Academy cannot be held liable unless the United States has waived its sovereign immunity under the statutory provisions at issue. Any waiver of the government's sovereign immunity must be ""unequivocal.""  United States Dep't of Energy v. State of Ohio , 503 U.S. 607, 615 (1992). We examine whether the United States has waived its sovereign immunity concerning the five whistleblower provisions under which Berkman brought his complaints. This examination is important because the remedies available under the different environmental statutes are not uniform.   Berkman v. USCGA , ARB Nos. 97-CAA-2, 97-CAA-9 (January 2, 1998)(a matter over which this Administrative Law Judge presided).               (a)Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act       The United States unequivocally has waived its sovereign immunity under the CERCLA's whistleblower provision.   Marcus v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , Case No. 92-TSC-5, Sec. Dec. and Ord., Feb. 7, 1994, slip op. at 2-3;  accord Pogue v. U.S. Dep't of Navy Mare Island Shipyard , Case No. 87-ERA-21, Sec. Dec., May 10, 1990, slip op. at 4-12,  rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Pogue v. Dep't of Labor , 940 F.2d 1287 (9th Cir. 1990).              (b) Clean Water Act  (CWA)          The whistleblower provision of the WPCA can apply to the Federal government if the respondent Federal entity falls within the ""federal facilities"" provision of that Act, which provides:   [Page 36]     Each department, agency, or instrumentality of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the Federal Government (1) having jurisdiction over any property or facility, or (2) engaged in any activity resulting, or which may result, in the discharge or runoff of pollutants, and each officer, agent, or employee thereof in the performance of his official duties, shall be subject to, and comply with, all Federal, State, interstate, and local requirements, administrative authority, and process and sanctions respecting control and abatement of water pollution in the same manner, and to the same extent as any nongovernmental entity including the payment of reasonable service charges.       33 U.S.C. §1323 (1994). Thus, the United States unequivocally has waived sovereign immunity under the WPCA.              (c) Clean Air Act (CAA)       The CAA has a similar Federal facilities provision at 42 U.S.C. §7418(a) (1994). The legislative history clearly indicates that the CAA whistleblower provision applies to facilities of the United States: ""This section is applicable, of course, to Federal . . . employees to the same extent as any employee of a private employer."" H.R. Rep. No. 294, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 326,  reprinted in  1977 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 1405.   See Jenkins v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , Case No. 92-CAA-6, Sec. Dec. and Ord., May 18, 1994, slip op. at 5.              (d) Solid Waste Disposal Act       With reference to the SWDA, its Federal facilities provision applies to any Federal agency ""having jurisdiction over any solid waste management facility or disposal site, or (2) engaged in any activity resulting, or which may result, in the disposal or management of solid waste or hazardous waste."" 42 U.S.C. §6961 (1994).  The Secretary has found that the SWDA whistleblower provision applies to all entities of the United States government by means of the Federal facilities provision.   Jenkins , slip op. at 7.              (e) Toxic Substances Control Act        In contrast, the United States has not waived its sovereign immunity under the TSCA's employee protection provision, except for certain whistleblower complaints involving lead- based paint.

January 2, 1998)(a matter over which this Administrative Law Judge presided).             (f)Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) a/k/a Solid Waste Disposal Act       Dugway argues that Dr. Hall's discrimination case should be dismissed in its entirety due to lack of jurisdiction under RCRA.  I disagree as the record is replete with evidence of Dr. Hall's protected activities under RCRA.  Dugway does not deny that it had a RCRA hazardous waste permit.  (TR June 12 p 21)  Dugway managers, in addition to Dr. Hall, testified that RCRA issues were involved with the weapons, waste and contaminated sites that were the subject of Dr. Hall's protected activities, as did Ms. Moran.  For example, the lab chemicals improperly disposed of down the lab drains until Dr. Hall and the State stopped the practice were RCRA wastes.  (Hall Deposition [RX 116] June 5, 2001 p 21-22; TR June 11 p 142-43; TR June 12 p 30, 120, 121)  The agents themselves and agent contaminated wastes involved in the Carr Red Dirt, Simpson Butte and the mustard/Lewisite training sites are RCRA wastes.  (TR p 2933)  The munitions to be assessed via the PINS device are RCRA wastes as evidenced by the State's treatment of the Lakeside bomb being transported without a hazardous waste manifest.  It also does not take a psychic or regulatory expert to understand that cyanide compounds such as Dr. Hall determined was in the M-79 mystery bomb, much to the surprise of Dugway, are hazardous wastes regulated under RCRA either specifically under regulations or under the statutory definition or the imminent hazard provision.      The Lewisite (because of its arsenic content) and the mustard agent contaminants found at the Simpson Butte site, the Carr Red Dirt Site, and the mustard/Lewisite mine testing site are RCRA regulated wastes, and would also be subject to enforcement under RCRA's imminent and substantial endangerment provisions.  (TR 2960 [Moran regarding Carr Red Dirt being RCRA issue]; 40 C.F.R. part 261; 42 U.S.C. §§ 6972(a)(1)(B), 6973)      The BZ bomblets were also RCRA regulated hazardous wastes at a minimum because of the reactive-explosive-ignitable components of the bomblets, as distinguished from the BZ agent itself which Dugway and apparently the State treated as not being a RCRA hazardous waste.  (TR 2826 [Dugway counsel admission that most chemical agents are regulated as hazardous waste in Utah except BZ]; TR p 2953-2954 [Moran, same])      The PINS device was being relied on by Dugway to identify whether or not certain munitions contained chemical warfare agent waste, and chemical warfare agent waste is RCRA regulated waste (P999 and F999 RCRA waste codes in Utah).  (TR 2826 [Dugway counsel admission that most chemical agents are regulated as hazardous waste in Utah except BZ]; TR p 2953-2954 [Moran, same])      Dugway has an inaccurately narrow view of the reach of RCRA.  For example, the imminent and substantial endangerment citizen and EPA enforcement provisions in RCRA are broad indeed.   See , 42 U.S.C. §§ 6972(a)(1)(B) and 6973.  The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), via the citizen suit provision and a companion provision for EPA enforcement, prohibits the handling of solid or hazardous waste in a manner that contributes to the creation of an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public or the environment (an imminent hazard).  ( Id. )  [Page 38]     The standard for determining and ""imminent and substantial endangerment"" pursuant to RCRA is clearly and plainly stated in the language of the statute.  RCRA provides the following standard in its citizen suit provision:    Except as provided in subsection (b) or (c) of this section, any person may commence a civil action on his own behalf --    (1) . . .   (B) against any person, including the United States and any other governmental instrumentality or agency, to the extent permitted by the eleventh amendment to the Constitution, and including any past or present generator, past or present transporter, or past or present owner or operator of a treatment, storage, or disposal facility, who has contributed or who is contribution to the past or present handling, storage, treatment, transportation, or disposal of any solid or hazardous waste which  may  present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment.     42 U.S.C. §6972(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added)      RCRA's imminent hazard provisions do not put an unreasonable burden of proof on EPA or citizens to prove harm with certainty.  Only threatened harm is required, not actual harm, in order to support a claim of imminent endangerment under RCRA, either 42 U.S.C. §6972(a)(1)(B) (citizen plaintiff) or 42 U.S.C. §6973 (government plaintiff).

Waste Industries , 734 F.2d at 166; H.R.

Waste Industries , 734 F.2d at 165.  A finding of ""Imminency"" does not require a showing that actual harm will occur immediately so long as the risk of threatened harm is present:  An ""imminent hazard"" may be declared at any point in a chain of events which may ultimately result in harm to the public.

Town of Harrison , 1993 WL 30476, *6(S.D.N.Y. 1993).      By enacting the endangerment provisions of RCRA and [Safe Drinking Water Act], Congress sought to invoke the broad and flexible equity powers of the federal courts in instances where hazardous wastes threatened human health.  S.Rep.No. 96-172, 96th Cong. 1st Sess, at 5, reprinted in, (1980) U.S. Code Gong. & Ad. News 5019, 5023.  These provisions have enhanced the courts' traditional equitable powers by authorizing the issuance of injunctions when there is but a risk of harm, a more lenient standard than the traditional requirement of threatened reparable harm.  H.R.Rep.No. 96-191, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., at 45 (1979); H.R.Re.No. 93-1185 93rd Cong., 2nd Sess., reprinted in (1974) U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News 6454, 6488.   United States v. Price , 688 F.2d 204, 211 (3d Cir. 1982).      The unequivocal statutory language and the legislative history make it clear that congress intended to confer upon the courts the authority to grant affirmative equitable relief to the extent necessary to eliminate any risks posed by toxic wastes.   Price , 688 F.2d at 213-214.  Congress, in the endangerment provisions of RCRA sought to invoke nothing less than the full equity powers of the federal courts in the effort to protect public health, the environment, and public water supplies from the pernicious effects of toxic wastes.   Price , 688 F.2d at 214.      Congress in amending RCRA in 1984 recognized and affirmed the  Price  court's interpretation of the broad equitable powers provided by the Act.  H.R.Rep. No. 98-198, 98th Cong., 2d Sess., at 48 (1984), reprinted in, 1984 U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News 5576, 5607.  In light of this broad RCRA authority to address not only releases of hazardous waste but the potential release of hazardous or solid waste that ay pose a risk of harm, and given that an employee does not have to be substantively correct regarding the perceived violation to be protected, there can be little doubt that Dr. Hall's internal and external reports regarding uncontrolled waste sites containing chemical warfare agents and/or their byproducts, concerning inadequate tests for declaring agent contaminated items clean and agent free before they are discarded or reused, concerning failure to properly identify the chemical contents of old recovered munitions which may due to that error be treated or handled in a dangerous manner ( e.g.  with incompatible chemicals), to name a few, fall under the jurisdiction of the DOL via the employee protection provision of RCRA, and I so find and conclude.  [Page 40]         2. No Military Exemption   Applies       Dugway relies on the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C.. Section 554, and on the Supreme Court decision in  Department of Navy v. Egan , 484 U.S. 518 (1988) in asserting its position that military affairs matters, including security clearance decisions, are exempt from review by DOL and the courts under the federal environmental statutes.  However, the Supreme Court's decision in  Egan  relates only to limits of judicial review on the merits or substance of security clearance decisions in a specific context, and does not establish a broad military affairs exemption.   Egan  concerned the authority of the MSPB to determine the  substantive correctness of a security clearance decision in the context of merit system law that is more narrow than the environmental statutes in question in the instant case .  Unlike in  Egan , under the environmental statutes there is a broad grant of authority for the DOL and the courts to review any form of discrimination, not just a finite list of narrowly defined adverse actions.   Egan  does not stand for the proposition that the DOL in an environmental whistleblower case cannot determine whether a decision regarding a security clearance was made with an illegal discriminatory motive as indicated by, for example, direct evidence of retaliatory motive such as the agency basing the security clearance decision in whole or part on an employee having filed a whistleblower complaint with the DOL or by indirect circumstantial evidence such as use of irregular procedure and disparate treatment.  The application of  Egan  depends on,  inter alia , what type of action is to be challenged, and what type of relief is sought.      Notwithstanding  Egan , an act of suspending a security clearance and a notice to remove that clearance can still be  prima facie  evidence of retaliatory motive and a challengeable adverse action under the environmental statutes.  Even if the remedy is not available of undoing a security clearance decision on its substantive merits,  per se , the circumstances surrounding the decision can nonetheless be taken as evidence of retaliatory motive and an adverse action under the environmental statutes via, for example, use of irregular procedure or disparate treatment.       Whether the DOL and courts in environmental discrimination cases can dictate a change in the substance of a security clearance decision, if illegal discriminatory intent is shown to have infected the decision process, appears to not have been specifically decided and settled by the courts.  But there is long standing Supreme Court precedent establishing the strong presumption that judicial review of agency action will be available and establishing the availability of judicial review of an illegal decision process even where the law would otherwise clearly prohibit review of the substance or merits of the decision.   See, e.g. ,  Bowen v. Michigan Academy Family Physicians , 476 U.S. 667 (1986).      As the U.S. Supreme Court held:    We begin with the strong presumption that Congress intends judicial review of administrative action. From the beginning ""our cases [have established] that judicial review of a final agency action by an aggrieved person will not be cut off unless there is persuasive reason to believe that such was the purpose of Congress.""   Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner , 387 U.S. 136, 140 (1967) (citing cases).   See generally  L. Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action 339-353 (1965).  In  Marbury v. Madison , 1 Cranch 137, 163 (1803), a case itself involving review of executive action, Chief Justice Marshall insisted that ""[the] very essence of civil liberty certainly consists in the right of every individual to claim the protection of the laws.""  Later, in the lesser known but nonetheless important case of  United States v. Nourse , 9 Pet. 8, 28-29 (1835), the Chief Justice noted the traditional observance of this right and laid the foundation for the modern presumption of judicial review:  [Page 41]    ""It would excite some surprise if, in a government of laws and of principle, furnished with a department whose appropriate duty it is to decide questions of right, not only between individuals, but between the government and individuals; a ministerial officer might, at his discretion, issue this powerful process . . . leaving to the debtor no remedy, no appeal to the laws of his country, if he should believe the claim to be unjust.  But this anomaly does not exist; this imputation cannot be cast on the legislature of the United States.""    Committees of both Houses of Congress have endorsed this view.  In undertaking the comprehensive rethinking of the place of administrative agencies in a regime of separate and divided powers that culminated in the passage of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C. §§ 551-559, 701-706, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary remarked:   ""Very rarely do statutes withhold judicial review. It has never been the policy of Congress to prevent the administration of its own statutes from being judicially confined to the scope of authority granted or to the objectives specified.  Its policy could not be otherwise, for in such a case statutes would in effect be blank checks drawn to the credit of some administrative officer or board.""  S. Rep. No. 752, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 26 (1945).     Accord , H. R. Rep. No. 1980, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 41 (1946).  The Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives agreed that Congress ordinarily intends that there be judicial review, and emphasized the clarity with which a contrary intent must be expressed:    ""The statutes of Congress are not merely advisory when they relate to administrative agencies, any more than in other cases.  To preclude judicial review under this bill a statute, if not specific in withholding such review, must upon its face give clear and convincing evidence of an intent to withhold it.  The mere failure to provide specially by statute for judicial review is certainly no evidence of intent to withhold review.""  Ibid.     Taking up the language in the House Committee Report, Justice Harlan reaffirmed the Court's holding in  Rusk v. Cort , 369 U.S. 367, 379-380 (1962), that ""only upon a showing of 'clear and convincing evidence' of a contrary legislative intent should the courts restrict access to judicial review.""   Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner , 387 U.S., at 141 (citations omitted).  This standard has been invoked time and again when considering whether the Secretary has discharged ""the heavy burden of overcoming the strong presumption that Congress did not mean to prohibit all judicial review of his decision,""  Dunlop v. Bachowski , 421 U.S. 560, 567 (1975). ...    We ordinarily presume that Congress intends the executive to obey its statutory commands and, accordingly, that it expects the courts to grant relief when an executive agency violates such a command.    Id.   [Page 42]     In view of the foregoing, it is apparent that there is no law that prohibits the DOL and courts from reviewing the process used in the security clearance decision for evidence of retaliation and, if found, providing some remedy to the complainant, even if the remedy may have to be limited to matters other than controlling the substantive outcome of the clearance decision. 4     In any case, there is no authority that prohibits consideration of an illegal and retaliatory clearance decision process for the purpose of establishing the elements of a whistleblower case such as protected activity, retaliatory motive, adverse action, and management knowledge of the action (versus who does and does not get a clearance).  There is nothing in  Egan  that exempts the Army from compliance with federal environmental laws or authorizes the Army to use security clearances to retaliate against employees who raise environmental and safety concerns.  First Amendment concerns would be raised by any attempt to ""legalize"" such discrimination for raising concerns on matters of public import such as the improper handling of chemical warfare agents, and I so find and conclude.      Further, in regard to potential application of any APA exemption for military affairs via 5 U.S.C. Section 554, assuming DOL proceedings under the environmental statutes are the type of proceeding to which such APA language was intended to apply, there is nothing uniquely military that is deserving of protection from judicial or agency review involved in a military agency functioning as an employer and illegally creating a hostile work environment, issuing improper ratings on performance evaluations, directly expressing hostility towards a Complainant's protected activities, issuing gag orders to prevent employees  from engaging in protected activity, and so forth.  These types of conduct, even though they happen to occur at a military facility, do not involve national security issues or uniquely military functions,  i.e. , do not represent ""the conduct of military or foreign affairs functions"" as that phrase is used in 5 U.S.C. Section 554, and I so find and conclude.       Further, the APA provision at 5 U.S.C. Section 554 merely makes inapplicable the APA in the case of ""the conduct of military or foreign affairs functions"" but does not restrict application of later enacted environmental statutes and the regulations thereunder to environmental whistleblower cases involving military agency employers.  The Congress clearly intended for the military to be bound by the federal environmental laws and the state environmental laws, like any other polluter.  Congress made that very clear in the Federal Facility Compliance Act at 42 U.S.C. 6961, as one example, and I so find and conclude.  [Page 43]     It should be noted that in  Johnson v. Oak Ridge , ARB. 97-057, September 30, 1999 the ARB appeared to decide, at least by implication, that security clearance issues could be addressed in an environmental whistleblower case if the clearance issue was clearly the subject of protected activities under the environmental statutes (which was found not to be the case there).          3.Complainant Engaged in Protected Activities, and Did So with a Reasonable Good Faith Belief That Environmental Laws Were Violated       This case proceeded to a full hearing on the merits.  Accordingly, examining whether or not Complainant has established a  prima facie  case is no longer particularly useful and this Administrative Law Judge will consider whether, viewing all of the evidence as a whole, the Complainant has shown, by a preponderance of the evidence that he was discriminated against for engaging in protected activity.   See Boudrie v. Commonwealth Edison Co. , 1995-ERA-15 (ARB Apr. 22, 1997);  Boytin v. Pennsylvania Power & Light Co. , 1994-ERA-32 (Sec'y, Oct. 20, 1995);  Marien v. Northeast Nuclear Energy Co. , 1993-ERA-49/50 (Sec'y, Sept. 18, 1995).  To carry that burden Complainant must prove that Respondent's stated reasons for reprimanding Complainant are pretext,  i.e. , that they are not the true reasons for the adverse action and that the protected activity was.   Leveille v. New York Air Nat'l Guard , 1994-TSC-3/4 (Sec'y Dec. 1, 1995);  Hoffman v. Bossert , 1994-CAA-4 (Sec'y 19, 1995).  It is not sufficient that Complainant establish that the proffered reason was unbelievable; he must establish intentional discrimination in order to prevail.   Leveille, supra .      On the basis of the totality of this closed record, I find and conclude that Complainant's engagement in protected activity has been overwhelmingly established in this case.  He raised complaints both internally within his chain-of-command, and externally to third parties. 5     I found Complainant's testimony most credible and convincing on this issue.  Specifically, I find that, virtually from the start of his employment with Dugway, Complainant has repeatedly raised his concerns both internally and to the Utah agency.  Complainant's concerns were that the procedures, methods, and policies of Dugway were causing direct violations of pertinent statutes and regulations.  I find and conclude that these actions constitute protected activity under the several Acts before me, with the exception of TSCA.      Similarly, the evidence clearly establishes that Respondent knew of Complainant's engaging in these protected activities, as his complaints were always logged with his first line supervisor and elsewhere in his chain-of-command.    [Page 44]     Even though Respondent disagreed with Complainant's insistence about the proper procedures, Respondent has not shown that Complainant's position was unreasonable.  See generally Yellow Freight Sys. v. Reich , 38 F.3d 76 (2d Cir. 1994) (wherein the Court held an employee need not prove the existence of an actual safety defect to have engaged in protected activity under an analogous whistleblower statute, the Surface Transportation Act);  Crow v. Noble Roman's, Inc. , 1995-CAA-8 (Sec'y Feb. 26, 1996) (the CAA protects employee's work refusal that is based on a good faith, reasonable belief that doing the work would be unsafe or unhealthy);  Minard v. Nerco Delamar Co. , 1992- SWD-1 (Sec'y Jan. 25, 1994) (concluding that whistleblower protection applies to where a complainant is mistaken, so long as complainant's belief is reasonable);  Scerbo v. Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y., Inc. , 1989-CAA-2 (Sec'y Nov. 13, 1992) (protection is not dependent upon actually proving a violation). In fact, it is well established that Complainant arrived at his recommendations that the Respondent was violating the Acts based on his extensive training and experience.  Further, the evidence establishes that many of the issues in controversy were anything but clear cut.       The nature of Dr. Hall's protected activities has been detailed above in the findings of fact and these are incorporated herein at this point.  Moreover, the law defining what is protected activity, as described below, clearly encompasses Dr. Hall's actions described above in raising his environmental concerns internally and externally.  Dr. Hall's actions in raising RCRA, CERCLA, SDWA, CWA, and CAA concerns regarding Simpson Butte and Lewisite, the mustard agent in the Carr Red Dirt, the Lakeside Bomb and M79 mystery bomb, the BZ bomblets, the improperly stored waste chemicals and a number of other matters spelled out  supra , are classic protected activities, and I again so find and conclude.    The Secretary of Labor has repeatedly held that the reporting of safety or  quality concerns internally to one's employer is protected activity under the Solid Waste Disposal Act.  See Dodd v. Polysar Latex , 1988-SWD-4 (Sec'y Sept. 22, 1994);  Conaway v. Instant  Oil Change, Inc. , 1991-SWD-4 (Sec'y Jan. 5, 1993). The Secretary has noted that, ""An  employee's internal complaints are the first step in achieving the statutory goal of promoting safety.""  Dodd v. Polysar Latex , 1988-SWD-4 (Sec'y Sept. 22, 1994).    Migliore v. Rhode Island Department of  Environmental Management , 1998-SWD-3, 1999-SWD-1, 1999-SWD-2 (ALJ RDO August 13, 1999).    Courts and the Secretary of Labor have broadly construed the range of employee conduct which is protected by the employee protection provisions contained in environmental and nuclear acts.  See  S. Kohn,  The Whistleblower Handbook  35-47 (1990). Examples of the types of employee conduct which the Secretary of Labor has held to be protected include: making internal complaints to management,[3] reporting alleged violations to governmental authorities such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (""NRC"") and the Environmental Protection Agency, threatening or stating an intention to report alleged violations to such governmental authorities, and contacting the media, trade unions, and citizen intervenor groups about alleged violations.   Id.     [Page 45]     As I also wrote in another decision:        This claim deals with internal complaints to Respondent's management because on April 20, 1992, Complainant advised Lionel Banda that there were serious and widespread violations in Respondent's ""Access Screening Program"" for technicians granted unescorted access to nuclear power plants and other public utilities.  The totality of this closed record leads to the conclusion that Complainant reported these violations to the Employer and that he forced the Employer to report these violations to the appropriate governmental authority, such as the NRC, as well as the affected public utilities.     Creekmore v. ABB Power Systems Energy Services, Inc. , 93-ERA-24 (ALJ Sept. 1, 1994) (a matter over which this Administrative Law Judge presided).      As I also wrote in another decision:        The employee protection provisions have been construed broadly to afford protection for participation in activities in furtherance of the statutory objectives.  Marcus v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , 1996-CAA-3 (ALJ Dec. 15, 1998), slip op. at p. 25,  citing Tyndall v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , 93-CAA-6, 95-CAA-5, ARB June 14, 1996).

Dec. and Ord., Nov. 13, 1992, slip op. at 4-5. Further, the gathering of evidence in support of a whistleblower complaint, including the gathering of evidence by means of tape recording, is a type of activity that has been held to be covered by the employee protection provisions referenced at 29 C.F.R. §24.1(a).  Melendez v. Chemicals Americas, supra  at p. 10.     Anderson v. Metro Wastewater Reclamation District , ARB No.: 98-087, Case No.: 1997-SDW-7 (ALJ RDO Sept. 18, 2001) (a matter over which I presided).  [Page 46]     As I also wrote more recently:        Complainant's engagement in protected activity has been overwhelmingly established in  this case. She raised complaints both internally within her chain-of-command, and externally to the EPA.  I found Complainant's testimony most credible and  convincing on this issue. Specifically, I find that from the 1996 proposed reorganization to the present,  Complainant has repeatedly raised her concerns that RIDEM was taking action that compromised the RCRA  enforcement program. Complainant's concerns were that the procedures, methods, and policies of RIDEM were  causing direct violations of the RCRA. I find and conclude that these actions constitute protected activity under.         Even though Respondent disagreed with Complainant's insistence about the proper RCRA  procedures, Respondent has not shown that Complainant's position was unreasonable.  See generally  Yellow Freight Sys. v. Reich , 38 F.3d 76 (2d Cir. 1994) (wherein the Court held an employee need not  prove the existence of an actual safety defect to have engaged in protected activity under an analogous  whistleblower statute, the Surface Transportation Act);  Crow v.

Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y., Inc. , 1989-CAA-2 (Sec'y Nov. 13, 1992) (protection is not dependent upon actually proving a violation). In fact, it is well established that Complainant arrived at her recommendations that the Respondent was violating  the RCRA based on her extensive training and experience in the environmental enforcement area. Further, the  evidence establishes that many of the enforcement actions in controversy were anything but clear cut.     Migliore v. Rhode Island Department of  Environmental Management , 1998-SWD-3, 1999-SWD-1, 1999-SWD-2 (ALJ RDO August 13, 1999).      The  Kemp  case requirement,  see   Kemp v. Volunteers of America of Pennsylvania, Inc. , ARB No. 00-069, ALJ No. 2000-CAA-6 (ARB Dec. 18, 2000),  that Complainant have a reasonable good faith belief that environmental laws were violated is well satisfied here.  The asbestos in the basement circumstances in  Kemp  are facts that do not resemble the facts here which involve,  inter alia , chemical warfare agent having been disposed of in the open environment at the Simpson Butte, Carr Red Dirt, and mustard/Lewisite mine test sites, incompatible chemicals stored so as to create a risk of fire and explosion, chemicals dumped via drains into sewers and from there to unlined lagoons, and violations of RCRA that do not require a release to constitute a violation (such as the RCRA requirement to prevent releases,  see  40 C.F.R. Sections 264.15, 264.31; Section 270.30) to name a few examples of many identified in the findings of fact above and established in the record.  Further, it was clear that because of the volatile nature of the chemical agents and the limited air flow control in the Dugway Chem Lab that the State environmental agency considered a release of even a small amount of agent inside the Chem Lab building to be a release to the environment, and I so find and conclude.  (Hall Deposition [RX 116], June 5, 2001 p 25-26)  [Page 47]        C. THE EMPLOYER DUGWAY PROVING GROUND HAD KNOWLEDGE OF DR. HALL'S PROTECTED ACTIVITIES       The record is replete with evidence that Dugway knew of Dr. Hall's protected activities and numerous examples of such evidence have already been detailed above.  Dugway knew because Dr. Hall made many of his protected reports directly to his managers and higher level supervisors, as in  Berkman .      As I wrote in  Berkman :    Similarly, the evidence clearly establishes that Respondent knew of Complainant's engaging  in these protected activities, as his complaints were always logged with his first line supervisor and elsewhere  in his chain-of-command.     Berkman v. U.S. Coast Guard Academy , Case Nos.: 97-CAA-2 and 97-CAA-9 (ARB Dec. January 2, 1998).  As the findings of fact,  supra , make clear, there was virtually no example of Dr. Hall's protected activities of which Dugway was unaware.      I strongly disagree with Respondent that Dugway was aware of Complainant's protected activities only ""a few times.""  This record is replete with many instances thereof, almost from the start of his employment at Dugway, simply because the word quickly spread that he was not a ""team player"" and could not be trusted.  Complainant would later even be called ""traitor"" by a very  high ranking military officer.         D. ADVERSE ACTIONS WERE TAKEN BY RESPONDENT EMPLOYER DUGWAY PROVING GROUND AGAINST DR. HALL       It is clear from the applicable law discussed herein defining what constitutes adverse actions by an employer against an employee that are actionable under the environmental statutes if performed with discriminatory intent, that the numerous actions by Dugway against Dr.  [Page 48]  Hall documented in the record and delineated above are the type of actions that are within the scope of the employee protection provisions of RCRA, SDWA, CWA, CERCLA and the CAA.    An ""adverse action"" has been defined as simply something unpleasant, detrimental, even unfortunate, but not necessarily (and not usually) discriminatory.""  Marcus v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , 1996-CAA-3 (ALJ Dec. 15, 1998), slip op. at p. 28,  citing Stone & Webster Engineering Corp. v. Herman , 115 F.3d 1568, 1573 (11th Cir. 1997). Under 29 C.F.R. §24.2(b), as amended, an employer is deemed to have violated the particular statutes and regulations ""if such employer intimidates, threatens, restrains, coerces, blacklists, discharges or in any other manner discriminates against any employee"" because of protected activities. Consistent with this regulation, a wide range of unfavorable actions has been held to constitute adverse action within the context of employment discrimination complaints.  Melendez v. Exxon Chemicals Americas, supra  at 24.     Anderson v. Metro Wastewater Reclamation District , ARB No.: 98-087, Case No.: 1997-SDW-7 (ALJ RDO Sept. 18, 2001).    Discrimination means disparate treatment. It means treating one employee less favorably than another for a forbidden reason.  See Teamsters v. United States , 431 U.S. 324, 335 n. 15 (1977). An employer may treat one employee less favorably than another in many different ways. Any such less favorable treatment is adverse action.  Termination, suspension and discipline are obvious forms of adverse action, but they are not exclusive. Indeed, the seminal case establishing the model for proving discrimination,  McDonnell Douglas v. Green , involved none of those.     Creekmore v. ABB Power Systems Energy Services, Inc. , 93-ERA-24 (ALJ Sept. 1, 1994).    An adverse employment action can be in the form of tangible job detriment or a hostile work environment.  Smith v. Esicorp, Inc. , 93-ERA-16, at p. 3 (Sec'y 3/13/96).  ...  Complainant also alleges he has been subjected to retaliatory harassment, which is a violation of the applicable whistleblower statutes.  Smith ,  supra ,   at p. 11;  Marien ,  supra , at p. 4. Hostile work environment cases involve issues of the environment in which the employee works and not tangible job detriment.  Smith ,  supra , at p. 11. For harassment to be actionable, it must be sufficiently severe or persuasive as to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment.  Id.  at pp. 4-5 ( Citing Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson , 477 U.S. 57, 67 (1986).  See also English v. General Elec. Co. , 85-ERA-2 (Sec'y 2/13/92) (in which the Secretary applied the  Meritor  decision for guidance in the case of an alleged hostile work environment in violation of an analogous whistleblower statute, the ERA). In  Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc. , 114 S. Ct. 367 (1993), the Supreme Court discussed some of the factors that may be weighed but emphasized that whether an environment is hostile or abusive can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances.    Berkman v. U.S. Coast Guard Academy , Case Nos.: 97-CAA-2 and 97-CAA-9 (ARB Dec. January 2, 1998).  [Page 49]     A finding of constructive discharge requires proving that the employer, rather than acting directly, deliberately makes an employee's working conditions so difficult, unpleasant, unattractive, or unsafe that an objective reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign,  i.e. , that the resignation was involuntary.   See generally Mosley v. Carolina Power & Light Co. , 94-ERA-23 (ARB 8/23/96)( citing Nathaniel, supra; Johnson v. Old Dominion Security , 86-CAA-3 (Secy' 5/29/91).   See also Guice-Mills v. Derwinski , 772 F.Supp. 188 (S.D.N.Y. 1991),  aff'd , 967 F.2d 794 (2d Cir. 1992);  Lopez v. S.B. Thomas, Inc. , 831 F.2d 1184 (2d Cir. 1987);  Talbert, supra .  Thus, the adverse consequences flowing from an adverse employment action generally are insufficient to substantiate a finding of constructive discharge.  Rather, the presence of ""aggravating factors"" is required.   Nathaniel, supra (citing Clark v. Marsh , 665 F.2d 1168, 1174 (D.C. Cir. 1981).   See also Stetson v. Nynex Serv. Co. , 995 F.2d 355 (2d Cir. 1993).  Conceivably, a constructive discharge could occur through medical or physical inability.   Spence v. Maryland Casualty Co. , 803 F.Supp. 659, 667 (W.D.N.Y. 1992)(reasoning that  Lopez v. S.B. Thomas, Inc., Supra , does not require that a constructive discharge be demonstrated only by an affirmative resignation).    On the one hand, the Secretary has noted that circumstances sufficient to render a resignation involuntary include a pattern of discriminatory treatment and ""locking"" an employee into a position from which no relief seemingly can be obtained.   Johnson, supra , at n. 11 ( citing Clark , 665 F.2d at 1175);  Satterwhite v. Smith , 744 F.2d at 1382-1383).  On the other hand, it is insufficient that the employee simply feels that the quality of his work has been unfairly criticized.   Mosley, supra  ( citing Stetson , 995 F.2d at 360).  Furthermore, when an employee's performance is poor, ""an employer's communication of the risks [of discipline for that poor performance] does not spoil the employee's decision to avoid those risks by quitting.""   Id.  at p. 4 ( quoting Henn v. National Geographic Society , 819 F.2d 824, 829-30 (7th Cir. 1987),  cert. denied , 484 U.S. 964 (1987). ...    The Secretary has adopted the majority position for determining whether or not there has been a constructive discharge.  As was succinctly stated in the matter of  Hollis v. Double DD Truck Lines, Inc. , 84-STA-13, at p. 4 (Sec'y March 18, 1995) it is not necessary to show that the employer intended to force a resignation, only that he intended the employee to work in the intolerable conditions.    Berkman v. U.S. Coast Guard Academy , Case Nos.: 97-CAA-2 and 97-CAA-9 (ARB Dec. January 2, 1998).  [Page 50]     There can be no doubt on this record that Dugway took a number of adverse actions against Dr. Hall.  The more obvious ones included lowered performance ratings, negative statements in performance ratings, transfer to the JOD from the chem lab, a twelve month transfer thereafter reduced to 120 days, removal of Dr. Hall's approval in the CPRP program, suspension and recommended revocation of his security clearance, creation of a hostile work environment, three mental examinations, threatened discharge, and constructive discharge/forced retirement, all of which adverse actions have been discussed above.      Dr. Hall also faced direct expressions of anger and hostility because of his protected activities.  The hostile work environment included the actions listed above and use of slander, innuendo and breaches of privacy and confidence to impugn Dr. Hall's reputation.  Complainant was forced to retire.  He was facing some pretty clear handwriting on the wall.  He tolerated a number of hostile and adverse actions over a period of years, and was told directly to stop engaging in protected reporting activity to Congress and environmental agencies.  His CPRP had been removed without notice and finally his security clearance had been suspended and recommended to be revoked.  He had been threatened with termination if his performance appraisals did not improve and circumstances made it clear that what Dugway wanted to change was not Dr. Hall's actual job performance but his protected reporting of environmental violations and dangers.  This was something in good conscience Dr. Hall would not allow himself to be intimidated into doing.  At that point, with his mental and physical health in jeopardy he decided to cut his losses and mitigate his damages and try to maintain some aspect of his health and his income by retiring.  He consulted his doctors, who essentially advised him that this hostile environment was probably going to kill him, and his own judgment was that he should not wait to be terminated for his own professional future.  So, in May of 1997, Dr. Hall was forced to give his notice, and in June of 1997 actually did in fact retire.  This pattern of facts, which made continued employment intolerable to Dr. Hall and would have to any reasonable person, amounts to what is recognized in the law as constructive discharge, or in this case, a forced retirement, as described in the case law quoted  supra , and I so find and conclude.      Respondent submits that its actions of requiring Dr. Hall to go through the chain-of-command with his concerns or complaints were not adverse actions under the statutes involved herein.  However, I strongly disagree - - that is the very essence of his case as the chain-of-command requirement was being used to prevent Dr. Hall from voicing his concerns or complaints outside Dugway.        E. RESPONDENT ACTED WITH RETALIATORY MOTIVE, TAKING ACTIONS AGAINST DR. HALL BECAUSE HE ENGAGED IN PROTECTED ACTIVITIES       The trial record reflects evidence of retaliatory motive that is both abundant and blatant, and these have been detailed above.  This evidence falls into a number of categories of direct and circumstantial evidence that are recognized in the case law as indicia of retaliatory motive and discriminatory intent.  Some of the applicable case law which lays out the law on evidence of retaliatory motive, including the burden shifting procedure which is to be used in an appropriate case is quoted at some length below.  However, the findings above make it clear that Dr. Hall's case is a direct evidence case, as in  Moder  quoted below, and thus burden shifting is not required.   [Page 51]  In any case, the motive evidence documented in the findings above makes clear that even if a burden shifting analysis were applied here, at best for Dugway this is a dual motive case and with the direct evidence identified in the findings above, there is no way Dugway can separate out the illegal from the legal motives for its actions against Dr. Hall and show that it would have taken the same actions absent the illegal motive, and I so find and conclude.    A plaintiff may prove a case of unlawful whistleblower retaliation in the same way as a case under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He may do so in one of two ways: either directly with direct evidence of retaliation or indirectly through circumstantial evidence establishing a  prima facie  case of retaliation.    Moder v. Village of Jackson, Wisconsin , 2000-WPC-0005 (ALJ Aug. 10, 2001) (a matter over which this Administrative Law Judge presided).      It is now well-settled that the Complainant, applying the traditional ""burden-shifting"" approach established in  McDonnell Douglas v. Green , 411 U.S. 492 (1973), may establish a  prima facie  case of retaliation indirectly by showing that      (1) the plaintiff was an employee of the party charged with discrimination; (2) the plaintiff was engaged in a protected activity under the Clean Water Act; (3) the employer took an adverse action against the plaintiff; and (4) the evidence creates a reasonable inference that the adverse action was taken because of the plaintiff's participation in the statutorily protected activity.       Passaic Valley , 992 F.2d at 480-81;  see also Simon v. Simmons Foods, Inc. , 49 F.3d 386, 389 (8th Cir. 1995).        Moreover, once the employee establishes a  prima facie  case of discrimination through such indirect means, the burden shifts to the employer to ""produce evidence that the plaintiff was [denied a promotion] . . . for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason.""  See Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine , 450 U.S. 248, 254 (1981). The employee then has ""the opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination.""  Id.  at 253;  see also St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks , 509 U.S. 502, 507-08 (1993). This Administrative Law Judge, in determining whether the plaintiff has met this burden, ""may still consider the evidence establishing the plaintiff's  prima facie  case 'and inferences properly drawn therefrom ... on the issue of whether the defendant's explanation is pretextual.'""  Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc. , 120 S.Ct. 2097, 2106 (2000) ( quoting   Burdine , 450 U.S. at 255, n. 10).   [Page 52]     Furthermore, the plaintiff need not proffer direct evidence that unlawful discrimination was the real motivation. Instead, ""it is permissible for the trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact of discrimination from the falsity of the employer's explanation.""  Reeves , 120 S.Ct. at 2108. As the Court stated in  St. Mary's  and reiterated in  Reeves :     The factfinder's disbelief of the reasons put forward by the defendant (particularly if disbelief is accompanied by a suspicion of mendacity) may, together with the elements of the  prima facie  case, suffice to show intentional discrimination. Thus, rejection of the defendant's proffered reasons will permit the trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact of intentional discrimination.     St. Mary's , 509 U.S. at 511,  quoted in Reeves , 120 S.Ct. at 2108.   Id.       If the employee presents direct evidence of discrimination, there is no need to resort to ""burden-shifting"" analysis under  McDonnell Douglas v. Green, supra ;  TWA v. Thurston , 469 U.S. 111, 121 (1985).  Direct evidence of discrimination is:      evidence which, if believed by the trier of fact, will prove the particular fact in question without reliance on inference or presumption... This evidence must not only speak directly to the issue of discriminatory intent, it must also relate to the specific employment decision in question.     Pitasi v. Gartner Group, Inc. , 184 F.3d 709, 714 (7th Cir. 1999) (internal quotations and citations omitted).       Of course, the employee must still prove by a preponderance of the evidence that unlawful discrimination was a  substantial factor in the employer's decision. See   Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins , 490 U.S. 228, 259 (1989) (White, J., concurring);  Id.  at 274 (O'Connor, J., concurring);  Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine , 450 U.S. 248, 253 (1981). So long as the direct evidence of discrimination is substantial, the employee is entitled to have it weighed and decided by the trier of fact. ...      This is a direct-evidence case, with substantial evidence that both ""speak[s] directly to the issue of discriminatory intent"" and ""relate[s] to the specific employment decision in question."" No inference or presumption is needed.  See Pitasi , 184 F.3d at 714. Beaver's and Murphy's statements and actions leading up to the decision to promote Deitsch rather than Moder leave no room for doubt that Moder's involvement in the DNR investigation more than ten years before was the deciding factor, and I so find and conclude. ...  [Page 53]     As I wrote in  Moder :    The Village has asserted what it calls ""legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons"" for selecting Deitsch rather than Moder. In this regard,  see   McDonnell Douglas v. Green ,  supra,  and its progeny. However, to the extent that those purported reasons are asserted in contravention of the direct evidence of discrimination, it is not enough for the employer simply to articulate them. If an employee proves unlawful discriminatory or retaliation, but the employer contends that its adverse action against the employee was motivated instead by a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason, dual-motive analysis applies. The  employer  must  prove,  by a preponderance of the evidence, that it would have reached the same decision even if the employee had not engaged in protected conduct.  See Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v. Doyle , 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977);  Passaic Valley, 992 F.2d at 481 (Sec. 507(a) case); see also Price Waterhouse, 490 U.S.  at 252-53 (Brennan, J., for 4 justices);  Id.  at 259-60 (White, J., concurring);  Id.  at 261 (O'Connor, J., concurring).     In such a ""dual-motive"" situation, it is not enough that the employer simply articulate a lawful reason for the employee then to disprove.  See Martin v. Department of the Army , 93-SDW-1 (Sec'y July 13, 1995). Rather, ""the employer's burden is most appropriately deemed an affirmative defense: the plaintiff must persuade the factfinder on one point, and then the employer, if it wishes to prevail, must persuade it on another.""  Price Waterhouse , 490 U.S. at 245 (Brennan, J.). The employer bears the risk that the influence of legal and illegal motives cannot be separated.  Mandreger v. Detroit Edison Co.,  88-ERA-17 (Sec'y March 30, 1994).     In short, Moder has proven by direct evidence that unlawful discrimination in violation of Section 507(a) was a substantial motivating factor in the decision not to promote him to supervisor/foreman, and I so find and conclude. The Village bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it would have selected Deitsch anyway for legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons even if it had not also been motivated by Moder's role in the DNR investigation. For the reasons discussed more fully below, all such asserted reasons are mere pretexts. ...    The defendant, of course, is entitled to proffer a ""legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason,"" returning to the plaintiff ""the opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination.""  Burdine , 450 U.S. at 253. Pretext is ""a lie, specifically a phony reason for some action.""  Russell v. Acme-Evans Co. , 51 F.3d 64, 68 (7th Cir. 1995).   [Page 54]   A plaintiff can establish pretext either directly, with evidence suggesting that retaliation or discrimination was the most likely motive for the termination, or indirectly, by showing that the employer's proffered reason was not worthy of belief. The indirect method requires some showing that (1) the defendant's explanation has no basis in fact, or (2) the explanation was not the ""real reason"", or (3) ... the reason stated was insufficient to warrant the termination.      Sanchez v. Henderson , 188 F.3d 740, 746 (7th Cir. 1999) (internal citations and quotations omitted).     Furthermore, the Supreme Court has emphasized:     The factfinder's disbelief of the reasons put forward by the defendant (particularly if disbelief is accompanied by a suspicion of mendacity) may, together with the elements of the  prima facie  case, suffice to show intentional discrimination. Thus, rejection of the defendant's proffered reasons will permit the trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact of intentional discrimination.       Reeves , 120 S.Ct. at 2108;  St. Mary's v. Hicks , 509 U.S. at 511.     Id.       In Dr. Hall's case like Moder's, there was retaliatory motive on the part of the Respondent in taking the adverse actions against Dr. Hall,  i.e. , the actions taken were caused by the protected activity.  There are a number of pieces of the puzzle, key circumstantial evidence, that point clearly to the presence of retaliatory motive in this case.  In addition, unlike many whistle blower cases but like  Moder , there are also more direct expressions of hostility and retaliatory motive in this case which are unambiguous, and I so find and conclude.     Direct Evidence:  Respondent's Hostile Attitude Toward Complainant's Protected Activities Specifically:       As this Administrative Law Judge found in  Moder , this case involves direct evidence of retaliatory motive and discriminatory intent.    This is a direct evidence case. Beaver told Deitsch at Deitsch's interview about ""perceived baggage"" and the possibility that one or both would be rejected because of the Schultz affair ten years earlier. Murphy told Goetsch, a week before the Board met to make the selection, that Moder was not seen as a ""team player"" because he had gone to DNR about Schultz. Beaver and Murphy collaborated in placing the report of the anonymous tip to the DNR before the Board members when they made their decision. This is all direct evidence that the two key players in the selection decision, Beaver and Murphy, did not want Moder to get the job because of his role in the DNR investigation.    ( Id. )  In the case at bar, General Aiken calling Complainant a traitor for reporting environmental violations is an example of direct evidence of retaliatory motive.  There were also several occasions when Colonel Kiskowski expressed overt hostility and anger in meetings with Dr. Hall, including in January 1996 when he imposed the chain-of-command gag order and in February 1997 when he angrily threatened Hall with termination.    [Page 55]     Another example of direct evidence is when Dugway manager Dr. Condie referred to Dr. Hall as one who cannot be trusted to not report his concerns and complaints to the State environmental agency.        A further unambiguous piece of direct evidence of retaliatory motive is reflected in the events and conversations resulting from Dugway managers being so upset with Dr. Hall having reported violations concerning improper storage of waste chemicals that Colonel Ertwine felt compelled to transfer Dr. Hall out of the chem lab and candidly explaining that the transfer had to be made to appear as if it were not in retaliation for Dr. Hall having reported the violations to OSHA.      Another blatant example of direct evidence is when Dugway managers, after ordering Dr. Hall to submit to a fitness for duty exam, and after being informed by Dr. Hall that he was being treated differently than other another chemist, promptly ordered the other chemist, Dr. Harvey, to submit to a fitness for duty exam and explained to Dr. Harvey that they were requiring that he submit to the exam so as to avoid the appearance of disparate treatment of the first chemist [Dr. Hall].      No less blatant was Dugway Commander Colonel Como's decision to recommend revocation of Dr. Hall's security clearance after reviewing a packet of information submitted to him by Mr. Bowcutt, a packet which included Dr. Hall's DOL whistleblower complaint, with the cover note for the packet directing the Commander's attention to the fact that such a whistleblower complaint had been filed just several weeks earlier.    Respondent's Hostile Attitude Toward Protected Activities of Employees Generally:       One of the more striking pieces of evidence showing Dugway management's hostility toward employees who raise compliance issues is the Dugway file on Judy Moran, formerly an environmental compliance officer at Dugway.  Dugway officials suspended the security clearance of environmental compliance officer Judy Moran's after she reported potential violations to the State of Utah, and blatantly stated in the official memoranda reflecting their decision that they did so  because  she reported an environmental violation to the State.   See  CX 131.      A similarly blatant statement by General Aiken was published in a Dugway newsletter in which the General stated that he had a deep concern with employees who reported concerns to the Inspector General's Office outside their chain-of-command.   See  CX 59.  Further, there was a clearly stated Dugway policy that required reporting of environmental violations and concerns through the ""chain-of-command"" first, and treated employees who reported environmental concerns outside the chain-of-command to the State, EPA, OSHA, Congress, the IG, or even the Dugway JAG or Environmental Office as disloyal, disobedient and subject to disciplinary action. This policy and practice, and General Aiken's statement referenced immediately above, reflect clear evidence of hostility and retaliatory motive towards employees such as Dr. Hall who raise protected environmental concerns to State and federal environmental agencies and Congress.  Direct evidence of discriminatory intent is found where, as here, an employee is subjected to adverse actions because he went outside the chain-of-command to report an environmental concern.  [Page 56]     On the basis of the totality of this closed record, this Judge finds and concludes that Respondent's adverse actions were motivated by its disapproval of Complainant's repeated insistence on environmental compliance and his efforts to obtain that compliance. While this Judge does not fault the chain-of-command for its disagreement with Complainant's assessment on the reportability of the North Site and its declination to adopt his recommendations, I do find fault in the chain-of-command's active efforts to dissuade and/or prohibit Complainant from making a report to external regulatory authorities. Respondent was not entitled to insist that Complainant adhere to their position or keep silent about his disagreement with it.  See Generally Dutkiewicz v. Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc. , 95-STA-34 (ARB August 8, 1997)(a  matter over which I presided).      As I wrote in an earlier decision:        Respondent is, in effect, faulting Complainant for going outside the chain-of-command and making a complaint to a government agency.  For example, Captain Florin commented and gesticulated that Complainant had stabbed him in the back when he reported to the CT DEP despite the command's determination that the North Site need not be reported.  He also testified and attested to the fact that he took issue with Complainant circumventing the chain-of-command.  (TR 1003; CX 109)  It is not permissible, however, to find fault with an employee for failing to observe established channels when making safety complaints.   Odom v. Anchor Lithkemko , 96-WPC-1 (ARB 10/10/97).   See also West v. Systems Applications Int'l , 94-CAA-15 (Sec'y 4/19/95).  Such restrictions on communication, the Secretary has held, would seriously undermine the purpose of the environmental whistleblower laws to protect public health and safety.    Berkman v. U.S. Coast Guard Academy , Case Nos.: 97-CAA-2 and 97-CAA-9 (ARB Dec. January 2, 1998).    The Board has held that evidence that an employer routinely encouraged employees to make written reports of safety defects is ""highly relevant"" evidence that militates against a finding of retaliatory motive.   See Andreae v. Dry Ice, Inc . 95-STA-24 (ARB 7/17/97).  Vice versa, this Judge views evidence that an employer discourages reporting compliance issues as highly relevant to a finding of retaliatory motive.  In this regard, I find the credible and uncontroverted evidence that Attorney Frey was told not to contact the DEP indicative of Respondent's animus towards the environmental compliance officer resorting to external authorities in an effort to obtain compliance. ...    Id.   [Page 57]   Respondent's Use of Irregular Procedure in Regard to Complainant:       It is now well-settled that an employer's use of irregular procedure in dealing with an employee who has engaged in protected activities is indicative of retaliatory motive.  A number of instances of Dugway's use of irregular procedure in regard to Dr. Hall have been delineated above, especially Dugway's failure to notify Dr. Hall that his CPRP approval was terminated.       It was also irregular procedure to require Dr. Hall to submit to a new background investigation on the excuse that newly changed regulations required it when the regulation in question exempted Dr. Hall as an employee who had a valid background investigation within five years of having been placed in a chemical duty position and who had no break in federal service.  Failure to inform Dr. Hall that his CPRP had been suspended, restricted or terminated for medical reasons was also irregular procedure.  Re-raising years later in 1996, old allegations regarding which Dr. Hall had been cleared in 1989-91, particularly in light of Dr. Hall having been given a memo from the Commanding Colonel of Dugway assuring him that his record was clear (CX 14) and that nothing would be held against him in the future, in an attempt to influence adversely the outcome of the third mental exam and Dr. Hall's CPRP and security clearance review was blatantly irregular procedure, not to mention offensive.  Likewise failing to erase from Dr. Hall's records the temporary disqualification from CPRP after Dr. Hall was reinstated, contrary to Army regulations and policy that requires such erasure, was irregular procedure reflecting Dugway's discriminatory intent, and I so find and conclude.    Respondent's Disparate Treatment of Complainant:       There was disparate treatment of Dr. Hall regarding his working at home and regarding being subjected to a fitness for duty exam in comparison to Dr. Harvey who was similarly situated.  When Dr. Hall pointed this out to Dugway, rather than cease their discriminatory treatment of Dr. Hall evidenced by the disparate treatment, Dugway embarked on a course to coverup the appearance of disparate treatment by forcing Dr. Harvey, a kind and dedicated public servant suffering serious illness, to undergo a fitness for duty exam (although with more flexible procedures) and eventually terminated Dr. Harvey.  This intentional victimization of an innocent and loyal professional employee shows the lengths to which Dugway was willing to go to silence Dr. Hall's whistleblowing, and I so find and conclude.       Dr. Hall also suffered disparate treatment regarding the time period in which submission of the paperwork for the new 1995 background investigation for CPRP was required.  Dr. Hall  was required to submit his paperwork within a short time, a matter of several days, and some of his colleagues were allowed to take 1-2 years to do so.  Dr. Hall was also subjected to disparate treatment in regard to being required to submit to mental examinations when employees who were in similar or more compelling circumstances were not required to submit to such exams, and I so find and conclude.  [Page 58]   Respondent's Changing Reasons Offered for its Actions Regarding Complainant:       Dugway's stated reasons for actions against Dr. Hall were conveniently inconsistent. Respondent first attempted to rely on a sexual harassment charge as a basis for requiring Dr. Hall to submit to two mental exams in 1989 and then assured Dr. Hall that such an allegation was not the reason for the exam (stating that the actual reason was certain letters Dr. Hall had submitted to Mr. Bowcutt), then in 1991 assured Dr. Hall that there were no pending sexual harassment charges against him, then five and six years later raised the same old (and still unfounded) sexual harassment charge again during later attempts in 1996 to again require Dr. Hall to submit to yet another mental exam, and then at trial attempted to rely on the same old sexual harassment charge to justify its past actions against Complainant but failed to produce a complaining witness even after being cautioned by the Court that the individual allegedly being harassed did not view it as such.  Moreover, Ms. Carlson's statements about the sweater incident do not, in my judgment, constitute sexual harassment as she did not view it as an ""unwanted touching.""  However, the woman in the back seat viewed it as such and led the conspiracy to bring that charge against Dr. Hall.      Further, Respondent rated Dr. Hall as fully successful or higher on all of his performance appraisals but gave contradictory performance information to the mental health professionals examining Dr. Hall, and later at trial attempted to provide an entirely different performance rating for Dr. Hall using a 1-10 comparative or personal potential based system never adopted at Dugway.    Proximity in Time of Respondent's Actions to Complainant's Protected Activities       As I wrote in one of my earlier decisions:    One factor that courts deem important in determining whether the employee has made a  prima facie  case of unlawful retaliation or discrimination is whether the employer discharged or otherwise disciplined the employee for engaging in protected activity ""so closely in time as to justify an inference of retaliatory motive.""   Couty v. Dole , 886 F.2d 147, 148 (8th Cir. 1989) (termination occurred thirty days after protected activity),  citing Womack v. Munson  619 F.2d 1292. 1296 (8th Cir. 1980) (twenty-three days),  cert. denied , 450 U.S. 979 (1981);  Keys v. Lutheran Family and Children Services of Missouri , 668 F.2d 356, 358 (8th Cir. 1981) (less than two months).  These cases provide examples of when the duration of time between protected conduct and adverse employment action is sufficiently short to give rise to at least an inference of retaliation, thereby allowing the employee to satisfy the requirement of a  prima facie  case. ...     It is well-settled that temporal proximity is sufficient as a matter of law to establish the final required element of a  prima facie  case - that of causation of retaliatory discharge.   Keys v. Lutheran Family and Children's Services of Missouri , 668 F.2d 356, 358 (8th Cir. 1981);  Womack v. Musen , 618 F.2d 1292, 1286 & N. 6 (8th Cir. 1980);  cert. denied , 450 U.S. 979, 101 S.Ct 1513, 67 L.Ed 2nd 814 (1981);  Davis v. State University of New York , 802 F.2d 638, 642 (2d Cir. 1986);  Mitchell v. Baldrich , 759 F.2d 80, 86 (D.C. Cir. 1985);  Dominic v. Consolidated Edison Co. of New York , 822 F.2d 1249 (2d Cir. 1987) (considering retaliatory action claim for firing that occurred three months after filing complaint);  Burrows v. Chemed Corp ., 567 F. Supp. 978, 986 (E.D. Mo. 1983) (holding inference of retaliatory motive justified, where transfer followed protected activity);  Kellin v. ACF Industries , 671 F.2d 279 (8th Cir. 1982) (holding lower court's finding that  prima facie  case for retaliatory action was established, where EEOC charge was filed in late 1971 and disciplinary measures occurred throughout 1972).  8. The close proximity of time of the discharge to the protected activity will justify the inference of a retaliatory motive in the employer.   Couty v. Dole ,  supra  (8th Cir. 1989).  The above cases include temporal spacing between the protected activity and the retaliatory discharge of up to five months.  Thermidor, supra.     Creekmore v. ABB Power Systems Energy Services, Inc. , 93-ERA-24 (ALJ Sept. 1, 1994).  [Page 59]     The close proximity in time between Dr. Hall's protected activities and Dugway's actions strongly supports an inference of retaliatory motive even in the absence of the direct evidence and abundant other circumstantial evidence.  For example, reassignment of Dr. Hall to the joint Contact Point occurred shortly after Dr. Hall's reporting to the State and OSHA of improper storage of waste chemicals resulted in an OSHA inspection and citation of Dugway for OSHA violations.      Attempts to lower Dr. Hall's performance appraisal occurred shortly after Dr. Hall engaged in protected internal and external reporting of environmental concerns, including in 1987 after Hall disclosed potential violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act and Clean Water, and later when Dr. Hall was engaged in raising concerns regarding Simpson Butte, the Carr Red Dirt, the BZ Bomblets, and PINS in the 1995-1997 period.      The Dugway Commander's Recommendation to revoke Dr. Hall's security clearance came shortly after Dr. Hall filed his DOL whistleblower complaint in this matter and after the Commander reviewed that complaint in the packet of information submitted to him and on which he relied in making his determination to recommend revocation of Dr. Hall's security clearance.      About a week after Dr. Hall had submitted his testimony in an Army 15-6 investigation, Dr. Christiansen said Gary Bodily's recently vacated position would not be filled from the list of previous applicants, on which list Hall was highly ranked, but would be filled from outside.       Dugway received the notification of the DOL/OSHA investigation on February 24, 1997.  The hostile adverse actions continued and intensified at that point in  time.  Shortly after Dugway learned of Dr. Hall's complaint, Dr. Brimhall handed Hall his review of the BZ report first draft, and expressed sincere concern for something unpleasant awaiting Hall at the Editor's office.      Dugway's initiation of the third mental exam and expanded DIS investigation came in close proximity to Hall's raising concerns about the Lakeside Bomb, PINS, Simpson Butte, the BZ Bomblets and the Carr Red Dirt.  [Page 60]   Pretextual Reasons Offered by Respondent for Its Actions Against Complainant       As Complainant has proved the elements of his case, Respondents have the burden of producing evidence to rebut the presumption of disparate treatment by presenting evidence that the alleged disparate treatment was motivated by legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons.   See Morris v. The American Inspection Co. , 1992-ERA-5 (Sec'y Dec. 15, 1992). Significantly, Respondent bears only a burden of production, as the ultimate burden of persuasion of the existence of intentional discrimination rests with the Complainant.   Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine , 450 U.S. 248, 254-55 (1981);  Dartey v. Zack Co. of Chicago , 1982-ERA-2 (Sec'y Apr. 25, 1983). An employer's discharge decision is not unlawful even if based on mistaken conclusions about the facts, however, a decision will only violate the Acts if it was motivated by retaliation.  Dysert v. Westinghouse Electric Corp. , 1986- ERA-39 (Sec'y Oct. 30, 1991).      Respondent contends that any alleged, adverse action taken against Complainant was for a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason.  I disagree.  Rather, I find and conclude that all of Respondent's purported legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for its actions were actually based upon, and closely interwoven with, Complainant's protected activities, and those actions and reasons therefore have been delineated at length above.  While Respondent cites to Dr. Hall's alleged poor performance, the delays and conflicts upon which Respondent relies actually involved the same projects and situations where Dr. Hall was engaging in protected activity.  Moreover, the cited delays were actually the result of the conspiracy against Dr. Hall to get rid of him because he was not a ""team player"" and because of his protected activity.      I find this situation closely analogous to  Passaic Valley Sewerage Commissioners v. United States Dep't of Labor , 992 F.2d 474 (3d Cir.),  cert. denied , 50 U.S. 964 (1993), where the Third Circuit held, where there was ""no evidence that the Complainant's alleged personality or professional deficiencies [in interpersonal relations] arose in any other context outside his complaint activity,"" the Respondent's conclusion that the Complainant had a personality problem or deficiency of interpersonal skills was reducible in essence to the problems of the inconvenience the Complainant caused by his pattern of complaints.  Id.  at 481;  see also Dodd v. Polysar Latex , 1988-SWD-4 (Sec'y Sept. 22, 1994) (concluding that what respondent viewed as poor attitude was nothing more than the result and manifestation of the Complainant's protected activity). I agree that this case presents a situation where all of Respondent's alleged ""legitimate"" reasons are essentially complaints about the inconvenience and difficulties caused by Complainant raising safety concerns. Therefore, I find and conclude that Respondent has failed to produce a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for subjecting the Complainant to adverse action, and as a result, Complainant has met his claim for intentional discrimination and is entitled to damages. If, however, a reviewing authority concludes that Respondent has provided legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for its actions, then I find and conclude that Complainant has proven that any such reasons are pretext, as shall now be discussed.   [Page 61]     I find and conclude that Complainant has presented adequate evidence to prove not only that the Respondent's proffered reasons for any adverse action pretext, but also that the Complainant was harassed and subject to disciplinary action in retaliation for engaging in protected activity.   Leveille v. New York Air Nat'l Guard , 1994-TSC-3/4 (Sec'y Dec. 11, 1995).  Respondent alleges that Complainant was subject to discipline based upon his professional failures, and repeated instances of refusing to follow supervisors' orders.  I find and conclude, however, that Complainant has proven that those reasons are specious, and that the real motivation concerned retaliation against him because of his protected activity.  I conclude that Dr. Hall has proven that Respondents intentionally discriminated against him for engaging in protected activity.      I find that Respondent's reasons are pretext and that Respondent's adverse actions were discriminatory and in retaliation for Complainant engaging in protected activity.      First, however, I, very briefly, wish to touch upon the issue of dual motive analysis. Under dual motive analysis, a respondent must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, the existence of a legitimate reason for the taking of adverse employment action against a complainant, and that the respondent would have taken the same action even if the employee had not engaged in protected conduct.  See Simon v. Simmons Foods, Inc. , 49 F.3d 386, 389 (8th Cir. 1995);  Martin v. The Dept. of the Army , 1993-SDW-1 (Sec'y July 13, 1995).       This Judge only reaches the dual motive analysis if I determine there is a legitimacy to the Respondent's stated reason for the adverse employment action, a conclusion which I have specifically rejected for the aforementioned reasons. Even so, I find and conclude the Respondent has failed to present sufficient evidence that they would have taken the same action if Complainant had not engaged in protected activity, because the evidence establishes that Respondent's actions and positions were motivated primarily in response to Complainant raising quality concerns.      In view of the clear and direct evidence of Dugway's retaliatory motive in the record, there is no need to analyze asserted reasons offered by Dugway to show they are pretextual.  On the record that exists, I find and conclude that it is impossible for Dugway to assert a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for its actions.  However, if reviewing authorities should rule otherwise, I further find and conclude that this record makes clear that the reasons asserted by Dugway are in fact pretextual.  Pretext is shown from Dugway's false and  post-hoc  evaluations of Complainant's performance over the years, evaluations that are inconsistent with the official performance appraisals at the time, and in the reasons given for his lowered performance evaluations.  In some cases, Dr. Hall protesting those lowered evaluations actually got other managers to intervene and get those performance evaluations increased above the initial management rating.      Pretext is blatantly shown by Dugway's continued reliance on false and unsupported allegations of sexual harassment when no victim of such harassment exists.  Dugway was asked by this Administrative Law Judge to bring in a complaining witness if Dugway was to continue to assert these allegations against Dr. Hall but Dugway failed to do so.  As already found above, Ms. Carlson does not view the sweater incident as sexual harassment.  [Page 62]     Pretext is also shown in the suspension and recommended revocation of Complainant's security clearance purportedly based on mental health problems based on mental exams that had no legal basis, and diagnoses that were based on biased information pursuant to a procedure that had no basis in law.      Pretext is also shown in threats of termination, allegedly based on late reports when the lateness of those reports was orchestrated as part of the conspiracy against Dr. Hall by Respondent.      Pretext is also shown in taking adverse action against Complainant under circumstances where other employees were not sanctioned or where other employees were  post-hoc , and only after the decision to act against Dr. Hall, treated similarly to Dr. Hall but only as a cover story to avoid the legitimate perception of disparate treatment, and I so find and conclude.      The evidence of retaliatory motive in Dugway's actions against Dr. Hall discussed under the categories above is abundant in the record - both direct and circumstantial evidence.  The case law recognizes each category above as evidence of retaliatory motive.      In terms of direct evidence, the gag order issued by Colonel Kiskowski was a clear direct sign of retaliatory motive and intent to discriminate.  This situation is analogous to the  Migliore  case where this Administrative Law Judge found:     Complainant had previously, and repeatedly, provided information to the EPA critical of Mr. Albro  and the RIDEM program. Such information was used by the EPA in conducting an audit of the RCRA program,  RIDEM's use of federal funds, and served as a basis for PEER's withdrawal petition. Suffice to say, RIDEM  failures, highlighted by complaints to the EPA and others, created a great deal of external pressure and  embarrassment for Mr. Albro and other RIDEM supervisors. I find that because of Complainant's repeated  protected disclosures to the EPA, Mr. Albro and Mr. Szymanski sought to prevent Complainant's contact with  the EPA. Despite the contradictory testimony on the extent of contact to be allowed, RIDEM sought to curtail  Complainant's access to the EPA, and such motivation was an intent to discriminate.     Migliore v. Rhode Island Department of  Environmental Management , 1998-SWD-3, 1999-SWD-1, 1999-SWD-2 (ALJ RDO August 13, 1999).      Respondent Has Not Articulated Legitimate Reasons for its Actions       As in  Migliore  quoted below, Respondent Dugway here has failed to articulate any legitimate non-discriminatory business reason for its actions against Dr. Hall, as a result of the existence of both substantial direct evidence of retaliatory motive and because Dugway's   [Page 63]  actions against Dr. Hall have been based upon and closely interwoven with Dr. Hall's protected activities.  As I ruled in  Migliore :    All of Respondent's purported legitimate, non-  discriminatory business reasons were actually based upon, and closely interwoven with, Complainant's protected  activity. For example, I find that the Respondent's allegation concerning Complainant's insubordination in regard  to her memoranda responses to Mr. Albro, and regarding the charges in CX 41 and CX 42, were actually based  upon, or in response to Complainant's actions where she implicated her protected activity. Further, Director  McLeod's memoranda directing Complainant to respond to his questions and threatening ""corrective  action"" were the direct result of her engaging in protective activity by voicing her concerns about American  Shipyard to both the EPA and PEER. I also find that Mr. Albro and Mr. Szymanski's statements regarding  Complainant's communications with the EPA are actually in response to several EPA investigations of RIDEM,  based on Complainant's protected disclosures. While Respondent cites to Complainant's alleged poor  performance, the delays and conflicts RIDEM relies upon, actually involved the same cases and circumstances  where Complainant was engaging in protected activity. Moreover, the cited delays were actually the result of  micro-managing and obstruction by the Complainant's supervisors. Accordingly, I conclude that the Respondent's propounded ""legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons"" for subjecting Complainant to a one-day suspension, and instances of discrimination and harassment, are actually tainted, as the basis for these  ""legitimate"" reasons was really in retaliation for her engaging in protected activity. I find this situation  closely analogous to  Passaic Valley Sewerage Commissioners v. United States Dep't of Labor ,  992 F.2d 474 (3d Cir.),  cert. denied , 50 U.S. 964 (1993), where the Third Circuit held, where there  was ""no evidence that the Complainant's alleged personality or professional deficiencies [in interpersonal  relations] arose in any other context outside his complaint activity,"" the Respondent's conclusion that the  Complainant had a personality problem or deficiency of interpersonal skills was reducible in essence to the  problems of the inconvenience the Complainant caused by his pattern of complaints.  Id.  at 481;  see also Dodd v. Polysar Latex , 1988-SWD-4 (Sec'y Sept. 22, 1994) (concluding that what respondent  viewed as poor attitude was nothing more than the result and manifestation of the Complainant's protected  activity). I agree that this case presents a situation where all of Respondent's alleged ""legitimate""  reasons are essentially complaints about the inconvenience and difficulties caused by Complainant raising safety concerns. Therefore, I find and conclude that Respondent has failed to produce a legitimate, non-discriminatory  reason for subjecting the Complainant to adverse action, and as a result, Complainant has met her claim for  intentional discrimination and is entitled to damages.     Migliore v. Rhode Island Department of  Environmental Management , 1998-SWD-3, 1999-SWD-1, 1999-SWD-2 (ALJ RDO August 13, 1999).  [Page 64]     While Respondent in the case at bar points to several employees who were disciplined for various reasons, those were proper management reasons for proper administrative and/or personnel reasons.  However, Complainant was treated in a disparate manner and in such an obvious fashion that he was finally forced to leave Dugway to keep his sanity and health.      Respondent also suggests that Dugway did not create or allow a hostile work environment, although due to Complainant's depressed, dysthymic, and/or paranoid type mental disorder, Complainant may have actually believed he was the victim of a hostile work environment.  Respondent also points out that Dr. Hall's psychological and medical problems existed before he became employed at Dugway and therefore were not caused by Dugway.      I agree to a certain extent but I also disagree - - first of all, to be affected by the death of a family cat of 16 years is not unusual, and for Respondent's counsel to imply that that is an unusual stressor simply offends all ""cat-lovers"" in the world.        Furthermore, while Complainant's psychological problems may have been aggravated by his own self-induced stress typically found in a so-called Type A individual, especially one who is a perfectionist, and while non-employment stressors were present in his life, there is absolutely no doubt that Complainant's psychological problems were aggravated, exacerbated and accelerated by the discriminatory, adverse and disparate treatment he received from his supervisors - both military and civilian - and from his co-workers, and I so find and conclude.      While Dr. McCann opined that he ""can see no evidence in the record or in (his) evaluation that Dr. Hall has experienced any type of mental illness or consequences of mental illness which could be caused by the actions of Dugway"" (TR 5141), that opinion refers  ONLY TO DIRECT CAUSATION  and does not rule out the logical inference by this Administrative Law Judge - - who has presided over workers' compensation claims for over twenty-four (24) years - - that the actions of Dugway - through any of its employees - did aggravate, accelerate or exacerbate Dr. Hall's acknowledged pre-existing psychological problems, and I so find and conclude.      While Complainant left Dugway in June of 1997, these stressors - both non-employment and employment-related - have continued because of his worsening health and financial condition and this protracted litigation, litigation, I might add, marked by a vigorous defense.      Thus, I firmly believe that this matter should have been voluntarily resolved years ago - -   However, such did not happen, apparently not to make a peace treaty with ""a traitor,"" to quote that military officer.      According to Respondent, ""The only act that took away his security clearance was his voluntary act of retiring.""  I strongly disagree.  Dr. Hall was forced to retire because of the actions of the Respondent and because Dr. Tedrow recommended that he get out of that environment.  I strongly agree with that medical recommendation of the doctor.  [Page 65]     Respondent was well aware of Dr. Hall's employment history at IBM, Locktite and Webb High School before hiring him.  Thus, Respondent should not be allowed to say now in defense:  ""the bottom line is that Complainant was let go from at least three (actually two) jobs before he came to work at Dugway.""      Yes, Complainant challenged his supervisors and co-workers at Dugway -  I see nothing wrong with this.  Dugway views that as a personality problem, apparently looking only for so-called ""yes men and women"" at that military facility.      I note that Respondent alleges that Complainant's ""anxiety caused him to fight going to trial and delay the hearing for years on end.""  I disagree - - the hearing was delayed several time due to Complainant's multiple medical problems and once due to this Court's budgetary problems and once due to the retirement of my distinguished colleague, Daniel L. Stewart.      I agree that Complainant did have certain interpersonal problems with his relationships with Carol Fruik, Carol Milliken and Ms. Edgeman.  However, I disagree with the statement of Respondent's counsel that Dr. Hall was ""harassing Deanna Carlson for a short time.""  Ms. Carlson did not view that automobile/sweater incident as such - notwithstanding the efforts of others to characterize it as such - Complainant and Ms. Carlson have remained friends to this very day, apparently to the dismay of Respondent.      As already noted above, Respondent cites Deanna Carlson - but she, to this day, has steadfastly refused to lodge a formal complaint against Dr. Hall, despite the urging of certain of the supervisors and the then head of the JAG office to do so - -  As noted, Ms. Carlson and Dr. Hall have remained friendly to this day - not the usual situation wherein one allegedly was the victim of sexual harassment.  Complainant's alleged ""misconduct"" has been greatly exaggerated in an attempt to put Respondent's defense in the best light.  The instances of misconduct cited by Respondent in its reply brief at pages 68-72 are simply examples of steps Dr. Hall found it necessary to take to deal with his personal, family and employment problems.  There is nothing sinister about those steps, especially given the conspiracy against him at Dugway.      While Complainant concedes that he had ""depression"" in his interview with Dr. McCann (TR 8138), that is simply a reflection of the treatment to which Dr. Hall was subjected at Dugway, which treatment aggravated, accelerated, and exacerbated his pre-existing psychological problems, and I so find and conclude.      Furthermore, while Respondent submits that there was ""no involuntary reassignment"" of Dr. Hall to JOD, this record is replete with instances of adverse action taken against Dr. Hall by Dugway because of his protected activities, and while Respondent points out that Complainant's own witnesses were unable to cite any such examples, the answer is simply that Dr. Hall did not get together with these witnesses and rehearse or suggest their testimony in any way. 6     Complainant has proven numerous instances of adverse action and these have been enumerated above.  [Page 66]     Moreover, having to undergo a psychiatric evaluation is an adverse action when the doctor, Dr. Hoffman, giving the evaluation, saw no need for such evaluation.      That these adverse actions, or any of them, may not be grievable under the regulations or union procedures is simply irrelevant.  The test is whether these adverse actions were taken by Respondent in retaliation for protected activities.      While the CCF notified Complainant that his security clearance would be revoked because of his mental condition, I find and conclude that the real reason,  sotto voce , was that he was not a team player, was a whistleblower and had engaged in protected activities virtually from the first day of his employment at Dugway.      Respondent has also tried to justify its actions herein by describing Dr. Hall's performance at Dugway as marginal.  However, such poor work performance is not reflected in the bottom line of his performance appraisals,  i.e. , his actual overall rating.  These performance appraisals lead me to believe that certain of Dr. Hall's supervisors - while engaging in the usual negative rhetoric verbally about him at Dugway and at the trial - refused to reflect that rhetoric in the performance appraisals, written documents that may be used for another purpose - as had happened here,  i.e. , documents in the record that actually support Dr. Hall's case.      Moreover, while Dugway supervisors recorded factual and negative comments in Complainant's performance appraisals, Complainant's alleged performance problems were really due to the requirement by other supervisors that he assist some of his co-workers and by the contradictory demands on his professional time and were, in my judgment, part of the grand conspiracy against Dr. Hall because (1) he was not a ""team player,"" (2) he was a whistleblower and (3) had engaged in protected activities to protect the public interest at that federal facility.      Dugway also submits that it acted properly in maintaining records about Complainant's employment because of this action, which was initiated (four months) before he retired and because Army Regulation 25-400-2 provided for maintaining CPRP records for forty years.  While that statement may be proper, I do have problems with the so-called ""supervisor's file"" because it is this file that was passed from supervisor to supervisor and that contained much negative and obsolete information about Dr. Hall, apparently to keep Dr. Hall's new supervisor up-to-speed about his protected activities and the trouble that he was causing everyone at Dugway.      I note that the Respondent posits that Complainant's allegation that Major General M.G. Aiken called him a traitor was false, and even if it were true, General Aiken had left that Command many years before Complainant allegedly heard of the remark.        I disagree strongly.  I accept Complainant's testimony that that remark was made, especially as I do not credit the one witness who denied making that remark to Dr. hall.  I find and conclude (1) that that remark was made, (2) that that remark reflected the attitude of many others at Dugway, (3) that it was passed on verbally throughout Dugway and (4) that it epitomized the negative attitude manifested against Dr. Hall.  [Page 67]     I note with considerable interest that Respondent did not take the post-hearing deposition of General Aiken.  Cost certainly cannot be a factor, given the plethora of witnesses, documents and evidence produced by the Respondent, especially dealing with such a serious allegation, one that may be slanderous.  Moreover, there is no evidence that General Aiken was unavailable for such deposition.  Thus, I shall draw an adverse inference by his absence herein.      Respondent also attempts to justify its actions herein on the basis of Complainant's substantial history of using mental health professionals for years, and pointing out that his erratic behavior, CCF's and Dugway's Action of Sending Complainant to, or asking him to undergo Mental Health Evaluations, were totally appropriate.  ""Complainant had problems at IBM, Locktite and Webb High School and he lasted at Dugway for 11 years, three years longer than at any other employer.  This tends to indicate that he was treated better at Dugway and that Dugway was more tolerant of his mischief and marginal work productivity, than any other employer.""      I disagree very strongly for the reasons that have already been articulated herein.      Respondent also submits that Dugway had regulatory grounds to temporarily disqualify or administratively terminate Dr. Hall from the CPRP.      I disagree.  Respondent should have worked with Dr. Hall in a positive way and help him to deal with his personal and employment problems in a constructive way.  However, this was not done and this lack of cooperation by the Respondent aggravated, accelerated and exacerbated his problems.      Moreover, when his CPRP was administratively terminated, he was not given notice thereof.  Respondent submits that notice of such termination is not legally required.  That may be so but common sense and common courtesy dictate that at least verbal notice be given to the affected employee.  In this case, Dr. Hall obtained notice thereof embarrassingly when he was denied access while escorting a visitor to the exclusion area.      Respondent also submits that CCF and Dugway had grounds to suspend and recommend revocation of Dr. Hall's security clearance due to his mental health history and the law requiring that the granting of a security clearance must be consistent with the National Security Interest.      I disagree.  Dr. Hall in early 1997 received that notice based on past charges of which he believed he had been cleared, first by the Colonel Cox in the so-called ""clean slate"" letter in October of 1991 (CX 14), and then by subsequent favorable work appraisals and by favorable results in his mental evaluations in the sense that there was no evidence found to warrant his termination.      While Dr. Hall's retirement ended that proceeding, the fact remains that he was forced to retire (1) by the Respondent's conspiracy and (2) upon his Doctor's advice.  Dr. Hall's retirement can hardly be characterized as ""voluntary,"" especially given Dr. Tedrow's medically sound recommendation that Dr. Hall leave behind his employment-related problems.  [Page 68]     According to Respondent, the review of Complainant's Security Clearance and the length of notice given to him complied with Statute, Executive Order, DOD Directive and Army Regulation, and that Dugway used the proper procedures for the actions it took regarding Complainant's security clearance.      That may well be so but the fact remains that the procedure was instituted as part of the conspiracy against Dr. Hall and to get rid of him because he was not a ""team player.""  The fact that Dugway followed proper procedures does not negate the fact that Dr. Hall's employment-related problems were the direct result of the hostile work environment fostered and perpetuated at Dugway by Dr. Hall's supervisors and the compliant co-workers who were part of this conspiracy against Dr. Hall.      Respondent also suggests that Dr. Hall's objection and response to the Intent to Revoke his security clearance did not exhaust his available administrative remedies within the DOD's Office of Hearings and Appeal.      I disagree, because  Sergeant Perry Watkins v. U.S. Army , 875 F.2d 699, 1989 U.S. App. LEXIS 6049 (9th Cir. 1989) is clearly distinguishable as it involves a member of the military service and does not involve a request for hearing under the federal whistleblower statutes.  Moreover, an individual on active duty, unlike Dr. Hall, a civilian employee, is subject to the rules and regulations of the particular branch of service plus the pertinent  Status of Forces Agreement  for transgressions occurring on foreign soil, for instance.      Respondent characterizes Dr. Hall's allegations as absurd and, if his claims are granted, would deny the ability of an agency involved in National Security Work to remove ""a mentally disordered person from the CPRP.""      Initially, I deny that Dr. Hall's allegations are absurd and, second, I hold that the agency's ability must not be exercised in such a way as to frustrate an employee's rights under the whistleblower statutes.  There are many ways by which the agency can protect National Security but the agency, in this case Dugway, must not deny Dr. Hall's rights under the whistleblower statutes.      After ""9/11,"" the rights of whistleblowers have been greatly enhanced and, just recently, President George W. Bush, as our Chief Executive and Commander in Chief, directed all federal employees to bring to the attention of appropriate personnel their ""suspicious"" concerns about safety and, if ignored as were the suspicions of F.B.I. Special Agent Coleen Rowley, to bring those concerns to the Director of Homeland Security and even to the White House, if necessary.  Thus, that constitutes a presidential directive to ignore the chain-of-command if necessary.  Moreover, the cases cited by Respondent are clearly distinguishable as Dr. Hall has neither been charged with nor convicted of any of the offenses found in the cases involving  Gregory Scott  (cocaine use),  Ernest Brazil  66 F.3d 193 (9th Cir. 1995)(involving a Title VII claim of alleged racial discrimination under the provisions of the EEO Act),  Keith Meinhold  (34 F.3d 1469 (9th Cir. 1994)(involving the military's so-called "" DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL "" policy as to the individual's sexual orientation), and  Sandra M. Thompson and George Stout , 884 F.2d 113 (4th Cir. 1989) (refusal to undergo random drug testing).  [Page 69]     According to Respondent, Dr. Hall's claim is without merit and, if granted, would deny a federal agency its statutory right to assign work and require merit performance of that work.      Initially, I deny that Dr. Hall was unwilling to complete his tasks on time.  Moreover, he was unable to complete them timely because of the conspiracy against him, a conspiracy that went from the highest levels of Dugway ( e.g. , Colonel Como ""rubber stamping"" the allegations against Dr. Hall) to Dr. Hall's supervisors and to his compliant, docile and ""team playing"" co-workers.      As I have already found and concluded above, Dr. Hall is an intelligent, honest, dedicated and conscientious chemist who always tried to do his best at Dugway but who was frustrated by his supervisors and certain co-workers, at every opportunity, especially by Christina Wheeler.  Furthermore, that Ms. Wheeler may have been abrasive and caustic to others at Dugway is no defense herein involving allegations of retaliation for having engaged in protected activity under the whistleblower statutes, and I so find and conclude.      Moreover, the disagreement with Dugway is more than ""marginal"" under the whistleblower statutes and retaliation for such protected activity.  One further point:  I find no similarity between Dr. Hall's problems at Dugway and those of Wen Ho Lee, an individual at Los Alamos who pleaded guilty to transferring willfully data he knew could be damaging to the United States.  While General Aiken referred to Dr. Hall as ""a traitor,"" apparently because of his whistleblowing and because he was not a ""team player,"" no such charges have been filed against Dr. Hall, and there has been no hint that any of his actions rose to that level.  If such were the case, Dr. Hall would have been a defendant in another forum.      I also find and conclude that  Ilgenfritz v. U.S. Coast Guard Academy , ARB Case No. 99-066 (August 28, 2001), and the other cases cited by Respondent's counsel in his admirable attempt to defeat this claim, are clearly distinguishable because this record leads ineluctably to the conclusion that Dr. Hall's employment-related problems directly resulted from that conspiracy against him, issues not involved in those proceedings cited by counsel.      On the basis of the totality of this closed record and resolving all doubts in favor of Dr. Hall to effectuate the spirit and purposes of the whistleblower statutes, I find and conclude that Dr. Hall was constructively terminated by Dugway by means of the hostile work environment created at Dugway as part of the conspiracy against him, a conspiracy engendered because of his protected activities that began at Dugway within a few months of his employment.  Dr. Hall was frustrated at every opportunity and he finally was forced to retire upon his doctor's advice.  [Page 70]     While I understand that Respondent's counsel must try to put all events in proper light for his client, I simply cannot agree that this proceeding is simply about an honest ""disagreement with management over environmental issues.""  This case involves the creation of a hostile work environment and a pattern of retaliation over the years because of Dr. Hall's protected activities.      Respondent relies on Complainant's pre-Dugway employment and psychological and psychiatric counseling as one of the reasons to deny the claim filed by Dr. Hall.      Initially, I note that the OSHA investigation is entirely irrelevant and immaterial herein as this is a  de novo  hearing and my decision herein will be based upon my review and analysis of all of the documents in this closed record as fully perfected by the parties.      Complainant's pre-Dugway employment history simply establishes that he is a conscientious and dedicated employee who has always attempted ""to do the right thing.""  He certainly is not a phony or a sycophant who ""goes along to get along"" and who says the ""right things"" in this ""politically correct era"" simply to ingratiate himself with his superiors.      This case is further compounded by the fact that Complainant, a highly-educated professional chemist, is a civilian employee at a military facility and subject to its dogmatic, autocratic and hierarchical structure, and I say this with all due respect to our dedicated people in the U.S. military and coming from one who has spent a total of six (6) years in Army M.I. and who is proud of such service.      Yes.  Complainant did have pre-existing personal, family and psychological problems before going to work for the Respondent in February, 1986.  However, Respondent hired him with full knowledge of these problems because he is, in my judgment, a brilliant chemist whose talents Respondent needed.  It is obvious that Complainant's problems were aggravated and exacerbated by the harassment, discrimination and disparate treatment by the Respondent, almost from day one in 1987.  It is well to keep in mind that an employer takes each employee ""as is"" and with all of our human frailties and the employer will be responsible for the aggravation and exacerbation of such pre-existing problems, and it is no defense for the employer to say that he/she had those problems prior to employment with us and, thus, we are not responsible therefor.  In this regard,  see Wheatley v. Adler , 407 F.2d 307 (D.C. Cir. 1968).      Respondent, in my judgment, should have taken steps to provide Dr. Hall with the time, help and resources that he needed; instead, Respondent discriminated against him, most particularly during the regime of Colonel Kiskowski, and these instances have been thoroughly delineated and discussed above.  It is apparent, even to the cursory reader of these transcripts, that Complainant was a whistleblower, that the Respondent knew about this status, that the Respondent used a number of means to make it difficult for him to do his job to such an extent that finally, as a result of his doctor's advice, he was forced to take an early retirement in June of 1997 to preserve his health, however, four (4) months after filing the complaints herein.  [Page 71]     Respondent makes much of Complainant's interactions with several female employees at Dugway in an attempt to justify the psychological examinations to which Complainant was subjected.  It is apparent to this fact-finder that Complainant, having gone through a tumultuous marriage and an acrimonious divorce, was and still is a lonely person who needs friends and companions and who, in hindsight, perhaps should not have mixed his professional and social life, given the conspiracy against him and the existence of that so-called supervisors' file.  However, he did so and the Respondent is using this aspect of his personality to defeat the claim.  As already noted above, Respondent points to an episode in an automobile when Complainant removed a piece of hair from the sweater - at about upper chest level - of a female passenger, and a female in the back seat - obviously out to get him - yelled out, ""that's sexual harassment.""  However, the alleged victim did not regard it as such and to this day she has yet to file a formal complaint against him.  To this day, Complainant and she remain good friends.  It is ludicrous to allege that he was ""stalking"" women.  He simply wanted and needed friends and companionship.  So much for Complainant's ""problems"" with women.      Moreover, I put little credence in the cards and letter he sent to several women as simply an attempt to inject some levity and humor into his otherwise demanding but lonely professional life.      While Respondent refers to Complainant's memoranda and letters as ""rambling,"" I view those documents as simply written by a person in the so-called ""stream of consciousness"" writing style.  I was able to understand what was written and this again is an attempt by Respondent ""to grasp at straws"" and raise all possible issues against Dr. Hall, hoping that one of the issues will stick.      This case really boils down to the simple fact that there existed at Dugway a conspiracy among virtually all of those who came into contact with the Complainant to get him because he was a whistleblower and one who would not stay within the military chain-of-command because his internal complaints to his superiors were producing no results.      The need for mental examinations is, in my judgment, another specious reason in the trumped-up allegations against Complainant.  While Dugway has the absolute right to maintain and ensure the integrity of the CPRP, it must treat all employees in the program fairly and equally.  As is delineated and discussed above, Complainant was discriminated against in the manner that Dugway operated the program as the exams were simply another way to get him and force him to retire.  In this aspect, Respondent succeeded.      For instance, Complainant was chastised for using government e-mail for personal purposes, but no one else was so similarly reprimanded, at least based on this closed record.      Moreover, I put little credence on the medical evidence presented by Respondent because, in my judgment, it is all part of this conspiracy against the Complainant and, if Respondent really believed that evidence, it should have immediately removed him from the CPRP permanently and taken steps to terminate him as an employee years ago.  However, the Respondent did not do so and I infer this is because the evidence was so flimsy and would not justify a termination.  [Page 72]     I place greater weight on the opinions of Dr. Christie and Dr. Tedrow who have seen and evaluated Complainant for many years and are in a better position to render well-documented and well-reasoned opinions, and they have done so herein.      I agree that Complainant does have psychological problems but they did not affect his professional work, as long as Respondent gave him reasonable assignments and reasonable deadlines.  However, Respondent did not do so and took a series of actions against him to delay his work and to make it difficult for him to remain at Dugway.      With reference to the change of the chemical surety regulations and the requirement for reinvestigation of security clearances every five (5) years, this was a hotly contested issue and produced conflicting testimony as to what that regulation required and when it was required.  This was also handled in a disparate manner vis-a-vis Complainant.  Initially, others were given additional time to complete their applications.  Several did not even return their applications.  Complainant was not given that opportunity.  (CX 1)  Furthermore, I agree with Complainant and Mr. Bowcutt that Dugway misinterpreted the rule with reference to those employees who had not had a break in service since issuance of their current clearances.      As I have already noted above, I am also concerned that (1) Complainant was administratively terminated from the CPRP on July 9, 1996 by Dr. Dement, (2) was not told of such termination by anyone at Dugway and (3) he did not find out about it until several months later when he was denied entrance into a chemical exclusion area.  Such lack of notice, in my judgment, is another act of blatant disparate treatment and I reject Respondent's argument that the regulation does not require such notice, because common courtesy and common sense require such notice so that the person affected can take proper steps to protect his/her rights in close proximity to the administrative termination.      With reference to the June, 1996 DIS investigation of the Complainant, the investigator talked to numerous individuals at Dugway but did not talk to Dr. Hall to get his version of the stories these individuals were telling the investigator.  A blatant lack of due process and another example of disparate treatment, and I so find and conclude.      With reference to the CCF request that Complainant undergo a mental evaluation, that was completed and on January 7, 1997  Complainant was notified that CCF intended to revoke his security clearance.  However, on February 13, 1997 he filed his DOL complaint herein and on May 21, 1997 he announced that he was seeking an early retirement, effective as of June 12, 1997, based on the advice of his doctors, especially Dr. Tedrow who has opined that Complainant suffers from post-traumatic stress syndrome, a diagnosis that I accept as reasonable and well-documented.      As noted above, a number of continuances were granted herein because of Complainant's medical condition and the trial began on June 7, 2001 and while discovery herein may have been initially delayed by these continuances, once the matter was assigned to this Judge, I advised the parties that discovery was an on-going issue herein and that discovery would be permitted until the close of the record herein on May 28, 2002.  Thus, as Complainant learned through recently furnished evidence of new allegations against him, this required that Complainant add additional elements to the theory of his case.  There has been no prejudice against Respondent because both sides were given every opportunity to follow-up every lead and to present additional documentation in support of their respective positions as long as the evidence was relevant, material and not unduly cumulative.  [Page 73]     Respondent submits that ""there were around twenty (or thirty?) direct conflicts between the testimony of the Complainant and Respondent's witnesses.""  (RX A at 115-129)  I disagree as I find Dr. Hall to be an honest, conscientious and dedicated individual who testified most credibly before me.  I have credited his version of these alleged ""conflicts"" and any confusion is obviously due to the passage of time and Dr. Hall's medical condition.  These whistleblower cases, in the absence of the ""smoking gun,"" are determined by circumstantial evidence and the evaluation of the credibility of the witnesses, as I have already discussed above.      I also find and conclude that Respondent's hiring in June of 2001 of Gary Millar, an acknowledged whistleblower, does not defeat this claim for the obvious reason that not hiring an individual for a position where there is a vacancy and for which the person is obviously qualified may constitute so-called ""black-balling"" where the refusal to hire was motivated primarily by his/her protected activity.  If such had occurred, Dugway could very well have been a Respondent in another proceeding before one of my colleagues.      In summary, I find and conclude that Complainant raised a great deal of concerns over the procedures and policies at Dugway.  His actions were the source of a great deal of pressure for Dugway management from the Utah state agency.  Further, Dugway has been severely criticized and embarrassed by Complainant's protected activity.  As a result, I find and conclude that Respondent has clearly, continuously and illegally discriminated against Complainant through harassment, disciplinary procedures and outright threats.  Accordingly, I find and conclude that all of Respondent's purported, legitimate reasons for taking adverse actions against Complainant are, in fact, pretext.  Complainant has met his burden of proving that Respondent has intentionally discriminated against him for engaging in protected activity concerning the proper enforcement of the Acts involved herein.  As such, Complainant is entitled to an award of damages.      This Judge, having found the Respondent in violation of the aforementioned whistleblower statutes, will issue a recommendation on damages to be awarded to Complainant. Complainant requests front pay, back pay, compensatory damages, equitable relief, and attorney fees and costs.    IV. DAMAGES AND RELIEF SOUGHT        A. GENERAL DISCUSSION       As I have already held in other decisions, the environmental statutes provide liberally for an award of damages sufficient to place the employee in the position they would have   [Page 74]  been absent the retaliation.  Thus, it is well to keep in mind certain well-settled principles.    Section 507(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA), 33 U.S.C. Sec. 1367(b), provides in pertinent part: ""If [the Secretary] finds that ... a violation did occur, he shall issue a decision, incorporating an order therein and his findings, requiring the party committing such violation to take such affirmative action to abate the violation as the Secretary of Labor deems appropriate[.]"" ""Affirmative action to abate [a] violation"" of an environmental whistleblower statute, such as Sec. 507(a), includes retroactive promotion into a position the discriminatee would occupy but for the discrimination.  See Thomas v. Arizona Public Svs. Co. , No. 89-ERA-19, slip op. at 13 (Sec'y Sept. 17, 1993). ""Making a victim whole ... include[s] his reinstatement to the position he would have held but for the discrimination.""  Lander , 888 F.2d at 156;  see also Malarkey v. Texaco, Inc. , 983 F.2d 1204, 1214 (2d Cir. 1993).     Cases under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,  as amended , 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-5, have guided the Secretary and the Administrative Review Board (ARB) in fashioning remedies appropriate to abate violations.  Hobby v. Georgia Power Co. , No. 90-ERA-30, slip op. at 15 (ARB Feb. 9, 2001). Like the remedies under Title VII, those available under the environmental whistleblower laws serve a twofold purpose. First, they are intended to make the complainant whole by placing him, ""as near as may be, in the situation he would have occupied if the wrong had not been committed.""  Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody , 422 U.S. 405, 418-19 (1975). Second, they must ""so far as possible eliminate the discriminatory effects of the past  as well as bar like discrimination in the future.""   Id.  at 418,  quoted in Hobby  at 7 (ARB's emphasis). This goes beyond the interest of employees in protection from discrimination. It also serves the public interest in assuring exposure of threats to public health and safety, such as the discharge of sewage into streams, rivers and lakes.  See Beliveau v. DOL , 170 F.3d 83, 88 (1st Cir. 1999).     Moder v. Village of Jackson, Wisconsin , 2000-WPC-0005 (ALJ Aug. 10, 2001).        Back pay is clearly provided for:    The ""goal of back pay is to make the victim of discrimination whole and restore him  [or her] to the position that he [or she] would have occupied in the absence of the unlawful discrimination.""  Blackburn v. Martin , 982 F.2d 125, 128 (4th Cir. 1992).  Also See Creekmore v.  ABB Power Sys. Energy Servs., Inc. , 1993-ERA-24 (Dep. Sec'y Feb. 14, 1996) .     Complainant is correct to note that  any uncertainties with regard to the amount of back pay are to be resolved against the discriminating party.  McCafferty v. Centerior Energy , 1996-ERA-6 (ARB Sept. 24, 1997).   [Page 75]    The award of back pay effectuates the remedial statutory purpose of making whole the victims of discrimination, and ""unrealistic exactitude is not required"" in calculating back pay and ""uncertainties in determining what an employee would have earned but for the discrimination, should be resolved against the discriminating [party].""  EEOC v. Enterprise Ass'n Steamfitters Local No. 6348 , 542 F.2d 579, 587 (2d Cir. 1976),  Steamfitters Local No. 6348 , 542 F.2d 579, 587 (2d Cir. 1976),  cert. denied , 430 U.S. 911 (1977),  quoting Hairston v. McLean Trucking Co. , 520 F.2d 226, 233 (4th Cir. 1975). Initially, the Complainant bears the burden of establishing the amount of back pay that a respondent owes.  Adams v. Coastal Production Operation, Inc. , 89- ERA-3 (Sec'y Aug. 5, 1992). Once the Complainant establishes the gross amount of back pay due, the burden shifts to the Respondent to prove facts which would mitigate that liability.   Lederhaus v. Donald Paschen & Midwest Inspection Service Ltd.,  92-ERA-13 (Sec'y Oct. 26, 1992), slip. op. at 9-10;  Moody v. T.V.A. , Dept of Labor Decisions, Vol. 7, No. 3, p. 68 (1993).       Creekmore v. ABB Power Systems Energy Services, Inc. , 93-ERA-24 (ALJ Sept. 1, 1994).      It is appropriate to review other types of wrongful termination cases, as well as awards in other whistleblower decisions involving emotional distress, to assist in the analysis of the appropriate measure of compensatory damages in a whistleblower case.  Accordingly, this is precisely what this Judge has done.   See   Crow v. Noble Roman's, Inc. , 1995-CAA-8 (Sec'y Feb. 26, 1996)(approving an award of $10,000.00 in compensatory damages); 7     Creekmore v. ABB Power Sys. Energy Servs., Inc. , 1993-ERA-24 (Dep. Sec'y Feb. 14, 1996) (wherein the Deputy Secretary upheld this ALJ's recommendation of $40,000.00 in compensatory damages); 8     Gaballa v. Atlantic Group, Inc. , 1994- ERA-9 (Sec'y Jan. 18, 1996)(wherein the Secretary reduced the ALJ's recommended compensatory damage award from $75,000.00 to $25,000.00); 9     Smith v. Littenberg , 992-ERA-52 (Sec'y Sept. 6, 1995) (wherein the Secretary affirmed the ALJ's award of $10,000.00); 10     Blackburn v. Metric Constructors, Inc. , 86-ERA-4 (Sec'y Aug. 16, 1993) (wherein the Secretary reduced the ALJ's recommended award of compensatory damages to $5,000.00); 11     Lederhaus v. Paschen , 1991-ERA-13 (Sec'y Oct. 26, 1992) (wherein the Secretary reduced the compensatory award from a recommended amount of $20,000.00 to $10,000.00); 12     McCuistion v. Tennessee Valley Auth. , 1989-ERA-6 (Sec'y Nov. 13, 1991) (wherein the Secretary increased compensatory damages from the ALJ's recommended award of $0.00 to $10,000.00); 13     Martin v. The Department of Army , 1993-SDW-1 (ARB July 30, 1999) (wherein the ARB awarded $75,000.00 in compensatory damages for emotional distress); 14     Jones v. EG&G Defense Materials, Inc. , 1995-CAA-3 (ARB Sept. 29, 1998) (wherein Board adopted ALJ's award of $50,000.00); 15     Smith v. Esicorp, Inc. , 1993-ERA-16 (ARB Aug. 27, 1998) (wherein   [Page 76]  the Board reduced the ALJ's recommendation of $100,000.00 in compensatory damages to $20,000.00); 16     Michaud v. BSP Transport, Inc. , 1995-STA-29 (ARB Oct. 9, 1997) (wherein the Board approved an award of $75,000.00 in compensatory damages); 17     Doyle v. Hydro Nuclear Services , 1989-ERA-22 (ARB Sept. 6, 1996) (wherein the Board affirmed the ALJ's recommendation of $40,000 compensatory damages); 18     Bigham v. Guaranteed Overnight Delivery , 1995-STA-37 (ALJ May, 8, 1996) (adopted by ARB Sept. 5, 1996) (wherein the Board increased the ALJ's award of compensatory damages from $2,500 to $20,000 after reviewing the observations and accounts of complainant's emotional distress); 19     Sayre v. Alyeska Pipeline , 1997-TSC-6 (ALJ May 8, 1999)(wherein ALJ awarded $10,000.00 in compensatory damages); 20     Leveille v. New York Air Nat'l Guard , 1994-TSC-3/4 (ALJ Feb. 9, 1998)(wherein ALJ awarded over $80,000.00 in compensatory damages based upon past and future emotional stress, past and future medical expenses, and damage to professional reputation); 21     Berkman v. United States Coast Guard Academy , 1997-CAA-2/9 (ALJ Jan. 2, 1998)(wherein the ALJ awarded $70,000.00 in compensatory damages). 22         In  Van Der Meer v. Western Kentucky Univ. , 1995-ERA-38 (ARB Apr. 20, 1998), the complainant suffered little out-of-pocket loss: he lost no salary as a result of the leave of absence and there was no evidence of uncompensated medical costs. Other losses were non-quantifiable. The complainant, however, was awarded $40,000 in compensatory damages because the respondent took extraordinary and very public action against the complainant which surely had a negative impact on complainant's reputation among the students, faculty and staff at the school, and more generally in the local community; complainant was   subjected to additional stress by the respondent's failure to follow the conciliatory procedures contained in its handbook and complainant testified that he felt humiliated.      In  Smith v. Esicorp, Inc. , 1993-ERA-16 (ARB Aug. 27, 1998), the ARB noted that, ""The severity of the retaliation suffered by [a complainant] is also relevant to our determination of appropriate compensatory damages. The courts have held that the more inherently humiliating and degrading the defendant's action, the more reasonable it is to infer that a person would suffer emotional distress, and the more conclusory the evidence of emotional distress may be.""   Id.  ( citing   United States v. Balistrieri , 981 F.2d 916, 932 (7th Cir. 1993)).      With these principles in mind, I will now consider the awards sought by Dr. Hall.  [Page 77]       B. BACK PAY       With reference to the general issue of damages that may be awarded herein, Respondent submits, perhaps tongue-in-cheek, that ""it is important to note that (Dr. Hall) was not fired.  He was not demoted.  He was not even disciplined.  He merely retired.  He has suffered none of the usual indicia of retaliation.  The stress he complains of is most closely related to the fact that he was unable to complete timely his work assignment.""      However, this closed record lends me to conclude otherwise, and I have already made these findings and conclusions above, based upon my interpretation of the evidence and based upon my conclusion that Dr. Hall is a credible witness and that any confusion as to the sequence of events is simply due to the passage of time and cumulative effects of the conspiracy against him at Dugway.      With reference to back pay, Dr. Hall seeks the following amounts calculated in this manner:      Dr. Hall's salary lost from 1996 to the end of 2001, estimated conservatively by presuming no appraisals above ""fully successful"" would have been received , and based on 1996 and 1997 earnings and leave statements, CX 127, RX 125, with cost of living adjustments approximately as shown on those statements, and including one GS-12 step increase that would have occurred during this period, would be as follows:        [ Year ]   [ Amount ]     1996:   $13,500.00    1997:   $44,919.00    1998:   $58,000.00    1999:   $60,000.00    2000:   $62,500.00      2001:   $65,000.00      2002 (first half):   $32,500.00          Total:   $336,419.00           Note that in the amounts above Dr. Hall's current retirement income of approximately $17,000 per year total has not been subtracted from the back pay amount requested above, for a reason.  Dr. Hall is requesting the option of paying back the prior retirement and social security payments from the full back pay amounts to allow full reinstatement of Dr. Hall's retirement and social security accounts so that he can be placed back in the position he would have been in regarding retirement and social security.  I agree as this request is most reasonable to restore Dr. Hall to the  status quo ante .  [Page 78]     According to the Respondent, Dr. Hall's estimate is grossly exaggerated and assumes that he could work full-time, 40 hours per week.  Also, Dr. Hall has not subtracted his post-Dugway income.      However, I disagree because but for the actions of the Respondent and the conspiracy against him, Dr. Hall would have been able to work full-time and with the usual accommodations made to an employee by an employer who acts in good faith and is not motivated to retaliate because of protected activities.      Moreover, I find and conclude that Dr. Hall's earning in his last six-to-twelve months at Dugway are not representative of his wage-earning capacity because that is the period during which the full effects of the conspiracy became manifest, thereby resulting in his constructive termination by Respondent.       Respondent also submits that six years back pay is excessive and it should be three years, or until his 65th birthday.      No.  I disagree - six years is reasonable and proper, especially as the federal government no longer has a mandatory retirement age, except for airline pilots, those in law enforcement and certain other specialized groups.      While Respondent posits that Dr. Hall has made no attempt to mitigate his damages, I disagree.  Dr. Hall has looked for work but to no avail, partly because of the way that he was traumatized at Dugway by that conspiracy.      The ""goal of back pay is to make the victim of discrimination whole and restore him [or her] to the position that he [or she] would have occupied in the absence of the unlawful discrimination.""  Blackburn v. Martin , 982 F.2d 125, 128 (4th Cir. 1992).       Complainant asserts that his request of $336,419.00 is based upon a straightforward calculation of the number of work days missed as a proximate result of Respondent's discriminatory conduct as a percentage of his annual salary.  Complainant is correct to note that any uncertainties with regard to the amount of back pay are to be resolved against the discriminating party.  McCafferty v. Centerior Energy , 1996-ERA-6 (ARB Sept. 24, 1997).      Thus, based upon the totality of the record herein, I find and conclude that Complainant is entitled to an award of back pay totaling $336,419.00 as the methodology that he has used to establish that amount of reasonable and appropriate and in line with other cases under the Acts involved herein.  I note that Dr. Hall has agreed to pay back ""the prior retirement and social security payments from these back pay amounts to allow full reinstatement of Dr. Hall's retirement and social security accounts so that he can be placed back in the position he would have been in regarding retirement and social security.""  (CX A at pages 37-38)  [Page 79]       C. OTHER DAMAGES           1.Compensatory Damages       As already  noted above, compensatory damages sufficient to make the employee whole are provided for as well:    The environmental statues, by authorizing an award of compensatory damages, have created a ""species of tort liability"" in favor of persons who are the objects of unlawful retaliation. Compensatory damages are designed to compensate complainants not only for direct pecuniary loss, but also for such harm as impairment of reputation, personal humiliation, and mental anguish and suffering.  Martin v. Dep't of the Army , ARB Case No. 96-131, ALJ Case No. 96-131, ARB Dec. and Ord. (July 30, 1999) WL 702416 at *13,  citing Memphis Community Sch. Dist, v. Stachura , 477 U.S. 299, 305-307 (1986). ...     It is well-settled that expert medical evidence is not necessary to award compensatory damages for emotional distress.  A complainant's credible testimony by itself is sufficient for this judge to find and conclude that emotional distress has resulted from a persistent pattern of retaliatory action and to award damages.   Jones v. EG&G Def. Materials Inc. , ARB Case No. 97-129, ALJ Case No. 95-CAA-3 (ARB Sept. 29, 1998).  In  Jones , the testimony of the complainant alone was sufficient to sustain a $50,000 award for emotional distress. Similarly, complainant's testimony was sufficient to sustain a $20,000 emotional distress award in  Assist.  Secretary of Labor for Occup. Safety & Healthy, Guaranteed Overnight Delivery , ARB Case No. 96-108, ALJ Case No. 95-STA-37 (Sept. 5, 1996).     Anderson v. Metro Wastewater Reclamation District , ARB No.: 98-087, Case No.: 1997-SDW-7 (ALJ RDO Sept. 18, 2001).      As I held in another decision:    The general rule is that a wrongdoer is liable to the person injured in compensatory damages for all of the natural and direct or proximate consequences of his wrongful act or omission but he is not responsible for the remote consequences of his wrongful act or omission.  Natural consequences are such as might reasonably have been foreseen, such as occur in an ordinary state of things.  Thus, it is often said, if according to the usual experience of mankind the result was to be expected, it is not too remote.  [Page 80]  An act or omission is the proximate cause of a loss where there is no intervening, independent, culpable and controlling cause severing the connection between the wrongful act or omission and the claimed loss.  Thus, an intermediate cause which, disconnected from the primary act or omission, produces the injury or loss will be regarded as the proximate cause.  It is sufficient if it is established that the defendant's act produced or set in motion other agencies, which in turn produced or contributed to the final result.  Moreover, although an act of the plaintiff has intervened between defendant's wrong and the injury suffered, the defendant is not thereby excused if the intervening act was the result of or was naturally and reasonably induced by his earlier wrong.  While the plaintiff is not entitled to recover damages for conditions which are due entirely to a previous disease, the defendant may be liable for damages if his wrongful act aggravated or exacerbated such disease or impairment of health.  Thus, the wrongdoer is not exonerated from liability if, by reason of some pre-existing condition, his victim is more susceptible to injury and the plaintiff may recover such damages as proximately result from the activation or aggravation of a dormant disease or condition.  Heart disease was recognized as a pre-existing condition in  Firkol v. A.R. Glen Corp. , 223 F. Supp. 163 (D.C.N.J. 1963).  As between an innocent and a wrongful cause, the law uniformly regards the latter as the proximate and legally responsible cause.  It is also well-settled that damages which are uncertain, contingent or speculative in their nature cannot be recovered as compensatory damages.  Where a cause of action is complete and no subsequent action may be maintained, a recovery may be had for prospective and anticipated damages reasonably certain to accrue.  Thus, damages are not restricted to the period ending with the institution of the suit and where it is established that there will be future effects sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the wrongful act or injury, damages for such effects may be awarded.     Creekmore v. ABB Power Systems Energy Services, Inc. , 93-ERA-24 (ALJ Sept. 1, 1994).    Compensatory damages may be awarded for emotional pain and suffering, mental anguish, embarrassment and humiliation.   See generally DeFord v. Secretary of Labor , 700 F.2d 281, 283 (6th Cir. 1983)(decided pursuant to the ERA);  Nolan v. AC Express , 1992-STA-37 (Sec'y Jan. 17, 1995)(decided pursuant to an analogous provision of the STA).  Where appropriate, a complainant may recover an award for emotional distress when his or her mental anguish is the proximate result of respondent's unlawful  discriminatory conduct.   See   Bigham v. Guaranteed Overnight Delivery , 1995-STA-37  (ALJ May, 8, 1996) (adopted by ARB Sept. 5, 1996);  Crow v. Noble Roman's Inc. , 1995-CAA-8  (Sec'y Feb. 26, 1996).   See also Blackburn v. Metric Constructors, Inc. , 1986-ERA-4 (Sec'y  Oct. 30, 1991).     Complainant bears the burden of proving the existence and magnitude of any such injuries; although, as a caveat, it should be noted that medical or psychiatric expert testimony on this point is not required.   Crow v. Noble Roman's, Inc. , 1995-CAA-8 (Sec'y Feb. 26, 1996);  Lederhaus v.  Paschen , 1991-ERA-13 (Sec'y Oct. 26, 1992);  Jones v. EG&G Defense Materials, Inc. ,  1995-CAA-3 (ARB Sept. 29, 1998).    [Page 81]     As I have also noted above, it is appropriate to review other types of wrongful termination cases, as well as awards in other whistleblower decisions involving emotional distress, to assist in the analysis of the appropriate measure of compensatory damages in a whistleblower case.  Accordingly, this is precisely what this Judge has done.   See   Crow v. Noble Roman's, Inc. , 1995-CAA-8 (Sec'y Feb. 26, 1996)(approving an award of $10,000.00 in compensatory damages); 23     Creekmore v. ABB Power Sys. Energy Servs., Inc. , 1993-ERA-24 (Dep.

FLENTJE  Attorneys  Department of Justice  Washington, D.C. 20530-0001  (202) 514-2217    QUESTION PRESENTED    Sections 1712 and 1721(b) of the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA), Pub. L. No. 106-554, Div. B, Tit. XVII, 114 Stat. 2763A-335, provide that a library that is otherwise eligible for special federal assistance for Internet access and related services in the form of discount rates for educational purposes under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 47 U.S.C. 254(h), or grants under the Library Services and Technology Act, 20 U.S.C. 9121 et seq., may not receive that assistance unless the library has a policy that includes the operation of a ""technology protection measure"" on Internet-connected computers that protects against access by all persons to ""visual depictions"" that are ""obscene"" or ""child pornography,"" and that protects against access by minors to ""visual depictions"" that are ""harmful to minors."" 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(6)(B)-(C); 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(1).    The question presented is whether Sections 1712 and 1721(b) of CIPA induce public libraries to violate the First Amendment, thereby exceeding Congress's power under the Spending Clause.

In the Supreme Court of the United States    No. 02-361    UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ET AL., APPELLANTS    v.    AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION, INC., ET AL.    ON APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA      BRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES    OPINION BELOW    The opinion of the district court (J.S. App. 1a-191a) is reported at 201 F. Supp. 2d 401.    JURISDICTION    The judgment of the district court was entered on May 31, 2002. A notice of appeal (J.S. App. 209a-211a) was filed on June 20, 2002. The jurisdiction of this Court rests on Section 1741(b) of the Children's Internet Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 106-554, Div. B, Tit. XVII, 114 Stat. 2763A-352, and 28 U.S.C. 1253.    CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY  PROVISIONS INVOLVED      Article 1, Section 8 of the United States Constitution provides that ""[t]he Congress shall have Power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts, and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States."" The First Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that ""Congress shall make no law * * * abridging the freedom of speech."" The pertinent provisions of the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA), Pub. L. No. 106-554, Div. B, Tit. XVII, 114 Stat. 2763A-335, the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 47 U.S.C. 254(h), and the Library Services and Technology Act, 20 U.S.C. 9121, 9122, 9133, 9134, and 9141, are reproduced in an appendix to the jurisdictional statement. J.S. App. 192a-208a.    STATEMENT    1. a. Congress provides federal assistance to public libraries for Internet access pursuant to two statutory programs. Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, qualifying libraries, including public libraries, elementary school libraries, and secondary school libraries, are entitled to purchase Internet access and related services for educational purposes from telecommunications providers at discounted rates (E-rates). 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(1)(B). Discounts under the E-Rate program reduce the cost of Internet access and related services by 20% to 90%, depending on the extent of economic disadvantage in a particular location. See 47 C.F.R. 54.505. For the year ending June 30, 2002, libraries received $58.5 million in E-rate discounts. Jt. Trial Stip. para. 128. The E-rate program is administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company under the supervision of the Federal Communications Commission. 47 C.F.R. 54.701, 54.702.    Public libraries also receive federal assistance under the Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA), 20 U.S.C. 9121 et seq., which was enacted, inter alia, ""to stimulate excellence and promote access to learning and information resources"" in libraries. 20 U.S.C. 9121(1). Pursuant to LSTA, the Institute of Museum and Library Services makes grants to state library administrative agencies that have approved plans. See 20 U.S.C. 9133, 9134, 9141. Those grants may be used for, inter alia, ""electronically linking libraries with educational, social, or information services,"" ""assisting libraries in accessing information through electronic networks,"" and ""paying costs for libraries to acquire or share computer systems and telecommunications technologies."" 20 U.S.C. 9141(a)(1)(B) and (E). In fiscal year 2002, Congress appropriated more than $149 million in LSTA grants for state library agencies. Jt. Trial Stip. para. 185.    b. Aided by the E-rate and LSTA programs, libraries have increasingly provided their patrons with access to information from the Internet. By 2000, 95% of the nation's libraries had connected to the Internet. J.S. App. 36a. By connecting to the Internet, public libraries can provide their patrons with a vast amount of valuable information. But there is also an enormous amount of pornography on the Internet, much of which can be obtained for free using any search engine. Id. at 30a-31a. Some pornographic Web sites use innocuous names, such as www.whitehouse.com, increasing the likelihood that the site will be reached accidentally. Id. at 31a. Many other pornographic sites attach pop-up windows that make it difficult to escape the site. Ibid.    The availability of pornography on the Internet has created a serious problem for libraries. Libraries have found that patrons of all ages, including minors, regularly search for online pornography. J.S. App. 2a. Some patrons leave pornographic images on an Internet terminal so that the next user is immediately exposed to them. Id. at 38a. Others leave printed pornographic images at the library printer. Ibid. Still others engage in inappropriate conduct. Id. at 146a.    To address the problems associated with online pornography, many public libraries have installed filtering software that blocks access to pornographic sites. J.S. App. 45a. Almost 17% of public libraries use filtering software on at least some of their Internet-connected computers, and 7% have filters on all of their computers. Library Research Center, Univ. of Ill. Grad. Sch. of Lib. & Info. Sci., Survey of Internet Access Management in Public Libraries (June 2000) (PX 38); J.S. App. 3a. A library that uses filtering software can set it to block categories of material, such as ""Pornography."" Id. at 50a. When a patron attempts to obtain access to a site falling within such a category, a screen appears that indicates that a block has occurred. Id. at 52a. A filter set to block a category such as ""Pornography"" may sometimes block other sites as well. To minimize that problem, a library can set its filtering software to prevent blocking material that falls into categories such as ""Education,"" ""History,"" ""Medical,"" and ""Text/Spoken Only."" PX 66C, at 7-8. A library also has the flexibility to add or delete specific sites from a blocking category. J.S. App. 52a. Anyone, including Web site owners, can ask companies that furnish filtering software to unblock particular sites. Id. at 53a.    c. The problems associated with the availability of online pornography at public libraries also came to Congress's attention. Congress became concerned that the Internet assistance it was providing to libraries for educational and informational purposes was facilitating access to illegal and harmful pornography. S. Rep. No. 226, 105th Cong., 2d Sess. 5 (1998). The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation held a hearing to examine the problem. The Children's Internet Protection Act: Hearing on S.97 Before the Senate Comm. on Commerce, Science and Transportation, 106th Cong., 1st Sess. 1 (1999). During that hearing, the Committee heard testimony that adults ""us[e] library computers to access pornography that are then exposed to staff, passersby and children,"" and that ""minors also access[] child and adult pornography in libraries."" Id. at 49 (prepared statement of Bruce Taylor). The Committee also heard testimony that improved filtering products could provide a reasonably effective way to prevent access to illegal and harmful pornography. Id. at 20-26.    The House Subcommittee on Telecommunications, Trade, and Consumer Protection of the House Commerce Committee also held a hearing on the problems related to online obscenity. Obscene Material Available Via The Internet: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Telecommunications, Trade and Consumer Protection of the House Comm. on Commerce, 106th Cong., 2d Sess. 1 (2000). At that hearing, the Committee received a report that documented more than 2000 incidents of patrons, including both adults and minors, using library computers to view online pornography, including obscenity and child pornography. Id. at 27. See J.A. 478-549 (David Burt, Dangerous Access, 2000 Edition: Uncovering Internet Pornography in America's Libraries (2000) (GX 8)).    d. To address the problems associated with the availability of online pornography at libraries, Congress enacted the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA), Pub. L. No. 106-554, Div. B, Tit. XVII, 114 Stat. 2763A-335. Sections 1712 and 1721(b) of CIPA provide that a library may not receive assistance for Internet access and related services under the E-rate or LSTA program, unless it has ""a policy of Internet safety that includes the operation of a technology protection measure that protects against access"" by all persons to ""visual depictions"" that are ""obscene"" or ""child pornography,"" and that protects against access by minors to ""visual depictions"" that are ""harmful to minors."" 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(1)(A)(i) and (B)(i); 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(6)(B)(i) and (C)(i).1 A ""technology protection measure"" is defined as ""a specific technology that blocks or filters Internet access to material covered by"" CIPA. 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(7)(I).2    CIPA permits the library to ""disable"" the technology protection measure ""to enable access for bona fide research or other lawful purposes."" 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(3); 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(6)(D). Under the E-Rate program, disabling is permitted ""during use by an adult."" 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(6)(D). Under the LSTA program, disabling is permitted during use by any person. 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(3).    2. A group of libraries, library associations, library patrons, and web site publishers (appellees) filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against the United States and the government agencies and officials responsible for administering the E-rate and LSTA programs, challenging the constitutionality of CIPA's filtering provisions. J.S. App. 5a. Appellees alleged that the provisions of CIPA that apply to public libraries are facially unconstitutional because they induce public libraries to violate their patrons' First Amendment rights. Ibid. Appellees also alleged that CIPA imposes an unconstitutional condition on the receipt of federal assistance, imposes an impermissible prior restraint on speech, and is unconstitutionally vague. Id. at 5a & n.1. Pursuant to Section 1741(a) of CIPA, a three-judge district court was convened. J.S. App. 6a.    After a trial, the district court held that CIPA is facially unconstitutional because it induces public libraries to violate the First Amendment rights of their patrons. J.S. App. 13a. The court accordingly enjoined the government agencies and officials responsible for administering the E-Rate and LSTA programs from withholding federal assistance for Internet access or related services from any public library for failure to comply with CIPA. Id. at 191a.    The district court analyzed the constitutionality of CIPA under the framework for Spending Clause legislation set forth in South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207-210 (1987). J.S. App. 95a. Under that decision, Congress may not use its spending power ""to induce the States to engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional."" Dole, 483 U.S. at 210. The district court held that CIPA is facially unconstitutional under Dole, because, in the court's view, ""any public library that complies with CIPA's conditions will necessarily violate the First Amendment."" J.S. App. 102a.    The district court acknowledged that ""generally the First Amendment subjects libraries' content-based decisions about which print materials to acquire for their collections to only rational [basis] review."" J.S. App. 120a. But the court refused to apply that same constitutional analysis to libraries' content-based decisions regarding material they acquire from the Internet. Id. at 121a. ""The central difference,"" the court stated, ""is that by providing patrons with even filtered Internet access, the library permits patrons to receive speech on a virtually unlimited number of topics, from a virtually unlimited number of speakers, without attempting to restrict patrons' access to speech that the library, in the exercise of its professional judgment, determines to be particularly valuable."" Ibid. The court was therefore ""satisfied that when the government provides Internet access in a public library,"" it has created a ""designated public forum."" Id. at 109a.    The district court next held that a public library's content- based restrictions on access to that ""forum"" trigger strict scrutiny. J.S. App. 128a. Based on its analysis of this Court's public forum and government subsidy decisions, id. at 127a-128a, the district court concluded that ""where a public library opens a forum to an unlimited number of speakers around the world to speak on an unlimited number of topics, strict scrutiny applies to the library's selective exclusions of particular speech whose content the library disfavors."" Id. at 128a. The court also concluded that strict scrutiny is applicable based on its understanding that a library's provision of Internet access ""promotes First Amendment values in an analogous manner to traditional public fora, such as sidewalks and parks."" Ibid.    Applying strict scrutiny, the district court held that the government has a compelling interest ""in preventing the dissemination of obscenity, child pornography, or, in the case of minors, material that is harmful to minors."" J.S. App. 139a. The court also concluded that, in certain circumstances, ""a public library might have a compelling interest in protecting library patrons and staff from unwilling exposure to sexually explicit speech that, although not obscene, is patently offensive."" Id. at 146a. Furthermore, the court found that ""[t]he volume of pornography on the Internet is huge,"" that ""library patrons of all ages, many from 11 to 15, have regularly sought to access it in public library settings,"" id. at 2a, and that ""software filters provide a relatively cheap and effective, albeit imperfect, means for public libraries to prevent patrons from accessing speech that falls within the filters' category definitions,"" id. at 90a-91a.    The district court nonetheless held that a public library's use of software filters to prevent access to illegal and harmful material is not narrowly tailored to further the government's interests. J.S. App. 149a. The court found that because of the limits of technology, filters set to prevent access to illegal and harmful pornography also restrict ""many thousands of Web pages that are clearly not harmful to minors, and many thousands more pages that, while possibly harmful to minors, are neither obscene nor child pornography."" Id. at 148a-149a.    The district court also concluded that there are less restrictive ways to prevent access to content covered by CIPA. J.S. App. 157a-167a. The court determined that libraries ""can adopt Internet use policies that make clear to patrons that the library's Internet terminals may not be used to access illegal content,"" and they ""can detect violations of their Internet use policies either through direct observation or through review of the library's Internet use logs."" Id. at 158a-159a. The court concluded that a library could adopt similar policies to restrict minors from obtaining material that is harmful to minors. Id. at 162a. The court also determined that there are less intrusive methods to prevent patrons from ""unwillingly being exposed to patently offensive, sexually explicit content,"" such as ""plac[ing] unfiltered terminals outside of patrons' sight-lines and areas of heavy traffic,"" and ""us[ing] privacy screens or recessed monitors."" Id. at 164a-166a.    Finally, the district court held that CIPA's provisions permitting the library to disable the filtering software for any lawful purpose do not demonstrate that CIPA is narrowly tailored. J.S. App. 167a-177a. The court concluded that ""the requirement that library patrons ask a state actor's permission to access disfavored content violates the First Amendment."" Id. at 170a. The court reasoned that patrons would be deterred from asking for permission to obtain access to speech ""that is constitutionally protected, yet sensitive in nature."" Id. at 171a-172a. While the court recognized that libraries may permit anonymous requests to disable the filtering software, it regarded that option as inadequate because such requests cannot be processed ""immediately."" Id. at 174a.3    SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT    I. The district court erred in holding that CIPA induces public libraries to violate the First Amendment rights of their patrons. Public libraries have broad discretion to decide what material to add to their collections, and the use of filtering software to block access to online pornography falls well within the permissible limits of that discretion.    A. The traditional mission of public libraries is to facilitate worthwhile and appropriate research, learning, and recreational reading and pursuits. To fulfill that mission, public libraries must have broad discretion to make content-based judgments in selecting material for their collections. For that reason, neither forum analysis nor strict scrutiny applies to a public library's collection decisions. Those doctrines would threaten to allocate to courts, rather than public libraries, the role of selecting what material should be included in the collections that public libraries make available in their local communities.    This Court has held that forum analysis and strict scrutiny are incompatible with the discretion that public television stations must have to fulfill their journalism missions, Arkansas Educational Television Commission v. Forbes, 523 U.S. 666, 672-673 (1998), and the discretion that the National Endowment for the Arts must have to fulfill its mission to select worthwhile art, National Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569. 585-586 (1998). Similarly, those doctrines are incompatible with the discretion that public libraries must have to fulfill their traditional missions. Rather than applying strict scrutiny to a public library's collection decisions, a court should instead apply rational basis review.    B. The deference owed to public library's collection decisions extends to its judgments about what material to collect from the Internet. Libraries collect material from the Internet for the same reasons that they collect books and other resources, and they therefore need the same degree of discretion to make judgments regarding what material to collect. Thus, just as public libraries have broad discretion to exclude pornography from their print collections, they have broad discretion to exclude pornography from their Internet collections.    C. Even if forum analysis were applicable to a public library's Internet collection decisions, strict scrutiny would not apply. If subjected to forum analysis, a public library's Internet-connected computers would most appropriately be viewed as a nonpublic forum. The entity responsible for a nonpublic forum may make content-based exclusions that are reasonable in light of the purposes of the forum, provided they are viewpoint neutral. Since there is no allegation of viewpoint discrimination here, the question presented by forum analysis would be whether the use of filtering is reasonable in light of the traditional purposes of a public library.    Strict scrutiny also would not apply if a public library's Internet-connected computers were viewed as a designated public forum. The standard for reviewing exclusions from a limited public forum is essentially the same reasonableness standard as the one that applies to exclusions from a nonpublic forum.    D. Regardless of whether the standard for reviewing a public library's collection practices is rationality or reasonableness, a library's use of filtering software to block material covered by CIPA is constitutional. The district court itself found that filtering software is a reasonably effective way to block pornographic material, and that such material falls outside of a public library's traditional collection boundaries.    The district court's finding that filtering software erroneously blocks some constitutionally protected speech does not undermine the reasonableness of their use. Libraries decline to collect many books that are constitutionally protected, and declining to collect constitutionally protected materials from the Internet is equally unproblematic. Public libraries may reasonably conclude that it best furthers their missions to use a resource that is effective in keeping out pornography, even if that resource keeps out some material that is not pornographic.    Moreover, patrons will only infrequently be unable to find the information they need because a particular Web site has been blocked. Only a very small percentage of all sites on the Web are erroneously blocked; information that is erroneously blocked can often be found on other sites or in the library's print collection; patrons may always ask the library to unblock the site or (at least in the case of adults) disable the filter; and the library's policies concerning the use of its own computers do not prevent patrons from obtaining access to the Internet through computers located elsewhere.    The district court believed that closely monitoring patrons who use the Internet would be a less restrictive alternative than using filtering software. A public library, however, is not required to satisfy a court that it has used the least restrictive alternative. In any event, closely monitoring patrons who use the Internet would be more restrictive than using filtering software. It would deeply intrude on patron privacy, significantly change the experience for everyone who visits a public library, alter the relationship between librarians and patrons, and needlessly expose librarians to pornography many would prefer not to see.    E. The use of filtering software also satisfies strict scrutiny. Public libraries have a compelling interest in restricting access through their own computers to online obscenity, child pornography, and (in the case of minors) material that is harmful to minors. The use of filtering software is the least restrictive method to further that compelling interest.    II. There are no alternative grounds for affirming the district court's judgment. Appellees face a serious threshold barrier in making their claim that CIPA imposes an unconstitutional condition on their receipt of federal assistance. The courts of appeals that have addressed the issue have all concluded that governmental entities do not have First Amendment rights. Appellees seek to rely on the First Amendment rights of their patrons. But the unconstitutional conditions doctrine applies only to those upon whom purportedly unconstitutional conditions are actually imposed. CIPA does not impose any conditions on library patrons. Moreover, as explained in Point I, the use of filtering software does not violate the First Amendment rights of patrons.    Assuming arguendo that public libraries may assert a First Amendment unconstitutional condition claim, there no merit to such a claim here. Congress may reasonably insist that those who receive federal assistance for Internet access and related services take the modest step of using filtering software to ensure that the assistance Congress has provided for educational and informational purposes does not facilitate access to illegal and harmful pornography. That condition does not distort the usual functioning of a public library. The material to which CIPA seeks to prevent access falls outside the collection boundaries of most public libraries, and many public libraries have determined that filtering software is the best way to prevent access to such material in a manner that is consistent with their missions. If a public library wishes to provide unfiltered access, it is free to decline federal assistance for Internet access and related services.    Nor is the use of filtering software a prior restraint on speech. Libraries that use filtering software do not regulate what speech may be placed on the Internet or prevent its dissemination throughout the world. They simply decline to obtain pornography from the Internet through their own computers and make it available to their patrons. That decision is no more a prior restraint on speech than a public library's decision to decline to subscribe to pornographic magazines. The judgment of the district court should therefore be reversed.    ARGUMENT    CIPA'S FILTERING PROVISIONS ARE FACIALLY CONSTITUTIONAL    I. CIPA DOES NOT INDUCE PUBLIC LIBRARIES TO VIOLATE ANY FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS OF THEIR PATRONS    This case involves the facial validity of an Act of Congress designed to ensure that federal assistance to libraries for Internet access and related services does not facilitate access to visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors. Under CIPA, a library may not receive federal assistance for Internet access and related services unless the library has a policy that includes the use of filtering software on Internet-connected computers that protects against access by all persons to visual depictions that are ""obscene"" or ""child pornography,"" and that protects against access by minors to visual depictions that are ""harmful to minors."" 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(6)(B) and (C); 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(1).    CIPA is not an exercise of Congress's regulatory authority over purely private conduct. Instead, it is an exercise of Congress's authority under the Spending Clause ""to provide for the * * * the General Welfare of the United States,"" Article I, Section 8, Clause 1, by specifying the purposes for which federal assistance to libraries may be used. As such, CIPA's filtering conditions attach only when a library voluntarily chooses to accept federal assistance for Internet access and related services.    Because CIPA's filtering provisions are conditions on the receipt of federal assistance, and not regulatory restrictions, this Court's Spending Clause cases provide the appropriate framework for assessing CIPA's constitutionality. Under those cases, Congress has wide latitude to attach conditions to the receipt of federal assistance in order to further broad policy objectives. South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 206 (1987). Congress's discretion to impose such conditions on state and local government entities, however, is subject to four limitations. First, the exercise of the spending power must be in pursuit of ""the general welfare."" Id. at 207. Second, Congress must condition the receipt of assistance ""unambiguously."" Ibid. Third, the condition must be related ""to the federal interest in particular national projects or programs."" Ibid. Fourth, Congress may not ""induce"" the recipient ""to engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional."" Id. at 210.    CIPA easily satisfies each of the first three limitations, and neither the district court nor appellees have suggested otherwise. J.S. App. 96a. Patrons seeking access to illegal and harmful online pornography in public libraries is a serious problem, and Congress's goal of ensuring that federal assistance to libraries does not facilitate such access is in ""pursuit of the public welfare."" The requirement that libraries receiving federal assistance use filtering technology that protects against access to such material is stated ""unambiguously."" 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(6)(B) and (C); 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(1). And that requirement is also directly related to Congress's purpose in providing assistance to libraries for Internet access-to further the libraries' educational and informational missions. See 47 U.S.C. 254(h); 20 U.S.C. 9121, 9141(a)(1)(B); S. Rep. No. 226, supra, at 4.    Invoking South Dakota v. Dole's fourth limitation, the district court held that the provisions of CIPA that apply to public libraries are facially unconstitutional because, in the court's view, a public library that uses filtering software in compliance with CIPA will necessarily violate the First Amendment rights of its patrons. The court reasoned that (1) a public library that connects its computers to the Internet creates a ""designated public forum,"" (2) strict scrutiny applies to content-based limitations on access to that ""forum,"" and (3) the use of filtering software is not narrowly tailored to serve any compelling government interest.    That analysis is incorrect. A public library, like any library, has broad discretion to decide what information to make available to its patrons through its own computers, and the use of filtering software to protect against access to obscenity, child pornography, and material that is harmful to minors falls well within the permissible limits of that discretion.    A. Public Libraries Have Broad Discretion To Select The Material They Make Available To Their Patrons    1. To fulfill their traditional missions, public libraries must have broad discretion to decide what material to provide to their patrons. For that reason, neither forum analysis nor strict scrutiny applies to a public library's collection decisions.    The first municipally-supported public library, the Boston Public Library, opened in 1854, and had as its mission ""to promote equality of education opportunity, to advance scientific investigation, to save youth from the evils of an ill-spent leisure, and to promote the vocational advancement of the workers."" J.A. 612 (GX 186 (Expert Report of Donald G. Davis, Jr. at 2)) (citation omitted). Over time, public libraries began to collect materials for recreational reading and other purposes as well. J.S. App. 33a. But facilitating learning and cultural enrichment have remained a focal point for most public libraries. Indeed, the American Library Association's current Bill of Rights provides that ""[b]ooks and other library resources should be provided for the interest, information, and enlightenment of all people of the community the library serves."" Id. at 32a.    Consistent with their missions, public libraries seek to provide a wide array of information to the public. J.S. App. 33a. As the district court found, however, the goal of public libraries has never been to provide ""universal coverage."" Id. at 34a. Instead, public libraries seek to provide materials ""that would be of the greatest direct benefit or interest to the community."" Id. at 34a-35a. As the district court found, in doing so, public libraries seek to develop collections that have ""requisite and appropriate quality."" Id. at 34a (emphasis added). Of necessity, public libraries therefore take into account the ""content of the material"" in making collection decisions. Id. at 35a (emphasis added). Some material may be selected for ""artistic merit, scholarship, or value to humanity,"" while other material may be selected ""to satisfy the informational, recreational and educational needs of the community."" J.A. 586 (GX 114, at 3). In all cases, however, the content of the work is necessarily a factor in making a collection decision.    The need to make selective judgments stems in part from the economic reality that public libraries have finite budgets. J.S. App. 8a. But since the fundamental role of public libraries is to identify for their patrons material that has ""requisite and appropriate quality,"" id. at 34a, public libraries would make selective judgments even if they had access to unlimited funds. See William A. Katz, Collection Development: The Selection of Materials for Libraries 6 (1980) (""[t]he librarian's responsibility * * * is to separate out the gold from the garbage, not to preserve everything""); Francis K.W. Drury, Book Selection xi (1930) (""It is the aim of the selector to give the public, not everything it wants, but the best of what it will read or use to advantage.""); J.A. 636 (GX 187 (Rebuttal Expert Report of Donald G. Davis, Jr., at 3)) (""A hypothetical collection of everything that has been produced is not only of dubious value, but actually detrimental to users trying to find what they want to find and really need."").    That is certainly true with respect to pornographic material. Many public libraries include in their print collections sexually explicit materials that have significant value, such as ""The Joy of Sex"" and ""The Joy of Gay Sex."" J.S. App. 33a. But very few public libraries collect graphic pornography, such as XXX-rated videos, or Hustler magazine. Ibid. The absence of pornographic books and videos from public libraries is not simply a function of finite budgets. Instead, it reflects a near universal consensus among public libraries that such materials are not appropriate for inclusion in their collections. J.A. 663-664 (GX 189 (Cronin Expert Report), at 6).    Thus, in fulfilling their traditional missions, public libraries necessarily make content-based collection decisions, including judgments concerning whether to collect pornographic material. Application of forum analysis and strict scrutiny would be incompatible with that tradition.    Indeed, subjecting collection decisions to forum analysis and strict scrutiny would risk transforming the role of public libraries in our society. Instead of vesting in public libraries responsibility for the resources that they collect and make available to their local communities, forum analysis would threaten to substitute judicial judgments regarding what is appropriate. A public library's traditional exercise of discretion to determine what materials to collect would be particularly threatened by application of strict scrutiny to collection decisions, which would require a library to establish that a challenged decision furthers a ""compelling"" interest, and that less restrictive alternatives would not be effective. United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 813, 816 (2000). Libraries would often be hard-pressed to show that the selection of one resource rather than another always furthers a ""compelling"" government interest. Nor are libraries always likely to be in a position to demonstrate that there are no alternatives that would be less restrictive, while still serving the library's overall collection goals. Libraries would also be vulnerable to charges that they have collected too many or too few works containing particular viewpoints. The very prospect of strict judicial review of collection decisions could chill libraries from exercising traditional editorial judgments.    2. This Court has not decided what level of scrutiny applies to a public library's content-based judgments regarding the material it makes available to its patrons. In two analogous contexts, however, the Court has made clear that the government has broad discretion to make content-based judgments in deciding what private speech to make available to the public. In those contexts, neither forum analysis nor strict scrutiny applies.    In Arkansas Educational Television Commission v. Forbes, 523 U.S. 666, 672-673 (1998), the Court held that public forum principles do not generally apply to a public television station's editorial judgments regarding the private speech or other programming it presents to its viewers. The Court explained that ""[b]road rights of access for outside speakers would be antithetical, as a general rule, to the discretion that stations and their editorial staff must exercise to fulfill their journalistic purpose and statutory obligations."" Id. at 673. Recognizing a broad right of public access, the Court added, ""would risk implicating the courts in judgments that should be left to the exercise of journalistic discretion."" Id. at 674.4    Similarly, in National Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569 (1998), the Court upheld an art funding program that required the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) to use content-based criteria in the process of making funding decisions. The Court explained that ""any content-based considerations that may be taken into account in the grant-making process are a consequence of the nature of art funding."" Id. at 585. In particular, ""[t]he very assumption of the NEA is that grants will be awarded according to the 'artistic worth of competing applicants,' and absolute neutrality is simply inconceivable."" Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court expressly rejected the application of forum analysis to art funding decisions, reasoning that such an analysis would conflict with ""NEA's mandate * * * to make esthetic judgments, and the inherently content-based 'excellence' threshold for NEA support."" Id. at 586. See Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 278 (1981) (Stevens, J., concurring in the judgment) (in order to safeguard the academic freedom of public universities, a public university's content-based decisions in allocating space for student programs should not routinely be subjected to forum analysis or strict scrutiny); Board of Education v. Pico, 457 U.S. 853, 871 (1982) (plurality opinion) (public school has authority to remove books from a school library based on a determination that they are educationally unsuitable or pervasively vulgar); id. at 890-891 (Burger, C.J., dissenting) (public school's discretion to remove books from a school library is not constrained by the First Amendment).    The principles underlying Forbes and Finley also apply to a public library's exercise of judgment in selecting the material it makes available to its patrons. Just as forum analysis and heightened judicial scrutiny are incompatible with the discretion that public television stations must have to fulfill their journalistic responsibilities, and the discretion that the NEA must have to fulfill its responsibility to select worthwhile art, they are also incompatible with the discretion that public libraries must have to fulfill their traditional missions.    B. A Library's Broad Discretion To Make Collection Decisions Applies To Its Selection Of Material From The Internet    The district court acknowledged that libraries may select books for their collections on the basis of content without triggering forum analysis or strict scrutiny. Such collection decisions, the court concluded, are subject only to rational basis review. J.S. App. 120a. But the court refused to apply that same analysis to a public library's judgments regarding the material it makes available to its patrons through its Internet-connected computers. In the court's view, a public library that collects material from the Internet creates a ""designated public forum,"" and strict scrutiny applies to content-based limitations on access to that ""forum."" For constitutional purposes, however, there is no relevant distinction between a library's collection of material from the Internet and its collection of books and other resources.    1. A public library does not make computers available to obtain material from the Internet in order to create a public forum for Web publishers to speak, any more than it collects books in order to provide a public forum for the authors of the books to speak. It provides Internet access for the very same reasons that it offers other library resources-to facilitate research, learning, and recreational pursuits through the furnishing of materials having requisite and appropriate quality. As Congress recognized, ""[t]he Internet is simply another method for making information available in a school or library."" S. Rep. No. 141, 106th Cong., 1st Sess. 7 (1999). In a very real sense, it is ""no more than a technological extension of the book stack."" Ibid.    Consistent with that understanding, public libraries exercise the same kind of judgments concerning the Internet that they routinely apply to other media. For example, some libraries prohibit the use of their computers for the viewing of materials that are ""offensive to the public,"" ""objectionable,"" or ""inappropriate."" J.S. App. 37a. Other libraries prevent access to Web sites that contain graphic violence or tasteless material. GXs 71, 83, 99, 247. Other libraries do not allow patrons to use the libraries' computers to send and receive e-mail or to participate in chat rooms. J.S. App. 38a. Still other libraries forbid access to Web sites that include games or dating services. Id. at 37a-38a. And consistent with their practice with respect to books, magazines, and movies, many libraries prohibit their patrons from viewing online pornography. Id. at 37a. Those judgments are no less entitled to deference than the similar judgments that libraries make in deciding what books to collect.    As the district court itself recognized, a library's authority to collect material from the Internet cannot be distinguished from its authority to collect books on the ground that, once a library connects to the Internet, a library does not incur additional cost by offering additional material. J.S. App. 126a n.25. Many libraries do not have enough Internet-connected computers to meet patron demand. Ibid. In those circumstances, a library that allows its patrons to use its computers to send e-mail, play games, or view pornography necessarily denies other patrons the opportunity to use the computer for other purposes, such as research. See J.A. 663 (GX 189) (Cronin Expert Report), at 6) (""By permitting pornography to be viewed on their premises, public librarians are constraining those patrons interested in accessing educational and information resources."" ); see also J.S. App. 126a n.25 (""every time library patrons visit a Web site, they deny other patrons waiting to use the terminal access to other Web sites""). That circumstance requires public libraries to make judgments about what material they will make available through their Internet-connected computers.    Even if a library could always provide enough computers to meet patron demand, however, that would not change the analysis. Ultimately, a public library's need to exercise judgment in making collection decisions depends not on resource limitations, but on the traditional role that public libraries play in our society in identifying material that is suitable and worthwhile for their patrons. A library is no less entitled to play that role when it collects material from the Internet than when it collects material from any other source. Thus, if libraries have broad discretion to refrain from including pornographic magazines and XXX-rated movies in their collections, as they unquestionably do, they should also have broad discretion not to collect comparable material from the Internet.    2. The district court distinguished a library's collection of material from the Internet from its collection of books on a single ground. ""The central difference,"" the court stated, ""is that by providing patrons with even filtered Internet access, the library permits patrons to receive speech on a virtually unlimited number of topics, from a virtually unlimited number of speakers, without attempting to restrict patrons' access to speech that the library, in the exercise of its professional judgment, determines to be particularly valuable."" J.S. App. 121a. In contrast, the court continued, ""the content of every book that a library acquires has been reviewed by the library's collection development staff or someone to whom they have delegated the task, and has been judged to meet the criteria that form the basis for the library's collection development policy."" Id. at 122a-123a.    That is not a tenable ground for subjecting a public library's book-collection decisions to rational basis review, while subjecting a public library's Internet collection decisions to strict scrutiny. A public library's decision to exclude dating services, games, e-mail, chatrooms, graphic violence, tasteless jokes, or pornography from its Internet collection is clearly an exercise of a library's traditional discretion to exclude material that lacks the requisite and appropriate quality or that otherwise falls outside the library's mission. A public library's failure to make quality-based judgments about all the material it collects from the Web does not somehow taint the judgments it does make.    Moreover, because of the vast quantity of material on the Internet and its rapidly changing nature, libraries cannot possibly segregate, on an item-by-item basis, all the Internet material that is appropriate for inclusion in the library's collection from all the material that is not. While a public library could limit its Internet collection to just those sites it found worthwhile, it could do so only at the cost of excluding an enormous amount of valuable information that it lacks the capacity to review. Given that tradeoff, it is entirely reasonable for public libraries to reject that approach and instead exclude categories of content they regard as inappropriate for inclusion in a public library, without making individualized judgments that everything they do make available has requisite and appropriate quality. A public library's judgment that such an approach best serves its historic mission is entitled to substantial deference, not judicial suspicion.    Indeed, rather than promoting First Amendment values, the district court's analysis has the opposite effect. Under the district court's analysis, a public library that provides Internet access only to the limited number of sites its staff has had the time to review in advance would have broad discretion to make its selections. In contrast, a public library that provides access to a much wider range of material, but prevents access to certain material its staff has determined to be of low value or otherwise outside its mission, would have to justify its judgments under strict scrutiny. The district court's approach therefore creates a perverse incentive for public libraries to make available less information in order to preserve their traditional discretion.    The district court's approach is particularly unpersuasive as applied to a public library's decision to exclude pornographic content. Most libraries already exclude pornography from their print collections because they regard it as inappropriate for inclusion in a public library. Under the district court's analysis, that judgment would be subjected to rational basis review, while a judgment to exclude online pornography from the library's Internet collection for precisely the same reason would be presumptively unconstitutional.    To the extent that the district court's analysis suggests a distinction between judgments of exclusion and judgments of inclusion, such a distinction is also untenable in this setting. ""The job of the librarian is to know what to exclude as well as what to include."" Will Manley, The Manley Arts: Good Fences Make Good Libraries, Booklist 446 (Nov. 1, 2001). For example, ""[m]edical libraries don't need the definitive works of James Joyce. A corporate library does not need a complete section of animal-husbandry materials."" Ibid. ""Systematic weeding is an integral part of the selection process which helps maintain the quality of the Library's collection."" J.A. 590 (GX 114, at 7). And, as noted above, most public libraries exclude pornography based on their judgment that it does not further their mission. As those examples illustrate, judgments of exclusion, like judgments of inclusion, play an important role in the development of a library's collection.    A public library's book collection authority also cannot be distinguished from its Internet collection authority on the ground that libraries rely on software companies to develop appropriate filtering programs. Libraries often rely on journal reviews and bibliographies to select their books, and they sometimes delegate to third party vendors the task of supplying books that satisfy the libraries' collection standards. J.S. App. 35a. While libraries retain ultimate control over their book collections, they also retain ultimate control over their Internet collections. Public libraries select the software and blocking categories that best meet their needs, and can fine tune the software to add or delete specific sites from a blocking category. Id. at 52a.    C. The District Court's Application Of Strict Scrutiny Is Not Supported By Precedent    1. In applying strict scrutiny to a public library's Internet collection decisions, the district court relied on several of this Court's public forum and government subsidy cases. J.S. App. 127a-128a. But those cases resolved First Amendment issues far removed from the question presented here.5    None of those cases involved a public library. None of those cases involved a government institution or program designed to make available private works having requisite and appropriate quality. And none of those cases suggested that a public library's collection decisions should be subjected to strict scrutiny.    2. The district court also justified its application of strict scrutiny based on a separate line of authority holding that content-based limitations on access to a traditional public forum, such as a public sidewalk or park, are subject to strict scrutiny. J.S. App. 128a. See Police Dep't of the City of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 96 (1972). Internet access at public libraries, however, does not satisfy this Court's definition of a traditional public forum. A public library's Internet-connected computers-a resource that did not exist until the past decade or so-have not ""immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and, time out of mind, * * * been used for purposes of assembly, communication of thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions."" International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee, 505 U.S. 672, 679 (1992).    Indeed, the district court acknowledged that the use of a public library's computers for Internet access does not satisfy the Court's test for a traditional public forum. J.S. App. 129a. The district court nonetheless viewed a public library's furnishing of material from the Internet as analogous to a traditional public forum, id. at 128a, because a public library itself is generally open to the public at no cost, id. at 129a-130a, and because the Internet permits speakers to reach a wide audience at a low cost, id. at 131a. That analysis is seriously flawed. This Court ""has rejected the view that traditional public forum status extends beyond its historic confines."" Forbes, 523 U.S. at 678. The doctrines applicable to traditional public fora therefore may not be extended by analogy.    Even if they could, the district court's analogy is misconceived. Public sidewalks and parks are not public fora simply because the public may use them for free. Rather, they are public fora because private speakers, and not the government, have always determined the content of the speech that occurs there. In contrast, while public libraries have always been open to the public, they are open for particular purposes. They are not dedicated to the full range of uses available in a public park or on a public sidewalk, and they are not dedicated to general public discussion and debate, as any patron who has been told to stop talking by a librarian can attest. And, most significantly, public libraries have always determined the content of the works they collect and make available to their patrons. For similar reasons, the district court's analogy is not aided by the observation that speakers can reach a wide audience through the Internet. It is not the speakers' ability to reach a wide audience that makes a public sidewalk or park a traditional public forum, but the tradition of private speakers determining the content of the speech in such a forum.    Moreover, the district court's reliance on the nature of the Internet ignores the fundamental difference between the Internet itself and a public library's decision whether to allow the use of its own computers to retrieve various types of material from the Internet. The Internet itself is a forum for First Amendment activity, but it is not one that is government-owned. When a government places restrictions on the content that may be placed on the Internet, it acts as a regulator of private activity, and its restrictions are subject to strict scrutiny. Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844 (1997). In contrast, when a public library brings material from the Internet into the library through its own computers, it acts as a collector of material for its patrons. It does not regulate the content of communication on the Internet, control its dissemination throughout the world, or affect access to that information through other computer terminals. In essence, a public library acts as a market participant, not as a market regulator, when it determines the extent to which it will obtain material from the Internet through its own computers in its own premises. Cf. Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U.S. 794 (1976). In that capacity, a public library necessarily has both the responsibility and discretion to decide, within the broad limits traditionally accorded such institutions, how little or how much material to provide from the Internet.    D. Even If A Library's Connection Of Its Computers To The Internet Created A Forum, Strict Scrutiny Would Not Apply    1. Even if forum analysis applied to a public library's selection of material from the Internet, strict scrutiny would not apply to a library's use of filtering software to block material covered by CIPA. ""The Court [has] identified three types of fora: the traditional public forum, the public forum created by government designation, and the nonpublic forum."" Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 802 (1985). As discussed above, a public library's Internet-connected computers are not traditional public fora. Accordingly, if forum analysis were applicable to a library's Internet-connected computers, they could only be either nonpublic fora or designated public fora. Of the two, they would more appropriately be viewed as nonpublic fora.    A designated public forum is created only when the government by ""fiat"" makes an affirmative choice to open up its property for use as a public forum. Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators' Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 46 (1983). ""The government does not create a public forum by inaction or by permitting limited discourse, but only by opening a nontraditional forum for public discourse."" Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 788.    For the same reasons that a library's Internet collection is not subject to forum analysis at all, it also does not satisfy the definition of a designated public forum. As already discussed, public libraries do not connect to the Internet in order to open up a forum for web publishers to speak; instead, they do so to further the library's traditional mission of facilitating research, learning, and recreational reading or pursuits. Moreover, public libraries have always reserved the right to determine the content of their collections, including their Internet collections, and to exclude from their collections materials that do not have requisite and appropriate quality. That practice is inconsistent with an intent to create a designated public forum. Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 804 (limiting participation in Combined Federal Campaign to ""appropriate"" voluntary agencies is inconsistent with an intent to create a designated public forum).    Thus, if forum analysis were applicable, a public library's Internet collection should be treated as a nonpublic forum. Under this Court's decisions, the government may limit access to a nonpublic forum based on content ""so long as the distinctions drawn are reasonable in light of the purposes served by the forum and are viewpoint neutral."" Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 806. The distinctions at issue are viewpoint neutral. CIPA provides for libraries to draw distinctions based on whether the material is ""obscene,"" ""child pornography,"" or ""harmful to minors,"" not on the basis of any particular viewpoint on sexuality. Similarly, the commercial filtering products used by public libraries draw distinctions based on whether the material falls into a category such as ""Pornography,"" J.S. App. 49a, not on the basis of any viewpoint about sexuality. The principle that the entity in charge of a nonpublic forum may not discriminate on the basis of viewpoint is therefore not implicated here. See R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 384-385 (1992) (prohibitions against obscenity and child pornography are based on content not viewpoint); Bethel Sch. Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U.S. 675, 684-685 (1986) (prohibition against lewd and indecent speech is based on content, not viewpoint); FCC v. Pacifica Found., 438 U.S. 726, 745-746 (1978) (plurality opinion) (restriction on patently offensive words dealing with sex is based on content, not viewpoint).    Because the use of filtering software involves distinctions based on content, rather than viewpoint, if a public library's Internet-connected computers were viewed as non-public fora, strict scrutiny would not apply. Instead, the relevant inquiry would be whether the use of the software is ""reasonable in light of the purposes served by the forum."" Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 806. Because a library's purpose in connecting to the Internet is to facilitate research, learning, and recreation of requisite and appropriate quality, the question would be whether the use of filtering software is reasonable in light of that purpose.    2. That same analysis would apply even if a public library's Internet-connected computers were treated as a designated public forum. In establishing a designated forum, the government is not required to create the equivalent of a traditional public forum that is presumptively available for expressive activities of all kinds, on all subjects, by all speakers. The government may instead create a ""limited"" public forum, and ""confine"" the forum ""to the limited and legitimate purposes for which it was created."" Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 829. The constitutional standard applicable to a ""limited"" public forum is essentially the same as the constitutional standard applicable to a nonpublic forum. The government ""may not exclude speech where its distinction is not 'reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum,' * * * nor may it discriminate against speech on the basis of its viewpoint."" Ibid.    If a library's Internet-connected computers were treated as a designated public forum, the designation would be for the limited purpose of facilitating appropriate research, learning, and recreational reading and other pursuits. As such, the relevant constitutional inquiry would not be whether the use of filtering software is narrowly tailored to further a compelling interest, but whether it is ""reasonable"" in light of those limited purposes. Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 829-830.    E. The Use of Filtering Software Is A Reasonable Method To Exclude Pornography From A Public Library's Internet Collection    Regardless of whether a public library's collection of material from the Internet is subject to review for rationality or reasonableness, a library's use of filtering software to prevent access to material covered by CIPA is facially constitutional. The character of (and the reasonableness of any limitation on) any ""forum"" that results from installing computers and connecting them to the Internet must take account of the fact that the computers and the access to the Internet they afford thereby become part of the resources of a library. Because public libraries have traditionally not included pornographic materials in their collections, a public library's decision not to include pornography in the material it collects from the Internet constitutes a ""reasonable"" limitation on any nonpublic or limited public ""forum"" the library may be deemed to have created. And the use of filtering software is, in turn, a reasonable method to block access to pornographic material.    1. The district court recognized that pornographic material falls outside a public library's traditional collection boundaries. J.S. App. 33a. It also found that filtering software is a reasonably effective way to screen out access to such material. Id. at 90a-91a. The district court nonetheless held that the use of filtering software is constitutionally deficient because all leading commercial filters block some constitutionally protected speech that does not fit into the categories identified by CIPA or the software categories that best capture CIPA material. Id. at 149a. For several reasons, the imperfection of filtering software does not affect the reasonableness of a library's judgment to use it.    First, a public library does not have an obligation to add material to its collection simply because the material is constitutionally protected. Public libraries do not include hundreds of thousands of constitutionally protected books, magazines, and videos in their collections. A library's decision not to provide certain constitutionally protected material through its Internet-connected computers raises no greater constitutional concern.    Second, a public library may reasonably decide that, in order to avoid making certain inappropriate material available to its patrons, it will also decline to make available certain material that may be worthwhile. For example, a public library may decide not to collect a particular magazine because of its pornographic pictures, even though that same magazine might contain worthwhile interviews with public figures. Relying on a similar judgment, a public library may decide to use filtering software that blocks material that is pornographic, even though it may also block some material that is non-pornographic.    Third, a library patron would only infrequently need to have access to a Web site that has been blocked in order to obtain the information he or she seeks. Based on the evidence submitted by appellees' own expert, filtering software erroneously blocks less than 1% of all Web sites. J.S. App. 79a, 85a (in sample of 500,000 sites, filtering software may have erroneously blocked ""somewhere between 4,403 and 4,783 Web sites""). A recently released study confirms that blocking software has only a negligible impact on access to valuable information. Carolyn R. Richardson et al., Does Pornography-Blocking Software Block Access to Health Information on the Internet, 288 JAMA 2887 (2002). The study found that when a filter is set to the least restrictive setting, such as the ""pornography"" setting on one of the most widely used filters in public libraries (N2H2), it blocks 1.4% of all health sites. Id. at 2891-2892, 2899.6 Any information that may be erroneously blocked can often be found on another Web site or on the library's bookshelves. For example, a witness who performed a search of the term ""breast cancer"" found that the first 50 sites were not blocked. 3/28/02 Tr. 97-98 (testimony of Tacoma librarian Biek). Similarly, as the district court found, many libraries carry books on human sexuality, such as The Joy of Sex and The Joy of Gay Sex. J.S. App. 33a.    Fourth, when patrons are unable to view a site because it has been blocked, the patron need only ask a librarian to unblock the site or (at least in the case of adults) disable the filter. As the district court found, libraries have the capacity to permanently unblock any erroneously blocked site. J.S. App. 52a. At least with respect to adults, CIPA also expressly authorizes library officials to ""disable"" a filter altogether ""to enable access for bona fide research or other lawful purposes."" 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(3) (disabling permitted for both adults and minors); 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(6)(D) (disabling permitted for adults).    The district court viewed unblocking and disabling as inadequate because some patrons may be too embarrassed to ask for assistance from a librarian. J.S. App. 172a. But library patrons are accustomed to asking for assistance from librarians-to locate material in the collection, to retrieve books in closed book stacks or on reserve, or to borrow materials from another library. Indeed, librarians answer more than seven million questions weekly. Id. at 33a-34a. There is no reason to anticipate that patrons will be any less willing to ask for assistance in obtaining information from the Internet. Moreover, the Constitution does not guarantee a patron the right to acquire information at a public library without any risk of embarrassment. Library patrons can be observed by librarians and other members of the public; patrons must ordinarily identify themselves in order to check out material or to obtain interlibrary loans; and libraries make a record of the material that patrons check out. Those standard operating procedures may deter some persons from using a public library to acquire information, but that does not mean that a library's standard operating procedures are unconstitutional.    In any event, a library has the ability to process anonymous unblocking requests. J.S. App. 173a. As the district court noted, such requests may not always be processed immediately. Id. at 174a. But that is also true when a patron requests material that is held in storage or in another branch, or that is available only by interlibrary loan. See PX 61, at CM00097 (Fort Vancouver) (interlibrary loan generally takes about three weeks); PX 66B, at 2 (Tulsa) (interlibrary loan generally takes 2-4 weeks). As these examples illustrate, the First Amendment does not give a library patron the right to demand that a librarian provide requested information immediately.    2. The district court also identified what it believed to be less restrictive and equally effective ways to preclude library patrons from receiving access to illegal and harmful pornography on library computers. In particular, the court concluded that libraries could make clear to patrons that the library's Internet terminals may not be used to view illegal or harmful content, and that libraries can detect violations through direct observation or through logs that reveal all the sites that a patron selects. J.S. App. 158a-159a. The district court erred in imposing that approach. In deciding what information to collect from the Internet, a public library is not required to satisfy a court that is has pursued the least restrictive alternative. Even if a public library's connection of its computers to the Internet were regarded as creating a nonpublic or a limited public forum, it would have broad discretion to choose among reasonable alternatives in deciding how best to further its mission.    In any event, a system under which librarians closely monitor everyone using computers to make sure that they are not viewing pornographic material would be far more intrusive than the use of filtering software. Such a regime would deeply invade the privacy that patrons ordinarily experience when they peruse materials in a library. It would also significantly alter the experience of everyone visiting the library, including many who prefer to steer clear (and to have their children steer clear) of pornographic Web sites and are quite content to have the library help them do so.    The district court's proposed alternative would also risk transforming the role of a librarian from a professional to whom patrons turn for assistance in finding information into a compliance officer who many patrons might wish to avoid. Such a fundamental change in the relationship between patrons and librarians would undermine rather than promote First Amendment values. Moreover, many librarians (like many patrons) would understandably be uncomfortable viewing pornographic depictions and confronting the patrons who are doing so. J.S. App. 44a. Under the court's alternative, those librarians would be needlessly exposed to material they would prefer not to see, and forced into a role they should not have to play.    The experience of the Greenville County Library System dramatically illustrates why a monitoring program is not a viable alternative to filtering software. In response to the problems associated with library patrons using its computers to view online pornography, Greenville instituted a policy prohibiting patrons from viewing online pornography, relocated all Internet-connected computers so that librarians would have visual contact with them, and entrusted librarians with responsibility to enforce its no-pornography policy. J.S. App. 40a. The result was that the library experienced a high turnover rate among librarians who worked in view of Internet terminals, while patrons continued to view online pornography. Ibid. Although the library considered discontinuing Internet access altogether, it ultimately adopted a filtering policy. Ibid.    The other alternatives discussed by the district court-moving terminals to places where their displays cannot easily be seen by other patrons, or purchasing privacy screens or recessed monitors (J.S. App. 165a-166a)- would not address a library's interest in preventing patrons from deliberately using the library's computers to view online pornography. To the contrary, by making it more difficult for library officials to monitor activity on the computers, those alternatives would make it easier for patrons to use the library's computers to obtain online pornography.    Even as methods for preventing inadvertent exposure to pornographic material, the additional alternatives discussed by the district are less effective than filtering software. Placing computers outside of patron sight-lines is constrained by libraries' space limitations and physical layouts. J.S. App. 42a. Privacy screens do not always prevent inadvertent viewing by patrons or librarians who pass by; they make it difficult for patrons to work together at a single terminal; they may be removed by patrons in order to improve the view; and they impose additional costs. Id. at 43a, 166a. Recessed monitors pose similar problems. Ibid. In contrast, filtering software efficiently addresses the problems associated with both deliberate and inadvertent exposure to online pornography.    F. The Use of Filtering Software Satisfies Strict Scrutiny    Even if strict scrutiny were applicable to a public library's collection of material from the Internet, a public library's use of filtering software to screen out material covered by CIPA would be constitutional. A government program satisfies strict scrutiny when it advances governmental interests that are ""compelling"" and employs ""the least restrictive means"" to further those interests. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U.S. at 816. That standard is satisfied here.    The government has a compelling interest in preventing the dissemination of obscenity, Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 18 (1973), child pornography, New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 757 (1982), and, in the case of minors, material that is harmful to minors, Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 637 (1968). In the unique setting of a public library, the government also has a compelling interest in protecting library patrons, including minors, from inadvertent exposure to pornographic visual depictions. Cf. FCC v. Pacifica, 438 U.S. 726, 748-749 (1978) (plurality opinion); Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U.S. 298, 302 (1974) (plurality opinion). The use of filtering software is the least restrictive method to further those interests. For the reasons discussed above, the alternatives identified by the court are either more restrictive or not as effective as filtering software in serving the government's compelling interests.    II. APPELLEES' OTHER CHALLENGES DO NOT PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE GROUND FOR AFFIRMANCE    Appellees argue that the district court's judgment may be affirmed on the alternative grounds that CIPA imposes an unconstitutional condition on the receipt of federal assistance, and that a library's use of filtering software constitutes an impermissible prior restraint on speech. ALA Mot. to Aff. 22-26; Multnomah County Resp. 17-19. Those contentions are without merit.    A. CIPA Does Not Impose An Unconstitutional Condition On The Receipt of Federal Assistance    1. Under the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions, ""the government 'may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected freedom of speech' even if he has no entitlement to that benefit."" Board of County Comm'rs v. Umbehr, 518 U.S. 668, 674 (1996) (quoting Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 597 (1972)). Appellees face a threshold barrier to relying on that doctrine. Public libraries that receive federal assistance for Internet access are government entities, and the courts of appeals that have addressed the issue have concluded that government entities do not have First Amendment rights. Warner Cable Communications, Inc. v. City of Niceville, 911 F.2d 634, 638 (11th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1222 (1991); NAACP v. Hunt, 891 F.2d 1555, 1565 (11th Cir. 1990); Student Gov't Ass'n v. Board of Trs. of the Univ. of Mass., 868 F.2d 473, 481 (1st Cir. 1989); Estiverne v. Louisiana State Bar Ass'n, 863 F.2d 371, 379 (5th Cir. 1989); Muir v. Alabama Educ. Television Comm'n, 688 F.2d 1033, 1038 (5th Cir. 1982) (en banc), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1023 (1983). See CBS, Inc. v. Democratic Nat'l Comm., 412 U.S. 94, 139 (1973) (Stewart, J., concurring) (""The First Amendment protects the press from government interference; it confers no analogous protection on the government.""); id. at 139 n.7 (""The purpose of the First Amendment is to protect private expression."") (quoting Thomas I. Emerson, The System of Freedom of Expression 700 (1970)).    Furthermore, if a government entity, such as a public library, does have First Amendment rights, it would be difficult to understand how appellees could defend the district court's holding that CIPA induces public libraries to violate the First Amendment rights of their patrons. If public libraries have a First Amendment right to determine what material to add to their Internet collections, they surely would have a First Amendment right to use filtering software notwithstanding the objections of certain library patrons and web publishers.    Perhaps for those reasons, appellees ultimately do not rely on the First Amendment rights of public libraries in making their unconstitutional conditions claim. Instead, they contend (ALA Mot. to Aff. 23-24) that CIPA imposes an unconstitutional condition on the First Amendment rights of library patrons. But library patrons are not the recipients of the federal assistance, and CIPA therefore does not impose any conditions at all on them. It follows that CIPA does not impose any unconstitutional condition on library patrons. As this Court explained in Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173 (1991), the Court's ""'unconstitutional conditions' cases involve situations in which the Government has placed a condition on the recipient of the subsidy, * * * effectively prohibiting the recipient from engaging in the protected conduct outside the scope of the federally [assisted] program."" 500 U.S. at 197 (emphasis omitted). The unconstitutional conditions doctrine does not apply to non-recipients upon whom no conditions have been imposed.    Moreover, as explained in Point I, a public library's use of filtering software does not violate any First Amendment rights of library patrons. For this reason as well, CIPA's requirement that a library use filtering software as a condition on the receipt of federal assistance for Internet access and related services would not amount to an unconstitutional condition, even if the effect on library patrons were appropriate to consider in the unconstitutional conditions analysis.    2. Assuming arguendo that public libraries may assert a First Amendment unconstitutional conditions claim, that claim would lack merit. Within broad limits, ""when the Government appropriates public funds to establish a program, it is entitled to define the limits of that program."" Rust, 500 U.S. at 194. The E-rate and LSTA programs were intended to make federal assistance for Internet access and related services available to public libraries to further their traditional role of obtaining requisite and appropriate material for educational and informational purposes. Especially since public libraries have traditionally excluded pornographic material from their other collections, Congress could reasonably conclude that a parallel limitation is appropriate under its program to assist libraries in expanding their collection activities to include the Internet.    Furthermore, in general, a condition of federal assistance violates the unconstitutional conditions doctrine only when it ""prohibit[s] the recipient from engaging in the protected conduct outside the scope of the federally [assisted] program."" 500 U.S. at 197 (emphasis omitted). CIPA does not exceed that limitation. A recipient that wishes to offer unfiltered access outside the scope of the federal program may do so-for example, at an affiliated library that does not receive federal assistance for Internet access. ALA errs in contending (ALA Mot. to Aff. 25-26) that CIPA exceeds the limits of Congress's authority because it applies to all computers at a library facility that receives federal assistance for Internet access and related services, including computers paid for by non-federal funds. Under Rust, Congress is entitled to ""require a certain degree of separation"" from the E-rate and LSTA programs ""in order to ensure the integrity"" of those programs. 505 U.S. at 198. Permitting public libraries to offer unfiltered access at the very facilities that receive federal assistance for Internet access or related services would undermine the integrity of those federal programs.    Appellees similarly err in contending, in reliance on Legal Services Corp., that CIPA's filtering conditions ""distort the usual functioning of public libraries."" ALA Mot. to Aff. 24 (quoting Legal Services Corp., 531 U.S. at 543). In Legal Services Corp., the Court concluded that the government program of furnishing legal aid to the indigent differed from the program in Rust ""in the vital respect"" that the role of lawyers supported by federal funds who represent clients in welfare disputes is to advocate against the government, and there was thus an assumption that counsel would be free of state control. 531 U.S. at 542-543. The Court concluded that the government-imposed restriction on advocacy in such welfare disputes would distort the usual functioning of the legal profession and the federal and state courts before which the legal aid lawyers appeared. Public libraries, by contrast, have no comparable role that pits them against the government, and there is no comparable assumption that public libraries must be free of any conditions that their benefactors, public or private, might attach to the use of funds or other assistance they donate to facilitate the acquisition of library resources.    Furthermore, the Court indicated in Legal Services Corp. that a condition on federal assistance ""distorts the usual functioning"" of a program in a way that raises First Amendment concerns only when its effect is to suppress speech that is ""inherent in the nature of the medium."" 531 U.S. at 543. Providing patrons with illegal or harmful pornography is not ""inherent"" in the role of public libraries in our society. To the contrary, libraries have traditionally excluded such material from their collections. Similarly, providing unfiltered access to the Internet is not ""inherent"" in the role of public libraries. Libraries have never had as their goal ""universal coverage,"" J.S. App. 34a, and many libraries have found the use of filtering software to be the best way to make material available from the Internet in conformity with their traditional missions. Library Research Center, Univ. of Ill. Grad. Sch. of Lib. & Info. Sci., Survey of Internet Access Management in Public Libraries (June 2000) (PX 38); J.S. App. 3a. To the extent that other libraries have reached a different conclusion, they are free to decline federal assistance.    Appellees assert (ALA Mot. to Aff. 24-25) that CIPA distorts the usual functioning of a public library because some libraries have chosen not to use filtering software. As Rust makes clear, however, speech-related conditions do not fall outside Congress's authority to define the limits of a federal program simply because a recipient objects to the policy judgment underlying them. In Rust, recipients of family planning funds challenged a restriction on abortion counseling on the ground that it interfered with their own judgments that appropriate family planning counseling includes abortion counseling. The Court rejected that claim, holding that Congress has authority to insist ""that public funds be spent for the purposes for which they were authorized."" 500 U.S. at 196. The Court further explained that ""the recipient is in no way compelled to operate a [federal] project; it can simply decline the subsidy."" Id. at 199 n.5. That analysis is controlling here.    B. A Library That Uses Filtering Software Does Not Impose A Prior Restraint On Speech    Appellees' reliance (ALA Mot. to Aff. 22-23; Multnomah County Resp. 17-19) on the presumption against prior restraints is also misplaced. A library's use of filtering software does not impose a ""restraint"" on Internet content. Any material blocked by a filter remains on the Internet and may be obtained from millions of computers throughout the world. A library's decision not to provide such material through its own computers is a collection decision, not a restraint on private speech.    Acceptance of appellees' contrary view would lead to the conclusion that a librarian observing a patron viewing hard-core obscenity through the library's computers would have to permit the patron to continue to do so unless and until the library could persuade a court that the material is obscene. See Conrad, 420 U.S. at 552-555, 559-560. The same would be true even if the patron were a 12-year old. Appellees' theory would also lead to the conclusion that public libraries engage in prior restraints when they fail to provide pornographic magazines or XXX-rated videos to their patrons. As those examples illustrate, prior restraint doctrine has no application to a public library's collection decisions.    CONCLUSION    The judgment of the district court should be reversed.    Respectfully submitted.    THEODORE B. OLSON  Solicitor General  ROBERT D. MCCALLUM, JR.  Assistant Attorney General  EDWIN S. KNEEDLER  Deputy Solicitor General  IRVING L. GORNSTEIN  Assistant to the Solicitor  General  BARBARA L. HERWIG  JACOB M. LEWIS  AUGUST E. FLENTJE  Attorneys      JANUARY 2003    1 CIPA also applies to schools that receive grants under Title III of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, and assistance under the E-rate program. 20 U.S.C. 6777; 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(5) (Sections 1711 and 1721(a) of CIPA). Those provisions are not at issue here. Pet. App. 16a.    2 CIPA adopts the definitions of ""obscene"" and ""child pornography"" set forth in the federal criminal code. 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(7)(D); 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(7)(E) (incorporating 18 U.S.C. 1460's definition of ""obscene""); 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(7)(A); 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(7)(F) (incorporating 18 U.S.C. 2256's definition of ""child pornography""). CIPA defines ""harmful to minors"" as ""any picture, image, graphic image file or other visual depiction that-(i) taken as a whole and with respect to minors, appeals to a prurient interest in nudity, sex, or excretion; (ii) depicts, describes, or represents, in a patently offensive way with respect to what is suitable for minors, an actual or simulated sexual act or sexual contact, actual or simulated normal or perverted sexual acts, or a lewd exhibition of the genitals; and (iii) taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value as to minors."" 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(7)(B); 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(7)(G). CIPA defines a ""minor"" as an individual under the age of 17. 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(7)(C); 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(7)(D).    3 In a lengthy footnote (J.S. App. 180a-188a n.36), the district court discussed appellees' alternative contention that CIPA imposes an unconstitutional condition on the receipt of federal assistance. In the course of that discussion, the court expressed the view that appellees' position that public libraries may assert First Amendment rights ""may well be correct."" Id. at 184a n.36. The court also stated that public libraries might also be able to ""rely on their patrons' rights, even though their patrons are not the ones who are directly receiving the federal funding."" Ibid. The court further stated ""that [appellees] have a good argument that CIPA's requirement that public libraries' use of filtering software distorts the usual functioning of public libraries in such a way that it constitutes an unconstitutional condition on the receipt of funds."" Id. at 188a n.36. But the court ultimately did not resolve any of those issues. Id. at 179a-180a & 188a n.36. The court also did not address appellees' contentions that CIPA imposes a prior restraint on speech and is unconstitutionally vague. Id. at 179a.    4 Forbes held that ""[a]lthough public broadcasting as a general matter does not lend itself to scrutiny under the forum doctrine, candidate debates present the narrow exception to that rule."" 523 U.S. at 675. In that limited context, a public broadcasting station is treated as a nonpublic forum and therefore may not engage in viewpoint discrimination. Id. at 681-682. There is nothing comparable to candidate debates in the materials subject to CIPA, and there is no claim of viewpoint discrimination here.    5 See Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of the Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 829-831 (1995) (university that furnishes funds to groups to encourage a diversity of views from students may not refuse to fund speech that is otherwise within the parameters of the funding program solely on the basis of the viewpoint of the speaker); City of Madison v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm'n, 429 U.S. 167, 175-176 (1976) (school board required by law to hold public meetings where citizens participate may not ""permit one side of a debatable public question to have a monopoly in expressing its views to the government""); Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U.S. 546, 552-555, 559-560 (1975) (municipal auditorium that is dedicated to discussion of public affairs by civic and other organizations may not deny a permit without following the established procedural safeguards that must accompany prior restraints on speech); FCC v. League of Women Voters, 468 U.S. 364, 381-382, 399-400 (1984) (prohibition against editorializing by broadcast stations that receive federal funds violates First Amendment because ""the expression of editorial opinion lies at the heart of First Amendment protection,"" and because stations receiving federal assistance were not permitted to establish an ""affiliate organization"" that could then ""editorialize with non-federal funds""); Legal Servs. Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533, 546 (2001) (funding restriction that prohibits attorneys from challenging welfare laws violates the First Amendment because it restricts speech based on the anti-government viewpoint of the speaker and interferes with the proper functioning of the legal profession and the judiciary).    6 The above estimates are not inconsistent with the estimates cited by the district court that between 6% and 15% of the material blocked by filtering software is erroneously blocked. J.S. App. 149a. Those who made the 6%-15% estimates examined a sample of sites that were blocked, and determined the percentage of those sites that were erroneously blocked. Those who made the estimates in the text examined a sample of sites, without regard to whether they were blocked or unblocked, and determined the percentage of those sites that were erroneously blocked. The estimates in the text are more relevant in determining the effect of erroneous blocking on patrons, because patrons search for material throughout the entire universe of the web; they do not limit their searches to blocked sites."
GX026-57-2388298	AG Files Second          “Spam” Lawsuit           SEATTLE  - February 10, 1999 - The Attorney General's Office today          filed Washington's second lawsuit under the state's new junk e-mail law,          alleging a Georgia business owner “spammed” Washington computers          with unsolicited sales pitches that contained false and misleading information.                                                                          CP's              Junk E-Mail Page                                  Washington's              Law                                   Overview                                  Verify              Violations                                  Protect              Yourself                                                 Register              Email                                   Take              Action                                                 File              a Complaint                                  Links                           The lawsuit, filed in King County Superior Court, alleges Sam Khuri,          owner of Benchmark Print Supply in Atlanta, solicits customers over the          Internet by using unsolicited e-mail, also known as “spam,”          in violation of Washington's junk e-mail law.          “Spammers need to know we mean business,” said Attorney General          Christine Gregoire. “It's more than just an annoyance to receive          e-mail sales pitches that are misleading or contain a false return address.          In this state, it's illegal.”          The lawsuit alleges that Khuri used letters and numbers (“w37,”          “bg08”) in the subject line instead of describing the content          of the message or the products being sold; manipulated information in          the e-mail header to make it appear the message came from another computer;          and made it impossible for recipients to reply to messages by using false          or non-existent return e-mail addresses.         More than 50 individuals filed complaints against Khuri, many of whom          received multiple e-mails from him. Since the law went into effect in          June of last year, more than 1,600 complaints have been received at the          Attorney General's junk e-mail complaint mailbox, junkemail@atg.wa.gov.                 In October, the Attorney General's Office filed its first case against          Jason Heckel, a Salem, Oregon spammer who does business as Natural Instincts.          Heckel used e-mail to sell his on-line booklet, “How to Profit From          the Internet.” The lawsuit is still pending.          Washington's law prohibits the sending of unsolicited commercial e-mail          that contains misleading information in its subject line, uses a third          party's domain name without permission, or misrepresents the message's          point of origin. The state is asking for civil penalties of up to $2,000          for each violation, appropriate restitution for consumers and reimbursement          of legal costs and fees.          The state Legislature is currently considering amendments that would          strengthen Washington's law. House Bill 1037 would make it a violation          for those who assist spammers or enable them to violate the law. In addition,          it would give Internet service providers a right to sue spammers who use          their networks in violation of the providers' policies.                Index
GX019-94-15502637	Release:4007-97        For Release :March 19, 1997        CFTC ISSUES REPORT OF INVESTIGATION        In the Matter of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith,     Inc.        WASHINGTON -- The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today     announced the issuance of a  Report of Investigation  (Report)     concerning the conduct of  Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith     (Merrill Lynch),  a Commission registrant. Section 8(a)(1) of the     Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) authorizes the Commission to ``publish ... the     results of any ... investigation ... as it deems of interest to the     public.'' The Report is the first of its kind to be published by the CFTC     as a result of an investigation.        The facts addressed in the Report arose out of the Commission's     investigation of and subsequent proceeding against Richard Conroy Bell     (Bell), an associated person (AP) of Merrill Lynch. From 1990 to November     1993, while employed as a Merrill Lynch financial consultant and AP, and     for approximately six months after he left Merrill Lynch in April 1993,     Bell -- without the knowledge or consent of Merrill Lynch -- operated a     Ponzi scheme. During this time, Bell defrauded approximately 110 investors,     some of whom were Merrill Lynch customers, and misappropriated and     converted to his own use approximately $8 million from the investors in his     commodity pool, which purportedly traded crude oil futures contracts. The     CFTC filed an injunctive action against Bell in November 1993, freezing     assets and enjoining further unlawful activity (CFTC News Release #3719-93,     November 22, 1993). To date, the equity receiver appointed in that action     has recovered approximately $4.6 million for return to defrauded investors,     including approximately $3.5 million paid by Merrill Lynch. Bell pleaded     guilty to a federal wire-fraud charge and is currently incarcerated.        The Report of Investigation examines Merrill Lynch's conduct in     fulfilling its responsibility to supervise diligently the activities of its     employees. Specifically, the Report notes that in March and April of 1992,     Merrill Lynch received three inquiries regarding Bell's conduct, including     one from the Oklahoma Department of Securities, which raised issues     regarding Bell's business activities outside of his employment at Merrill     Lynch. Bell had previously disclosed certain outside activities to Merrill     Lynch; however, these inquiries from outside sources called into question     the accuracy of Bell's disclosure of the nature of his outside activity and     raised issues that properly should have been seen to impact potentially on     Merrill Lynch's supervisory responsibilities. In response to these     inquiries, Merrill Lynch interviewed Bell and accepted both oral and     written representations from him pertaining to his outside activity.     Merrill Lynch did nothing to confirm independently or to corroborate any of     Bell's explanations, which ultimately proved to be false. The Report notes     that, based on Bell's misrepresentations, Merrill Lynch concluded that his     outside business was a matter outside the scope of his employment at     Merrill Lynch and that, therefore, Merrill Lynch erroneously determined     that further investigation was not required.        The CFTC's Report concludes that information regarding an employee's     outside business activity, particularly information raising questions about     whether the employee has deceived or misled his employer and others, is     relevant to an assessment of the employee's ability to continue to perform     activities on behalf of his employer and the level of supervision required     of that employee. Information, such as that which came to Merrill Lynch's     attention, at the very least needed to be investigated sufficiently to     determine whether it was relevant to Merrill Lynch's business as a     registrant with the CFTC. The Report finds that Merrill Lynch's     investigation into Bell's outside activities was inadequate because, among     other things, it was limited to obtaining uncorroborated explanations from     Bell and therefore did not fulfill Merrill Lynch's supervisory obligations     under the CEA and CFTC regulations.        Geoffrey Aronow, Director of the CFTC's Division of Enforcement stated,     ``This Report re-emphasizes the Commission's continued concern with proper     supervision. The Report makes clear that Commission rules require that a     firm properly follow up on all information that raises issues about its     supervision of its employees' conduct relating to its business as a     registrant. That information can, as it did here, arise from outside     business activities. Nevertheless, if that information potentially impacts     on the firm's supervisory duties, it must be properly pursued. Merrill     Lynch failed to do so here.''        Mr. Aronow also said: ``Because the issue of what level of inquiry a     Commission registrant is required to make regarding the outside business     activities of its employees when those activities appear to raise issues     relating to its business as a Commission registrant is one of first     impression, the Commission, in its discretion, determined to issue the     Report, in lieu of bringing an enforcement action against Merrill     Lynch.''        CFTC Commissioner John E. Tull, Jr., dissented from the Commission's     issuance of the Report.        # # #             Updated February 1, 2001

XVII, 114 Stat. 2763A-335, provides that a library that is otherwise eligible for special federal assistance for Internet access in the form of discount rates for educational purposes under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 47 U.S.C. 254(h) (Supp. V 1999), or grants under the Library Services and Technology Act, 20 U.S.C. 9121 et seq., may not receive that assistance unless the library has in place a policy that includes the operation of a ""technology protection measure"" on Internet-connected computers that protects against access by all persons to ""visual depictions"" that are ""obscene"" or ""child pornography,"" and that protects against access by minors to ""visual depictions"" that are ""harmful to minors."" 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(6)(B) and (C) (Supp. V 1999); 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(1).    The question presented is whether CIPA induces public libraries to violate the First Amendment, thereby exceeding Congress's power under the Spending Clause.

App. 1a-191a) is reported at 201 F. Supp. 2d 401.    JURISDICTION    The order of the district court (J.S. App. 191a) was entered on May 31, 2002. A notice of appeal (J.S. App. 209a-211a) was filed on June 20, 2002. The jurisdiction of this Court is invoked under Section 1741(b) of the Children's Internet Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 106-554, Div. B, Tit. XVII, 114 Stat. 2763A-352, and 28 U.S.C. 1253.    CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY  PROVISIONS INVOLVED      Article 1, Section 8, Clause 1 of the Constitution provides that ""[t]he Congress shall have Power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts, and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States."" The First Amendment of the Constitution provides that ""Congress shall make no law * * * abridging the freedom of speech."" The pertinent provisions of the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA), Pub. L. No. 106-554, Div. B, Tit. XVII, 114 Stat. 2763A-335, the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 47 U.S.C. 254(h) (Supp. V 1999), and the Library Services and Technology Act, 20 U.S.C. 9121, 9122, 9133, 9134, 9141, are reproduced in a separately bound appendix to this jurisdictional statement. J.S. App. 192a-208a.    STATEMENT    1. Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 47 U.S.C. 251 et seq., telecommunications providers must provide Internet access at discounted rates (E-rates) to elementary schools, secondary schools, and libraries for educational purposes. 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(1)(B) (Supp. V 1999). Discounts under the E-rate program reduce the cost of Internet access by 20% to 90%, depending on the extent of economic disadvantage in a particular location. See 47 C.F.R. 54.505. For the year ending June 30, 2002, libraries and library consortia received $58.5 million in E-rate discounts. Joint Trial Stipulations para. 128. The Universal Service Administrative Company administers the E-rate program under the supervision of the Federal Communications Commission. 47 C.F.R. 54.701, 54.702.    The Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA), 20 U.S.C. 9121 et seq., also establishes a program of federal assistance to libraries. Under that program, the Institute of Museum and Library Services makes grants of congressionally appropriated funds to state library administrative agencies with approved plans. See 20 U.S.C. 9133, 9141. Those grants may be used for, inter alia, ""electronically linking libraries with educational, social, or information services"" and ""paying costs for libraries to acquire or share computer systems and telecommunications technologies."" 20 U.S.C. 9141(a)(1)(B) and (E). In fiscal year 2002, Congress appropriated more than $149 million in LSTA grants for state library agencies. Joint Trial Stipulations para. 185.    Aided by the E-rate and LSTA programs, libraries have increasingly provided their patrons with access to content on the Internet. In 1996, 44.4% of public libraries in the United States were connected to the Internet. United States Nat'l Comm'n on Libraries and Information Science, Moving Toward More Effective Public Internet Access: The 1998 National Survey of Public Library Outlet Internet Connectivity 5 (Mar. 1999). By 2000, 95% of the nation's libraries were connected to the Internet. J.S. App. 36a.    Congress established the E-rate and LSTA programs in order to further the educational, learning, and informational missions of libraries. See 47 U.S.C. 254(h) (Supp. V 1999); 20 U.S.C. 9121, 9141(a)(1)(B). Congress recognized, however, that a library's connection to the Internet could also enable library patrons to obtain access to a vast amount of illegal and harmful pornographic visual depictions. S. Rep. No. 141, 106th Cong., 1st Sess. 2 (1999). Congress was concerned that facilitating access to such pornographic material would be inconsistent with the educational purposes of the assistance it was providing. S. Rep. No. 226, 105th Cong., 2d Sess. 5 (1998). The Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation held a hearing to examine the nature of the problem and potential legislative solutions.1 During that hearing, evidence was presented that filtering software could provide a reasonably effective way to prevent access to illegal and harmful pornographic material. S. Rep. No. 226, supra, at 5-6.    Following the hearing, Congress enacted the Children's Internet Protection Act, which provides that a library may not receive assistance to establish access to the Internet under the E-rate or LSTA program, unless it has a policy of Internet safety that includes the operation of a ""technology protection measure"" that protects against access by all persons to ""visual depictions"" that are ""obscene"" or ""child pornography,"" and that protects against access by minors to ""visual depictions"" that are ""harmful to minors."" 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(1)(A)(i) and (B)(i); 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(6)(B)(i) and (C)(i) (Supp. V 1999). A ""technology protection measure"" is defined as ""a specific technology that blocks or filters Internet access to"" material covered by CIPA. 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(7)(I) (Supp. V 1999).2    CIPA permits the ""disabling"" of a technology protection measure ""to enable access for bona fide research or other lawful purposes."" 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(3); 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(6)(D) (Supp. V 1999). Under the E-rate program, disabling is permitted ""during use by an adult."" 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(6)(D) (Supp. V 1999). Under the LSTA program, disabling is permitted during use by any person. 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(3).    Congress enacted CIPA pursuant to its authority under the Spending Clause of the Constitution, Article I, Section 8, Clause 1, to establish conditions on the receipt of federal assistance. S. Rep. No. 141, supra, at 8. Congress made clear that if a library wishes to provide unfiltered access, it may do so with its own funds. S. Rep. No. 226, supra, at 5. Congress also noted that CIPA involves filtering material based on its sexually explicit content, not based on its viewpoint. Ibid.    Congress also understood that a library is not a traditional public forum open to unrestricted First Amendment activity. Congress was aware that libraries impose strict rules to maintain ""an atmosphere for reading and study,"" that ""[p]atrons are not permitted to give speeches, make public statements, sing, [or] speak loudly,"" and that ""[i]t is the exclusive authority of the library to make affirmative decisions regarding what books, magazines, or other material is placed on library shelves, or otherwise made available to patrons."" S. Rep. No. 141, supra, at 8. Congress did not view a decision to provide Internet access as fundamentally altering the library's mission. Instead, it viewed such access as a component of the library's overall assembling of a collection. In Congress's judgment, connecting a library computer to the Internet ""is simply another method for making information available in a * * * library. It is no more than a technological extension of the book stack."" Id. at 7.    2. A group of libraries, library associations, library patrons, and web site publishers (appellees) filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against the United States and the government agencies and officials responsible for administering the E-rate and LSTA programs, challenging the constitutionality of CIPA's filtering provisions. J.S. App. 5a. Appellees alleged that CIPA is facially unconstitutional because it induces public libraries to violate the First Amendment, and because it imposes an unconstitutional condition on a library's exercise of its own First Amendment rights. Ibid. Pursuant to Section 1741(a) of CIPA, a three-judge district court was convened. J.S. App. 6a. After a trial, the district court held that CIPA is facially unconstitutional because it induces public libraries to violate the First Amendment rights of their patrons. Id. at 13a. The court accordingly enjoined the government agencies and officials responsible for administering the E-rate and LSTA programs from withholding federal assistance from any public library for failure to comply with CIPA. Id. at 191a.    The district court analyzed the constitutionality of CIPA under the framework for Spending Clause legislation set forth in South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207-210 (1987). J.S. App. 95a. Under that decision, the district court explained, Congress may not use its spending power ""to induce the States to engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional."" Ibid. (quoting Dole, 483 U.S. at 210). For purposes of its analysis under Dole, the district court assumed that CIPA would be facially unconstitutional only if ""any public library that complies with CIPA's conditions will necessarily violate the First Amendment."" Id. at 102a. The court held that CIPA is facially unconstitutional when measured against that standard. Ibid.    The district court acknowledged that ""generally the First Amendment subjects libraries' content-based decisions about which print materials to acquire for their collections to only rational [basis] review."" J.S. App. 120a. But the court refused to apply that same constitutional analysis to libraries' content-based decisions regarding material they acquire from the Internet. Id. at 121a. The court reasoned that rational basis review applies to a government's ""editorial discretion in selecting certain speech for subsidization or inclusion in a state-created forum"" only when ""the state actor exercising the editorial discretion has at least reviewed the content of the speech that the forum facilitates."" Ibid. In the court's view, ""[t]his exercise of editorial discretion is evident in a library's decision to acquire certain books for its collection."" Id. at 122a. In contrast, the court continued, ""in providing patrons with even filtered Internet access, a public library invites patrons to access speech whose content has never been reviewed and recommended as particularly valuable by either a librarian or a third party to whom the library has delegated collection development decisions."" Id. at 123a. Based on its understanding that a library that provides Internet access ""indiscriminately facilitates private speech whose content it makes no effort to examine,"" id. at 125a, the court concluded that a library that offers Internet access necessarily creates a ""designated public forum,"" id. at 109a.    The court next held that a public library's content-based restrictions on access to that ""forum"" trigger strict scrutiny. J.S. App. 128a. Based on its analysis of this Court's public forum and government subsidy decisions, id. at 127a-128a, the district court concluded that ""where a public library opens a forum to an unlimited number of speakers around the world to speak on an unlimited number of topics, strict scrutiny applies to the library's selective exclusions of particular speech whose content the library disfavors,"" id. at 128a. The court also concluded that strict scrutiny is applicable based on its understanding that a library's provision of Internet access ""promotes First Amendment values in an analogous manner to traditional public fora, such as sidewalks and parks, in which content-based restrictions on speech are always subject to strict scrutiny."" Ibid.    Applying strict scrutiny, the district court first held that the government has a ""well-established"" compelling interest ""in preventing the dissemination of obscenity, child pornography, or, in the case of minors, material [that is] harmful to minors."" J.S. App. 139a. The court next concluded that, in certain circumstances, ""a public library might have a compelling interest in protecting library patrons and staff from unwilling exposure to sexually explicit speech that, although not obscene, is patently offensive."" Id. at 146a. Furthermore, the court found that ""[t]he volume of pornography on the Internet is huge,"" and that ""library patrons of all ages, many from 11 to 15, have regularly sought to access it in public library settings."" Id. at 2a. The district court nonetheless held that a public library's use of software filters to prevent access to categories such as ""full nudity"" and ""sexual activity"" (3/28/02 Biek Test. 29) is not narrowly tailored to further the government's interests. J.S. App. 149a. The court found that because of the limits of technology, filters set to prevent access to those categories also restrict ""many thousands of Web pages that are clearly not harmful to minors, and many thousands more pages that, while possibly harmful to minors, are neither obscene nor child pornography."" Id. at 148a-149a.    The district court also concluded there are less restrictive ways to prevent access to the content covered by CIPA. J.S. App. 157a-167a. The court determined that libraries ""can adopt Internet use policies that make clear to patrons that the library's Internet terminals may not be used to access illegal content,"" and they ""can detect violations of their Internet use policies either through direct observation or through review of the library's Internet use logs."" Id. at 158a-159a. The court similarly determined that there are less intrusive methods to prevent patrons from ""unwillingly being exposed to patently offensive, sexually explicit content,"" such as ""plac[ing] unfiltered terminals outside of patrons' sight-lines and areas of heavy traffic"" and ""us[ing] privacy screens or recessed monitors."" Id. at 165a-166a.    Finally, the district court held that CIPA's provisions permitting the disabling of filtering software do not cure CIPA's lack of narrow tailoring. J.S. App. 167a-177a. The court ""assume[d] without deciding that the disabling provisions permit libraries to allow a patron access to any speech that is constitutionally protected with respect to that patron."" Id. at 170a. It nonetheless held that ""the requirement that library patrons ask a state actor's permission to access disfavored content violates the First Amendment."" Ibid. The court reasoned that patrons would be deterred from asking for permission to obtain access to information that is ""sensitive in nature."" Id. at 172a. While the court recognized that libraries may permit anonymous requests to disable filtering software, it regarded that option as inadequate because ""such requests cannot immediately be acted on."" Id. at 174a.3    THE QUESTION PRESENTED IS SUBSTANTIAL    This case involves a challenge to the constitutionality of two provisions of the Children's Internet Protection Act under which a public library may not receive federal assistance for Internet access unless it uses filtering software that prevents patrons from obtaining access to visual depictions on the Internet that are obscene, child pornography, or (in the case of minors) harmful to minors. The district court declared those two provisions unconstitutional on their face and enjoined their enforcement.    The district court's decision directly frustrates Congress's effort to ensure that special federal assistance made available to libraries to enable them to establish and maintain access to the Internet for educational and other purposes does not facilitate access to the enormous amount of illegal and harmful pornography on the Internet. Equally disturbing, by holding that a public library's use of filtering software to prevent access to the visual depictions covered by CIPA violates the First Amendment, the district court's decision deprives all the nation's public libraries-without regard to whether they receive federal assistance-of the ability to make their own independent judgments concerning how to avoid becoming a conduit for illegal and harmful material.    The district court's First Amendment holding is incorrect. A public library may exercise content-based judgments in deciding what information to make available to its patrons without violating the First Amendment. That principle not only applies to a library's acquisition of books, magazines, and videos; it also applies to a library's decisions regarding the material it will provide through its Internet-connected computers. A library that refuses to make available to its patrons pornographic magazines or XXX videos may also refuse to make available comparable material through those computers.    CIPA specifies that a decision holding its filtering provisions unconstitutional ""shall be reviewable as a matter of right by direct appeal"" to this Court. Pub. L. No. 106-554, App. D, § 1741(b), 114 Stat. 2763A-352. Because the district court invalidated important provisions of an Act of Congress on their face and did so based on an erroneous constitutional analysis, the Court should note probable jurisdiction of the government's appeal and set the case for plenary review.    A. THE QUESTION PRESENTED IS IMPORTANT    This case involves the facial validity of Congress's effort in CIPA to ensure that federal assistance to libraries to establish Internet access does not facilitate access to visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors. Two CIPA provisions are at issue. The first provides that a library may not receive E-rate discounts for Internet service for educational purposes unless the library has in place a policy that includes the operation of a ""technology protection measure"" on Internet-connected computers that protects against access by all persons to ""visual depictions"" that are ""obscene"" or ""child pornography,"" and that protects against access by minors to ""visual depictions"" that are ""harmful to minors."" 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(6)(B)-(C) (Supp. V 1999). The second provision at issue imposes the same condition on a library's receipt of grants to establish Internet access under the Library Services and Technology Act. 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(1).    The district court expressly held that each of those provisions ""is facially invalid, since [each] will induce public libraries, as state actors, to violate the First Amendment."" J.S. App. 179a. The court's invalidation of CIPA's filtering provisions has profound consequences for both the federal government and the nation's public libraries. The court's ruling eliminates the protection Congress adopted to ensure that the assistance it provides to libraries to facilitate access to the wealth of valuable information on the Internet does not simultaneously enable access to the enormous amount of illegal and harmful pornography that pervades the Internet.    The consequences for the nation's public libraries are equally unsettling. Public libraries often have policies that preclude the use of Internet-connected computers to obtain access to pornographic visual depictions, J.S. App. 37a, and, as of June 2000, 7% of those libraries already used filtering software on all of their computers as a means of furthering those policies, id. at 45a. The district court's ruling flatly condemns the use of any filtering software to enforce standard library policies against access to pornography. Id. at 179a. Moreover, under the district court's view that strict scrutiny applies to any content-based restriction on Internet access, id. at 128a, the standard policies of libraries to prevent access to pornographic visual depictions are themselves presumptively unconstitutional and may survive only if they are narrowly tailored to further compelling interests. The question presented in this case-whether CIPA's filtering provisions induce public libraries to violate the First Amendment rights of their patrons-is therefore one of great public importance.    B. CIPA'S FILTERING PROVISIONS ARE FACIALLY VALID    The district court erred in holding that CIPA is facially unconstitutional. While Congress may not use its spending authority ""to induce the States to engage in activities that would themselves be unconstitutional,"" Dole, 483 U.S. at 210, CIPA does no such thing. A public library's use of filtering software to prevent its computers from being used to obtain access to the pornographic material covered by CIPA is a constitutionally permissible means for a public library to exercise control over the material that it provides to its patrons. The district court's contrary conclusion rests on an unprecedented and erroneous application of strict scrutiny to a public library's exercise of editorial judgment.    1. A Public Library Does Not Create A Forum When It Provides Internet Access Through Its Own Computers, And Its Judgments Regarding The Material It Will Make Available Are Not Subject To Strict Scrutiny    a. The district court's application of strict scrutiny rests on the court's mistaken view that a public library creates a public forum when it provides access to content on the Internet through its own computers. A public library's exercise of judgment in selecting the material it will make available to its patrons is not subject to forum analysis. Forum analysis and its accompanying heightened judicial scrutiny are incompatible with the long-established and necessary discretion that public libraries must have to fulfill their traditional missions.    The first public library, the Boston Public Library, opened in 1854, and had as its original mission ""to promote equality of education opportunity, to advance scientific investigation, to save youth from the evils of an ill-spent leisure, and to promote the vocational advancement of the workers."" Expert Report of Donald G. Davis, Jr. 2. Over time, public libraries began to collect materials to serve additional purposes. For example, driven in part by a desire to serve broader community interests, libraries collect popular fiction as well as more traditional works. But facilitating learning and cultural enrichment has remained the traditional mission for most public libraries. Indeed, the American Library Association's Bill of Rights still provides that ""[b]ooks and other library resources should be provided for the interest, information, and enlightenment of all people of the community the library serves."" J.S. App. 32a.    Consistent with their missions, libraries have always exercised judgment in deciding what materials to collect. In performing that important function, libraries have considered the content and value of available works as well as the needs and interests of the community. J.S. App. 35a. Libraries often rely on journal reviews and bibliographies as selection aids and establish standards to guide their collection decisions. Ibid. Libraries may also delegate to third party vendors the task of supplying resources that satisfy the library's collection standards. Ibid. In all cases, however, libraries remain responsible for the content of their collections. Ibid. Consistent with their traditional mission and their overriding responsibility to the communities that they serve, most libraries exclude pornographic works from their collections. 3/29/02 Cronin Test. 91. Only a handful of libraries collect Hustler magazine or XXX movie titles. J.S. App. 33a & n.4.    No decision of this Court suggests that forum analysis applies to a public library's traditional collection practices and decisions. Still less do this Court's decisions suggest that public libraries must justify the judgments they make in assembling their collections as narrowly tailored to further compelling interests. To the contrary, this Court's precedents make clear that the government has broad discretion to decide whether material is sufficiently worthwhile to involve the government in providing it. NEA v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 585-588 (1998); Arkansas Educ. Television Comm'n v. Forbes, 523 U.S. 666, 672-675 (1998); Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 193-194 (1991). That principle applies with particular force to public libraries.    Any other approach would risk transforming the role of public libraries in our society. Instead of public libraries exercising responsibility for the resources that they make available to the public, forum analysis would threaten to substitute judicial judgments regarding what is appropriate. Cf. Arkansas Educ. Television, 523 U.S. at 674. A public library's traditional exercise of discretion to determine what materials to collect would be particularly threatened by application of strict scrutiny to collection decisions, which would require a library to establish that a challenged decision furthers a ""compelling"" interest, and that ""plausible"" less restrictive alternatives would not be effective. United States v. Playboy Entm't Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 813, 816 (2000). Libraries would often be hard-pressed to show that the selection of one resource rather than another always furthers a ""compelling"" government interest. Nor are libraries likely to be in a position to demonstrate that there are no ""plausible"" alternatives that would be less restrictive, while still serving the library's overall collection goals. Libraries would also be vulnerable to charges that they have collected too many or too few works containing particular viewpoints. The very prospect of strict judicial review of collection decisions could chill libraries from exercising traditional editorial judgments.    b. The district court accepted the principle that libraries may select books for their collections on the basis of content without triggering strict scrutiny. Such collection decisions, the court concluded, are subject only to rational basis review. J.S. App. 120a. But the court refused to apply that same analysis to a public library's editorial judgments regarding the content that it makes available through its Internet-connected computers. The court reasoned that, because public libraries do not exercise individualized judgments regarding the value of all web sites that they make available through their computers, they create public forums, from which any content-based exclusion must be justified under strict scrutiny. Id. at 125a-128a. That analysis is seriously flawed.    A public library does not provide Internet access in order to create a public forum for web publishers to speak, any more than it collects books in order to provide a public forum for the authors of the books to speak. It provides Internet access for the very same reasons that it offers other library resources-to facilitate research, learning, and enlightenment. Because of the vast amount of material on the Internet, and its ever-changing nature, it would be impossible for any public library to review every web site and make an individualized determination regarding whether that site has sufficient value to further the library's mission. But a public library's inability to review every web site in advance does not divest it of its traditional authority to make selective judgments regarding the information that it will provide to its patrons. The Internet does not need to be, as the district court assumed, an all-or-nothing proposition. Indeed, many libraries have taken actions demonstrating efforts to exercise the same kind of editorial judgments concerning the Internet that they routinely apply to other media.    For example, many libraries have decided that certain web sites have particular value, and they therefore provide links to those sites on the first screen a patron views on the library's computers. Joint Trial Stipulations para. 268. That judgment plainly gives certain web speakers preferred access to library patrons on the basis of the content of their web sites. But it would be extraordinary to suggest that such a decision by a public library is presumptively unconstitutional.    Similarly, many libraries exercise their discretion to preclude the use of their computers to obtain access to certain Internet resources. For example, some libraries do not allow patrons to use the libraries' computers to send and receive e-mail messages or to participate in chat rooms because they regard the Internet primarily as a research and information tool. J.S. App. 37a-38a; GX 33, at 2-3, 83. Other libraries have concluded that web sites that include games, personals, or dating services are not sufficiently valuable or compatible with the libraries' mission to justify providing access to them. J.S. App. 37a-38a; GX 33, at 2-3, 83. Still others prevent access to sites that contain graphic violence or tasteless material. GX 71, 83, 99, 242, 244, 247. Those decisions reflect the same kind of judgments that libraries make when they decide what books, magazines, tapes, CD-ROMS, and videos to add to their collections. Nothing in this Court's First Amendment jurisprudence suggests that those decisions should be subjected to forum analysis, much less to strict scrutiny.    The same is true when a library decides to prevent its computers from being used to obtain access to visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors by enabling their computers to filter out such categories as ""sexual activity"" and ""full nudity."" If libraries have the discretion to refrain from including pornographic magazines and XXX movies in their collections, as they unquestionably do, there is no reason that a library's judgment not to offer access to comparable material on the Internet should be treated as inherently suspect and presumptively unconstitutional.    c. In invoking forum analysis and applying strict scrutiny, the district court confused the constitutional status of the Internet itself with the constitutional status of a library's decision whether to allow the use its own computers to provide access to various types of material on the Internet. The Internet itself is a forum for First Amendment activity, but it is not one that is government-owned. When government places restrictions on what content may be placed on the Internet, it acts as a regulator of private activity, and its restrictions are subject to strict scrutiny. Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844 (1997). In contrast, when a public library brings Internet content into the library through its own computers, it acts as a collector of materials that it will make available to its patrons. In that capacity, the library necessarily has both the responsibility and the discretion to decide how little or how much of the Internet's content to provide. A web site publisher has no more right to insist on access to library patrons through library computers than a book author has to insist on access to library patrons through a library's book stacks.    d. Acceptance of the district court's contrary view would produce a number of startling consequences. Under the district court's analysis, a public library that provides Internet access only to the limited number of web sites the library regards as having particular value would have broad discretion to make those selection decisions. In contrast, a public library that provides access to a much wider range of materials without making individualized value judgments, but prevents access to certain materials because the library determines that they lack sufficient value or are not sufficiently related to its mission, would have to justify its selection decisions under strict scrutiny. The district court's approach would therefore create a perverse incentive for a library to make available less information to its patrons in order to preserve its traditional discretion.    The district court's analysis would also seem to extend to any other resource to which a library makes a connection. For example, if a library establishes a television room with cable access, it would have to satisfy strict scrutiny to justify a decision to block programs that contain frontal nudity. Similarly, a library that offers telephone service to its adult patrons would have to satisfy strict scrutiny to preclude the use of the phone to obtain access to dial-a-porn.    Those consequences underscore the fundamental flaw in the district court's analysis. A public library has broad discretion to make content-based judgments regarding the material it makes available to the public, and forum analysis and strict scrutiny have no application to those decisions.4    2. Even If A Library's Connection Of Its Computers To The Internet Created A Forum, Strict Scrutiny Would Not Apply    Even if a public library's Internet-connected computers were subjected to forum analysis, strict scrutiny would not apply to a library's use of filtering software. ""[T]he Court [has] identified three types of fora: the traditional public forum, the public forum created by government designation, and the nonpublic forum."" Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 802 (1985). Traditional public fora are limited to those venues such as streets and parks that have ""immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and, time out of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly, communication of thoughts between citizens, and discussing public questions."" International Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness, Inc., v. Lee, 505 U.S. 672, 679 (1992) (quoting Hague v. Committee for Indus. Org., 307 U.S. 496, 515 (1939)). The Court ""has rejected the view that traditional public forum status extends beyond its historic confines."" Arkansas Educ. Television, 523 U.S. at 678. Accordingly, if forum analysis were applicable to a library's Internet-connected computers, they could only be non-public fora or designated public fora. In either event, strict scrutiny would not apply to a library's use of filtering software to prevent access to material covered by CIPA.    The government may limit access to a non-public forum ""based on subject matter and speaker identity so long as the distinctions drawn are reasonable in light of the purposes served by the forum and are viewpoint neutral."" Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 806. In a designated forum, the government may limit the forum to certain purposes, and then impose limitations that are ""reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum."" Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995) (quoting Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 406). A content restriction is permissible in such a forum ""if it preserves the purposes of [the] limited forum,"" while viewpoint discrimination ""is presumed impermissible when directed against speech otherwise within the forum's limitations."" Id. at 830.    The use of filtering software to prevent access to the graphic depictions covered by CIPA does not involve any distinctions based on viewpoint. See R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 384 (1992); Bethel Sch. Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U.S. 675, 684-685 (1986). FCC v. Pacifica Found., 438 U.S. 726, 745-746 (1978) (plurality opinion). Moreover, libraries may regard the purposes of providing access to the Internet not to encompass providing access to the illegal, harmful, and low-value content covered by CIPA, just as many libraries view the purposes of collecting magazines not to encompass providing access to pornographic magazines. Consequently, if a library's Internet-connected computers were subjected to forum analysis, the relevant inquiry would not be whether the use of filtering software is narrowly tailored to achieve compelling interests, but whether its use is ""reasonable in light of the purposes served by the forum."" Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 806; Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 839.    3. Regardless Of The Standard Of Review, A Library's Use Of Filtering Software Is Constitutionally Permissible    Under the correct constitutional analysis, a library's use of filtering software to prevent access to material covered by CIPA is subject to rational basis review. See pp. 14-20, supra. Under that standard, the constitutionality of using filtering software to prevent access to material covered by CIPA cannot reasonably be questioned. But regardless of whether the appropriate standard of review is ""rational basis,"" ""reasonable in light of the purposes served by the forum,"" or ""strict scrutiny,"" a library's use of filtering software is a permissible exercise of the library's editorial discretion to determine what content it will make available to its patrons.    a. The district court concluded that the use of filtering software is constitutionally deficient because all leading commercial filters block a substantial amount of material that does not fit into the categories identified by CIPA or the software categories, such as ""sexual activity and ""full nudity,"" that best capture CIPA material. J.S. App. 149a. For several reasons, that technological imperfection does not call into question the constitutionality of filtering software.    First, the district court's own findings show that filtering software erroneously blocks a fraction of 1% of the material on the Internet. J.S. App. 85a (finding that one or more of the leading filtering programs erroneously blocked several thousand sites in a 500,000 web site sample that was deliberately skewed to overstate the degree of overblocking). Second, much information that is erroneously blocked can be found on another web site or on the library's bookshelves. 4/1/02 Davis Test. 92 (much information can be found on other sites); 3/28/02 Biek Test. 97-98 (finding that the first 50 sites in a search of ""breast cancer"" were not blocked); J.S. App. 33a (finding that many libraries carry the The Joy of Sex and The Joy of Gay Sex). Third, libraries have the capacity to permanently unblock an erroneously blocked site. Id. at 46a. Finally, CIPA authorizes a library to disable filtering software altogether ""to enable access for bona fide research or other lawful purposes."" 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(3) (all patrons) (LSTA program); 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(6)(D) (Supp. V 1999) (adults only) (E-rate program).    Because of the first two factors, a patron will rarely need to obtain access to a site that has been blocked in order to obtain the information he or she seeks at the library. Because of the last two factors, in the rare cases in which a patron is unable to find the information, the patron need only ask a librarian to unblock the site or (at least in the case of adults) disable the filter.    The district court viewed unblocking and disabling as inadequate because some patrons may be too embarrassed to ask for assistance from a librarian. J.S. App. 172a. Throughout the history of libraries, however, patrons have asked for help when they could not find the information they needed by themselves. Moreover, anyone who has been in a library knows that most librarians are eager to provide such assistance, and that they do so without intruding on privacy. Indeed, librarians answer more than seven million questions weekly. Id. at 33a-34a.    In any event, a library has the ability to process anonymous unblocking requests. J.S. App. 173a. As the district court noted, such requests may not always be processed immediately. Id. at 174a. But the district court's view that a patron of a public library has a First Amendment right to demand that librarians immediately process a request for information, rather than perform their myriad other responsibilities, is unprecedented and insupportable. The patron always has the option to seek access to the Internet somewhere else, rather than through the computers made available at the local public library.    b. The district court also found that there are less restrictive and equally effective ways to preclude access on computers in a public library to the pornographic visual depictions covered by CIPA. In particular, the court concluded that libraries can make clear to patrons that the library's Internet terminals may not be used to obtain access to illegal or harmful content, and libraries can detect violations through direct observation or through logs that reveal all the sites that a patron selects. J.S. App. 158a-159a. But a system under which librarians closely monitor everyone using computers to make sure that they are not viewing material covered by CIPA would be far more intrusive, not less intrusive, than the use of filtering software. Such a regime also would materially alter the experience of visiting the library for patrons generally, including the many who prefer to steer clear (and to have their children steer clear) of pornographic web sites and would be quite content to have the library help them do so. With respect to all other media, libraries are free to make a judgment that material that would be harmful to a substantial portion of patrons should not be provided to any patrons to avoid the need for such counterproductive monitoring. Libraries should be free to make the same judgment as to the Internet.    It is also difficult to see how the district court's alternative would withstand the court's constitutional analysis. If, as the district court held, requiring a patron to request unblocking would be unconstitutional because it would deter some patrons from seeking useful information, close monitoring of patrons would seemingly be unconstitutional as well because it too would deter some patrons from seeking useful information.    The district court's proposed alternative would also risk transforming the role of a librarian from an aid to whom patrons turn for assistance in finding information into a compliance officer that many patrons might wish to avoid. Such a fundamental change in the relationship between patrons and librarians would retard rather than promote First Amendment values. Under the court's alternative, moreover, librarians would be needlessly exposed to material that many would prefer not to see.    Those difficulties could be largely avoided through reliance on an honor system in which the library simply announces a policy and hopes it will be followed. But it is implausible to suggest that such a hands-off approach would be as effective as the use of a filtering device. Moreover, such a toothless policy would also have difficulty surviving the district court's version of strict scrutiny. A challenger could readily argue that such an approach would deter compliant patrons from viewing material that is constitutionally protected, but close to the line, while having no effect on patrons who are determined to obtain access to illegal or harmful content.5    In the end, the only way for a library to comply with the district court's decision may be to refrain from adopting any Internet policy, and to leave access decisions entirely in the hands of library patrons. Some libraries may wish to adopt such a policy, but the First Amendment surely does not require it, and Congress need not subsidize it.    In sum, Congress permissibly conditioned the federal assistance it provides to public libraries to establish Internet access on a library's willingness to use filtering software to prevent access to depictions on the Internet that are child pornography, obscene, or harmful to minors. The district court erred in holding that CIPA thereby causes public libraries to violate the First Amendment.6         CONCLUSION    The Court should note probable jurisdiction.

GORNSTEIN  Assistant to the Solicitor  General  BARBARA L. HERWIG  JACOB M. LEWIS  H. THOMAS BYRON III  Attorneys      SEPTEMBER 2002    1 See The Children's Internet Protection Act: Hearing on S. 97 Before the Senate Comm. on Commerce, Science and Transportation, 106th Cong., 1st Sess. (1999).    2 CIPA adopts the definitions of ""obscene"" and ""child pornography"" set forth in the federal criminal code. 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(7)(D); 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(7)(E) (Supp. V 1999) (incorporating 18 U.S.C. 1460's definition of ""obscene""); 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(7)(A); 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(7)(F) (Supp. V 1999) (incorporating 18 U.S.C. 2256's definition of ""child pornography""). CIPA defines ""harmful to minors"" as ""any picture, image, graphic image file or other visual depiction that-(i) taken as a whole and with respect to minors, appeals to a prurient interest in nudity, sex, or excretion; (ii) depicts, describes, or represents, in a patently offensive way with respect to what is suitable for minors, an actual or simulated sexual act or sexual contact, actual or simulated normal or perverted sexual acts, or a lewd exhibition of the genitals; and (iii) taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value as to minors."" 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(7)(B); 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(7)(G) (Supp. V 1999). CIPA defines a ""minor"" as an individual under the age of 17. 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(7)(C); 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(7)(D) (Supp. V 1999).    3 In a lengthy footnote (J.S. App. 180a-188a n.36), the district court discussed appellees' alternative contention that CIPA imposes an unconstitutional condition on the First Amendment rights of libraries. In the course of that discussion, the court expressed the view that appellees' position that public libraries may assert First Amendment rights ""may well be correct."" Id. at 184a n.36. The court also stated that public libraries might also be able to ""rely on their patrons' rights, even though their patrons are not the ones who are directly receiving the federal funding."" Ibid. And the court further stated ""that [appellees] have a good argument that CIPA's requirement that public libraries' use [of] filtering software distorts the usual functioning of public libraries in such a way that it constitutes an unconstitutional condition on the receipt of funds."" Id. at 188a n.36. But the court ultimately did not resolve any of those issues. Id. at 179a-180a & 188a n.36. The court also did not address appellees' contentions that CIPA constitutes an invalid prior restraint on speech and is unconstitutionally vague. Id. at 179a.    4 The district court's analysis would also seem to apply no matter where the government locates an Internet-connected computer. Under the court's analysis, a government that provides access to the Internet at city hall or a public hospital would have to justify under strict scrutiny its decision to use a filter to block illegal and harmful pornographic content.    5 The district court concluded that a library could protect patrons from unwilling exposure to depictions covered by CIPA by moving terminals to places where their displays cannot easily be seen by other patrons, or by purchasing privacy screens or recessed monitors. J.S. App. 165a-166a. But those alternatives would not prevent the patrons at the computers from obtaining access to visual depictions that are child pornography, obscene, or harmful to minors. To the contrary, by making it more difficult for library officials to monitor activity on the computers, the court's alternatives would make it easier for patrons to obtain access to the visual depictions covered by CIPA. Those alternatives also would not address the interest of librarians in avoiding unwilling exposure.    6 There is also no merit to appellees' alternative contention that CIPA imposes an unconstitutional condition on a library's First Amendment right to provide unfiltered access to the Internet. This Court has never addressed whether governmental entities have First Amendment rights. But the courts of appeals that have addressed the issue have concluded that they do not. Warner Cable Communications, Inc. v. City of Niceville, 911 F.2d 634, 638 (11th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1222 (1991); NAACP v. Hunt, 891 F.2d 1555, 1565 (11th Cir. 1990); Student Gov't Ass'n v. Board of Trustees of Univ. of Mass., 868 F.2d 473, 481 (1st Cir. 1989). In any event, Congress may define a federally assisted program to include limitations on speech-related activity without violating the First Amendment rights of the recipients, provided that the recipients may continue to engage in the speech-related activity outside the federal program. Rust, 500 U.S. at 196; FCC v. League of Women Voters, 468 U.S. 364, 400 (1984); Regan v. Taxation with Representation, 461 U.S. 540, 545-546 (1983). That standard is satisfied here. Libraries that accept federal assistance are free to establish unfiltered computers at facilities or branches that do not receive assistance under the E-rate or LSTA programs."

Blocking      software not only fails to block all harmful material, but it also      over-blocks many sites that are protected under the First Amendment.        Political       sites were blocked in the last election, including House Majority Leader       Dick Armey and Congressman Ed Markey.        CHIPA     restricts adult access to material as well as minors.   CHIPA     further accentuates the digital divide.   CHIPA     overrides local control and decision-making.   CHIPA     is unconstitutional because it limits free speech      First      Amendment applies to the Internet.    The      First Amendment includes the right to receive information as well as to      speak.    CHIPA      is a content-based restriction on speech that fails the strict scrutiny      test.        CHIPA       is clearly not narrowly tailored, nor is it the least restrictive means       to achieve the governments goal.       CHIPA      is overbroad, encompassing much more speech than is constitutionally      permitted.    CHIPA      constitutes an unconstitutional prior restraint.        CHIPA       removes speech from the Internet without any judicial determination that       such speech is unprotected under the Constitution.       CHIPA      is unconstitutionally vague.    CHIPA      violates constitutionally protected anonymity and privacy.        CHIPA       requires adults to obtain permission in order to view blocked sites.       CHIPA      violates the unconstitutional conditions doctrine.        CHIPA       conditions receipt of federal funds upon violations of the First       Amendment.        There     are less restrictive means of accomplishing Congress goal in enacting     CHIPA.   Conclusion Mr. Chairman, andmembers of the Committee: I am Marvin J. Johnson,Legislative Counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union. I appreciate theopportunity to testify before you today about the Childrens InternetProtection Act (CHIPA) on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union. TheACLU is a nation-wide, non-partisan organization of more than 275,000 membersdevoted to protecting the principles of freedom set forth in the Bill of Rightsand the Constitution.          The hearingtoday is to determine the effectiveness of the Childrens Internet ProtectionAct. CHIPA was signed into law on December 21, 2000. It will become effectiveon April 20, 2001. 1712(b) (tobe codified at 20 U.S.C. 9134); 1721(h) (to becodified at 47 U.S.C. 254(h)). CHIPA requires that public libraries receivinge-rate discounts or funds under the Library Services Technology Act (LSTA)implement and enforce technology protection measures to block obscenity, childpornography and material harmful to minors.           Under thee-rate provisions, libraries that do not timely certify their compliance becomeineligible for further e-rate discounts. Where the library knowingly fails toinsure compliance, it may be required to reimburse any discounts received forthe period covered by the certification. Libraries receiving LSTA funds are notrequired to reimburse the government in the event they fail to comply withCHIPA.          CHIPA'srestrictions are not limited to library Internet access supported only by thefederal e-rate and LSTA programs. Both the e-rate restrictions in Section1721(b) and the LSTA restrictions in Section 1712 require libraries to certifythat technology protection measures are in place on "" any  of itscomputers with Internet access"" and ""during  any  use of suchcomputers."" 1721(b) (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(6)(C)(i)-(ii));1712.15 (to be codified at 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(1)(B)(i)-(ii)) [Emphasis added].A library subject to CHIPA must install and enforce the operation of technologyprotection measures on all of its computers with Internet access even if thelibrary purchased the computers or paid for Internet access with money that isnot from federal programs. While CHIPA is not yet ineffect, it will be ineffective. There is no reliable way to block out allobjectionable material, so any technological protection measure will beineffective in removing that material from view. Furthermore, all of thecurrent technological protection measures block significant amounts of materialthat deserve constitutional protection. This overbreadth is one of the reasons CHIPA is unconstitutional. Technology Protection Measures Do Not Work          CHIPA will be ineffective because noavailable technology can implement its mandate.  CHIPA defines a technologyprotection measure as a specific technology that blocks or filters Internetaccess to the material covered by a certification. 57 U.S.C. 254(h)(6)(H).CHIPA requires blocking of material that is obscene, child pornography, orharmful to minors. It is not possible to create a technology protection measurethat blocks access only to material that is obscene, child pornography, orharmful to minors as defined by CHIPA, or that blocks access to all materialthat meets those definitions.           In order to understand the reasonthese technological protection measures are destined to fail, one mustunderstand the nature of the technology.          The World Wide Web is now estimated tocontain over 1.5 billion pages. It continues to grow and change at a geometricrate. Thus, there is a massive amount of information to catalog, and thatinformation continues to change and grow every day.           Private companies produce technologythat is designed to block access to particular content on the web. Thetechnology is commonly referred to as blocking software or blockingprograms. These programs are computer software that is designed to blockcontent on the Internet that would otherwise be available to all Internetusers.           Vendors of this software establishcriteria to identify specific categories of speech on the Internet. They thenconfigure the software to block web pages containing those categories ofspeech. Some programs block as few as six categories, while others block up totwenty-nine or more categories. These categories may include hate speech,criminal activity, sexually explicit speech, adult speech, violent speech orspeech using specific disfavored words. Some of the blocked categories expressdisapproval of a particular viewpoint, such as a category that blocks allinformation about alternative lifestyles including homosexuality.          The terms obscenity, childpornography and harmful to minors as used in CHIPA are legal terms. None ofthe current vendors of blocking technology claim to block categories that meetthese legal definitions, nor do they employ attorneys or judges to make thosedeterminations. Leaving decisions of what constitutes obscenity, childpornography and material harmful to minors up to legally untrained personsleads to more information being blocked than is legally permissible.           Once blocking program vendorsestablish the criteria for information they intend to block, they establish amethod of identifying the web pages that meet that criteria. Generally, theyconduct automated searches based on words or strings of words, similar tosearches done by standard search engines. Web pages are usually blocked intheir entirety if any content on the web page fits the vendors contentcategories, regardless of whether the content on the page is textual, visual,or both.          No technology currently availableallows vendors to conduct automated searches for visual images that fit theircontent categories, or that are communicated through email, chat, or onlinediscussion groups. As a result, any implementation of this technology isunder-inclusive, allowing access to material that CHIPA intends to block.          After using this technology toidentify web sites to block, the blocking program vendors add these pages to amaster list of web pages to block (blocked sites list). Some vendors claim tohave employees review individual web sites before adding them to the blockedsite list. These employees, however, are not lawyers or judges, and receive nolegal training. There is a great deal of employee turnover in these jobs. As aresult, untrained employees are making what are essentially legal decisions andexcluding constitutionally protected material.          An operational blocking program thenblocks users from accessing web pages on the programs blocked sites list.Vendors normally treat their blocked sites list as a trade secret, and refuseto reveal this information to their customers, prospective customers, or to thepublic.  Two blocking techniques canbe used by program vendors to block access to email, chat, and onlinediscussion groups. First, the blocking programs may block access to all email,chat, and online discussion groups. Second, the programs may selectively blockout particular words communicated through email, chat, or discussion groups.For example, the programs may replace supposedly objectionable words with xxxregardless of the context in which the word was used. Hence Marc Rotenbergs [i] blocked version of the First Amendment: Congress shall make no law abridgingthe freedom of sXXXch, or the right of the people peaceably to XXXemble, and topeXXXion the government for a redress of grievances.          Because of the way these blockingprograms work, they inherently rely upon the exercise of subjective humanjudgment by the vendor to decide what is objectionable and what is not. Thevendor, rather than librarians, other government officials, adult patrons, or parentsdecide what gets placed on the blocked sites list.          Furthermore, because of the massiveamounts of information available on the web, and its constantly changingcontent, no company can keep up with all the information or changes. It isestimated that even the most sophisticated search techniques find less than 20%of the web. Therefore, the idea that blocking technology will block out all ofthe objectionable information on the web is an impossibility. Although blockingprogram vendors provide updates to their blocked sites list, it is impossiblefor them to find all of the content on the Internet that meets their criteria,or to keep up with the rapidly increasing and changing content available.           In March, 2001, Consumer Reportstested blocking software, and found that most failed to block at least 20% ofobjectionable material. Consumer Reports, March 1, 2001, Digital Chaperonesfor kids found at  http://www.consumerreports.org/Special/ConsumerInterest/Reports/0103fil0.html           Not only does blocking software failto block all material meeting the legal definitions of obscenity, childpornography and material harmful to minors, it also blocks much materialwhich is not objectionable, and protected under the First Amendment. Because ofthis overbreadth, CHIPA will be found unconstitutional, and therefore,ineffective.          The federal government and others haverepeatedly documented the failures and flaws of blocking programs. The UnitedStates Attorney General has said that blocking programs inescapably fail toblock objectionable speech because they are unable to screen for images. Brieffor the Appellants,  Reno v. ACLU , No. 96-511 (January 1997) at 40-41.Congress itself has repeatedly noted these flaws. A House report found thatsuch software is not the preferred solution because of the risk thatprotected, harmless, or innocent speech would be accidentally orinappropriately blocked. H.R. Rep. No. 105-775 (1998) at 19.          In October 1998, Congress appointedthe Child Online Protection Act Commission (COPA Commission), and charged itwith identify[ing] technological or other methods that will help reduce accessby minors to material that is harmful to minors on the Internet. In October2000, the Commission reported that blocking technology raises First Amendmentconcerns because of its potential to be over-inclusive in blocking content.Concerns are increased because the extent of blocking is often unclear and notdisclosed, and may not be based on parental choices. The Commissionspecifically did not recommend any government-imposed mandatory use of blockingtechnologies.          On October 23, 2000, Peacefire [ii] issued a report of blocking technology which found error rates anywhere from20% to 80%. Error rates were based on sites being blocked as pornography whenthey were, in fact, not pornographic. Study of Average Error Rates forCensorware Programs, October 23, 2000, found at  http://www.peacefire.org/error-rates/ On November 7, 2000,Peacefire issued its report  Blind Ballots: Web Sites of U.S. PoliticalCandidates Censored by Censorware . ( http://www.peacefire.org/blind-ballots/).The report found numerous political candidates sites were blocked by thissoftware. Jeffery Pollock, Republican candidate for Congress in Oregons ThirdCongressional District, had originally favored blocking software. After hearingthat his site was one of those blocked, he reversed his position. The site ofCongressman Markey, the Ranking Minority member of this subcommittee was alsoblocked by one of the programs that characterized his site as Hate, Illegal, Pornography,and/or Violence.           Proponents of blocking often claimthat even if some web sites are blocked, there are others available on thetopic that may be unblocked so the information will ultimately be available.This position makes little sense, particularly when discussing candidate websites. Should a Republican candidate be soothed by the fact that his blockedviews may be found and discussed at his Democratic opponents unblocked website?          On December 12, 2000, Peacefirepublished a report demonstrating that sites of human rights groups were beingblocked by this software.  Amnesty Intercepted: Global human rights groupsblocked by Web censoring software , December 12, 2000, found at:  http://www.peacefire.org/amnesty-intercepted/          Consumer Reports in March 2001 foundthat blocking software varied from 20% to 63% in its over-blocking.          Despite protestations from blockingsoftware supporters that instances of over-blocking are all old examplesremedied by newer versions, these examples are all recent. The flaws ofblocking programs are not a matter of individual flaws in individual products.These flaws are inevitable given the task and the limitations of thetechnology.          As a result of these problems,blocking software fails to protect because it cannot block all material thatmeets the CHIPA criteria. Furthermore, it blocks a huge amount of informationthat should not be considered objectionable, and is clearly protected under theFirst Amendment. CHIPA Restricts Adult Access As Well As Minors          While CHIPA purports to protect minorsby blocking their access to the Internet, it also blocks adult access. Bysweeping so broadly, CHIPA violates the Constitution.          Section1721(b) of CHIPA requires public libraries that participate in the federale-rate program to certify to the FCC that they are (i) enforcing a policy ofInternet safety that includes the operation of a technology protection measurewith respect to computers with Internet access that protects against accessthrough such computers to visual depictions that are (I) obscene; or (II) childpornography; and (ii) is enforcing the operation of such technology measureduring  any use  of such computers. 1721 (to be codified at 47 U.S.C.254 (h)(6)(C)). [Emphasis added.]          Section1712 of CHIPA applies to libraries that do not receive the e-rate discount butreceive funds pursuant to 20 U.S.C. 9134(b), the Library Services andTechnology Act (LSTA), to purchase computers used to access the Internet, orto pay for direct costs associated with accessing the Internet. 1712 (to becodified at 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(1)). Section 1712 requires the same installation andenforcement of technology protection measures as is required by Section 1721(b).1712 (to be codified at 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(1)(A) and (B)).          CHIPA'srestrictions are not limited to library Internet access supported only by thefederal e-rate and LSTA programs. Both the e-rate restrictions in Section1721(b) and the LSTA restrictions in Section 1712 require libraries to certifythat technology protection measures are in place on "" any  of itscomputers with Internet access"" and ""during  any  use of suchcomputers."" 1721(b) (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(6)(C)(i)-(ii));1712.15 (to be codified at 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(1)(B)(i)-(ii)) [Emphasis added].          Thus, whileCHIPA is commonly referred to as a child protection measure, it goes furtherand operates to block adult access as well. In doing so, CHIPA will follow theCDA and COPA along the trail of unconstitutional attempts to censor theInternet.  CHIPA Further Accentuates the Digital Divide          CHIPA willhave little effect on the rich. They can afford their own computers withunfiltered access. The poor who have to rely upon library access to perform jobsearches, school homework, and general research are the ones who will bepenalized by CHIPA.           Publiclibraries play a crucial role in affording access to the economic and socialbenefits of the Internet to those who do not have computers at home. Librariesassure that advanced information services are universally available to allsegments of the American population on an equitable basis.           For manypeople who cannot afford a personal computer or network connections, Internetaccess at public libraries may be their only means of accessing the Internet.Minorities, low-income persons, the less educated, children of single-parenthouseholds, and persons who reside in rural areas are less likely than othersto have home Internet access. For example, Whites are more likely to haveaccess to the Internet from home than Blacks or Latinos have from  any location. Black and Latino households are less than half as likely to have homeInternet access as White households. [iii] According to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration,this digital divide is growing. CHIPA will only worsen the situation withthese unintended consequences. CHIPA Overrides Local Control and Decision-making          Manycommunities spent a lot of time studying the issue of Internet access and howto deal with it in their public libraries. Kalamazoo, Michigan, Holland,Michigan, and Multnomah County Public Library are a few such examples. In eachcase, they decided blocking software was inappropriate for their libraries, andthey opted for other, less restrictive measures to protect their children.           CHIPAignores and overrides those local decisions, instead opting for a one sizefits all scheme that is unworkable and unconstitutional. CHIPAIs Unconstitutional Because it Limits Free Speech          CHIPAwill further be ineffective to protect children because it will be stricken asunconstitutional.           Asyou know, on March 20, 2001, the ACLU and the American Library Association eachfiled a lawsuit in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against the ChildrensInternet Protection Act (CHIPA). Under the Act, any challenge will be heard bya panel of three judges, and appeals from any decision of the panel will godirectly to the United States Supreme Court. The three judges were justrecently appointed. The First Amendment Applies to the Internet In  Reno I, [iv] a unanimous Supreme Court held that the First Amendment applies to theInternet. The Court found the Internet should be afforded the highestprotection under the First Amendment, equivalent to that provided books,newspapers, and magazines. [v] Therefore, any attempted regulation of Internet speech such as CHIPA isconstitutionally suspect. The First Amendment includes the rightto receive information as well as to speak. While the First Amendmentdiscusses the freedom of speech, the Supreme Court has made it clear that italso encompasses the fundamental right to receive information. [vi] In  Reno I,  the Supreme Courtconfirmed that the right to receive information applies without qualificationto expression on the Internet. [vii] Thus, attempts such as CHIPA to restrict information affect the constitutionalrights not only of the speaker, but the recipient as well. For example,blocking a web site on safe sex violates the rights of the web site operator(the speaker) but also the rights of the one who wishes to review that material(the recipient). CHIPAIs a Content-Based Restriction on Speech That Fails the Strict Scrutiny Test CHIPA purports to restrictspeech based on its content (obscenity, child pornography, and material harmfulto minors). Additionally, many blocking software vendors block sites they findpolitically objectionable, for example, sites that discuss or condemnhomosexuality. Content-based regulations are presumptively invalid. [viii] In order to overcome the presumption of unconstitutionality, content-basedrestrictions must meet the strict scrutiny standard [ix] and survive an exacting test. The strict scrutiny test requires that thechallenged statute or regulation is necessary to serve a compellinggovernmental interest, and is narrowly drawn to achieve that end. [x] It is not enough to show that the Governments ends are compelling; the meansmust be carefully tailored to achieve those ends. [xi] Narrow Tailoring and Least RestrictiveMeans Under the strict scrutinyanalysis, the government has the burden of establishing that a regulation isthe least restrictive means and narrowly tailored to its objective. [xii] In other words, the Government is not allowed to use a nuclear bomb when asmall side arm would suffice. Government regulation of theInternet often fails because it attempts to burn the house to roast the pig. [xiii] For example, in  Reno , the Court noted [we] are persuaded thatthe CDA lacks the precision that the First Amendment requires when a statuteregulates the content of speech. In order to deny minors access to potentiallyharmful speech, the CDA effectively suppresses a large amount of speech thatadults have a constitutional right to receive and to address to one another.That burden on adult speech is unacceptable if less restrictive alternativeswould be at least as effective in achieving the legitimate purpose that thestatute was enacted to serve.    Because there were lessrestrictive alternatives available that would be at least as effective as theCDA, the Court found the act unconstitutional.          Likethe CDA, CHIPA restricts far more speech than is targeted. As noted above, notechnology available today reliably blocks  only  obscenity, childpornography and material harmful to minors. Thus, a broad range of speechprotected under the First Amendment gets sidelined, while the filters alsoallow objectionable speech to get through.            In passing CHIPA, Congress failed to consider less restrictivealternatives. It also failed to heed the report of the COPA Commission whichdid  not  recommend mandatory blocking programs, and recommended variousless restrictive alternatives. CHIPA IsOverbroad Overbreadth is a test thatis used when an otherwise legitimate regulation also affects speech that maynot be lawfully restricted.  An example of anoverbroad statute appears in  Reno I ,where the Court reviewed the constitutionality of the Communications DecencyAct (CDA) [xiv] , Congressfirst attempt to regulate content on the Internet. In invalidating the CDA, theCourt noted the acts breadth was unprecedented, [xv] and that it suppressed a large amount of speech that adults have aconstitutional right to send and receive. Therefore, even though the intent maybe to protect children, a law or regulation that burdens speech which adultshave a constitutional right to receive is unconstitutional if less restrictivealternatives would be at least as effective in achieving the Acts legitimatepurposes. [xvi]          Becausethe effect of CHIPA is to suppress more speech than is necessary to achieve thegovernments objective, it is fatally overbroad. CHIPA Is An Unconstitutional Prior Restraint Under the priorrestraint doctrine, the government may not restrain protected speech withoutthe benefit of clear objective standards or adequate procedural safeguards,including provisions for administrative review, time limitations on the reviewprocess, and provisions for prompt judicial review. [xvii] CHIPA implicitly assumes,for example, that a blocking software vendor can legitimately determine whetherexpression is unprotected by the Constitution. From a legal standpoint, thatassumption is incorrect.  In 1973, theSupreme Court in  Miller v. California , [xviii] crafted the definition of obscenity still used today. Known as the  Miller  test, it requires that a trier offact (a judge or jury) examine the work and determine: 1.      Whether the average person, applying contemporary communitystandards would find that the work taken as a whole, appeals to the prurientinterest;  2.      Whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensiveway, sexual conduct specifically defined in the applicable state law; and  3.      Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary,artistic, political or scientific value.   Only if the answer to all of thesequestions is yes can a work be judged obscene and  only then  does it lose its protection under the First Amendment. In order to placecertain speech into the category of obscenity, the government must initiallyprovide a series of procedural safeguards. First, there must be a statutespecifically defining the sexual conduct that may not be depicted or displayed.This requirement helps guarantee that speakers have fair notice of what isprohibited. [xix]  Second,the material cannot legitimately be banned without a full adversarial trial.Finally, a jury must be available to apply the relevant community standardsfor obscenity to the challenged material.          Thefact that a school or library uses third-party software that decides what isobscene material exacerbates the policys unconstitutionality. [A] defendantcannot avoid its constitutional obligation by contracting out itsdecisionmaking to a private entity. [xx]          Mandatoryblocking policies that rely on commercial blocking software constitute priorrestraints because they entrust all . . . blocking decisions . . . to aprivate vendor whose standards and practices cannot be monitored by theblocking library. [xxi]  Allsubstantive blocking decisions by commercial suppliers necessarily lie outsidethe control of the government; consequently, each blocking decision inherentlylacks the requisite procedural safeguards. In fact, in  Mainstream Loudoun ,the blocking software provider refused to provide the defendants with thecriteria it used to block sites, let alone the names of the actual sitesblocked. [xxii] Mandatory blocking policies like CHIPA thus confer unbridled discretion oncommercial software providers, allowing them to restrict accessindiscriminately and without any administrative or judicial review.           Inshort, no speech is unprotected by the Constitution until a court determines itto be so. CHIPA attempts to bypass legal requirements and thus runs afoul ofthe Constitution. CHIPA Is Unconstitutionally Vague It is a general principle oflaw that laws [must] give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonableopportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. [xxiii] If a law is too vague to give this reasonable opportunity, it is deemed voidfor vagueness. When a law interferes with the right of free speech, the courtsapply a more stringent variation of the vagueness test. [xxiv] The Supreme Court has recognized that First Amendment freedoms are delicateand vulnerable, as well as supremely precious in our society. The threat of sanctionsmay deter their exercise almost as potently as the actual application ofsanctions. Because First Amendment freedoms need breathing space to survive,government may regulate in the area only with narrow specificity. [xxv] In order to avoid the vice ofvagueness, the law or regulation must provide explicit standards for those whoapply them. A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters topolicemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis,with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application. [xxvi] Therefore, the law must provide an ascertainable standard for inclusion andexclusion. [xxvii]  Whenthat standard is missing, the law unconstitutionally produces a chilling effecton speech, inducing speakers to steer far wider of the unlawful zone than ifthe boundaries were clearly marked. [xxviii] It forces people to conform their speech to that which is unquestionablysafe. [xxix]           CHIPA provides that [a]nadministrator, supervisor, or other person authorized by the certifyingauthority . . . may disable the technology protection measure concerned, duringuse by an adult, to enable access for bona fide research or other lawfulpurpose. No definition of bona fide research or other lawful purpose isprovided. 1721 (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. 254 (h)(6)(D)). Section 1712provides that [a]n administrator, supervisor, or other authority may disable atechnology protection measure to enable access for bona fide research or otherlawful purposes."" 1712 (to be codified at 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(3)). Unlikethe comparable e-rate section, this provision appears to apply to minors aswell as adults. Again, no definition is provided for bona fide research orother lawful purpose. The phrase is left to the interpretation of eachlibrarian or staff person tasked with making that determination.  CHIPA ViolatesConstitutionally Protected Anonymity and Privacy CHIPA requires adults (and perhaps minors in the case ofLSTA funds) to seek permission from a government official in order to obtainunblocked access. In doing so, a patron requesting such access loses his or heranonymity and privacy. The Constitution protects anonymity and privacy incommunications and the ability to receive information anonymously. [xxx] CHIPA Violates the UnconstitutionalConditions Doctrine Broadlyspeaking, the unconstitutional conditions doctrine holds that Congress may notcondition receipt of federal funds upon the waiver of a constitutional right.Under CHIPA, Congress conditions receipt of federal money (except in the caseof the e-rate) on the condition that libraries violate the First Amendment. Duringdebates on the Childrens Internet Protection Act (CHIPA), some proponentsclaimed there was no constitutional infirmity in conditioning receipt of federalmoney on acquiring and using blocking software. Even if mandatory blockingitself violated the First Amendment, it was claimed this was circumventedbecause schools and libraries only had to block if they received federal funds.Since they were under no obligation to receive those funds, there was noviolation. TheSupreme Courts decision in  LegalServices Corporation v. Velasquez [xxxi] reaffirms the long-standing principle that the government may not require thesacrifice of constitutional rights as a condition for receiving a governmentbenefit. [xxxii] In  Velasquez , Congress required thatfunds distributed to the Legal Services Corporation not be used to challengeexisting welfare laws. Legal Services attorneys therefore could not representclients in welfare benefits cases if the constitutionality of the welfare lawsbecame an issue. Thus, both the attorney and the client were prohibited fromchallenging these laws; the attorney because of the funding restrictions, andthe client because they could not afford another attorney. The Court thus hadto decide whether one of the conditions imposed by Congress on the use of LSCfunds violates the First Amendment rights of LSC grantees and their clients.The majority of the Court concluded that it did. Whileconcluding that the government may, in certain circumstances, use funding as atool to mold speech, the Court noted [i]t does not follow. . .thatviewpoint-based restrictions are proper when the [government] does not itselfspeak or subsidize transmittal of a message it favors but instead expends fundsto encourage a diversity of views from private speakers. Thesubsidies involved in CHIPA are made to encourage schools and libraries toconnect to the Internet. The funds thus are not intended to facilitate a specificmessage, but rather to encourage the populace to engage in the diversity ofviews that is the Internet. Also, like in  Velasquez ,the money was given to one entity for the benefit of a third party. In  Velasquez , the money was given to LSCfor the benefit of the clients. In CHIPA, the money is given to schools andlibraries for the benefit of the patrons and students.           Thesituation in  Velasquez  and CHIPA isdifferent than that in  National Endowmentfor the Arts v. Finley . [xxxiii] In  Finley , the Court found thechallenged provision only required that the NEA take into account decency andrespect in making its grants. It was not a determinative factor, but one ofseveral considerations. Thus, Congress had not disallowed any particularviewpoints in subsidizing the arts.          TheCourt specifically noted the situation might be different if the NEA engaged inviewpoint discrimination: If the NEA were to leverage its power to award subsidieson the basis of subjective criteria into a penalty on disfavored viewpoints,then we would confront a different case. We have stated that, even in theprovision of subsidies, the Government may not aim at the suppression ofdangerous ideas, [citation omitted] and if a subsidy were manipulated to havea coercive effect, then relief could be appropriate. [citation omitted] [xxxiv]             Velasquez is the latest pronouncement in this area of the law. Since Congress is usingfederal money to force libraries to violate the First Amendment,  Velasquez declares that, under these circumstances, CHIPA is unconstitutional. Constitutional Alternatives That are Less RestrictiveMeans of Accomplishing Congress Goal           Congress passed CHIPA with theintent to protect children. For all the reasons noted above, CHIPA isunconstitutional and will be stricken, in addition to being ineffective.           As noted above, many libraries havealready implemented options that do not involve blocking software and are atleast as effective as blocking. These options include library web sites,educational programs, and Internet Use Policies.          Many libraries have implemented theirown home pages to help patrons identify high-quality and useful sites. Inaddition to providing its own content, a library may provide indexes of otherlinks it has evaluated and can recommend. Cataloging and organizing thisinformation helps lead users to resources in the subject areas of interest andconsequently helps them avoid unwanted resources. Descriptions on the pages canassist users in deciding whether to visit a particular site.          The same philosophy can be applied tolibrary sites designed specifically for children. The site can provide childrenwith a safe Internet experience by visiting sites reviewed by the librarian.          Many libraries educate patrons aboutInternet use. Through education, librarians assist patrons in finding usefulinformation and avoiding unwanted information. Many public libraries offerclasses on the use of the library, the catalog, indexes and systems. In manylibraries, patrons are required to take such classes before they can use publicconnections. These classes cover the librarys use policies. Topics forInternet classes often include: kinds of information and subjects which arelikely to be found on the Internet; how to construct effective, high-qualitysearch strategies taking advantage of features of directories and searchengines (truncation, Boolean searching, searching on phrases); when to usevarious kinds of search aids; how to evaluate resources found; and theadvantages of using library-approved Web sites and other sites known to collectquality resources.          Education was one of therecommendations made by the COPA Commission in its report of October 20, 2000.          Libraries also may offer classes andresources to help parents assist their children in using the Internet safelyand productively. Most reinforce the importance of parental supervision andinvolvement with children when using the Internet. Parents should teachchildren to be educated consumers of information and to talk to their parentsabout what they find online. Parents may be advised to consider settingboundaries on how much time children can be on the Net, and on the kinds ofinformation they look at. Children may also be instructed about the importanceof not giving their names, passwords, credit card numbers, or other personallyidentifying information, or arranging to meet anyone they talk to onlinewithout discussing it with their parents. A good example of these guides is theLibrarians Guide to Cyberspace for Parents and Kids, from the American LibraryAssociation. ( www.ala.org/parentspage/greatsites/safe.html )          Another method libraries use toeducate patrons about Internet use is the development of Internet Use Policies.These policies can remind users about expected use of the library and oflibrary resources in general. The American Library Association has establishedgeneral guidelines for the development of library policies.          Many libraries require patrons to signan Internet Use Policy before they can access the Internet. These policies mayexplain the diversity of information on the Internet, and point patrons to thelibrary-approved resources on the library web page. A substantial number ofpolicies discuss the decentralized, uncontrolled nature of the Internet andwarn patrons that they may encounter material they find objectionable. Thepolicy may explain that beyond the library web page, the library does notmonitor or control the information on the Internet, and that patrons use it attheir own risk. The policy may inform parents that they are responsible fordeciding what library resources are appropriate for their children. The policymay also set rules for Internet use, and can impose sanctions for violations,including losing Internet access privileges, and reporting illegal conduct tolaw enforcement authorities. In many cases, these policies are tied togetherwith educational programs.          There are numerous ways libraries canand do work with parents and children to protect children while they use theInternet. These methods are at least as effective as blocking technologywithout the side-effect of blocking much material that is constitutionallyprotected. Conclusion          Protecting children is a laudablegoal. CHIPA, however, fails to protect children. No blocking mechanism orsoftware is completely effective. At the same time, CHIPA results in blocking alarge segment of constitutionally protected speech to adults as well as minors.Since there are less restrictive alternatives, CHIPA is constitutionallyinfirm.          The First Amendment is part of thefoundation of our society and a bedrock of our principles. Emasculating theFirst Amendment in the name of protecting children only teaches our childrenthat principles are elastic and suggests to them that when those principlesbecome inconvenient, they should be discarded. Such a lesson leaves a childsmoral compass spinning. Indeed, perhaps we do the minors in this country harmif First Amendment protections, which they will with age inherit fully, arechipped away in the name of their protection. [xxxv]      Wecan, and must, protect our founding principles as well as our children. It isnot an either-or situation. With thoughtful consideration, both can beachieved.    AdditionalMaterials: ACLU Complaint  http://www.aclu.org/court/multnomah.pdf Blind Ballots: Web Sites of U.S.Political Candidates Censored by Censorware, November 7, 2000  http://www.peacefire.org/blind-ballots/   Filtering Programs Block CandidateSites, November 8, 2000 (verifying results of Blind Ballots report onCyberPatrol)  http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2651471,00.html   Amnesty Intercepted: Global human rights groups blocked byWeb censoring software, December 12, 2000  http://www.peacefire.org/amnesty-intercepted/   Study of Average Error Rates for Censorware Programs,October 23, 2000 http://www.peacefire.org/error-rates/   COPA Commission Report, October 20, 2000  http://www.copacommission.org/report/   Consumer Reports, March 1, 2001, Digital Chaperones http://www.consumerreports.org/Special/ConsumerInterest/Reports/0103fil0.html   [i]  MarcRotenberg is the Director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC)in Washington, D.C.

[xix]  This is animportant requirement the Government overlooked in its enactment of theCommunications Decency Act (CDA). In  Renov.

The Court disagreed, noting that the second prong of  Miller  contained a critical elementomitted from the CDA: that the proscribed material be specifically defined bythe applicable state law. The Court also noted the CDA went beyond  Millers  application to sexual conductto include excretory activities as well as organs of both a sexual andexcretory nature. Finally, the Court concluded that just because a definitionincluding three limitations is not vague, it does not follow that one of thoselimitations, standing by itself, is not vague.

Blocking      software not only fails to block all harmful material, but it also      over-blocks many sites that are protected under the First Amendment.        Political       sites were blocked in the last election, including House Majority Leader       Dick Armey and Congressman Ed Markey.        CHIPA     restricts adult access to material as well as minors.   CHIPA     further accentuates the digital divide.   CHIPA     overrides local control and decision-making.   CHIPA     is unconstitutional because it limits free speech      First      Amendment applies to the Internet.    The      First Amendment includes the right to receive information as well as to      speak.    CHIPA      is a content-based restriction on speech that fails the strict scrutiny      test.        CHIPA       is clearly not narrowly tailored, nor is it the least restrictive means       to achieve the governments goal.       CHIPA      is overbroad, encompassing much more speech than is constitutionally      permitted.    CHIPA      constitutes an unconstitutional prior restraint.        CHIPA       removes speech from the Internet without any judicial determination that       such speech is unprotected under the Constitution.       CHIPA      is unconstitutionally vague.    CHIPA      violates constitutionally protected anonymity and privacy.        CHIPA       requires adults to obtain permission in order to view blocked sites.       CHIPA      violates the unconstitutional conditions doctrine.        CHIPA       conditions receipt of federal funds upon violations of the First       Amendment.        There     are less restrictive means of accomplishing Congress goal in enacting     CHIPA.   Conclusion Mr. Chairman, andmembers of the Committee: I am Marvin J. Johnson,Legislative Counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union. I appreciate theopportunity to testify before you today about the Childrens InternetProtection Act (CHIPA) on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union. TheACLU is a nation-wide, non-partisan organization of more than 275,000 membersdevoted to protecting the principles of freedom set forth in the Bill of Rightsand the Constitution.          The hearingtoday is to determine the effectiveness of the Childrens Internet ProtectionAct. CHIPA was signed into law on December 21, 2000. It will become effectiveon April 20, 2001. 1712(b) (tobe codified at 20 U.S.C. 9134); 1721(h) (to becodified at 47 U.S.C. 254(h)). CHIPA requires that public libraries receivinge-rate discounts or funds under the Library Services Technology Act (LSTA)implement and enforce technology protection measures to block obscenity, childpornography and material harmful to minors.           Under thee-rate provisions, libraries that do not timely certify their compliance becomeineligible for further e-rate discounts. Where the library knowingly fails toinsure compliance, it may be required to reimburse any discounts received forthe period covered by the certification. Libraries receiving LSTA funds are notrequired to reimburse the government in the event they fail to comply withCHIPA.          CHIPA'srestrictions are not limited to library Internet access supported only by thefederal e-rate and LSTA programs. Both the e-rate restrictions in Section1721(b) and the LSTA restrictions in Section 1712 require libraries to certifythat technology protection measures are in place on "" any  of itscomputers with Internet access"" and ""during  any  use of suchcomputers."" 1721(b) (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(6)(C)(i)-(ii));1712.15 (to be codified at 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(1)(B)(i)-(ii)) [Emphasis added].A library subject to CHIPA must install and enforce the operation of technologyprotection measures on all of its computers with Internet access even if thelibrary purchased the computers or paid for Internet access with money that isnot from federal programs. While CHIPA is not yet ineffect, it will be ineffective. There is no reliable way to block out allobjectionable material, so any technological protection measure will beineffective in removing that material from view. Furthermore, all of thecurrent technological protection measures block significant amounts of materialthat deserve constitutional protection. This overbreadth is one of the reasons CHIPA is unconstitutional. Technology Protection Measures Do Not Work          CHIPA will be ineffective because noavailable technology can implement its mandate.  CHIPA defines a technologyprotection measure as a specific technology that blocks or filters Internetaccess to the material covered by a certification. 57 U.S.C. 254(h)(6)(H).CHIPA requires blocking of material that is obscene, child pornography, orharmful to minors. It is not possible to create a technology protection measurethat blocks access only to material that is obscene, child pornography, orharmful to minors as defined by CHIPA, or that blocks access to all materialthat meets those definitions.           In order to understand the reasonthese technological protection measures are destined to fail, one mustunderstand the nature of the technology.          The World Wide Web is now estimated tocontain over 1.5 billion pages. It continues to grow and change at a geometricrate. Thus, there is a massive amount of information to catalog, and thatinformation continues to change and grow every day.           Private companies produce technologythat is designed to block access to particular content on the web. Thetechnology is commonly referred to as blocking software or blockingprograms. These programs are computer software that is designed to blockcontent on the Internet that would otherwise be available to all Internetusers.           Vendors of this software establishcriteria to identify specific categories of speech on the Internet. They thenconfigure the software to block web pages containing those categories ofspeech. Some programs block as few as six categories, while others block up totwenty-nine or more categories. These categories may include hate speech,criminal activity, sexually explicit speech, adult speech, violent speech orspeech using specific disfavored words. Some of the blocked categories expressdisapproval of a particular viewpoint, such as a category that blocks allinformation about alternative lifestyles including homosexuality.          The terms obscenity, childpornography and harmful to minors as used in CHIPA are legal terms. None ofthe current vendors of blocking technology claim to block categories that meetthese legal definitions, nor do they employ attorneys or judges to make thosedeterminations. Leaving decisions of what constitutes obscenity, childpornography and material harmful to minors up to legally untrained personsleads to more information being blocked than is legally permissible.           Once blocking program vendorsestablish the criteria for information they intend to block, they establish amethod of identifying the web pages that meet that criteria. Generally, theyconduct automated searches based on words or strings of words, similar tosearches done by standard search engines. Web pages are usually blocked intheir entirety if any content on the web page fits the vendors contentcategories, regardless of whether the content on the page is textual, visual,or both.          No technology currently availableallows vendors to conduct automated searches for visual images that fit theircontent categories, or that are communicated through email, chat, or onlinediscussion groups. As a result, any implementation of this technology isunder-inclusive, allowing access to material that CHIPA intends to block.          After using this technology toidentify web sites to block, the blocking program vendors add these pages to amaster list of web pages to block (blocked sites list). Some vendors claim tohave employees review individual web sites before adding them to the blockedsite list. These employees, however, are not lawyers or judges, and receive nolegal training. There is a great deal of employee turnover in these jobs. As aresult, untrained employees are making what are essentially legal decisions andexcluding constitutionally protected material.          An operational blocking program thenblocks users from accessing web pages on the programs blocked sites list.Vendors normally treat their blocked sites list as a trade secret, and refuseto reveal this information to their customers, prospective customers, or to thepublic.  Two blocking techniques canbe used by program vendors to block access to email, chat, and onlinediscussion groups. First, the blocking programs may block access to all email,chat, and online discussion groups. Second, the programs may selectively blockout particular words communicated through email, chat, or discussion groups.For example, the programs may replace supposedly objectionable words with xxxregardless of the context in which the word was used. Hence Marc Rotenbergs [i] blocked version of the First Amendment: Congress shall make no law abridgingthe freedom of sXXXch, or the right of the people peaceably to XXXemble, and topeXXXion the government for a redress of grievances.          Because of the way these blockingprograms work, they inherently rely upon the exercise of subjective humanjudgment by the vendor to decide what is objectionable and what is not. Thevendor, rather than librarians, other government officials, adult patrons, or parentsdecide what gets placed on the blocked sites list.          Furthermore, because of the massiveamounts of information available on the web, and its constantly changingcontent, no company can keep up with all the information or changes. It isestimated that even the most sophisticated search techniques find less than 20%of the web. Therefore, the idea that blocking technology will block out all ofthe objectionable information on the web is an impossibility. Although blockingprogram vendors provide updates to their blocked sites list, it is impossiblefor them to find all of the content on the Internet that meets their criteria,or to keep up with the rapidly increasing and changing content available.           In March, 2001, Consumer Reportstested blocking software, and found that most failed to block at least 20% ofobjectionable material. Consumer Reports, March 1, 2001, Digital Chaperonesfor kids found at  http://www.consumerreports.org/Special/ConsumerInterest/Reports/0103fil0.html           Not only does blocking software failto block all material meeting the legal definitions of obscenity, childpornography and material harmful to minors, it also blocks much materialwhich is not objectionable, and protected under the First Amendment. Because ofthis overbreadth, CHIPA will be found unconstitutional, and therefore,ineffective.          The federal government and others haverepeatedly documented the failures and flaws of blocking programs. The UnitedStates Attorney General has said that blocking programs inescapably fail toblock objectionable speech because they are unable to screen for images. Brieffor the Appellants,  Reno v. ACLU , No. 96-511 (January 1997) at 40-41.Congress itself has repeatedly noted these flaws. A House report found thatsuch software is not the preferred solution because of the risk thatprotected, harmless, or innocent speech would be accidentally orinappropriately blocked. H.R. Rep. No. 105-775 (1998) at 19.          In October 1998, Congress appointedthe Child Online Protection Act Commission (COPA Commission), and charged itwith identify[ing] technological or other methods that will help reduce accessby minors to material that is harmful to minors on the Internet. In October2000, the Commission reported that blocking technology raises First Amendmentconcerns because of its potential to be over-inclusive in blocking content.Concerns are increased because the extent of blocking is often unclear and notdisclosed, and may not be based on parental choices. The Commissionspecifically did not recommend any government-imposed mandatory use of blockingtechnologies.          On October 23, 2000, Peacefire [ii] issued a report of blocking technology which found error rates anywhere from20% to 80%. Error rates were based on sites being blocked as pornography whenthey were, in fact, not pornographic. Study of Average Error Rates forCensorware Programs, October 23, 2000, found at  http://www.peacefire.org/error-rates/ On November 7, 2000,Peacefire issued its report  Blind Ballots: Web Sites of U.S. PoliticalCandidates Censored by Censorware . ( http://www.peacefire.org/blind-ballots/).The report found numerous political candidates sites were blocked by thissoftware. Jeffery Pollock, Republican candidate for Congress in Oregons ThirdCongressional District, had originally favored blocking software. After hearingthat his site was one of those blocked, he reversed his position. The site ofCongressman Markey, the Ranking Minority member of this subcommittee was alsoblocked by one of the programs that characterized his site as Hate, Illegal, Pornography,and/or Violence.           Proponents of blocking often claimthat even if some web sites are blocked, there are others available on thetopic that may be unblocked so the information will ultimately be available.This position makes little sense, particularly when discussing candidate websites. Should a Republican candidate be soothed by the fact that his blockedviews may be found and discussed at his Democratic opponents unblocked website?          On December 12, 2000, Peacefirepublished a report demonstrating that sites of human rights groups were beingblocked by this software.  Amnesty Intercepted: Global human rights groupsblocked by Web censoring software , December 12, 2000, found at:  http://www.peacefire.org/amnesty-intercepted/          Consumer Reports in March 2001 foundthat blocking software varied from 20% to 63% in its over-blocking.          Despite protestations from blockingsoftware supporters that instances of over-blocking are all old examplesremedied by newer versions, these examples are all recent. The flaws ofblocking programs are not a matter of individual flaws in individual products.These flaws are inevitable given the task and the limitations of thetechnology.          As a result of these problems,blocking software fails to protect because it cannot block all material thatmeets the CHIPA criteria. Furthermore, it blocks a huge amount of informationthat should not be considered objectionable, and is clearly protected under theFirst Amendment. CHIPA Restricts Adult Access As Well As Minors          While CHIPA purports to protect minorsby blocking their access to the Internet, it also blocks adult access. Bysweeping so broadly, CHIPA violates the Constitution.          Section1721(b) of CHIPA requires public libraries that participate in the federale-rate program to certify to the FCC that they are (i) enforcing a policy ofInternet safety that includes the operation of a technology protection measurewith respect to computers with Internet access that protects against accessthrough such computers to visual depictions that are (I) obscene; or (II) childpornography; and (ii) is enforcing the operation of such technology measureduring  any use  of such computers. 1721 (to be codified at 47 U.S.C.254 (h)(6)(C)). [Emphasis added.]          Section1712 of CHIPA applies to libraries that do not receive the e-rate discount butreceive funds pursuant to 20 U.S.C. 9134(b), the Library Services andTechnology Act (LSTA), to purchase computers used to access the Internet, orto pay for direct costs associated with accessing the Internet. 1712 (to becodified at 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(1)). Section 1712 requires the same installation andenforcement of technology protection measures as is required by Section 1721(b).1712 (to be codified at 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(1)(A) and (B)).          CHIPA'srestrictions are not limited to library Internet access supported only by thefederal e-rate and LSTA programs. Both the e-rate restrictions in Section1721(b) and the LSTA restrictions in Section 1712 require libraries to certifythat technology protection measures are in place on "" any  of itscomputers with Internet access"" and ""during  any  use of suchcomputers."" 1721(b) (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. 254(h)(6)(C)(i)-(ii));1712.15 (to be codified at 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(1)(B)(i)-(ii)) [Emphasis added].          Thus, whileCHIPA is commonly referred to as a child protection measure, it goes furtherand operates to block adult access as well. In doing so, CHIPA will follow theCDA and COPA along the trail of unconstitutional attempts to censor theInternet.  CHIPA Further Accentuates the Digital Divide          CHIPA willhave little effect on the rich. They can afford their own computers withunfiltered access. The poor who have to rely upon library access to perform jobsearches, school homework, and general research are the ones who will bepenalized by CHIPA.           Publiclibraries play a crucial role in affording access to the economic and socialbenefits of the Internet to those who do not have computers at home. Librariesassure that advanced information services are universally available to allsegments of the American population on an equitable basis.           For manypeople who cannot afford a personal computer or network connections, Internetaccess at public libraries may be their only means of accessing the Internet.Minorities, low-income persons, the less educated, children of single-parenthouseholds, and persons who reside in rural areas are less likely than othersto have home Internet access. For example, Whites are more likely to haveaccess to the Internet from home than Blacks or Latinos have from  any location. Black and Latino households are less than half as likely to have homeInternet access as White households. [iii] According to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration,this digital divide is growing. CHIPA will only worsen the situation withthese unintended consequences. CHIPA Overrides Local Control and Decision-making          Manycommunities spent a lot of time studying the issue of Internet access and howto deal with it in their public libraries. Kalamazoo, Michigan, Holland,Michigan, and Multnomah County Public Library are a few such examples. In eachcase, they decided blocking software was inappropriate for their libraries, andthey opted for other, less restrictive measures to protect their children.           CHIPAignores and overrides those local decisions, instead opting for a one sizefits all scheme that is unworkable and unconstitutional. CHIPAIs Unconstitutional Because it Limits Free Speech          CHIPAwill further be ineffective to protect children because it will be stricken asunconstitutional.           Asyou know, on March 20, 2001, the ACLU and the American Library Association eachfiled a lawsuit in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against the ChildrensInternet Protection Act (CHIPA). Under the Act, any challenge will be heard bya panel of three judges, and appeals from any decision of the panel will godirectly to the United States Supreme Court. The three judges were justrecently appointed. The First Amendment Applies to the Internet In  Reno I, [iv] a unanimous Supreme Court held that the First Amendment applies to theInternet. The Court found the Internet should be afforded the highestprotection under the First Amendment, equivalent to that provided books,newspapers, and magazines. [v] Therefore, any attempted regulation of Internet speech such as CHIPA isconstitutionally suspect. The First Amendment includes the rightto receive information as well as to speak. While the First Amendmentdiscusses the freedom of speech, the Supreme Court has made it clear that italso encompasses the fundamental right to receive information. [vi] In  Reno I,  the Supreme Courtconfirmed that the right to receive information applies without qualificationto expression on the Internet. [vii] Thus, attempts such as CHIPA to restrict information affect the constitutionalrights not only of the speaker, but the recipient as well. For example,blocking a web site on safe sex violates the rights of the web site operator(the speaker) but also the rights of the one who wishes to review that material(the recipient). CHIPAIs a Content-Based Restriction on Speech That Fails the Strict Scrutiny Test CHIPA purports to restrictspeech based on its content (obscenity, child pornography, and material harmfulto minors). Additionally, many blocking software vendors block sites they findpolitically objectionable, for example, sites that discuss or condemnhomosexuality. Content-based regulations are presumptively invalid. [viii] In order to overcome the presumption of unconstitutionality, content-basedrestrictions must meet the strict scrutiny standard [ix] and survive an exacting test. The strict scrutiny test requires that thechallenged statute or regulation is necessary to serve a compellinggovernmental interest, and is narrowly drawn to achieve that end. [x] It is not enough to show that the Governments ends are compelling; the meansmust be carefully tailored to achieve those ends. [xi] Narrow Tailoring and Least RestrictiveMeans Under the strict scrutinyanalysis, the government has the burden of establishing that a regulation isthe least restrictive means and narrowly tailored to its objective. [xii] In other words, the Government is not allowed to use a nuclear bomb when asmall side arm would suffice. Government regulation of theInternet often fails because it attempts to burn the house to roast the pig. [xiii] For example, in  Reno , the Court noted [we] are persuaded thatthe CDA lacks the precision that the First Amendment requires when a statuteregulates the content of speech. In order to deny minors access to potentiallyharmful speech, the CDA effectively suppresses a large amount of speech thatadults have a constitutional right to receive and to address to one another.That burden on adult speech is unacceptable if less restrictive alternativeswould be at least as effective in achieving the legitimate purpose that thestatute was enacted to serve.    Because there were lessrestrictive alternatives available that would be at least as effective as theCDA, the Court found the act unconstitutional.          Likethe CDA, CHIPA restricts far more speech than is targeted. As noted above, notechnology available today reliably blocks  only  obscenity, childpornography and material harmful to minors. Thus, a broad range of speechprotected under the First Amendment gets sidelined, while the filters alsoallow objectionable speech to get through.            In passing CHIPA, Congress failed to consider less restrictivealternatives. It also failed to heed the report of the COPA Commission whichdid  not  recommend mandatory blocking programs, and recommended variousless restrictive alternatives. CHIPA IsOverbroad Overbreadth is a test thatis used when an otherwise legitimate regulation also affects speech that maynot be lawfully restricted.  An example of anoverbroad statute appears in  Reno I ,where the Court reviewed the constitutionality of the Communications DecencyAct (CDA) [xiv] , Congressfirst attempt to regulate content on the Internet. In invalidating the CDA, theCourt noted the acts breadth was unprecedented, [xv] and that it suppressed a large amount of speech that adults have aconstitutional right to send and receive. Therefore, even though the intent maybe to protect children, a law or regulation that burdens speech which adultshave a constitutional right to receive is unconstitutional if less restrictivealternatives would be at least as effective in achieving the Acts legitimatepurposes. [xvi]          Becausethe effect of CHIPA is to suppress more speech than is necessary to achieve thegovernments objective, it is fatally overbroad. CHIPA Is An Unconstitutional Prior Restraint Under the priorrestraint doctrine, the government may not restrain protected speech withoutthe benefit of clear objective standards or adequate procedural safeguards,including provisions for administrative review, time limitations on the reviewprocess, and provisions for prompt judicial review. [xvii] CHIPA implicitly assumes,for example, that a blocking software vendor can legitimately determine whetherexpression is unprotected by the Constitution. From a legal standpoint, thatassumption is incorrect.  In 1973, theSupreme Court in  Miller v. California , [xviii] crafted the definition of obscenity still used today. Known as the  Miller  test, it requires that a trier offact (a judge or jury) examine the work and determine: 1.      Whether the average person, applying contemporary communitystandards would find that the work taken as a whole, appeals to the prurientinterest;  2.      Whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensiveway, sexual conduct specifically defined in the applicable state law; and  3.      Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary,artistic, political or scientific value.   Only if the answer to all of thesequestions is yes can a work be judged obscene and  only then  does it lose its protection under the First Amendment. In order to placecertain speech into the category of obscenity, the government must initiallyprovide a series of procedural safeguards. First, there must be a statutespecifically defining the sexual conduct that may not be depicted or displayed.This requirement helps guarantee that speakers have fair notice of what isprohibited. [xix]  Second,the material cannot legitimately be banned without a full adversarial trial.Finally, a jury must be available to apply the relevant community standardsfor obscenity to the challenged material.          Thefact that a school or library uses third-party software that decides what isobscene material exacerbates the policys unconstitutionality. [A] defendantcannot avoid its constitutional obligation by contracting out itsdecisionmaking to a private entity. [xx]          Mandatoryblocking policies that rely on commercial blocking software constitute priorrestraints because they entrust all . . . blocking decisions . . . to aprivate vendor whose standards and practices cannot be monitored by theblocking library. [xxi]  Allsubstantive blocking decisions by commercial suppliers necessarily lie outsidethe control of the government; consequently, each blocking decision inherentlylacks the requisite procedural safeguards. In fact, in  Mainstream Loudoun ,the blocking software provider refused to provide the defendants with thecriteria it used to block sites, let alone the names of the actual sitesblocked. [xxii] Mandatory blocking policies like CHIPA thus confer unbridled discretion oncommercial software providers, allowing them to restrict accessindiscriminately and without any administrative or judicial review.           Inshort, no speech is unprotected by the Constitution until a court determines itto be so. CHIPA attempts to bypass legal requirements and thus runs afoul ofthe Constitution. CHIPA Is Unconstitutionally Vague It is a general principle oflaw that laws [must] give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonableopportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. [xxiii] If a law is too vague to give this reasonable opportunity, it is deemed voidfor vagueness. When a law interferes with the right of free speech, the courtsapply a more stringent variation of the vagueness test. [xxiv] The Supreme Court has recognized that First Amendment freedoms are delicateand vulnerable, as well as supremely precious in our society. The threat of sanctionsmay deter their exercise almost as potently as the actual application ofsanctions. Because First Amendment freedoms need breathing space to survive,government may regulate in the area only with narrow specificity. [xxv] In order to avoid the vice ofvagueness, the law or regulation must provide explicit standards for those whoapply them. A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters topolicemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis,with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application. [xxvi] Therefore, the law must provide an ascertainable standard for inclusion andexclusion. [xxvii]  Whenthat standard is missing, the law unconstitutionally produces a chilling effecton speech, inducing speakers to steer far wider of the unlawful zone than ifthe boundaries were clearly marked. [xxviii] It forces people to conform their speech to that which is unquestionablysafe. [xxix]           CHIPA provides that [a]nadministrator, supervisor, or other person authorized by the certifyingauthority . . . may disable the technology protection measure concerned, duringuse by an adult, to enable access for bona fide research or other lawfulpurpose. No definition of bona fide research or other lawful purpose isprovided. 1721 (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. 254 (h)(6)(D)). Section 1712provides that [a]n administrator, supervisor, or other authority may disable atechnology protection measure to enable access for bona fide research or otherlawful purposes."" 1712 (to be codified at 20 U.S.C. 9134(f)(3)). Unlikethe comparable e-rate section, this provision appears to apply to minors aswell as adults. Again, no definition is provided for bona fide research orother lawful purpose. The phrase is left to the interpretation of eachlibrarian or staff person tasked with making that determination.  CHIPA ViolatesConstitutionally Protected Anonymity and Privacy CHIPA requires adults (and perhaps minors in the case ofLSTA funds) to seek permission from a government official in order to obtainunblocked access. In doing so, a patron requesting such access loses his or heranonymity and privacy. The Constitution protects anonymity and privacy incommunications and the ability to receive information anonymously. [xxx] CHIPA Violates the UnconstitutionalConditions Doctrine Broadlyspeaking, the unconstitutional conditions doctrine holds that Congress may notcondition receipt of federal funds upon the waiver of a constitutional right.Under CHIPA, Congress conditions receipt of federal money (except in the caseof the e-rate) on the condition that libraries violate the First Amendment. Duringdebates on the Childrens Internet Protection Act (CHIPA), some proponentsclaimed there was no constitutional infirmity in conditioning receipt of federalmoney on acquiring and using blocking software. Even if mandatory blockingitself violated the First Amendment, it was claimed this was circumventedbecause schools and libraries only had to block if they received federal funds.Since they were under no obligation to receive those funds, there was noviolation. TheSupreme Courts decision in  LegalServices Corporation v. Velasquez [xxxi] reaffirms the long-standing principle that the government may not require thesacrifice of constitutional rights as a condition for receiving a governmentbenefit. [xxxii] In  Velasquez , Congress required thatfunds distributed to the Legal Services Corporation not be used to challengeexisting welfare laws. Legal Services attorneys therefore could not representclients in welfare benefits cases if the constitutionality of the welfare lawsbecame an issue. Thus, both the attorney and the client were prohibited fromchallenging these laws; the attorney because of the funding restrictions, andthe client because they could not afford another attorney. The Court thus hadto decide whether one of the conditions imposed by Congress on the use of LSCfunds violates the First Amendment rights of LSC grantees and their clients.The majority of the Court concluded that it did. Whileconcluding that the government may, in certain circumstances, use funding as atool to mold speech, the Court noted [i]t does not follow. . .thatviewpoint-based restrictions are proper when the [government] does not itselfspeak or subsidize transmittal of a message it favors but instead expends fundsto encourage a diversity of views from private speakers. Thesubsidies involved in CHIPA are made to encourage schools and libraries toconnect to the Internet. The funds thus are not intended to facilitate a specificmessage, but rather to encourage the populace to engage in the diversity ofviews that is the Internet. Also, like in  Velasquez ,the money was given to one entity for the benefit of a third party. In  Velasquez , the money was given to LSCfor the benefit of the clients. In CHIPA, the money is given to schools andlibraries for the benefit of the patrons and students.           Thesituation in  Velasquez  and CHIPA isdifferent than that in  National Endowmentfor the Arts v. Finley . [xxxiii] In  Finley , the Court found thechallenged provision only required that the NEA take into account decency andrespect in making its grants. It was not a determinative factor, but one ofseveral considerations. Thus, Congress had not disallowed any particularviewpoints in subsidizing the arts.          TheCourt specifically noted the situation might be different if the NEA engaged inviewpoint discrimination: If the NEA were to leverage its power to award subsidieson the basis of subjective criteria into a penalty on disfavored viewpoints,then we would confront a different case. We have stated that, even in theprovision of subsidies, the Government may not aim at the suppression ofdangerous ideas, [citation omitted] and if a subsidy were manipulated to havea coercive effect, then relief could be appropriate. [citation omitted] [xxxiv]             Velasquez is the latest pronouncement in this area of the law. Since Congress is usingfederal money to force libraries to violate the First Amendment,  Velasquez declares that, under these circumstances, CHIPA is unconstitutional. Constitutional Alternatives That are Less RestrictiveMeans of Accomplishing Congress Goal           Congress passed CHIPA with theintent to protect children. For all the reasons noted above, CHIPA isunconstitutional and will be stricken, in addition to being ineffective.           As noted above, many libraries havealready implemented options that do not involve blocking software and are atleast as effective as blocking. These options include library web sites,educational programs, and Internet Use Policies.          Many libraries have implemented theirown home pages to help patrons identify high-quality and useful sites. Inaddition to providing its own content, a library may provide indexes of otherlinks it has evaluated and can recommend. Cataloging and organizing thisinformation helps lead users to resources in the subject areas of interest andconsequently helps them avoid unwanted resources. Descriptions on the pages canassist users in deciding whether to visit a particular site.          The same philosophy can be applied tolibrary sites designed specifically for children. The site can provide childrenwith a safe Internet experience by visiting sites reviewed by the librarian.          Many libraries educate patrons aboutInternet use. Through education, librarians assist patrons in finding usefulinformation and avoiding unwanted information. Many public libraries offerclasses on the use of the library, the catalog, indexes and systems. In manylibraries, patrons are required to take such classes before they can use publicconnections. These classes cover the librarys use policies. Topics forInternet classes often include: kinds of information and subjects which arelikely to be found on the Internet; how to construct effective, high-qualitysearch strategies taking advantage of features of directories and searchengines (truncation, Boolean searching, searching on phrases); when to usevarious kinds of search aids; how to evaluate resources found; and theadvantages of using library-approved Web sites and other sites known to collectquality resources.          Education was one of therecommendations made by the COPA Commission in its report of October 20, 2000.          Libraries also may offer classes andresources to help parents assist their children in using the Internet safelyand productively. Most reinforce the importance of parental supervision andinvolvement with children when using the Internet. Parents should teachchildren to be educated consumers of information and to talk to their parentsabout what they find online. Parents may be advised to consider settingboundaries on how much time children can be on the Net, and on the kinds ofinformation they look at. Children may also be instructed about the importanceof not giving their names, passwords, credit card numbers, or other personallyidentifying information, or arranging to meet anyone they talk to onlinewithout discussing it with their parents. A good example of these guides is theLibrarians Guide to Cyberspace for Parents and Kids, from the American LibraryAssociation. ( www.ala.org/parentspage/greatsites/safe.html )          Another method libraries use toeducate patrons about Internet use is the development of Internet Use Policies.These policies can remind users about expected use of the library and oflibrary resources in general. The American Library Association has establishedgeneral guidelines for the development of library policies.          Many libraries require patrons to signan Internet Use Policy before they can access the Internet. These policies mayexplain the diversity of information on the Internet, and point patrons to thelibrary-approved resources on the library web page. A substantial number ofpolicies discuss the decentralized, uncontrolled nature of the Internet andwarn patrons that they may encounter material they find objectionable. Thepolicy may explain that beyond the library web page, the library does notmonitor or control the information on the Internet, and that patrons use it attheir own risk. The policy may inform parents that they are responsible fordeciding what library resources are appropriate for their children. The policymay also set rules for Internet use, and can impose sanctions for violations,including losing Internet access privileges, and reporting illegal conduct tolaw enforcement authorities. In many cases, these policies are tied togetherwith educational programs.          There are numerous ways libraries canand do work with parents and children to protect children while they use theInternet. These methods are at least as effective as blocking technologywithout the side-effect of blocking much material that is constitutionallyprotected. Conclusion          Protecting children is a laudablegoal. CHIPA, however, fails to protect children. No blocking mechanism orsoftware is completely effective. At the same time, CHIPA results in blocking alarge segment of constitutionally protected speech to adults as well as minors.Since there are less restrictive alternatives, CHIPA is constitutionallyinfirm.          The First Amendment is part of thefoundation of our society and a bedrock of our principles. Emasculating theFirst Amendment in the name of protecting children only teaches our childrenthat principles are elastic and suggests to them that when those principlesbecome inconvenient, they should be discarded. Such a lesson leaves a childsmoral compass spinning. Indeed, perhaps we do the minors in this country harmif First Amendment protections, which they will with age inherit fully, arechipped away in the name of their protection. [xxxv]      Wecan, and must, protect our founding principles as well as our children. It isnot an either-or situation. With thoughtful consideration, both can beachieved.    AdditionalMaterials: ACLU Complaint  http://www.aclu.org/court/multnomah.pdf Blind Ballots: Web Sites of U.S.Political Candidates Censored by Censorware, November 7, 2000  http://www.peacefire.org/blind-ballots/   Filtering Programs Block CandidateSites, November 8, 2000 (verifying results of Blind Ballots report onCyberPatrol)  http://www.zdnet.com/zdnn/stories/news/0,4586,2651471,00.html   Amnesty Intercepted: Global human rights groups blocked byWeb censoring software, December 12, 2000  http://www.peacefire.org/amnesty-intercepted/   Study of Average Error Rates for Censorware Programs,October 23, 2000 http://www.peacefire.org/error-rates/   COPA Commission Report, October 20, 2000  http://www.copacommission.org/report/   Consumer Reports, March 1, 2001, Digital Chaperones http://www.consumerreports.org/Special/ConsumerInterest/Reports/0103fil0.html   [i]  MarcRotenberg is the Director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC)in Washington, D.C.

The Court disagreed, noting that the second prong of  Miller  contained a critical elementomitted from the CDA: that the proscribed material be specifically defined bythe applicable state law. The Court also noted the CDA went beyond  Millers  application to sexual conductto include excretory activities as well as organs of both a sexual andexcretory nature. Finally, the Court concluded that just because a definitionincluding three limitations is not vague, it does not follow that one of thoselimitations, standing by itself, is not vague.

Losses totaling $15,000 are alleged in    Mirabal's scheme.     On September 19, 2002, a Santa Fe grand jury returned a 6-count indictment    against Henrietta Larkin, an employee of St. Vincent's Hospital in Santa Fe,    for violations of the Pyramid Promotional Act.   Losses totally $21,250 are    alleged in Larkin's scheme.  Larkin targeted women for her scheme called ""Women    Helping Women.""  The pyramid activity took place in the Santa Fe area during    October and November 2000.   Also on September 19, 2002, a Santa Fe grand jury returned 6-count indictments    against Valerie Trujillo and a 5-count indictment against Aggie Lujan, both    of Santa Cruz.  It is alleged that losses totaled $22,500 in Trujillo and Lujan's    pyramid scheme.  Trujillo and Lujan are alleged to have recruited women to their    scheme between September 1 and 15, 2000.   ""The recent series of grand jury indictments should convince anyone who    has a question about this activity to recognize that pyramid schemes are illegal.     Any individuals who obtained money from the promotion of illegal pyramid schemes    should return their ill-gotten gains.  Whether the scheme was called ""The    Dinner Party,"" ""The Gifting Club,"" ""Fields of Plenty,""    or ""Women Empowering Women"" if individuals obtained their money by    bringing others into the scheme then it was a pyramid scheme and it is illegal.     These schemes fail and people lose money.  Hopefully some of those who lost    money in these schemes will receive restitution,"" Attorney General Madrid    said.   Estevan Apodaca, who pled guilty to two counts of violating the Pyramid Promotional    Act, was required to pay $30,000 in restitution and complete 200 hours of community    service by the   district court.  Four individuals in Belen are awaiting trial on numerous violations    of the act.  In late August a grand jury returned a nine-count indictment against    Mary Armijo of Albuquerque for violations of the Pyramid Promotional Act.  Another    Albuquerque resident, Gail Gallegos, was indicted on five counts of violations    of the Pyramid Promotional Act.   ###"

JURISDICTION AND PROCEDURE The court has jurisdiction to entertain this matter pursuant to section 1334 of Title 28 of the United States Code, and  Internal Operating Procedure 15(a) of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. This matter is a  core proceeding under section 157(b)(2)(E) and (H) of Title 28. FACTS AND BACKGROUND The essential facts are not in dispute. The complaint  alleges, and the defendant does not deny, that the debtor, First Commercial Management Group, Inc., was engaged in a Ponzi scheme 2  in which the debtor purported to sell pay telephones to investors who were identified by brokers. until 1998. As inducement, The scheme operated from 1995 were promised certain  investors  benefits, one of which was an annual return exceeding twelve percent of their investment. They were also guaranteed all of  their money back if they decided to withdraw from the enterprise after three years. The debtor contracted to sell more than 6,000  A Ponzi scheme, sometimes called a pyramid scheme, involves an enterprise which makes payments to investors from money received from more recent investors rather than from profits of a legitimate business enterprise.

Ill. 2000). 2  2   pay telephones to more than 2,000 investors nationwide, but fewer than 1,500 of the pay telephones were actually placed and  operated. The debtor made payments to investors from a pool of funds received from new investors rather than from profits derived from operating the pay telephones. The defendant served as a  broker for the debtor, recruiting individuals who paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to purchase pay telephones from the debtor.  The defendant does not contest these general allegations.  He  denies, however, that he had knowledge of the fraudulent nature of the debtor's activities. He also objects to the legal conclusions  the trustee would have me draw regarding the significance of his efforts to assist the debtor. Some facts are agreed to by the parties. are uncontroverted because the trustee Many other facts to take the  failed 3  necessary procedural steps to contest them.  In addition to the  general findings set forth above, I specifically find and conclude as follows: The trustee provided no evidence or affidavits in support of his motion for summary judgment or to contradict the affidavit attached to the defendant's motion. Further, the trustee failed to respond to the defendant's affirmative defense and the defendant's request to admit facts. Accordingly, the facts alleged in the defendant's affidavit, affirmative defense, and request to admit facts are all deemed uncontroverted. 3 3   1. 2.  The debtor's overall business constituted a Ponzi scheme. After performing a two month inquiry regarding the debtor and its principals, the defendant signed a contract with the debtor in which he agreed to find investors for the debtor's enterprise.  3.  The defendant generated $888,450 for the debtor by finding investors.  4.  The  defendant  received  substantial  commissions  from  the  debtor for finding the investors.  The commissions totaled  between 6.75% and 9.12% of the money generated. 5. The percentage of the commissions paid to the defendant for locating investors was in line with commissions paid to other individuals performing similar services in the pay telephone industry. 6. The defendant sold seventy-one pay telephones to investors for the debtor. After the sales, the defendant performed  substantial follow-up services with respect to the investors and verified that seventy of the seventy-one pay telephones were in place and generating income to the investors. 7. The defendant was not aware that the debtor was operating a Ponzi scheme. 8. The defendant was not aware that any of the debtor's  activities were fraudulent. 4   9.  The defendant had no fraudulent intent and performed no fraudulent activities in connection with his services for the debtor.  DISCUSSION Standard on Cross Motions for Summary Judgment The pendency of cross motions for summary judgment does not require that one of the motions be granted. 10A Charles Alan  Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure 2720 (3d ed. 1998). Under Each motion must be evaluated independently.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56, made applicable to this  adversary proceeding by Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7056, a motion for summary judgment must be granted if it is shown ""that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). Trustee's Complaint The trustee's complaint consists of two counts. The first is 4  entitled ""Avoidance of Fraudulent Transfers, 11 U.S.C.  548."" Section 548(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code provides, in pertinent part: 5 4   After eighteen paragraphs of allegations common to both counts, the first count alleges: ""Any commissions paid to [the defendant] within one year of the petition date by [the debtor] were made for less than reasonable equivalent value."" The next and final  paragraph alleges: ""Because [the debtor] was engaged in a Ponzi scheme, it was insolvent as a matter of law and commissions paid to [the defendant] were and are fraudulent transfers as a matter of law."" The second count is entitled ""Avoida nce of Fraudulent  Transfers, 11 U.S.C.  544 and 740 ILCS 160/1,"" and its prayer for relief refers to ""Section 5 of the Illinois Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act."" 5  The allegations in the second count are identical  (a)(1) The trustee may avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property ... that was made ... on or within one year before the date of the filing of the petition, if the debtor voluntarily or involuntarily (A) made such transfer ... with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any entity to which the debtor was or became, on or after the date that such transfer was made, ..., indebted; or (B)(i) received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such transfer ...; and (ii)(I) was insolvent on the date that such transfer was made ..., or became insolvent as a result of such transfer .... 5  The pertinent part of section 544 reads: [T]he trustee may avoid any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property ... that is voidable under 6   to those in the first except there is no limitation regarding when the commissions were paid. In general, section 548(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code provides two theories of recovery. The cause of action in section  548(a)(1)(A) is often referred to as ""actual fraud"" or ""fraud in fact"" because of the requirement that the transferor possess  applicable law claim that is title or that 502(e) of this  by a creditor holding an unsecured allowable under section 502 of this is not allowable only under section title.  The Illinois version of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act is set forth at 740 ILCS 160/1 et seq. The pertinent part of section 5(a) reads: A transfer made ... by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor, whether the creditor's claim arose before or after the transfer was made ... if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation: (1) with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor of the debtor; or (2) without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer ..., and the debtor: (A) was engaged or was about to engage in a business or a transaction for which the remaining assets of the debtor were unreasonably small in relation to the business or transaction; or (B) intended to incur, or believed or reasonably should have believed that he would incur, debts beyond his ability to pay as they became due.  7   ""actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud.""  The cause of action  under section 548(a)(1)(B) is often called ""constructive fraud"" or ""fraud in law"" because it requires no such intent. The title of the second count of the complaint, which refers to section 544 of the Bankruptcy Code and to the Illinois Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (UFTA), invokes that part of section 544 which allows the trustee to pursue a creditor's rights under state law. The combination of section 544(b) and section 5(a) of the causes of action  Illinois UFTA allows the trustee to pursue  analogous to those under section 548(a)(1) but without the one year statute of limitations applicable under section 548. Trustee's Motion for Summary Judgment Actual Fraud In support of his motion for summary judgment, the trustee first argues that the commission payments to the defendant ""are avoidable fraudulent transfers as a matter of law because they were made with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud 6  creditors.""  The Defendant argues that the trustee's actual fraud  argument is not supported by the pleadings and that I should not  Helms v. Roti (In re Roti), 271 B.R. 281, 300 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 2002). 8  6   consider  it.  The  applicable  procedural  rule  7  provides  that  allegations of fraud must be pleaded with particularity. very least, a complaint must be specific enough to  At the give a  defendant full notice of the claims being asserted and to allow a defendant to prepare responsive pleadings. See 5 Collier on  Bankruptcy 548.04[3](15th ed. rev. 2001). The first count of the trustee's complaint does not specify which portion of section 548 it seeks to invoke. Although it is  clear from the allegations regarding ""reasonable equivalent value"" and insolvency that the trustee is asserting a cause of action pursuant to section 548(a)(1)(B), there is nothing in the  complaint to give the defendant notice of a section 548(a)(1)(A) assertion. Except for the reference to a Ponzi scheme, there is  not even a vague reference to an actual intent to defraud. Similarly, the second count does not specify which portion of section 5 of the Illinois UFTA it is based upon. Again, although  the cause of action for constructive fraud can be recognized because of the allegations regarding value and insolvency, there is nothing to alert the defendant to a charge of actual fraud. Consequently, the actual fraud argument raised in the trustee's  Fed. R. Civ. P. 9 (b), applicable to adversary proceedings by Fed. R. Bank. P. 7009. 9  7   motion for summary judgment is not supported by the allegations in either count, and I will not consider it. Constructive Fraud As noted, each count of the complaint adequately pleads a cause of action for constructive fraud, the first count based on section 548(a)(1)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code, and the second count based on section 544(b) of the Bankruptcy Code and section 5(a) of the Illinois UFTA. To prevail on this cause of action under  either count, the trustee must prove both that the debtor received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the commission payments and that the debtor was insolvent at the time of the transfers. 8  The issue of insolvency is not in dispute here, because by definition a Ponzi scheme inevitably becomes insolvent at some point. What the parties vigorously dispute is the issue of equivalent value. The trustee contends that the  reasonably  commissions were paid for less than reasonably equivalent value as a matter of law because they were paid in the context of a Ponzi scheme. The defendant responds that he performed innocently, that  his investors actually received pay telephones, and that he knew nothing about the debtor's fraudulent activities.  8  See the statutes quoted in notes 4 and 5. 10   The critical issue is whether reasonably equivalent value was given and received when the defendant performed services for the debtor and the debtor paid commissions to the defendant in return. Some of the rules governing this determination are clear. The measurement of reasonably equivalent value is a question of fact. In re Image Worldwide, Ltd., 139 F.3d 574, 576 (7th Cir. 1998). The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has recognized that there is no fixed formula for determining reasonable equivalence. Barber v. Golden Seed Co., Inc., 129 F.3d 382, 387 (7th Cir. 1997). The determination depends instead on all of the facts of each case. Id. Important elements in the determination of  reasonable equivalence include fair market value and whether the transaction between the parties was at arms length. Id. (citing Budles v. Baker, 856 F.2d 815, 824 (7 make a th  Cir. 1988)).  A court must  determination of whether reasonably equivalent value  exists by comparing the value of what was transferred with the value of what was received. Id. In this case the trustee urges me to focus on the value of the defendant's services in the context of a Ponzi scheme. He  argues, in effect, that because the enterprise has no legitimate purpose there can be no value in perpetuating it. His most  persuasive authority for this argument is a case decided by Judge 11   Schmetterer of this district; Martino v. Edison Worldwide Capital (In re Randy), 189 B.R. 425 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 1995). The  defendant, on the other hand, urges me to focus more narrowly on the contractual relationship between the defendant and the debtor and the quid pro quo thereunder. His primary authority is a  recent case, In re Churchill Mortgage Inv. Corp., 256 B.R. 664 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2000), an opinion which disagrees with both the analysis and result of In re Randy. The Randy and Churchill cases do decide the precise issue before me, reaching opposite conclusions. The Randy analysis  begins with established principles of Ponzi scheme jurisprudence: when facing fraudulent conveyance actions, investors may keep the principal amount of their investments, but they may not keep any profits from the scheme. In re Randy, 189 B.R. at 437. The  rationale of these cases is described as follows: Most of these decisions reason, as a matter of law, that the investor/defendants in these fraudulent transfer actions should not be allowed to keep payments in excess of their original investments since they would be profiting at the expense of those investors who enter the scheme late and receive nothing. The fact that such investors got into the scheme early enough to make a profit should not entitle them to a reward at the expense of other investors who entered the scheme later. Id. at 437-38 (citations concludes: 12 omitted). The Randy analysis then   The underlying reasoning that courts have used to find that profits paid in a Ponzi scheme to innocent investors are fraudulent transfers applies equally well to commissions paid to brokers who promoted or aided the investment scheme, whether or not they had any culpable intent. Therefore, as a matter of law, when brokers are paid commissions for their efforts in promoting a Ponzi scheme, these commissions are fraudulent transfers under  548 and 544 of the Code. Id. at 438. The Randy case contained causes of action for both actual fraud and constructive fraud. Regarding the actual fraud count, 9  the opinion concludes, as do nearly all of the cases,  that the  principal of the Ponzi scheme, the debtor Randy, had the actual intent to defraud the investor-creditors. Id. at 440. Regarding  the constructive fraud counts, the opinion analyzes the issue of reasonably equivalent value as follows: To determine whether Debtor received value for the transfer, the Court needs to first assess the bargain that Debtor made and which gave rise to Debtor's liability to his creditors ... Debtor's liability for the commissions arose under whatever agreement he made with each of the Defendants. Therefore, whether Debtor was really indebted to Defendants depends on whether or not De fendants had a valid, enforceable right under their agreement with Debtor to receive the commissions. Id. at 440-41. The Randy opinion then cites cases holding that the contract  Mark A. McDermott, Ponzi Schemes and the Law of Fraudulent and Preferential Transfers, 72 Am. Bankr. L.J. 157, 173-174 (Spring 1998). 13  9   between the Ponzi scheme principal and the investors enforceable in excess of the amounts invested.  is  not  That is, the The  contracts could not be enforced by investors seeking profits.  opinion then analogizes again between profits and commissions: These courts have decided that the contract that underlies the transaction is illegal, and therefore no value could have been given by the transferee to the debtor for the transfer. For the reasons that follow, this Court concludes that this argument applies even more forcefully to brokers who have received commissions for helping perpetrate the Ponzi scheme. Id. at 441. The opinion then discusses a possible exception to the The  general rule that illegal contracts will not be enforced.  exception would allow an innocent party to enforce the contract because the rationale for refusing enforcement is not present. The opinion then notes that in some circumstances courts conclude that the public policy against enforcing illegal contracts will prevail over the public policy of protecting innocent parties. Relying primarily on In re Independent Clearing House, 77 B.R. 843 (D. Utah 1987), which refused enforcement of a contract for an investor seeking Ponzi scheme profits, and Dicello v. Jenkins (In re International Loan Network ), 160 B.R. 1 (Bankr. D.D.C. 1993), the opinion concludes: [E]nforcing any agreements between Randy and these Defendants would only exacerbate the harm to the 14   debtor's creditors.Any contracts of the Defendants would be unenforceable, and no value was or could legally be given pursuant thereto to the Debtor or the Debtor's bankruptcy estate. In re Randy, 189 B.R. at 441. In contrast to the Randy analysis, the Churchill opinion focuses on the discrete transaction between the debtor and the defendant, without regard to the nature of the debtor's overall enterprise. that this Churchill, 256 B.R. at 677-79. narrow focus is compelled by The opinion contends the language of the  pertinent statutes.  Section 548(a)(1)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code  refers to ""less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such transfer."" Likewise, section 548(c) affords a transferee a  defense if the transferee ""takes for value and in good faith ... to the extent that such transferee ... gave value to the debtor in exchange for such transfer ..."" The parallel provision of New  York law, applicable in Churchill, contains similar language. Section 5(a) a of the Illinois UFTA also refers in to ""without for the  receiving transfer.""  reasonably  equivalent  value  exchange  After reviewing the case law, the Churchill opinion  then states: [I]t is evident that the analysis which must be used to determine value is a commercial equation which looks to the actual transaction between the debtor and the transferee, and the Court must measure ""what was given 15   and received"" in that transaction. Churchill, 256 B.R. at 679. The Churchill opinion also rightly observes that it would be a legal fiction to say that brokers who produce investors to provide money for a Ponzi scheme are providing nothing of value. Id. at 681. Money is valuable even when used for illegal  purposes. I conclude that the Churchill analysis regarding the proper method of decision is persuasive. I also believe that one of the  premises of the Randy opinion  that profits and commissions should be treated the same  does not withstand scrutiny. fundamental distinction between profits and commissions The was  recognized in In re Scholes, 56 F.3d 750 (7th Cir. 1995)(Posner, J.). In Scholes, the receiver for corporations owned by a Ponzi  scheme principal brought fraudulent transfer actions against the principal's investors former had spouse, received against one of the Ponzi scheme  who  profits,  and  against  religious  organizations that received funds from the corporations. The court determined, as a matter of law, that neither the Ponzi scheme investor nor the religious organizations paid valuable consideration for the property transferred by the corporations. As a result, those transfers were recoverable by the receiver as 16   fraudulent conveyances. With respect to the Ponzi scheme investor, Judge Posner reasoned that he was: entitled to his profit only if the payment of that profit to him, which reduced the net assets of the estate now administered by the receiver, was offset by an equivalent benefit to the estate. . . . It was not. A profit is not offset by anything; it is the residuum of income that remains when costs are netted against revenues. Scholes, 56 F.3d at 757. Regarding the former spouse, however, the Scholes court determined that to the extent she had any legitimate claims against the principal, payments made by the principal to her would not constitute fraudulent conveyances. that if the principal's former spouse: had valid claims against [the principal] equal to the amount of money he gave her, so that by giving it to her he received consideration in the form of a release of commensurate legal obligations to her, this would be adequate and not merely nominal consideration. There would be no net depletion of the estate . . . . Id. at 758. In addition to this analytic difference between profits and commissions, there is also an ethical difference between an innocent broker who performed services and less than innocent investors who, at best, tried to take advantage of a ""deal"" that should have been seen as too good to be true. 17 The court reasoned   The Churchill court had been urged to follow In re Randy, and in declining to do so it identified what it described as the ""fatal legal flaw"" in the reasoning adopted by the Randy court: [I]t focuses not on a comparison of the values of the mutual consideration actually exchanged in the transaction between the Broker and the Debtor, but on the value, or more accurately stated, the supposed significance or consequence of the Broker-Debtor transaction in the context of Debtors' whole Ponzi scheme. . . . [T]he statutes and case law do not call for the court to assess the impact of an alleged fraudulent transfer in a debtor's overall business. T he statutes require an evaluation of the specific consideration exchanged by the debtor and the transferee in the specific transaction which the trustee seeks to avoid, and if the transfer is equivalent in value, it is not subject to avoidance under the law. Churchill, 256 B.R. 664, 680. 10  I am persuaded by the analysis  of  the  Churchill court  regarding how reasonably equivalent value should be determined under these circumstances, and I respectfully disagree with the Randy court's approach. reasonably equivalent I find it appropriate to analyze whether value exists by focusing on the  consideration exchanged between the debtor and the defendant, On appeal, the District Court affirmed the decision of the Churchill court, recognizing that the ""significance or consequence of the Broker-Debtor transaction as it relates to the Debtor's overall Ponzi scheme is of nonrelevance,"" because the law does not require the Court to assess the transaction's impact on the debtor's overall business. Balaber-Strauss v. Lawrence, 264 B.R. 303 (S.D. N.Y. 2001). 18 10   rather than focusing on the conduct of debtor's management, which is extraneous to the exchange that the trustee is seeking to avoid. Having settled on the proper methodology, the next step is to apply it to the specific exchange between the debtor and the defendant in the instant case. The defendant here performed  services for the debtor by recruiting investors for the debtor's business enterprise, and then performing follow up services with respect to such investors. To the extent he did so, the  defendant has a claim against the debtor equal to the value of the services he performed. There was no depletion of the  bankruptcy estate when the commissions were paid to the defendant because, in paying such commissions, the debtor received adequate consideration, or reasonably equivalent value, in the form of a release of any claims the defendant could have asserted against the estate for unpaid commissions. On these grounds, I find that  reasonably equivalent value was exchanged when the debtor paid commissions to the defendant. As such, the trustee's section  548(a)(1)(B) cause of action must fail. 11 U.S.C.  548(c) Even if a transfer were to fall within section 548(a)(1)(A) or (B), section 548(c) of the Bankruptcy Code could shelter the commission payments from the trustee's avoidance powers if the 19   defendant took the commissions ""for value and in good faith.""  11  Consequently, even if the trustee had successfully pleaded a section 548(a)(1)(A) cause of action, or proved a section  548(a)(1)(B) claim, he would still be unable to recover the commissions paid if the defendant received the commissions in exchange for value and in good faith. For section 548 purposes, the term ""value"" is defined as ""property, or satisfaction or securing of a present or antecedent debt of the debtor..."" in section 548(d)(2)(A). In the instant  case, the debtor entered into a contract with the defendant whereby the debtor agreed to pay the defendant commissions for finding investors for the debtor's enterprise. The defendant  gave value, or consideration, to the debtor by locating investors pursuant to the terms of such contract. In return, the debtor  incurred the obligation to pay the defendant for recruiting investors. This obligation constituted a debt that was satisfied through the payment of commissions, and the satisfaction of this  11  Section 548(c) of the Code provides in pertinent part: Except to the extent that a transfer ... voidable under this section is voidable under section 544, 545, or 547 of this title, a transferee ... of such a transfer ... that takes for value and in good faith... may retain any interest transferred ... to the extent that such transferee ... gave value to the debtor in exchange for such transfer .... 20   obligation falls squarely within section 548(d)(2)(A).  See  Merrill v. Allen (In re Universal Clearing House Company), 60 B.R. 985, 998 - 99, (D. Utah 1986). The second issue under section 548 (c) is whether the defendant acted in good faith in receiving the commissions. One  undisputed fact in this case is that the commissions paid to the defendant for locating investors for the debtor were within the range of commissions earned by others for performing similar services in the pay telephone industry. It is also not disputed  that the defendant performed his services without any knowledge that the debtor's activities were fraudulent or that the debtor was operating a Ponzi scheme. that the defendant's actions Moreover, the facts do not show were in any way fraudulent.  Accordingly, I conclude the defendant acted in good faith when receiving his commissions. I further conclude that he would be  protected from any possible recovery by the trustee under section 548(a)(1)(A) or (B) through the shelter provided by section 548(c).  11 U.S.C. 544 As noted above, the second count of the trustee's complaint is brought under section 544 of the Bankruptcy Code and under  21   section 5 of the Illinois UFTA.  Subsection (b) of section 544  allows a trustee to avoid a transfer of a debtor's interest in property if an unsecured creditor could have done so under the applicable state law. Liebowitz v. Parkway Bank & Trust, Co. (In re Image Worldwide, Inc.), 139 F.3d 574, 576-77 (7th Cir. 1998). In this count, the trustee seeks to avoid and recover the  commission payments pursuant to sections 5 and 6 of the Illinois statute which is analogous to section 548(a)(1)(A) and (B) of the Bankruptcy Code. Except for different statutes of limitations,  the state and federal statutes are functional equivalents, and the analysis applicable to the first count is also applicable to the second. 12  Accordingly, the trustee cannot prevail on the  second count of the complaint for the reasons stated above regarding the first count. The Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment Because I have resolved the threshold issue of ""reasonably equivalent value"" in favor of the defendant, and because that issue prevents the trustee from recovering under either count of the complaint (as well as providing the defendant an affirmative defense), it is clear that the defendant is entitled to judgment  12  See In re Roti, supra note 6; In re Randy, 189 B.R. at 22  443.   as a matter of law.  Accordingly, the defendant's motion for  summary judgment must be granted.  Conclusion For the reasons stated herein, the defendant's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED, and the trustee's cross motion for summary judgment is DENIED. This Opinion will serve as findings  of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7052.

GX075-21-2719388	"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:  September 21, 1999    FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:   Genene Wiggins, Jennifer Salvato         (973) 504-6327    New Jersey Sues Operators of Alleged Pyramid Schemes   State Alleges ""Gifting Club"" Scam Defrauded Consumers      out of Hundreds of Thousands of Dollars    NEWARK-The State is suing four New Jersey corporations and their agents for allegedly enticing trusting consumers into paying thousands of dollars to join one of several ""gifting clubs,"" which were nothing more than unlawful pyramid schemes, Attorney General John J. Farmer, Jr., New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs Director Mark S. Herr and Bureau of Securities Chief Franklin L. Widmann announced today.    The State's suit accuses the defendants of defrauding consumers out of hundreds of thousands of dollars after inviting them to purchase membership positions in their ""gifting clubs."" Represented as investment opportunities, consumers were told that as members of the gifting clubs they were virtually guaranteed returns eight times greater than their initial average investments of $2,000.     The suit, filed in Essex County Superior Court on Sept. 15, 1999, names as defendants:    Anova-Tau, Inc., P.O. Box 467, 252 Prospect St., South Orange, a for-profit corporation established in March 1999 and later ""dissolved before commencing business"" in May;   AnovaTau, Inc., 2227 U.S. Highway 1, North Brunswick, the apparent successor corporation to Anova-Tau, Inc.;   Amigos Social Club, Inc., (Amigos) 602 Hamilton Street, Somerset, a non-profit corporation established in May and a possible affiliate of AnovaTau;   Amigos Associates 500 Social Club, Inc., (""Amigos 500"") 602  Hamilton Street, First Floor, Somerset, a non-profit corporation established in May and another possible affiliate of AnovaTau;    Linda K. Shepard, 148 Kingsberry Drive, Somerset, president and a director of AnovaTau, Inc.,  Shepard has also allegedly served as incorporator and registered agent of Amigos and Amigos    500; and     Dawn Neal, the ""records officer"" of AnovaTau and possible director/officer of Amigos and/or Amigos 500.     ""Pyramid schemes are unlawful frauds that rely heavily on the recruitment of others to remain afloat.  They are, however, mathematically impossible to maintain and eventually collapse when they fail to attract new recruits, Farmer said.   When they do eventually collapse, the people who are most vulnerable are the investors sitting  on the lower levels of the pyramid.  We are taking strong and decisive action now to stop  this scheme before it spreads too far and inflicts serious damage on more innocent citizens.""     ""They can call it a gifting club or anything they want,"" Herr said, ""but this gifting club was, is and will always be, a pyramid scheme which is against the law.""   The complaint also asserts that the defendants violated the State's Uniform Securities Law by offering or selling investment contracts, such as the gifting clubs, without lawfully registering the offerings with Consumer Affairs Bureau of Securities (""BOS"").    ""You can't offer or sell an investment such as this without being registered pursuant to the New Jersey Uniform Securities Law,"" Widmann said.  ""Registration is an important step in protecting New Jerseys investors.""     The State's complaint asserts that after just 18 rounds of ""team captains"" graduating off the pyramids, more than one million new recruits would be required to fill the bottom levels of the game boards and after just 28 rounds of so-called ""giftings,"" more than one billion new recruits would be needed.  The State alleges that this mathematical impossibility, and the defendants failure to disclose it, lies at the heart of the pyramid-scheme fraud.    AnovaTau referred to the pyramids as ""boards,"" ""ships,"" or ""gifting ships"" which  followed the classic model for these schemes, the complaint alleges.  AnovaTaus four-tier pyramids consisted of 15 membership positions: eight entry-level positions (""stars""), four second-level positions (""all-stars""), two third-level positions (""superstars""), and one top-level position (""the team captain"").  To buy into the schemes, new members typically were required to pay $2,000.  The games were allegedly promoted through various media, including a toll-free hotline number and an Internet Website: www.amiinc.org .    To make money, the complaint alleges, members would have to recruit new entrants into the scheme and get them to also contribute the $2,000.  Once the eight entry-level positions on the pyramid were filled, the top-level player or ""team captain"" would graduate off the board, and the board or ship would split, creating two new boards or ships.  The players on the boards or ships would advance up one level, creating sixteen new entry-level positions to be filled.    However, according to the State's expert, to remain afloat, the clubs must continually double in size.  The team captain must bring in two new recruits, who then need four new recruits, then eight.  After the first split, 16 new players are needed, then 32 (after the second split) then 64, then 128 and so on.  Without luring additional members into the scheme, those in the bottom rungs could not profit or move up higher in the pyramid.    For example, in only eight rounds of so-called ""giftings"" and  ""boards"" splitting, the number of new recruits would have to reach approximately 1,024 to provide the funds necessary for each preceding member to obtain $16,000.  But after just 18 rounds, the number of new recruits required would be more than one million, and after 28 rounds, the number of new recruits needed would be more than one billion.  In terms of money, that equates to $2 trillion in new money required to allow the pyramid to thrive.    In AnovaTaus pyramid scheme, once all entry-level positions were filled, the ""team captain,"" would leave the pyramid after collecting the $16,000 paid by the eight new members and paying a required $500 participation fee paid to AnovaTau.   That, AnovaTau represented, meant that each successful team captain would leave the pyramid with $15,500   a $13,500 profit or nearly 700 percent over the original $2,000 investment.    At one AnovaTau meeting, the State alleges, 25 team captains graduated off their boards, collecting nearly $400,000, and resulting in income of $12,500 to AnovaTau.    The State is seeking, among other things, temporary and permanent restraints against the defendants; the appointment of a receiver; an order freezing their assets and directing the defendants to refund affected consumers at their own expense; and monetary penalties assessed for violations of the Consumer Fraud Act and of Uniform Securities Law.     Deputy Attorneys General Christopher J. Dalton and Amina Maddox of the Division of Law are handling this case for the State.

GX017-90-0089317	"For Release:                   July 22, 2002 Pyramid Promoter                 Settles FTC Charges                   A leading salesman for an Internet-based business opportunity                 that promised easy income for investors in an Internet shopping mall network has agreed to                 settle Federal Trade Commission charges that the scheme was an illegal pyramid operation.                 The settlement will bar the defendant from engaging in pyramid schemes in the future, and                 from making misleading earnings claims or providing others with the means to make such                 claims if he participates in any multi-level marketing program.                   In November 2000, the FTC charged J.D. Noland and other                 principals and participants of the Mesa, Arizona-based Bigsmart program with operating an                 illegal pyramid scheme. According to the FTC complaint detailing the charges, Bigsmart                 marketed Internet theme ""malls"" that it claimed would enable investors to earn                 substantial income from commissions on products purchased through the Internet. The malls                 were a collection of links to retail sites maintained by independent third-party                 merchants, such as MarthaStewart.com, and to a ""Superstore"" maintained by                 Bigsmart. Bigsmart directed traffic to the malls through the personalized Bigsmart                 ""welcome pages"" to which members could purchase access for a $10 application fee                 and a $99.95 ""hosting"" fee. Although Bigsmart claimed that members would make                 substantial amounts of money by investing in its Internet shopping mall network, the                 scheme was structured in such a way that realizing continued financial gains would depend                 on "". . . the continued, successive recruitment of other participants,"" not on                 retail sales of products and services to the public, according to the FTC's complaint. The                 FTC charged that the claims that consumers who invested in Bigsmart would earn substantial                 income were false; that promotional materials that contained the false and misleading                 claims provided the means for others to deceive consumers; and that Bigsmart was actually                 a pyramid scheme. All other defendants in the Bigsmart case previously settled the FTC                 charges. The settlement announced today ends the litigation with Noland.                   The settlement bars the defendant from engaging in any future                 pyramid schemes. It also bars him from:                     misrepresenting the potential earnings or income of any                     multi-level marketing program;                      misrepresenting the benefits a participant in a multi-level                     marketing program can receive; and                      misrepresenting the amount of sales a participant could expect                     to make.                                     It also bars him from providing others with the ""means                 and instrumentalities"" with which to make false or misleading statements about                 multi-level marketing programs. Based on financial statements provided by the defendant, a                 judgment in the amount of $104,748 will be suspended. Should the Commission have evidence                 that the defendant made misrepresentations in the financial statements, the entire amount                 of the judgment, which represents his income from Bigsmart, will become immediately due.                   The Commission vote to approve the settlement was 5-0. The                 order was filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. This case was brought                 with the invaluable assistance of the Offices of the Attorney General of Texas and the                 Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, & Consumer Protection, Division of Trade                 & Consumer Protection.

GX015-98-14898443	"For Release :  April 10, 2000 FTC Halts Pyramid Scheme       2Xtreme and USAsurance Group/Akahi Claim 60,000 Recruits             At the request of the Federal Trade Commission, a U. S. District Court Judge has halted     the operation of an alleged pyramid scheme and frozen the defendants' assets, pending     trial. The FTC alleges that consumers lost substantial sums of money to the scheme and has     asked the court to order consumer redress after a trial on the merits of the agency's     charges. On December 9, 1999, the FTC filed suit in U. S. District Court for the District     of Maryland seeking a Preliminary Injunction and an asset freeze, pending trial. After a     two-day preliminary injunction hearing that concluded February 25, 2000, Judge J.     Frederick Motz found that based on the FTC's preliminary evidence, it is likely to succeed     in proving in a full trial that the defendants deceived consumers. Judge Motz issued     preliminary injunctions prohibiting the defendants from operating illegal pyramid schemes     and from making various misrepresentations pending trial. The injunctions also froze the     individual and corporate assets to preserve them for consumer redress.       The FTC complaint alleges that Dallas-based 2Xtreme Performance International, and its     successor, Denver-based USAsurance Group/Akahi, used Web sites, direct mail, infomercials,     telemarketing and seminars to convince consumers they could make substantial income by     investing in their multi-level marketing scheme, which marketed nutritional supplements,     beauty, weight-loss and other products. Marketing materials represented that consumers     could expect to earn enough income to retire in two to five years.       The FTC alleged that the earnings claims are false and that 2Xtreme's practices     violated federal law. The FTC charged that since 2Xtreme is actually a pyramid, consumers     will not earn the specific levels of income touted in the marketing materials. In fact,     most consumers will lose money, the complaint says. In addition, by providing promotional     materials containing the misrepresentations about income to its participants, 2Xtreme was     providing them with the ""means and instrumentalities"" to violate federal law.        A trial date has not yet been set by the court.        The injunctions named John T. Polk, Patrick Farah, Peter Hirsch, 2Xtreme Performance     International, USAsurance Group, Inc., Akahi Corp., Akahi.com Inc., and AFEW, Inc. Prior     to the hearing, defendants Peter Hirsch, John T. Polk, and AFEW, Inc. stipulated to the     entry of a preliminary injunction against them. The businesses were based in Englewood,     Colorado; Dallas, Addison, and Carrollton, Texas.

GX016-18-6343220	"FOR         RELEASE:           MARCH 18, 1997           INTERNET         PYRAMID SCHEME MARKETERS          TO PAY $75,000 IN REDRESS UNDER SETTLEMENT WITH FTC           The Federal Trade Commission has negotiated a         settlement with The Mentor Network, Inc. and Parviz         Firouzgar, southern California-based marketers of an         allegedly fraudulent pyramid scheme promoted partially         via the Internet. The settlement would require them to         pay $75,000 into a fund for consumer redress, and would         bar them from operating any chain or pyramid marketing         program. The settlement also includes provisions designed         to ensure that payments to participants in multi-level         marketing programs operated by the defendants come         primarily from sales of goods or services to         non-participants rather than from recruiting new         participants.           Multi-level marketing plans are a way of selling goods         or services through distributors. Distributors typically         receive commissions on both their sales and on those of         others they recruit to become distributors. If a plan         offers to pay commissions for recruiting new         distributors, it could be an illegal pyramid scheme.         According to the FTC, pyramid plans inevitably collapse         when no new distributors can be recruited and, when that         happens, most people lose their money.            The FTC filed charges in the Mentor Network case as         part of Operation Missed Fortune, the broadest         federal-state coordinated law-enforcement and         consumer-education effort ever initiated. Missed Fortune         targeted get-rich-quick self-employment schemes, and         resulted in more than 75 law-enforcement actions by the         FTC and 25 states. The FTC alleged in this particular         case that the defendants made false and misleading         earnings claims in connection with their pyramid scheme         that nominally involved the sponsorship of needy children         in foreign countries. According to the complaint, the         defendants claimed that consumers could receive as much         as $12,285 by (1) paying $24 to join         ""MentorVision""; (2) paying $30 per month for a         minimum of one year; and (3) recruiting three other         people -- they also provided distributors with         promotional materials containing false claims for use in         recruiting other participants. Upon filing of the charges         in federal district court in November 1996, the FTC         obtained a temporary restraining order prohibiting the         defendants from making misrepresentations regarding         profits or earnings in an investment program, freezing         their assets, and appointing a receiver over the         defendants’ business. These provisions were         continued in a preliminary injunction to which the         defendants agreed in December. Mentor Network operates         out of Irvine and Newport Beach.           The proposed consent judgment and order to settle the         FTC charges, if approved by the court, would bar the         defendants from engaging or assisting in any manner in         the advertising, promoting or offering of any chain or         pyramid marketing program, and from making or assisting         another in making any misrepresentation about a material         fact -- including earnings or whether the program has         government approval -- of any marketing or investment         program. In addition the order would require that, with         regard to any multi-level marketing program that the         defen dants operate or in which they play a role, the         payments received by each participant be derived         primarily from the sale of goods or services to         non-participants, and not from recruiting addition al         participants. The defendants would be required to         institute and enforce rules concerning this sales         requirement. The $75,000 in redress to be paid by the         defendants would be due within five days from the date         the court enters the order. If refunds prove impractical,         the money will be turned over to the U.S. Treasury.           The FTC’s Seattle Regional Office handled this         case with assistance from the Washing ton state Attorney         General’s office, and Newport Beach, California,         Police Department. The Commission vote to approve the         settlement for filing in court was 5-0. It was filed         March 17 in U.S. District Court for the Central District         of California, in Santa Ana, and requires the         court’s approval to become binding.           NOTE:  This consent judgment is for settlement         purposes only and does not constitute an admission by the         defendant of a law violation. Consent judgments have the         force of law when signed by the judge.

COLLINS OF HOFFMAN     ESTATES, ILLINOIS, IN CFTC ANTI-FRAUD ACTION FILED IN 1994        Court Says Defendants in the Case Operated an Unregistered Commodity     Pool in a Manner Akin to a Ponzi Scheme, Among other Violations of Federal     Commodity Law        WASHINGTON -- The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced     today that Judge Joan B. Gottschall of the U.S. District Court for Northern     Illinois entered an order of permanent injunction against  Edward M.     Collins  of Hoffman Estates, Illinois, a defendant in a six-count civil     anti-fraud action filed on July 19, 1994 (See CFTC News Release #3777-94).     Thomas Collins of Palatine, Illinois, Edward's brother who is now deceased,     and Lake States Commodities, Inc. of Rolling Meadows, Illinois, were also     named in the CFTC complaint.        The complaint alleged that from at least January 1989 to June 1994, the     defendants cheated and defrauded investors and committed commodity pool     fraud by, among other things, misrepresenting to commodity pool investors     that their funds were invested in a multi-million dollar commodity pool,     when, in fact, such an account did not exist; issuing statements which     falsely reported that investors' accounts were increasing in value as a     result of gains in the commodity pool trading account; misrepresenting that     investors could expect 30 to 50 percent annual returns on their investment     when there was no reasonable basis for such representations; and advising     investors that their investment relationship was to be construed as a     personal loan to Thomas Collins, with no statements issued that could link     the customers to the futures market.        Thomas Collins, who was president of Lake States Commodities, fled his     Illinois residence in June 1994. His whereabouts were unknown until July     22, 1996, when he died in San Diego, California. Edward Collins was the     secretary and a shareholder of Lake States Commodities. Neither Edward     Collins nor Lake States Commodities has ever been registered with the CFTC;     Thomas Collins had been registered as a floor trader since February 1994,     and had been a member of the MidAmerica Commodity Exchange since 1985.        Court Finds that Edward Collins Violated Federal Commodity     Law        The court's permanent injunctive order against Edward Collins finds that     Edward Collins violated anti-fraud and registration provisions of the     Commodity Exchange Act, as charged in the complaint, and enjoins him from     further such violations of Federal commodity law.        According to the court's order, ""The evidence indicates that on repeated     occasions, [the] defendant made misrepresentations to investors and     potential investors, issued false reports and statements, and solicited     funds for a fraudulent scheme. Defendant's fraudulent activities continued     in modified form even after the commencement of the CFTC's     investigation.""        Edward Collins Also Is a Respondent in an Ongoing CFTC Administrative     Action        On May 19, 1994, the CFTC filed an administrative enforcement action     against Edward and Thomas Collins, alleging, among other things, that they     engaged in fictitious sales and noncompetitive trades in violation of the     CEA (CFTC Docket No. 94-13, CFTC News Release #3765-94). That matter is     pending before CFTC Administrative Law Judge Bruce C. Levine.        On June 21, 1994, involuntary bankruptcy actions were filed against     Thomas Collins and the defunct Lake States. The bankruptcy trustee has     brought adverse actions against Edward Collins and others to recover funds     on behalf of investors and other creditors. A number of these adverse     actions are pending.        # # #             Updated February 1, 2001"
GX016-43-14516744	For Release:   April 25, 2000 Equinox International Settles Case with FTC, Eight States      Nearly $40 Million in Restitution for Alleged Pyramid Victims        Consumers who lost money investing in a pyramid scheme they thought was a legitimate     multi-level marketing business, will share in as much as $40 million dollars under the     terms of a settlement between the Federal Trade Commission and law enforcement authorities     from eight states, and William Gouldd and Equinox International of Las Vegas, Nevada. The     settlement also will bar Gouldd from any future involvement in any multi-level marketing     scheme, for life, and requires dissolution of Equinox, Advanced Marketing Seminars, Inc.     and BG Management, Inc. Gouldd and Equinox faced charges by the FTC and law enforcement     authorities from Hawaii, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania,     Tennessee, and Virginia.         In a suit filed jointly with the states on August 3, 1999 the FTC alleged that the     defendants operated an illegal pyramid scheme, made deceptive earnings claims, and     provided distributors with the means and instrumentalities to violate federal law. State     law enforcers alleged violations of state securities laws, deceptive trade practices laws,     false advertising laws, pyramid laws, and licensing requirements laws. Private class     action plaintiffs' lawyers also joined the suit.   At the request of the     FTC and state law enforcers, a U.S. District Court in Las Vegas halted the allegedly     illegal operations of Equinox International Corporation; Advanced Marketing Seminars,     Inc.; BG Management, Inc.; and William Gouldd, their principal, froze the defendants'     assets, and appointed a receiver, pending trial. The trial began April 3, 2000. The     settlement announced today will end the trial process.       The terms of the settlement bar Gouldd, for life, from engaging in any multi-level     marketing operations. It also provides that   cash and corporate and     individual assets will be placed in the hands of the court-appointed receiver for     liquidation. The assets have an estimated book value of nearly $50 million, and once     liquidated are expected to yield approximately $40 million. Proceeds from the sale of     assets will be used for consumer redress and payment of certain court-approved expenses,     including the payment of states plaintiffs' fees and costs and fees and costs to     defendants' and private class action plaintiffs' lawyers. Redress will be paid by the     court-appointed receiver following what likely will be months of accounting and     liquidation proceedings. Consumers who believe that they are eligible to participate in     the redress distribution may check on the status of these proceedings by visiting the     Federal Trade Commission's website, www.ftc.gov, or calling the FTC's Equinox hotline,     202-326-2103.

GX016-43-8807386	"For Release:   November 24, 1998 FutureNet Defendant Settles FTC Charges       Operator Barred from Any Future Multi-Level Marketing     Business       A founder of FutureNet, a company that was promoted as a multi-level marketing program,     has agreed to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that the program was actually an     illegal pyramid scheme. The settlement would bar Larry Stephen Huff not only from any     future involvement in illegal ponzi or pyramid schemes, but from involvement in  any      multi-level marketing.       On February 17, 1998, the FTC filed charges against Valencia, California-based     FutureNet, Inc., FutureNet Online, Inc., and five principals of these corporations seeking     a permanent injunction against future violations and refunds for investors. On February     23, the court issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the defendants' assets and     appointing a receiver for the corporate defendants. On March 3, 1998, the Court modified     and extended the order, maintaining the injunction against pyramiding included in the     initial restraining order. FutureNet, Inc., FutureNet Online, Inc., and two corporate     officers, Alan J. Setlin and Chris Lobato, settled the FTC charges in April, 1998. The     stipulated final judgment announced today would settle charges against Huff. Settlements     have not been reached with two other defendants, Robert Depew and David Soto.        According to the FTC's complaint, FutureNet, Inc. claimed that its recruits could earn     substantial income for the rest of their lives by joining a multi-level marketing program     selling Internet access devices. Consumers paid fees ranging from $195 to $794 to become     Future Net distributors in the scheme, which was promoted on the Internet. But, according     to the FTC, a major portion of the income the defendants promised was not based on sales     of the devices, which are easily available at other retail distributors, including Sears     and Circuit City, at lower prices. Instead, the promised income could only come from fees     paid by newly recruited distributors who would in turn recruit more distributors, vainly     seeking to recruit and collect fees from an endless ""downline"" of new     distributors. FutureNet claimed that their recruits -- so called ""Internet     Consultants"" -- would receive $200 - $400 when they personally recruited another     consultant, and $25 - $50 when a person in their downline recruited a new member. The     agency charged that the bulk of the income from the FutureNet multi-level marketing plan     did not depend on sales of the Internet devices they were purportedly selling, but rather     almost entirely on the recruitment of new distributors -- the typical profile of an     illegal pyramid. Since almost 90 percent of investors in any pyramid program actually lose     money, the defendants' earnings claims were false, and violated federal law, the FTC     alleged. In addition to the pyramid based on Internet access devices, the defendants,     prior to the initiation of the FTC action, also had started a similar program based upon     sales of deregulated electric power, even though no state had deregulated the sale of     electric power at the time defendants began to offer this program.        The settlement announced today would bar Huff from:         engaging, participating or assisting in any pyramid or ponzi scheme, or in any multi-         level marketing program;         misrepresenting the amount of sales a person can actually or potentially make;         making earnings claims without disclosing the number and percent of participants who         earn that much;         misrepresenting that he has received approval from any Commission to sell products or         services;         selling electrical power without meeting state licensing and registration requirements;             The order requires that anyone working for Huff must comply with the settlement     provisions. In addition, the settlement is expressly premised on the "". . .     truthfulness, accuracy and completeness of the financial statements"" provided by     Huff. If the court finds that Huff misrepresented or made omissions about his financial     status, he would be liable for $21 million for consumer redress. The settlement also     contains record-keeping provisions to allow the FTC to monitor compliance.       The Commission vote to approve the stipulated final judgment and order was 4-0.             NOTE:  This proposed stipulated final judgment and order is for     settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by the defendant of a law     violation. Consent judgments have the force of law when signed by the judge.

GX019-99-10540488	CFTC News Release 4398-00 (99-Civ-967A JEC)        For Release May 15, 2000        U.S. DISTRICT COURT ORDERS FORMER ALPHARETTA, GEORGIA, MAN TO PAY     $3.3 MILLION RESTITUTION AND PERMANENTLY BARS HIM AND HIS COMPANY FROM THE     FUTURES INDUSTRY FOR FRAUDULENT COMMODITY POOL SCHEME        The CFTC Alleged that Donald E. James Pooled More than $5 Million     from at Least 25 Investors throughout Georgia and Florida and Fraudulently     Misappropriated Some of the Investors' Funds; In March 2000, James Was     Sentenced to 51 Months in a Federal Prison        WASHINGTON - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced     today that on May 8, 2000, U.S. District Court Judge Julie E. Carnes of the     Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, entered a consent order of     permanent injunction against  Donald E. James , formerly of     Alpharetta, Georgia and  Donald James, Inc. , a Georgia corporation.     The order requires James to pay $3,331,538 in restitution to victims,     prohibits the defendants from engaging in activities in the futures     industry on behalf of others and prohibits James from trading for himself     until the restitution has been fully paid with interest, and permanently     enjoins the defendants from violating federal commodity laws and     regulations.        The order also permanently enjoins James and James, Inc. from soliciting     funds, from controlling or directing the trading of commodity accounts on     behalf of any other persons or entities and from seeking registration, or     claiming exemption from registration, with the CFTC.        Under the terms of the court's order, defrauded investors are deemed to     be third-party beneficiaries of the order, such that at any time after the     Equity Receiver in the case has been discharged, and in any event no later     than five years after date of the Order, each investor may seek enforcement     of the order.        In consenting to the entry of a permanent injunction, the defendants     neither admitted nor denied the allegations in the eight-count civil     injunctive complaint, which was filed by the CFTC on April 15, 1999 (see     CFTC News Release 4257-99, April 21, 1999). The CFTC's complaint alleged     that from November 1994 until April 1999, James accepted and pooled more     than $5 million from at least 25 investors throughout Georgia and Florida     and fraudulently misappropriated some of the investors' funds.        Specifically, the complaint alleged that James and his firm     misrepresented to investors that all of their funds would be used to trade     commodity futures when, in fact, James used less than $200,000 of     investor's funds to actually trade futures. The complaint alleged that     James violated the anti-fraud provisions of sections 4b and 4 o (1) of     the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) by misrepresenting to investors, both     orally and in written statements, that they were earning profits from     futures when, in fact, James actually lost money trading. The complaint     also alleged that James and James, Inc. used some investors' funds to make     returns of principal and purported profits to some of the other investors,     in a manner akin to a  Ponzi  scheme.        Finally, the complaint alleged that James and James, Inc. illegally     acted as commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors without     being registered with the CFTC and that James illegally commingled     investors' funds with his own.        In March 2000, James Was Sentenced to 51 Months in a Federal     Prison        In January 2000, in a related criminal action brought by the United     States Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia with the CFTC's     cooperation, James pled guilty to one count of mail fraud. In March 2000,     James was sentenced to 51 months in a federal prison and he is currently     serving that sentence. Additional criminal charges brought by Fulton     County, Georgia prosecutors are still pending against James.        # # #        Updated February 1, 2001
GX017-48-6149562	FOR RELEASE:  JUNE 30,     1998       CDI Pyramid Promoters Settle     FTC Charges; Nearly $2 Million for Consumer Redress        Three principals of a pyramid scheme promoted through the Internet had promised     investors would earn up to $18,000 a month and receive an unsecured credit card with a     high credit limit. These promoters have agreed to settle Federal Trade Commission charges     that their claims were false and their scheme violated federal laws. The settlement, which     requires approval of the court, provides nearly $2 million in consumer redress and would     enjoin the defendants from operating pyramid or Ponzi schemes, or any program that     promises income primarily from the recruitment of others, rather than the sale of a     product. The order would prohibit misrepresentations in the sale of marketing     opportunities and specifically prohibit misrepresentations about earnings and benefits,     such as receiving unsecured credit cards, from participating in any such program. It also     requires liquidation of the businesses through which the pyramid scheme operated.        In November 1997, the FTC charged that Nia Cano of Long Beach, California, also known     as Nghia F. Cano, Nina DeCano and Nina S. Cano, doing business as Credit Development     International (CDI) and Drivers Seat Network (DSN), and Charles Johnson of Lake Elsinore,     California, marketed the pyramid scheme through recruitment seminars and sales meetings     across the country. The Commission later added additional defendants, including Bryan     McCord of Garden Grove, California. The defendants claimed that, for an initial investment     of $130 and monthly payments of $30 a month, consumers could obtain unsecured Visa or     MasterCard credit cards with high credit limits and make a much as $18,000 per month by     recruiting participants for the program. The FTC alleged that these claims were false.       At the request of the FTC, a Federal District Court issued a temporary restraining     order, freezing the defendants’ assets and appointing a receiver to preserve them.     Following a November 20, 1997, hearing, the court granted the FTC’s request for a     preliminary injunction, continuing the asset freeze and receivership. The FTC asked the     court to issue a permanent injunction and to order redress for consumers who were victims     of the scam. The settlement announced today would resolve the FTC charges against Nia     Cano, Charles Johnson and Bryan McCord. The case will continue against the remaining     defendants.        The settlements will prohibit the defendants from engaging in any pyramid, Ponzi or     other marketing scheme in which a person derives income primarily from recruiting others     into the program. They also will prohibit misrepresentations about earnings and the     availability of an unsecured credit card. In addition, each defendant is enjoined from     assisting other businesses to make such misrepresentations. The settlements prohibit the     settling defendants from releasing the names of the consumers who were recruited to join     CDI and DSN. Further, the settlement with Nia Cano requires the liquidation of her     businesses. Nearly $2 million in assets frozen by the court will be placed under the     authority of a receiver who will implement a redress plan.        The Commission vote to approve the settlements was 4-0.        NOTE:  A stipulated final order is for settlement purposes only and does not     constitute an admission by the defendant of a law violation. Stipulated final orders have     the force of law when signed by the judge.             Copies  of the initial     complaint and Stipulated Final Order are available from the FTC’s web site at  http://www.ftc.gov      and also from the FTC’s Consumer Response Center, Room 130, Th Street and     Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20580; 202-FTC- HELP (202-382-4357); TDD for     the hearing impaired 1-866-653-4261.

GX019-44-5158061	Release: 3899-96 (94-661-Civ. ORL-18)        For Release: April 3, 1996        FLORIDA COURT ISSUES PERMANENT INJUNCTION AGAINST KEITH DOMINICK AND     MAIN STREET INVESTMENT GROUP IN 1994 CFTC ANTI-FRAUD ACTION        Dominick Agrees to Pay Restitution to Defrauded Customers and        to be Barred Permanently from the Futures Industry, Among Other     Sanctions        WASHINGTON -- The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced     today that U.S. District Court Judge G. Kendall Sharp entered a consent     order of permanent injunction against  Keith Dominick  -- individually     and d/b/a  Keith Dominick Investor Group  and  Dominion     Investments  -- and  Main Street Investment Group, Inc. (Main     Street) , a Florida corporation, both of Kissimmee, Florida. The order,     entered on March 30, 1996, requires Dominick to pay restitution in the     amount of $4,528,237 and bars him from the futures industry, among other     sanctions. Neither of these defendants has ever been registered with the     CFTC in any capacity.        The court's action, filed on April 1, 1996, stems from an original     eight-count civil anti-fraud action that was filed in June 1994 against     Keith Dominick and Main Street (see CFTC News Release 3770-94, June 17,     1994 ) alleging that they defrauded commodity pool investors in a manner     akin to a Ponzi scheme. The complaint alleged that the defendants violated     the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations by, among other     things, committing fraud by making misrepresentations, misappropriating     investor funds, and providing false statements to investors; acting as     commodity pool operators without being registered; converting customer     funds to their own use; and commingling the property of a commodity pool     with the property of others. Since 1992, Dominick and Main Street solicited     and received more than $5.9 million from at least 70 pool participants in     Florida, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Texas, and South Carolina, the CFTC     charged. On the same day the complaint was filed, the Court entered an       ex parte  restraining order against Keith Dominick and Main Street     freezing their assets. Approximately $150,000 of the funds were frozen.        Complaint Was Amended, Adding Two Other Individual Defendants        On July 11, 1995, the CFTC filed an amended 14-count complaint to the     original complaint, adding  Rev. Gary A. Smith , pastor of the     Heartland Worship Center, Inc. and  Jay Blevins , president of the     Jeff Blevins Memorial Childrens Fund, both not-for-profit corporations     located in Kissimmee, Florida (see CFTC News Release 3857-95, July 11,     1995). The amended complaint repeats the charges in the original complaint,     and further charges that Rev. Smith and Blevins solicited investors for     Dominick and Main Street and that, in their solicitations, Smith and     Blevins made fraudulent misrepresentations to investors (including     guaranteeing profits of up to 100 percent and representing that the     operation could not lose money) and failed to disclose to investors that     Dominick was paying them a commission. Rev. Smith allegedly solicited over     $1.5 million from at least 38 investors and Blevins allegedly solicited     over $2.5 million from at least 8 investors. The amended complaint alleges     that Rev. Smith and Blevins received, respectively, approximately $378,000     and $325,000 in commissions from Dominick.        Trial Has Begun for Remaining Defendants: Rev. Smith and Jay     Blevins        The consent order announced today pertains only to Dominick and Main     Street. The CFTC's case against Rev. Smith and Blevins went to trial on     April 1, 1996. The CFTC is seeking restitution to investors, disgorgement     of ill gotten gains, and permanent injunctions against Rev. Smith and     Blevins, as well as a civil monetary penalty.        Dominick Agrees to Cooperate Fully with the CFTC's Ongoing     Prosecution of the Case        Specifically, to settle the complaint, defendants Dominick and Main     Street agreed to:                cooperate fully with the Commission's case against Rev. Smith and       Blevens, including giving testimony at trial;          findings that they committed all of the violations alleged in the       complaint, including an admission that they defrauded investors and       converted investor funds;          be permanently enjoined from further violations of the commodity       futures laws; and          be permanently enjoined from ever registering with the CFTC and from       engaging in any activity in the commodity futures industry on behalf of       others.              In addition, Dominick agreed to pay back $4.5 million (plus interest) in     restitution to defrauded investors. Because Dominick had dissipated     virtually all of the customer funds, the settlement provides for monthly     payments of a substantial portion of Dominick's current income, with a     provision for increasing the monthly payment should his financial situation     change.        Finally, Main Street is permanently enjoined from trading commodities     for its own account and Dominick is enjoined from so trading until or     unless he pays the full restitution to the investors.        # # #              Updated February 1, 2001
