To start with the obvious, they were the greatest and most influential act of the rock era, and introduced more innovations into popular music than any other rock band of the 20th century. Moreover, they were among the few artists of any discipline that were simultaneously the best at what they did and the most popular at what they did. Relentlessly imaginative and experimental, the Beatles grabbed a hold of the international mass consciousness in 1964 and never let go for the next six years, always staying ahead of the pack in terms of creativity but never losing their ability to communicate their increasingly sophisticated ideas to a mass audience. Their supremacy as rock icons remains unchallenged to this day, decades after their breakup in 1970.     Even when couching praise in specific terms, it's hard to convey the scope of the Beatles' achievements in a mere paragraph or two. They synthesized all that was good about early rock & roll, and changed it into something original and even more exciting. They established the prototype for the self-contained rock group that wrote and performed its own material. As composers, their craft and melodic inventiveness were second to none, and key to the evolution of rock from its blues/R&B-based forms into a style that was far more eclectic, but equally visceral. As singers, both John Lennon and Paul McCartney were among the best and most expressive vocalists in rock; the group's harmonies were intricate and exhilarating. As performers, they were (at least until touring had ground them down) exciting and photogenic; when they retreated into the studio, they were instrumental in pioneering advanced techniques and multi-layered arrangements. They were also the first British rock group to achieve worldwide prominence, launching a British Invasion that made rock truly an international phenomenon.     More than any other top group, the Beatles' success was very much a case of the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. Their phenomenal cohesion was due in large degree to most of the group having known each other and played together in Liverpool for about five years before they began to have hit records. Guitarist and teenage rebel John Lennon got hooked on rock & roll in the mid-'50s, and formed a band, the Quarrymen, at his high school. Around mid-1957, the Quarrymen were joined by another guitarist, Paul McCartney, nearly two years Lennon's junior. A bit later they were joined by another guitarist, George Harrison, a friend of McCartney. The Quarrymen would change lineups constantly in the late '50s, eventually reducing to the core trio of guitarists, who'd proven themselves to be the best musicians and most personally compatible individuals within the band.     The Quarrymen changed their name to the Silver Beatles in 1960, quickly dropping the ""Silver"" to become just the Beatles. Lennon's art college friend Stuart Sutcliffe joined on bass, but finding a permanent drummer was a vexing problem until Pete Best joined in the summer of 1960. He successfully auditioned for the combo just before they left for a several-month stint in Hamburg, Germany.    Hamburg was the Beatles' baptism by fire. Playing grueling sessions for hours on end in one of the most notorious red-light districts in the world, the group was forced to expand its repertoire, tighten up its chops, and invest its show with enough manic energy to keep the rowdy crowds satisfied. When they returned to Liverpool at the end of 1960, the band formerly also-rans on the exploding Liverpudlian ""beat"" scene were suddenly the most exciting act on the local circuit. They consolidated their following in 1961 with constant gigging in the Merseyside area, most often at the legendary Cavern Club, the incubator of the Merseybeat sound.    They also returned for engagements in Hamburg during 1961, although Sutcliffe dropped out of the band that year to concentrate on his art school studies there. McCartney took over on bass, Harrison settled in as lead guitarist, and Lennon had rhythm guitar; everyone sang. In mid-1961, the Beatles (minus Sutcliffe) made their first recordings in Germany, as a backup group to a British rock guitarist/singer based in Hamburg, Tony Sheridan. The Beatles hadn't fully developed at this point, and these recordings many of which (including a couple of Sheridan-less tracks) were issued only after the band's rise to fame found their talents in a most embryonic state. The Hamburg stint was also notable for gaining the Beatles sophisticated, artistic fans such as Sutcliffe's girlfriend, Astrid Kirchherr, who influenced all of them (except Best) to restyle their quiffs in the moptops that gave the musicians their most distinctive visual trademark. (Sutcliffe, tragically, would die of a brain hemorrhage in April 1962).     Near the end of 1961, the Beatles' exploding local popularity caught the attention of local record store manager Brian Epstein, who was soon managing the band as well. He used his contacts to swiftly acquire a January 1, 1962, audition at Decca Records that has been heavily bootlegged (some tracks were officially released in 1995). After weeks of deliberation, Decca turned them down as did several other British labels. Epstein's perseverance was finally rewarded with an audition for producer George Martin at Parlophone, an EMI subsidiary; Martin signed the Beatles in mid-1962. By this time, Epstein was assiduously grooming his charges for national success by influencing them to smarten up their appearance, dispensing with their leather jackets and trousers in favor of tailored suits and ties.     One more major change was in the offing before the Beatles made their Parlophone debut. In August 1962, drummer Pete Best was kicked out of the group, a controversial decision that has been the cause of much speculation since. There is still no solid consensus as to whether it was because of his solitary, moody nature; the other Beatles' jealousy of his popularity with the fans; his musical shortcomings (George Martin had already told Epstein that Best wasn't good enough to drum on recordings); or his refusal to wear his hair in bangs. What seems most likely was that the Beatles simply found his personality incompatible, preferring to enlist Ringo Starr (born Richard Starkey), a drummer with another popular Merseyside outfit, Rory Storm & the Hurricanes. Starr had been in the Beatles for a few weeks when they recorded their first single, ""Love Me Do""/""P.S. I Love You,"" in September 1962. Both sides of the 45 were Lennon-McCartney originals, and the songwriting team would be credited with most of the group's material throughout the Beatles' career.     The single, a promising but fairly rudimentary effort, hovered around the lower reaches of the British Top 20. The Beatles phenomenon didn't truly kick in until ""Please Please Me,"" which topped the British charts in early 1963. This was the prototype British Invasion single: an infectious melody, charging guitars, and positively exuberant harmonies. The same traits were evident on their third 45, ""From Me to You"" (a British number one), and their debut LP, Please Please Me. Although it was mostly recorded in a single day, Please Please Me topped the British charts for an astonishing 30 weeks, establishing the group as the most popular rock & roll act ever seen in the U.K.     What the Beatles had done was take the best elements of the rock and pop they loved and make them their own. Since the Quarrymen days, they had been steeped in the classic early rock of Elvis, Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Carl Perkins, and the Everly Brothers; they'd also kept an ear open to the early '60s sounds of Motown, Phil Spector, and the girl groups. What they added was an unmatched songwriting savvy (inspired by Brill Building teams such as Gerry Goffin and Carole King), a brash guitar-oriented attack, wildly enthusiastic vocals, and the embodiment of the youthful flair of their generation, ready to dispense with postwar austerity and claim a culture of their own. They were also unsurpassed in their eclecticism, willing to borrow from blues, popular standards, gospel, folk, or whatever seemed suitable for their musical vision. Producer George Martin was the perfect foil for the group, refining their ideas without tinkering with their cores; during the last half of their career, he was indispensable for his ability to translate their concepts into arrangements that required complex orchestration, innovative applications of recording technology, and an ever-widening array of instruments.     Just as crucially, the Beatles were never ones to stand still and milk formulas. All of their subsequent albums and singles would show remarkable artistic progression (though never at the expense of a damn catchy tune). Even on their second LP, With the Beatles (1963), it was evident that their talents as composers and instrumentalists were expanding furiously, as they devised ever more inventive melodies and harmonies, and boosted the fullness of their arrangements. ""She Loves You"" and ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" established the group not just as a popular music act, but as a phenomenon never before seen in the British entertainment business, as each single sold over a million copies in the U.K. After some celebrated national TV appearances, Beatlemania broke out across the British Isles in late 1963, and the group generating screams and hysteria at all of their public appearances, musical or otherwise.     Capitol, which had first refusal of the Beatles' recordings in the United States, had declined to issue the group's first few singles, which ended up appearing on relatively small American independents. Capitol took up its option on ""I Want to Hold Your Hand,"" which stormed to the top of the U.S. charts within weeks of its release on December 26, 1963. The Beatles' television appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show in February of 1964 launched Beatlemania (and the entire British Invasion) on an even bigger scale than it had reached in Britain. In the first week of April 1964, the Beatles had the Top Five best-selling singles in the U.S.; they also had the first two slots on the album charts, as well as other entries throughout the Billboard Top 100. No one had ever dominated the market for popular music so heavily; it's doubtful that anyone ever will again. The Beatles themselves would continue to reach number one with most of their singles and albums until their 1970 breakup.     Hard as it may be to believe today, the Beatles were often dismissed by cultural commentators of the time as nothing more than a fad that would vanish within months as the novelty wore off. The group ensured this wouldn't happen by making A Hard Day's Night in early 1964, a cina vitstyle motion picture comedy/musical that cemented their image as ""the Fab Four"": happy-go-lucky, individualistic, cheeky, funny lads with nonstop energy. The soundtrack was also a triumph, consisting entirely of Lennon-McCartney tunes, including such standards as the title tune, ""And I Love Her,"" ""If I Fell,"" ""Can't Buy Me Love,"" and ""Things We Said Today."" George Harrison's resonant 12-string electric guitar leads were hugely influential; the movie helped persuade the Byrds, then folksingers, to plunge all out into rock & roll, and the Beatles (along with Bob Dylan) would be hugely influential on the folk-rock explosion of 1965. The Beatles' success, too, had begun to open the U.S. market for fellow Brits like the Rolling Stones, the Animals, and the Kinks, and inspired young American groups like the Beau Brummels, Lovin' Spoonful, and others to mount a challenge of their own with self-penned material that owed a great debt to Lennon-McCartney.     Between riotous international tours in 1964 and 1965, the Beatles continued to squeeze out more chart-topping albums and singles. (Until 1967, the group's British albums were often truncated for release in the States; when their catalog was transferred to CD, the albums were released worldwide in their British configurations.) In retrospect, critics have judged Beatles for Sale (late 1964) and Help! (mid-1965) as the band's least impressive efforts. To some degree, that's true. Touring and an insatiable market placed heavy demands upon their songwriting, and some of the originals and covers on these records, while brilliant by many group's standards, were filler in the context of the Beatles' best work.     But when at the top of their game, the group was continuing to push forward. ""I Feel Fine"" had feedback and brilliant guitar leads; ""Ticket to Ride"" showed the band beginning to incorporate the ringing, metallic, circular guitar lines that would be appropriated by bands like the Byrds; ""Help!"" was their first burst of confessional lyricism; ""Yesterday"" employed a string quartet. John Lennon in particular was beginning to exhibit a Dylanesque influence in his songwriting on such folky, downbeat numbers as ""I'm a Loser"" and ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away."" And tracks like ""I Don't Want to Spoil the Party"" and ""I've Just Seen a Face"" had a strong country flavor.     Although the Beatles' second film, Help!, was a much sillier and less sophisticated affair than their first feature, it too was a huge commercial success. By this time, though, the Beatles had nothing to prove in commercial terms; the remaining frontiers were artistic challenges that could only be met in the studio. They rose to the occasion at the end of 1965 with Rubber Soul, one of the classic folk-rock records. Lyrically, Lennon, McCartney, and even Harrison (who was now writing some tunes on his own) were evolving beyond boy-girl scenarios into complex, personal feelings. They were also pushing the limits of studio rock by devising new guitar and bass textures, experimenting with distortion and multi-tracking, and using unconventional (for rock) instruments like the sitar.     As much of a progression as Rubber Soul was relative to their previous records, it was but a taster for the boundary-shattering outings of the next few years. The ""Paperback Writer""/""Rain"" single found the group abandoning romantic themes entirely, boosting the bass to previously unknown levels, and fooling around with psychedelic imagery and backward tapes on the B-side. Drugs (psychedelic and otherwise) were fueling their already fertile imaginations, but they felt creatively hindered by their touring obligations. Revolver, released in the summer of 1966, proved what the group could be capable of when allotted months of time in the studio. Hazy hard guitars and thicker vocal arrangements formed the bed of these increasingly imagistic, ambitious lyrics; the group's eclecticism now encompassed everything from singalong novelties (""Yellow Submarine"") and string quartet-backed character sketches (""Eleanor Rigby"") to Indian-influenced swirls of echo and backward tapes (""Tomorrow Never Knows""). Some would complain that the Beatles had abandoned the earthy rock of their roots for clever mannerism. But Revolver, like virtually all of the group's singles and albums from ""She Loves You"" on, would be a worldwide chart-topper.     For the past couple of years, live performance had become a rote exercise for the group, tired of competing with thousands of screaming fans that drowned out most of their voices and instruments. A 1966 summer worldwide tour was particularly grueling: the group's entourage was physically attacked in the Philippines after a perceived snub of the country's queen, and a casual remark by John Lennon about the Beatles being bigger than Jesus Christ was picked up in the States, resulting in the burning of Beatle records in the Bible belt and demands for a repentant apology. Their final concert of that American tour (in San Francisco on August 29, 1966) would be their last in front of a paying audience, as the group decided to stop playing live in order to concentrate on their studio recordings.     This was a radical (indeed, unprecedented) step in 1966, and the media was rife with speculation that the act was breaking up, especially after all four spent late 1966 engaged in separate personal and artistic pursuits. The appearance of the ""Penny Lane""/""Strawberry Fields Forever"" single in February 1967 squelched these concerns. Frequently cited as the strongest double A-side ever, the Beatles were now pushing forward into unabashedly psychedelic territory in their use of orchestral arrangements and Mellotron, without abandoning their grasp of memorable melody and immediately accessible lyrical messages.     Sgt. Pepper, released in June 1967 as the Summer of Love dawned, was the definitive psychedelic soundtrack. Or, at least, so it was perceived at the time: subsequent critics have painted the album as an uneven affair, given a conceptual unity via its brilliant multi-tracked overdubs, singalong melodies, and fairy tale-ish lyrics. Others remain convinced, as millions did at the time, that it represented pop's greatest triumph, or indeed an evolution of pop into art with a capital A. In addition to mining all manner of roots influences, the musicians were also picking up vibes from Indian music, avant-garde electronics, classical, music hall, and more. When the Beatles premiered their hippie anthem ""All You Need Is Love"" as part of a worldwide TV broadcast, they had been truly anointed as spokespersons for their generation (a role they had not actively sought), and it seemed they could do no wrong.     Musically, that would usually continue to be the case, but the group's strength began to unravel at a surprisingly quick pace. In August 1967, Brian Epstein prone to suicidal depression over the past year died of a drug overdose, leaving them without a manager. They pressed on with their next film project, Magical Mystery Tour, directed by themselves; lacking focus or even basic professionalism, the picture bombed when it was premiered on BBC television in December 1967, giving the media the first real chance they'd ever had to roast the Beatles over a flame. (Another film, the animated feature Yellow Submarine, would appear in 1968, although the Beatles had little involvement with the project, either in terms of the movie or the soundtrack.) In early 1968, the Beatles decamped to India for a course in transcendental meditation with the Maharishi; this too became something of a media embarrassment as each of the four would eventually depart the course before its completion.     The Beatles did use their unaccustomed peace in India to compose a wealth of new material. Judged solely on musical merit, The White Album, a double LP released in late 1968, was a triumph. While largely abandoning their psychedelic instruments to return to guitar-based rock, they maintained their whimsical eclecticism, proving themselves masters of everything from blues-rock to vaudeville. As individual songwriters, too, it contains some of their finest work (as does the brilliant non-LP single from this era, ""Hey Jude""/""Revolution"").     The problem, at least in terms of the group's long-term health, was that these were very much individual songs, as opposed to collective ones. Lennon and McCartney had long composed most of their tunes separately (you can almost always tell the composer by the lead vocalist). But they had always fed off of each other not only to supply missing bits and pieces that would bring a song to completion, but to provide a competitive edge that would bring out the best in the other. McCartney's romantic melodicism and Lennon's more acidic, gritty wit were perfect complements for one another. By The White Album, it was clear (if only in retrospect) that each member was more concerned with his own expression than that of the collective group: a natural impulse, but one that was bound to lead to difficulties.     In addition, George Harrison was becoming a more prolific and skilled composer as well, imbuing his own melodies (which were nearly the equal of those of his more celebrated colleagues) with a cosmic lightness. Harrison was beginning to resent his junior status, and the group began to bicker more openly in the studio. Ringo Starr, whose solid drumming and good nature could usually be counted upon (as was evident in his infrequent lead vocals), actually quit for a couple of weeks in the midst of the White Album sessions (though the media was unaware of this at the time). Personal interests were coming into play as well: Lennon's devotion to romantic and artistic pursuits with his new girlfriend (and soon-to-be wife) Yoko Ono was diverting his attentions from the Beatles. Apple Records, started by the group earlier in 1968 as a sort of utopian commercial enterprise, was becoming a financial and organizational nightmare.     These weren't the ideal conditions under which to record a new album in January 1969, especially when McCartney was pushing the group to return to live performing, although none of the others seemed especially keen on the idea. They did agree to try and record a ""back-to-basics,"" live-in-the-studio-type LP, the sessions being filmed for a television special. That plan almost blew up when Harrison, in the midst of tense arguments, left the group for a few days. Although he returned, the idea of playing live concerts was put on the back burner; Harrison enlisted American soul keyboardist Billy Preston as kind of a fifth member on the sessions, both to beef up the arrangements and to alleviate the uncomfortable atmosphere. Exacerbating the problem was that the Beatles didn't have a great deal of first-class new songs to work with, although some were excellent. In order to provide a suitable concert-like experience for the film, the group did climb the roof of their Apple headquarters in London to deliver an impromptu performance on January 30, 1969, before the police stopped it; this was their last live concert of any sort.     Generally dissatisfied with these early-1969 sessions, the album and film at first titled Get Back, and later to emerge as Let It Be remained in the can as the group tried to figure out how the projects should be mixed, packaged, and distributed. A couple of the best tracks, ""Get Back""/""Don't Let Me Down,"" were issued as a single in the spring of 1969. By this time, the Beatles' quarrels were intensifying in a dispute over management: McCartney wanted their affairs to be handled by his new father-in-law, Lee Eastman, while the other members of the group favored a tough American businessman, Allen Klein.     It was something of a miracle, then, that the final album recorded by the group, Abbey Road, was one of their most unified efforts (even if, by this time, the musicians were recording many of their parts separately). It certainly boasted some of their most intricate melodies, harmonies, and instrumental arrangements; it also heralded the arrival of Harrison as a composer of equal talent to Lennon and McCartney, as George wrote the album's two most popular tunes, ""Something"" and ""Here Comes the Sun."" The Beatles were still progressing, but it turned out to be the end of the road, as their business disputes continued to magnify. Lennon, who had begun releasing solo singles and performing with friends as the Plastic Ono Band, threatened to resign in late 1969, although he was dissuaded from making a public announcement.     Most of the early-1969 tapes remained unreleased, partially because the footage for the planned television broadcast of these sessions was now going to be produced as a documentary movie. The accompanying soundtrack album, Let It Be, was delayed so that its release could coincide with that of the film. Lennon, Harrison, and Allen Klein decided to have celebrated American producer Phil Spector record some additional instrumentation and do some mixing. Thus the confusion that persists among most rock listeners to this day: Let It Be, although the last Beatles album to be released, was not the last one to be recorded. Abbey Road should actually be considered as the Beatles' last album; most of the material on Let It Be, including the title track (which would be the last single released while the group was still together), was recorded several months before the Abbey Road sessions began in earnest, and a good 15 months or so before its May 1970 release.     By that time, the Beatles were no more. In fact, there had been no recording done by the group as a unit since August 1969, and each member of the band had begun to pursue serious outside professional interests independently via the Plastic Ono Band, Harrison's tour with Delaney & Bonnie, Starr's starring role in the Magic Christian film, or McCartney's first solo album. The outside world for the most part remained almost wholly unaware of the seriousness of the group's friction, making it a devastating shock for much of the world's youth when McCartney announced that he was leaving the Beatles on April 10, 1970. (The ""announcement"" was actually contained in a press release for his new album, in which his declaration of his intention to work on his own effectively served as a notice of his departure.)     The final blow, apparently, was the conflict between the release dates of Let It Be and McCartney's debut solo album. The rest of the group asked McCartney to delay his release until after Let It Be; McCartney refused and, for good measure, was distressed by Spector's post-production work on Let It Be, particularly the string overdubs on ""The Long and Winding Road,"" which became a posthumous Beatles single that spring. Although McCartney received much of the blame for the split, it should be remembered that he had done more than any other member to keep the group going since Epstein's death, and that each of the other Beatles had threatened to leave well before McCartney's departure. With hindsight, the breakup seemed inevitable in view of their serious business disagreements and the growth of their individual interests.     As bitter as the initial headlines were to swallow, the feuding would grow much worse over the next few years. At the end of 1970, McCartney sued the rest of the Beatles in order to dissolve their partnership; the battle dragged through the courts for years, scotching any prospects of a group reunion. In any case, each member of the band quickly established a viable solo career. In fact, at the outset it could have been argued that the artistic effects of the split were in some ways beneficial, freeing Lennon and Harrison to make their most uncompromising artistic statements (Plastic Ono Band and All Things Must Pass). George's individual talents in particular received acclaim that had always eluded him when he was overshadowed by Lennon-McCartney. Paul had a much rougher time with the critics, but continued to issue a stream of hit singles, hitting a commercial and critical jackpot at the end of 1973 with the massively successful Band on the Run. Ringo did not have the songwriting acumen to compete on the same level as the others, yet he too had quite a few big hit singles in the early '70s, often benefiting from the assistance of his former bandmates.     Yet within a short time, it became apparent both that the Beatles were not going to settle their differences and reunite, and that their solo work could not compare with what they were capable of creating together. The stereotype has it that the split allowed each of them to indulge in their worst tendencies to their extremes: Lennon in agitprop, Harrison in holier-than-thou mysticism, McCartney in cutesy pop, Starr in easy listening rock. There's a good deal of truth in this, but it's also important to bear in mind that what was most missing was a sense of group interaction. The critical party line often champions Lennon as the angry, realist rocker, and McCartney as the melodic balladeer, but this is a fallacy: each of them was capable, in roughly equal measures, of ballsy all-out rock and sweet romanticism. What is not in dispute is that they sparked each other to reach heights that they could not attain on their own.     Despite periodic rumors of reunions throughout the 1970s, no group projects came close to materializing. It should be added that the Beatles themselves continued to feud to some degree, and from all evidence weren't seriously interested in working together as a unit. Any hopes of a reunion vanished when Lennon was assassinated in New York City in December 1980. The Beatles continued their solo careers throughout the 1980s, but their releases became less frequent, and their commercial success gradually diminished as listeners without first-hand memories of the combo created their own idols.     The popularity of the Beatles-as-unit, however, proved eternal. In part, this is because the group's 1970 split effectively short-circuited the prospects of artistic decline; the body of work that was preserved was uniformly strong. However, it's also because, like any great works of art, the Beatles' records carried an ageless magnificence that continues to captivate new generations of listeners. So it is that Beatles records continue to be heard on radio in heavy rotation, continue to sell in massive quantities, and continue to be covered and quoted by rock and pop artists through the present day.     Legal wrangles at Apple prevented the official issue of previously unreleased Beatle material for over two decades (although much of it was frequently bootlegged). The situation finally changed in the 1990s, after McCartney, Harrison, Starr, and Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, settled their principal business disagreements. In 1994, this resulted in a double CD of BBC sessions from the early and mid-'60s. The following year, a much more ambitious project was undertaken: a multi-part film documentary, broadcast on network television in 1995, and then released (with double the length) for the home video market in 1996, with the active participation of the surviving Beatles.     To coincide with the Anthology documentary, three double CDs of previously unreleased/rare material were issued in 1995 and 1996. Additionally,   "

Albums contained largely "" filler "" material (unexceptional songs) along with one or two hits. The Beatles rarely incorporated singles as part of their albums, thus defining the  album  as more important.   Several Beatles album covers have been copied or parodied, for example:             With the Beatles  was imitated by  Meet the Residents  ( The Residents ),  Red  ( King Crimson ),  Get The Knack  ( The Knack ),  Meet the Smithereens  ( The Smithereens ), and  Deface the Music  ( Utopia ) - itself an album of pastiches spanning the Beatles' career.   Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  was imitated by  The Yellow Album  ( The Simpsons ) and  We're Only in It for the Money  ( Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention )   The White Album  was imitated by  Boyd Rice ,  Prince ,  Metallica , and  Jay-Z , who all released albums with black covers called ""The Black Album"". There is also a  SpongeBob SquarePants  soundtrack called ""The Yellow Album"". Weezer also has three self-titled albums that are known better as the Red, Blue and Green Albums.   Abbey Road  was imitated by  The Abbey Road E.P.  ( Red Hot Chili Peppers )   Let It Be  was imitated by  Demon Days  ( Gorillaz )             [ edit ]   Music videos   In the mid-1960s, the Beatles began filming promotional  music videos  for their songs, which they sent to television networks in lieu of appearing in person.   "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" was made in 1967. It used many techniques previously only seen in experimental film, including intricate  jump-cuts  that rapidly alternated between night and day, reversed film, and other  avant-garde  devices. These techniques were later copied and the use of such film and videos started the now common practice of releasing a video clip to accompany singles.   Dick Lester got a formal letter from MTV declaring him the father of the modern pop video, for the work he did directing both of the early Beatles films, A Hard Days Night and Help!"". His revolutionary camera techniques together with short lines of dialogue and rapid editing cuts were all seen as the precursor to the modern rock video.     [ edit ]   Cover versions       Main article:  List of artists who have covered the Beatles       In May 1966, John Lennon said of people covering their songs, ""Lack of feeling in an emotional sense is responsible for the way some singers do our songs. They don't understand and are too old to grasp the feeling. Beatles are really the only people who can play Beatle music."" [ 1 ]   Although many artists have performed covers of songs by The Beatles, the following are among the most notable.     [ edit ]   Oasis   Both Noel and Liam Gallagher have revealed the massive influence The Beatles have on their music. On their EP  Cigarettes and Alcohol , there is a live version of Beatles' song  I Am The Walrus . Oasis have also covered  Helter Skelter  and  Strawberry Fields Forever .   Oasis songs also often contain references to Beatles' songs, such as:   Sing a song to me/One from Let It Be    Be Here Now  off  Be Here Now .     You can sail with me/In my yellow submarine -  Supersonic  off  Definitely Maybe     Id like to be/Under the sea -  Take Me Away  off  Supersonic [EP]  (This is a direct line-take from Beatles song  Octopuses Garden )     Fool on the Hill and I Feel Fine -  DYou Know What I Mean?  off  Be Here Now     Down the long and winding road/and back home to you -  My Big Mouth  off  Be Here Now   On the way to the studio to record an extra verse for  ""Shakermaker"" , Noel realised he had no lyrics for it. On the way, the car stopped at some traffic lights by a familiar record shop, ""Sifter's"". Noel turned this journey into the missing verse,  ""Mr Sifter sold me songs/When I was just 16/Now he stops at traffic lights/But only when they're green"" [ citation needed ] . The video for the single was shot partly at the record shop, and during this verse Liam is seen holding the Paul McCartney and Wings LP  ""Red Rose Speedway"".   The video to  ""All Around The World""  (itself a nod to  ""Yellow Submarine"" ) features the band in white suits. The Beatles wore white suits while performing  Your Mother Should Know  during the film  ""Magical Mystery Tour"" .   The front cover of the  ""Live Forever""  single features a photograph of the childhood home of John Lennon.   The melody for the Liam track ""Guess God Thinks I'm Abel"", by his own admission, is a slowed down version of  I Wanna Be Your Man .   John Lennon was once asked to sum up the 60s in one phrase. His answer was  Be Here Now , the title of Oasis' 1997 album.   On 2008's Liam penned song,  I'm Outta Time , there features a audio-clip of Lennon defending his right to live in New York, when he says  ""As Churchill said, 'It's every Englishman's inalienable right to live where the hell he likes. What's it gonna do? Vanish? Is it not going to be there when I get back?'""     [ edit ]   Dream Theater   In the  title track  off of  Dream Theater 's 2005 album  Octavarium , there are two lines containing Beatles references.     ""Sailing on the seven seas/the Day Tripper diem's ready""     ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds/Dave's not here/I come to save the day""     [ edit ]   Jimi Hendrix   On  June 4 ,  1967 ,  the Jimi Hendrix Experience  played their last show in England, at London's Saville Theatre, [ 2 ]  before heading to  America . Two Beatles ( Paul McCartney  and  George Harrison ) were in attendance, along with a roll-call of  UK  rock stardom:  Brian Epstein ,  Eric Clapton ,  Spencer Davis ,  Jack Bruce , and pop singer  Lulu .   Hendrix opened the show with his own rendition of "" Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band "", which he had learned in the few days leading up to the show. Harrison and McCartney were extremely impressed by this, especially because it was played on the Sunday after the release of  Sgt. Pepper  the previous Friday. McCartney had publicly endorsed Hendrix for months, before Hendrix broke into the UK music scene. [ 3 ]  Hendrix also played Day Tripper which can be found on the live albums ""Radio One"" and ""BBC Sessions"".     [ edit ]   Joe Cocker   Joe Cocker 's first album was called  With a Little Help from My Friends  and contained a song with the  same name . He had completely revamped the  Lennon / McCartney  song by changing it to a  12/8   blues / rock  song. The Beatles heard it before its release, as the producer was uncertain as to how they would react to such a radical overhaul of one of their tracks. All the Beatles agreed that it was a great version. [ citation needed ]   Cocker's version was later used as the theme song for the TV show  The Wonder Years .   Cocker later sang and acted the song "" Come Together "" in the feature film "" Across the Universe "".     [ edit ]   David Bowie   David Bowie  covered "" Across the Universe "" on his 1975 album  Young Americans .  John Lennon  was partly involved in the making of the album. Bowie revamped the song into a soul version, eliminating the monotone vocals used in the  Beatles  version (and other covers of the song), as well as eliminating the ""jai guru deva om"" part of the chorus.     [ edit ]   Keith Moon   In 1976,  Keith Moon  of  The Who  covered the Beatles' "" When I'm Sixty-Four "" for the soundtrack of the documentary  All This and World War II , and sang backing vocals (with many others) on "" All You Need Is Love "". [ 4 ]  Moon also covered "" In My Life "" on his album  Two Sides of the Moon .   Moon once approached the Beatles' table at a London nightclub. ""Can I join you?"" he asked. ""Yeah, sure,"" said Starr, as he pulled up a seat for Moon. Moon then said, ""No, can I  join  you?"", implying that he wanted to join the band. Ringo replied with, ""No, we've already got a drummer.""  [ 5 ]  The last photo of Lennon and McCartney together was owned by Moon.   Moon's final night out was as a guest of McCartney at the preview of the film  The Buddy Holly Story . After dinner with Paul and  Linda McCartney , Moon and his girlfriendAnnette Walter-Laxleft the party early and they returned to his flat in Curzon Place,  London . He later died in his sleep.     [ edit ]   Peter Sellers   Peter Sellers  recited the lyrics of "" A Hard Day's Night "" [ 6 ]  (1965 - UK # 14) in a ""Shakespearian"" voice, (in the style of  Laurence Olivier  playing  Richard III ) with minimal backing music.   He deliberately changed the tempo and dynamics of the original lyrics to make them comical. He left definite pauses between words, such as:     ""But when I get home to you... I find the things that you do... will make me feel (pause)  all right .""     This version was re-issued in 1993, and reached Number 52 in the UK Top 75 Singles chart. He covered several other Beatles hits, including "" Help! "" and "" She Loves You "".   Sellers had casual friendships with Harrison and Starr. Harrison told occasional Sellers stories in interviews, and Starr appeared with Sellers in the anarchic movie,  The Magic Christian  (1970), whose theme song was  Badfinger 's cover version of McCartney's "" Come and Get It "". Starr also gave Sellers a rough mix of songs from The Beatles'  White Album . The tape was auctioned, and  bootlegged , after his death.     [ edit ]   Other successful cover versions     Elton John  collaborated with John Lennon in 1974 and recorded "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", while Elton John appeared in Lennon's ""Whatever Gets You Thru The Night"".  (For more information, see  Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds#Elton John version .)   Earth, Wind & Fire  recorded "" Got to Get You into My Life "".   Stevie Wonder  covered "" We Can Work It Out "". [ citation needed ]  It appears on his 1970 album "" Signed, Sealed, and Delivered ""   Frank Sinatra  covered "" Yesterday "" and  George Harrison 's "" Something "" even though he once famously said (at a live concert) that it was his favourite Lennon and McCartney song. [ citation needed ]   Wet Wet Wet  had their first Number 1 hit with "" With a Little Help from My Friends "" in 1988.   Ray Charles  covered "" Eleanor Rigby "" and "" Yesterday "" and is known for his approval of The Beatles' music.   Rufus Wainwright  and  Fiona Apple  covered "" Across the Universe "" (the latter for the  Pleasantville Soundtrack ).   Franz Ferdinand  covered "" It Won't Be Long "" live.   A number of artists like  Oasis ,  Kaiser Chiefs ,  Travis  and  Bryan Adams  rerecorded the whole  Sgt. Peppers  album.   Elliott Smith  recorded a version of "" Because "", which was played over the end credits of the film  American Beauty .   Aimee Mann  and Michael Penn recorded a cover of  Two of Us  on the  I Am Sam soundtrack . Also, Aimee recorded a version of  Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds .   Also, singer-songwriter  Ben Folds  covered "" Golden Slumbers "" on the  I Am Sam  soundtrack.   Phish  covered the ""White Album"" in its entirety on  October 31 ,  1994  in Glens Falls, NY as part of their Halloween ""musical costume."" The show was later released as  Live Phish Volume 13 . Phish also covered ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps,"" and ""A Day In The Life"" regularly in their live performances.   Wilson Pickett  covered "" Hey Jude "", which was a #16 pop hit.   In 1995, the  Argentine  band  Los Fabulosos Cadillacs  did a reggae cover of the song "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" with  Blondie 's  Debbie Harry .   In 2008, Minnesota singer-songwriter  Jon Li  performed acoustic piano versions of "" Eight Days a Week "" and "" If I Fell "", among other Beatles favorites.       [ edit ]   Live Concerts   The Beatles were the first entertainment act to stage a large stadium concert. At  Shea Stadium ,  New York City  on Sunday,  August 15 ,  1965  the group opened their  1965 North American tour  to a record audience of 55,600. The event sold out in 17 minutes.  [ 7 ]  It was the first concert to be held at a major outdoor stadium and set records for attendance and revenue generation, demonstrating that outdoor concerts on a large scale could be successful and profitable. The Beatles returned to Shea for a very successful encore in August 1966.     [ edit ]   Fashion          A Young Boy with a mop top haircut.         [ edit ]   The mop-top haircut   The Beatle haircut, also known as the  mop-top  (or  moptop ) because of its resemblance to a  mop or  Arthur  amongst fans, is a mid-length  hairstyle  named after and popularised by the Beatles. It is a straight cut - collar-length at the back and over the ears at the sides, with a straight fringe (bangs).   As a schoolboy in the mid '50s,  Jrgen Vollmer  had left his hair hanging down over his forehead one day after he had gone swimming, not bothering to style it.  John Lennon  is quoted in The  Beatles Anthology  as follows:  Jrgen had a flattened-down hairstyle with a fringe in the back, which we rather took to.  In late 1961 Vollmer moved to  Paris . McCartney said in a 1979 radio interview: ""We saw a guy in Hamburg whose hair we liked. John and I were hitchhiking to Paris. We asked him to cut our hair like he cut his."" McCartney also wrote in a letter to Vollmer in 1989:  George explained in a 60s interview that it was John and I having our hair cut in Paris which prompted him to do the same. We were the first to take the plunge. [ 8 ]   Because of the immense popularity of the Beatles, the haircut was widely imitated worldwide between 1964 and 1966. Their hair-style led  toy  manufacturers to begin producing real-hair and plastic, ""Beatle Wigs"". [ 9 ]  Lowell Toy Manufacturing Corp. of New York was licensed to make ""the only AUTHENTIC Beatle Wig"". There have been many attempts at counterfeiting, but in its original packaging this wig has become highly collectible.   At a press conference at the Plaza Hotel in New York, shortly after the Beatles' arrival in the United States, Harrison was asked by a reporter, ""What do you call your hairstyle?"" He replied ""Arthur"". The scene was recreated in the movie  A Hard Day's Night  with the reporter asking Harrison, ""What would you call that, uh, hairstyle you're wearing?""   Mikhail Safonov wrote in 2003 that in the  Brezhnev -dominated  Soviet Union , mimicking the Beatles hairstyle was seen as extremely rebellious. Young people were called ""hairies"" by their elders, and were arrested and forced to have their hair cut in police stations. [ 10 ]   In 1967, most memorably on the cover of  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , all four of the Beatles sported moustaches. This look signaled a new, more mature image for the ""mop tops."" By the late 1960s, the Beatles generally had much longer hair than they had during the Beatlemania era, and often wore full  beards .     [ edit ]   Suits   In the early Beatle-mania years, the Beatles would occasionally wear black, and then later grey,  Edwardian  collarless suits. [ 8 ] [ 11 ]  This style of suit was adopted from the  Mod youth cult , then at its peak in the UK. [ 12 ]  These suits (instead of leather trousers,  plaid  shirts, and  slacks ) became extremely common for new bands to wear after 1964.   Later, during the psychedelic era of 19671968, the Beatles popularised bright colours, and wore paisley suits and shirts and trousers with floral patterns. The Beatles also popularised Indian-influenced fashions such as collarless shirts and sandals.   By the late 1960s, the Beatles had adopted trends toward more casual fashions, with  t-shirts ,  blue jeans , and  denim   jackets . Lennon also popularised wearing solid white suits, reflecting an interest in minimalist design that also influenced the cover of the  White Album . This mixture of casual wear and unconventional formal clothing could be seen in The Beatles' later years as they grew beards and drifted towards more hippie and Indian clothing.     [ edit ]   Footwear   Beatle boots  are tight-fitting,  cuban-heeled , ankle-length boots with a pointed toe which originated in 1963 when  Brian Epstein  discovered Chelsea boots while browsing in the London footwear company Anello & Davide, and consequently commissioned four pairs (with the addition of Cuban heels) for  The Beatles  to complement their new suit image upon their  return from Hamburg , who wore them under  drainpipe trousers . [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Other fashions   The style of  hat  worn by Lennon and his wife Cynthia on the Beatles' tour of the U.S. in 1964 was adopted widely by both men and women. In 1966, during the filming of  How I Won the War , Lennon adopted round, thin-rimmed ""teashade glasses,"" which became a signature element of Lennon's look. This style of eyewear is still popularly known as ""John Lennon glasses.""     [ edit ]   TV     [ edit ]   Absolutely Fabulous   The hit  UK  TV show  Absolutely Fabulous , better known as ""Ab-Fab"", filmed a whole episode based on finding the "" Lost Tapes "" of the Beatles.  Robert Lindsay  played a fictional tape engineer who used to work at  Abbey Road Studios  during the time that the Beatles worked there.   A long scene was filmed in the Abbey Road Studios:  Joanna Lumley  pressed the record button by mistake on the reel-to-reel recorder while she was looking for a second bottle of champagne in the control room. In the meantime,  Jennifer Saunders  unknowingly sang over the tapes, and they were lost forever. When Robert Lindsay played the tapes at the party and realised that they were lost forever, he promptly collapsed on the floor.     [ edit ]   The Simpsons   In the  The Simpsons  Season 5 opening episode, ""Homer's Barbershop Quartet"", Homer, Skinner, Apu, and Barney form a group called the Be-sharps, which rapidly rises to the top. There are numerous references to the Beatles, such as Barney dating a Japanese conceptual artist (a parody of Yoko Ono) playing a song that repeats ""number 8"", a "" Revolution 9 "" parody, and the Be-Sharps claiming they were ""bigger than Jesus"". It ends with them singing on the rooftop of Moe's bar. The episode even includes a cameo by  George Harrison , who meets Homer (but Homer cares more about his brownie than the legend), and later appears in a limousine while the Be-Sharps sing on the rooftop, remarking that ""It's been done."" Homer later states to the crowd, ""I hope we've finally passed the audition"", but Barney is the one who doesn't understand what he means.   In the Season 7 episode, ""Lisa the Vegetarian"",  Paul McCartney  and then wife  Linda McCartney  appear at the roof of the Kwik-E-Mart to give Lisa guidance of being a vegetarian. In the end they ask her if she like to hear a song, Lisa is thrilled and agrees. But in a twist they go to Apu to sing a song (on a  tabla  - an offkey version of  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band ) - while they snap to his beat.   In the Season 8 episode ""Bart After Dark"", the couch gag is a parody of the cover of the Beatles' album  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , featuring a large crowd of regular characters, and the family standing in front of the couch, front and centre; Homer turns to look at the crowded scene behind him.   In the Season 14 episode ""Bart of War"", Bart and Milhouse break into Flanders' house when chasing after their fly-on-a-string and stumbling into Ned's private collection of Beatles memorabilia, which included a  DIY  book titled  Learn  Carpentry  with the Beatles  (with  John Lennon  on the cover saying, 'I'm  fixing a hole  ... in my  drywall !'); a  Yellow Submarine  standing cardboard cut-out; a Mop-Top- Pop  featuring the flavours 'John  Lemon ,' ' Orange  Harrison,' 'Paul Mc Iced Tea ' and ' Mango  Starr'.   Bart later takes a drink of a 'John Lemon' flavored can of Mop-Top-Pop and sees a psychedelic transformation of Milhouse through John Lennon's career; from the early years of a suit and mop-top to the "" Sergeant Pepper ""-era uniform to a more rebellious hippie-look with grannie-glasses to the controversial  Rolling Stone  magazine cover with a nude  John Lennon  next to  Yoko Ono . Afterwards, Bart quotes 'Yellow matter custard, dripping from a dead dog's eye' from The Beatles' song "" I Am The Walrus "".   After Bart and Milhouse destroy the Beatles room, the police catch them. Chief Wiggum claims they're taking the "" Last Train to Clarksville "". Lou points out that that was a  Monkees ' song. Ned and Homer have a conversation, during which Homer mentions he never knew that devout Christian Ned was such a Beatles fan. Ned answers ""Of course I am! They were bigger than Jesus. But your boy went  Yoko  and broke up my collection."" This is a reference to the infamous ""We're bigger than Jesus"" quote of  John Lennon  and the common belief that the breakup of the Beatles was due to John Lennon's relationship with  Yoko Ono .   The series has also referenced post-Beatle bands including  Plastic Ono Band  and the  Traveling Wilburys . Homer says that Yoko Ono ruined Plastic Ono during one of the episodes. In season 14 episode 8, he asks Lisa who her favourite Traveling Wilbury was  [ 14 ]  before guessing  Lynne .   The three Beatles who were alive in 1990 recorded their voices for  The Simpsons . Ringo appeared on  Brush with Greatness , Paul and Linda McCartney on  Lisa the Vegetarian , and George on the  Homer's Barbershop Quartet  episode. The John Lennon song  ""Mother""  appeared in one episode ( My Mother the Carjacker ), so all the Beatles have made a  vocal appearance on the Simpsons  (Lennon also was seen during the  bed-in for peace  in an episode where Homer ruins the rock & roll wax museum.)   In  Treehouse of Horror  18, Homer kills celebrites so they can be used for advertisement. John Lennon is briefly seen, along with a number of dead celebrities, coming down from heaven to earth to kill Homer. Lennon is seen riding a  Yellow Submarine  and saying ""All we are saying is let's eat some brains"", which is a reference to  Give Peace a Chance .     [ edit ]   Other television appearances     In  Nickelodeon  in a behind the scenes fact of  SpongeBob SquarePants  Plankton has a Album hit called Krabby Road (referring to  Abbey Road  by  The Beatles ), which shows him walking on  Abbey Road . Also, in the episode  Chimps Ahoy , the three monkeys arrive in the Beatles' Yellow Submarine.   In a movie version of Nickelodeon's  Naked Brothers Band  one of the band members says that they are ""Bigger than Santa Claus,"" an obvious reference to John Lennon's infamous quote.   ""The Hatrocks and The Gruesomes"", the  January 22 ,  1965  episode of  The Flintstones , features a band with The Beatles' trademark mop-top hair that plays ""bug music"", a parody of the ""yeah, yeah, yeah"" refrain from "" She Loves You "". [ 15 ]   An episode of  Gilligan's Island  entitled ""Don't Bug the Mosquitoes"" that aired December 9, 1965 featured a mop-topped quartet called The Mosquitoes, with the names Bingo, Bango, Bongo... and Irving.   The early 90s series  Superhuman Samurai Syber Squad  featured an episode entitled ""Amp Loves You! Yea, Yea, Yea.""   Pinky and Perky , a children's puppet programme from the late 1957 until 1971 featured occasional appearances from ""The Beakles"", a crow based version of The Beatles.   The Beatles (TV series) , a late 1960s American animated television series featuring the musical misadventures of The Beatles.   The Rutles , a mid-1970s series of sketches on the  BBC  television series  Rutland Weekend Television , which would lead to the 1978 mockumentary film  All You Need Is Cash   The 1997 episode of  Mister Show , "" Please Don't Kill Me "", features a mockumentary style skit entitled  The Fad Three , in which a Beatlesque trio is shown appearing on stage at various ""gigs"" in front of screaming (and fainting) fans. The three are shown playing no instruments at all, but are instead shown simply standing in place for a few moments before the curtain closes; poking fun at the extent of the Beatles' popularity and the numerous times they had been drowned out by the cheering of their own fans.   Sesame Street  featured a parody band called ""the Beetles"", a group of four bugs with Liverpool accents and Beatle hair performing parodies of their songs, such as  Letter B  and  Hey Food .   In  The Angry Beavers  episode ""Beaver Fever"", Norbert and Daggett become music stars. This episode includes many references to The Beatles.   In  The Powerpuff Girls  episode "" Meet the Beat-Alls "", Mojo Jojo, ""Him"", Princess Morbucks, and Fuzzy Lumpkins form a group of supervillains named ""The Beat-Alls"". There are many additional references to the Beatles, their history, songs, and albums through the episode.  [2]   In  School House Rock , they mentioned the Beatles in the song ""A Noun is a Person, Place or Thing"".   The Beatles were mentioned in an episode of ""Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3"" episode ' Kootie Pie Rocks ', where Kootie Pie threatened to turn her favourite band  Milli Vanilli  into beetles (she meant the Buzzy Beetles from the game). Rob and Fab comment ""Who wants to be a band from the '60s?"".   In the  Nickelodeon  cartoon  Doug ,  The Beets  are a popular band and an evident parody of The Beatles in a number of ways: its name, the accents of the band members, the ""Beet Mania"" that encompasses Bluffington and its last album, ""Let it Beet"" (a play on  Let It Be ).   The cast of British soap,  EastEnders  sang a number of songs of the set of the programme for  Children in Need 2007 . They sung  Beatles  songs including,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart Club Band ,  Fixing a Hole  and  With a Little Help from My Friends . The performance also marked the 40th anniversary of the release of  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart Club Band .   In the  Pinky and the Brain  episode ""All you Need is Narf"" Pinky disguises himself as an Indian guru to obtain a special herb.The episode is centered around spoofing the beatles' meeting with  Maharishi .   Many people say that  Thomas The Tank Engine & Friends  is a Beatles reference because of Ringo Starr being the narrator of the show and because of the engines being happy a lot like when The Beatles had fun during the band's years.   Nick Jr's  The Wonderpets  preimiered an episode calles ""Save The Beetles"" in which the wonderpets save four beetles with  mop top  hair cuts stuck in a yellow submarine       [ edit ]   Film             Lists of miscellaneous information  should be avoided.  Please  relocate  any relevant information into appropriate sections or articles.  (September 2008)         The rock musical,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released in 1978, featured Beatles covers by  the Bee Gees ,  Peter Frampton ,  Aerosmith ,  Earth, Wind & Fire  and many other musical and non-musical celebrities. It went on to be a critical and commercial disaster.   The 2007 film  Across the Universe  is a musical that takes place during the 60s. 33 Beatles compositions were used in the film along with names of characters referenced in their music.   The 1996 film  That Thing You Do!  tells the story of a fictional one-hit wonder rock band and makes many (indirect)  references  to The Beatles' career.   The 1978 television film  All You Need Is Cash  (based on a single sketch from a mid-1970s sketch series called  Rutland Weekend Television ) traces the career of a British rock group called  The Rutles  in  mockumentary  style.   The film  This Is Spinal Tap  also pokes mild fun at the Beatles. In a flashback to the band's early days as a skiffle group (which the Beatles actually had roots in), they sing a song in the same style as older songs. They are also dressed similarly, with a grey, collarless suit and white collared shirts.   In the  Walt Disney  film  The Jungle Book , the four  vultures  that  Mowgli  befriends look very much like the Beatles. They were supposed to be the voices of the vultures (whose names are Flaps, Dizzy, Buzzie, and Ziggy), but could not for some reason. They do speak  scouse  though, and they can sing.   The Vultures' song ""That's What Friends Are For"" was originally written with Beatles-style beat, but  Disney  insisted it was changed, so as not to date it to the Sixties. It was rewritten as a barbershop quartet, to make it timeless. (Out-takes of the Beatles-style version are available on the 2007 40th anniversary ""platinum edition"" 2-disc  Disney DVD , which incidentally is the last animated feature  Disney  himself was personally involved in producing.)   The 1964  James Bond  film  Goldfinger  features  Sean Connery  as Bond saying the line ""That's as bad as listening to  The Beatles  without earmuffs!"" in response to the suggestion by Jill Masterson that they needn't bother chilling their wine bottle to the correct temperature. This line caused much laughter since, at the time, The Beatles and James Bond were the two most popular British exports in the world.   In the 2007 comedy film  Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story , fictional Dewey Cox meets the Beatles who are purposefully portrayed satirically by  Jack Black  as Paul McCartney,  Paul Rudd  as John Lennon,  Jason Schwartzman  as Ringo Starr, and  Justin Long  as George Harrison.   In  Winning London , a film starring  Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen , the twins and their love interests can be seen walking down Abbey Road in one of the earlier scenes.   In the film  Top Secret!  a horse trots off singing A Hard Days Night.   A new movie by  Nick Jr.  called 'The Wonderpets save the Beetles' focuses around  The Wonderpets  saving four beetles with Liverpool accents who are stuck in a yellow submarine that's leaking. It is implied 'The Beetles' have a very large fanbase. At the end of the movie, the band sings a song called 'Kelp', an obvious reference to the Beatles song  Help! .   In the 2007 movie  Superbad , the character Seth ( Jonah Hill ) says to Evan ( Michael Cera ) that looking into offscreen character Matt Muir's eyes was ""like the first time he heard the Beatles"".       [ edit ]   Video games     In  EarthBound , there are various references to the Beatles throughout the game.  Shigesato Itoi , the game's creator, has stated that he was a huge fan of the Beatles, and APE, the company that created the game, cited John Lennon as an inspiration for the game's music. Here are some examples:    A man in Onett gives you a pop quiz: fill in the blank of a Beatles song, ""XXXterday"". He gives you a yes-or-no answer choice. If you respond ""yes,"" he'll say ""That's correct! I'm impressed.""   Various people in Moonside will say ""Hello! And... goodbye!"", a reference to the song  Hello, Goodbye .   In the Japanese version,  John  (for Ness),  Paul  (for Jeff),  George  (for Poo), and  Ringo  (for King the dog) are included as ""suggested names"" (included by the developers if you don't want to create names yourself). Yoko (as in  Yoko Ono , the widow of John Lennon) is also a ""suggested name"" for Paula. Additionally, "" honey pie "" is a suggestion for your favourite food, and ""love"" is a suggestion for your favourite thing.   A yellow submarine can be seen inside Dungeon Man.   One of the Runaway Five members can be heard singing  Money (That's What I Want)  to himself.   Bits of Beatles melodies are scattered in the game's music. For instance, part of the opening to  All You Need is Love  can be heard in the Cave of the Past, and part of Tessie's song references  Strawberry Fields Forever .   In  Mother , you come across a man who says ""I am a forgotten man"", and ""You didn't have to notice me"", a possible reference to  nowhere man       In  Worms & Reinforcements United , one team of worms is known as ""The Fab Four"", and its worms named ""John"", ""Paul"", ""George"" and ""Ringo"".   In  Guitar Hero 3 , Xavier Stone's 'Captain X' costume is available in four styles, three of which are named after members of The Beatles: John, Paul, and George, respectively. The costume is also similar to the uniforms on the cover of the  Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band  Album.   The  Star Fox  1992 comic makes a reference to General Pepper by Fox making a  pun  by saying ""General Pepper? Hmm I Thought he was only a Sargent""   On the internet website  Neopets , there is an item on the site called the, ""Strawberry Fields Forever Paint Brush"" Which is named after the song  Strawberry Fields Forever  written by John Lennon.   Issue #2 of the Official UK Nintendo Magazine spoofs the album, "" Abbey Road "" which is a cover of  Animal Crossing Wild World .       [ edit ]   Beatlesque   Beatlesque  (pronounced  /bitlsk/ ) is a term used to describe  rock  and  pop   bands  and  musicians  who were influenced by  The Beatles  and make music that is very similar. New bands are promoted as being ""The next Beatles"" or ""The new Fab Four"", and members of the media refer to musical acts as being ""Beatlesque"". This practice has itself been parodied; for example, the band  Type O Negative  often refer to themselves as ""The Drab Four"".   Badfinger   Badfinger  was a Welsh rock/pop band that formed in the late 1960s. They became closely associated with The Beatles due to their close work relationship with Beatles members and producers. The Beatles' producer  George Martin  was also their producer, and the band released their records on the Beatles'  Apple Records  label. Their interpretation of the song  ""Come and Get It""  was based on  Paul McCartney 's demo version. Their song  ""No Matter What""  is Lennon-inspired. [ citation needed ]   George Harrison  also worked with Badfinger, not only producing much of their music but also contributing the slide guitar solo on the song ""Day After Day"". [ citation needed ]  The band was even named after ""Badfinger Boogie"", the working title for the Beatles' "" With a Little Help From My Friends "". [ citation needed ]   Electric Light Orchestra   The  Electric Light Orchestra , also known as ELO, was a successful  British  rock music group of the 1970s and 1980s. ELO grew out of a former band known as The Move, and when the remaining members decided to regroup as ELO, they announced their intention to ""continue where 'I Am the Walrus' left off."" They recorded a tribute song called ""Beatles Forever"", but it is still unavailable, as band member and Beatles fan  Jeff Lynne  was reportedly embarrassed by it. [ citation needed ]  ""Can't Get It Out Of My Head"" (on The Mike Douglas Show) with a quartet and horn section is very Lennon-like and included the line, ""I saw the ocean's daughter"", a play on the name of  Yoko Ono , whose name means ""Ocean child"".   Frontman  Jeff Lynne  later produced George Harrison's  Cloud Nine  album, worked with him on the  Traveling Wilburys  albums, and completed Harrison's final work  Brainwashed . Lynne also produced the new songs for the Beatles'  Anthology .   Julian Lennon   Julian Lennon  is the son of John Lennon. The songs ""Valotte"", ""Saltwater"", and ""Too Late for Goodbyes"" are all Beatlesque. The music video for the song ""I Don't Wanna Know"" features Julian and his band dressed up as the Beatles. Julian also covered ""When I'm 64"", which was originally sung by  Paul McCartney .   There was wild media speculation that a Beatles reunion might take place with Julian Lennon in his father's place, even though neither Lennon nor the remaining Beatles ever endorsed the idea, and the remaining Beatles denied that there had ever been any truth in the reports. ( Anthology .)   The Monkees   The Monkees  were a pop-rock quartet specifically created by U.S. television in 1965 in order to replicate the style and music of the Beatles at the height of  Beatlemania . At the peak of their success, the Monkees outsold the Beatles and the  Rolling Stones  combined, selling over 35 million records, and having four consecutive Number 1 albums in the year 1967 alone. The craze has become known as 'Monkeemania', as the remarkable teenage craze had not been seen since the peak of Beatlemania. Much controversy has been put down by the ""Pre-fab"" four as the public believed they did not play their own instruments; but aside from their first two LPs, this was not the case.  (See  The Monkees#From TV to stage )  ""Randy Scouse Git,"" a song written by Monkee Micky Dolenz about partying in London with the Beatles may be the first song reference to the Beatles in the line ""the four kings of EMI,"" EMI being the Beatles' label. The song title was censored in England and it was released as a single there as ""Alternate Title.""   Oasis   Oasis  have often cited the Beatles as a strong influence.   Oasis have covered numerous Beatles songs during their career. The first was a live performance of "" I Am The Walrus "", first released on the 1994 single "" Cigarettes & Alcohol "" and later released on the B-sides compilation  The Masterplan . Since then they have released studio covers of "" You've Got to Hide Your Love Away "" and "" Helter Skelter "".  Noel Gallagher  himself performed "" Help! "" on some of his 1998 acoustic sets. [ citation needed ]   Noel has also been involved in a number of collaborations of Beatles songs, beginning in September 1995 with "" Come Together "". The song was recorded with  Paul McCartney  and  Paul Weller  under the guise of the Smokin' Mojo Filters and was recorded at  Abbey Road  and released on the  HELP  album. In May 1996, Noel and his brother  Liam  were guests on a live cover of "" Day Tripper "" at an  Ocean Colour Scene "" gig. In 1999, he provided acoustic guitar for  Claire Martin 's cover of ""Help!"". In September 2000, he sang and played guitar on performances of "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" (with  Johnny Marr  and  Cornershop ) and "" All You Need Is Love "" (as part of a group finale) as well as backing vocals and acoustic guitar on a cover of "" I'm Only Sleeping "" with the  Stereophonics . These three performances were part of a  John Lennon  tribute show, performed at  George Martin 's AIR Studios, and broadcast on  Channel 4  in September 2000. In August 2002, he was recorded singing parts of "" Eleanor Rigby "" and "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" during a soundcheck for a live performance on  Late Night with Conan O'Brien  show. Noel also performed ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" on November 2006, with Gem Archer and Terry Kirkbride, for a charity gig at Koko in Camden, London and continued to perform it for the remainder of the  Stop the Clocks  semi-acoustic tour.   Oasis have also occasionally slipped in small parts of Beatles songs in live performances. They have regularly ended live performances of "" Whatever "" by singing parts of "" Octopus's Garden "". Bits of "" Got To Get You Into My Life "" found their way into a couple of October 1995 performances of "" Round Are Way "". A riff based around the vocal melody of ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" was integrated into an extended intro for live performances of ""Cigarettes & Alcohol"" in 2000 and 2001.   Their current semi-official drummer  Zak Starkey  is the son of  Ringo Starr . Starkey joined in early 2004 after Oasis longtime drummer  Alan White  left the band. He performed on their latest album  Don't Believe the Truth  ( 2005 ) and subsequent 20052006 world tour, but he wasn't signed as a new bandmember and didn't participate in interviews and photoshots, due to his commitments as drummer for  The Who .   Noel Gallagher sat on a panel in 2004 to decide on the most influential of pop artists to be included in the  UK Music Hall of Fame , and was quoted as saying ""They [the Beatles] inspire me more now than they did when I was a kid and are still the greatest."" [ 16 ]   The end of the song ""She's Electric"" ( What's the Story Morning Glory ) has the same progression as the end of "" With a Little Help From My Friends "" ( Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band ).   Other artists having a Beatlesque musical style     The Apples in Stereo   Klaatu   Cheap Trick   The Chords   Crowded House   Downhere   Locksley   Simian   The Smithereens   Tears for Fears   The Knickerbockers   Emitt Rhodes   Les Fradkin  on his two  George Harrison  tribute CD's: ""Something for George"" and ""Love You 2""   Ween   Warren Zanes   The Bangles   Elliott Smith   Splitsville , particularly on their Beatles/Beach Boys tribute, ""The Complete Pet Soul""   Tally Hall   Czerwone Gitary   The Aerovons [ 17 ]   Panic At The Disco , specifically their sophomore album ""Pretty.

These pressings were also numbered.               The Beatles  is the ninth official U.K.  album  and the fifteenth U.S. album by  The Beatles , a  double album   released in 1968 . It is more commonly known as  The White Album  as it has no text other than the band's name (and, on the early LP and CD releases, a serial number) on its plain white sleeve. The album was the first The Beatles undertook following the death of their manager  Brian Epstein . Originally entitled  A Doll's House , the title was changed when the British progressive band  Family  released the similarly titled  Music in a Doll's House  earlier that year.   In 1997,  The Beatles  was named the 10th greatest album of all time in a 'Music of the Millennium' poll conducted by  HMV ,  Channel 4 ,  The Guardian  and  Classic FM . In 1998,  Q  magazine  readers placed it at number 17, while in 2000 the same magazine placed it at number 7 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. [ 2 ]  In 2001, the TV network  VH1  named it as the 11th greatest album ever. [ 3 ]  In 2006, the album was chosen by  Time Magazine  as one of the 100 best albums of all time. [ 4 ]  It was ranked number 10 in  Rolling Stone ' s list of the  500 greatest albums of all time  in 2003. [ 5 ]   According to the  Recording Industry Association of America ,  The Beatles  is The Beatles' best-selling album at 19-times  platinum  and the tenth- best-selling album of all time  in the  United States .

There, they had undertaken a  transcendental meditation  course with  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . Although the retreat, which had required long periods of meditation, was initially conceived by the band as a spiritual respite from all worldly endeavours  a chance, in Lennon's words, to ""get away from everything"" [ 6 ]   both Lennon and McCartney had quickly found themselves in songwriting mode, often meeting ""clandestinely in the afternoons in each other's rooms"" [ 7 ]  to review the new work. ""Regardless of what I was supposed to be doing,"" Lennon would later recall, ""I did write some of my best songs there."" [ 8 ]  Close to forty new compositions had emerged in Rishikesh, a little more than half of which would be laid down in very rough form at  Kinfauns , George Harrisons home in Esher.   The Beatles left Rishikesh before the end of the course, with Ringo Starr and then Paul McCartney departing first, and Lennon and George Harrison departing together later. According to some reports, Lennon left Rishikesh because he felt personally betrayed by rumours that Maharishi had made sexual advances toward  Mia Farrow , who had accompanied The Beatles on their trip. Shortly after he decided to leave, Lennon wrote a song called ""Maharishi"" which included the lyrics, ""Maharishi/You little twat""; the song became "" Sexy Sadie "". According to several authors,  Alexis Mardas  (aka ""Magic Alex"") deliberately engineered these rumours because he was bent on undermining the Maharishi's influence over each Beatle. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]  Lennon himself, in a 1980 interview, acknowledged that the Maharishi was the inspiration for the song. ""I just called him 'Sexy Sadie'."" [ 12 ]  In May 1968,  John Lennon ,  Paul McCartney , and  George Harrison  assembled at Kinfauns, and demoed 23 songs that they composed at Rishikesh.     [ edit ]   Recording sessions          Abbey Road Studios in 2006.       The Beatles  was recorded between 30 May 1968 and 14 October 1968, largely at  Abbey Road Studios , with some sessions at  Trident Studios . Although productive, the sessions were reportedly undisciplined and sometimes fractious, and they took place at a time when tensions were growing within the group. Concurrent with the recording of this album, The Beatles were launching their new multimedia business corporation  Apple Corps , an enterprise that proved to be a source of significant stress for the band.   The sessions for  The Beatles  marked the first appearance in the studio of Lennon's new girlfriend and artistic partner  Yoko Ono , who would thereafter be a more or less constant presence at all Beatles' sessions. Prior to Ono's appearance on the scene, the individual Beatles had been very insular during recording sessions, with influence from outsiders strictly limited. McCartney's girlfriend at the time,  Francie Schwartz , was also present at some of the recording sessions.   Author  Mark Lewisohn  reports that The Beatles held their first and only 24-hour recording/producing session near the end of the creation of  The Beatles , during which occurred the final mixing and sequencing for the album. The session was attended by Lennon, McCartney, and producer  George Martin . [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Division and discord in the studio   Despite the album's official title, which emphasized group identity, studio efforts on  The Beatles  captured the work of four increasingly individualized artists who frequently found themselves at odds. The band's work pattern changed dramatically with this project, and by most accounts the extraordinary synergy of The Beatles' previous studio sessions was harder to come by during this period. Sometimes McCartney would record in one studio for prolonged periods of time, while Lennon would record in another, each man using different engineers. [ 13 ]  At one point in the sessions, George Martin, whose authority over the band in the studio had waned, spontaneously left to go on holiday, leaving  Chris Thomas  in charge of producing. [ 14 ]  During one of these sessions, while recording "" Helter Skelter "", Harrison reportedly ran around the studio while holding a flaming ashtray above his head. [ 13 ]   Long after the recording of  The Beatles  was complete, Sir George Martin mentioned in interviews that his working relationship with The Beatles changed during this period, and that many of the band's efforts seemed unfocused, often yielding prolonged jam sessions that sounded uninspired. [ 15 ]  On 16 July recording engineer  Geoff Emerick , who had worked with the group since  Revolver , announced he was no longer willing to work with the group out of disgust with the deteriorating work environment. [ citation needed ]   The sudden departures were not limited to EMI personnel. On 22 August, drummer  Ringo Starr  abruptly left the studio, explaining later that he felt his role was minimized compared to that of the other members, and that he was tired of waiting through the long and contentious recording sessions. [ 15 ]  Lennon, McCartney and Harrison pleaded with Starr to return, and after two weeks he did. According to Mark Lewisohn's book  The Complete Beatles Chronicle , Paul McCartney played drums on ""Back in the U.S.S.R."" However, according to Lewisohn, in the case of ""Dear Prudence"" the three remaining Beatles each took a shot at bass and drums, with the result that those parts may be composite tracks played by Lennon, McCartney and/or Harrison. As of 2008, the actual musician/instrument lineup is still undetermined. Upon Starr's return, he found his drum kit decorated with red, white and blue flowers, a welcome-back gesture from Harrison. [ 15 ]  The reconciliation was, however, only temporary, and Starr's exit served as a precursor of future ""months and years of misery,"" in Starr's words. [ 15 ]  Indeed, after  The Beatles  was completed, both Harrison and Lennon would stage similar unpublicized departures from the band. [ 15 ]  McCartney, whose public departure in 1970 would mark the formal end of the band's ensemble, described the sessions for  The Beatles  as a turning point for the group. Up to this point, he observed, ""the world was a problem, but we weren't. You know, that was the best thing about The Beatles, until we started to break up, like during the  White Album  and stuff. Even the studio got a bit tense then."" [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Other musicians   Eric Clapton , at Harrison's invitation, provided lead guitar for Harrison's "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "". Harrison soon reciprocated by collaborating on the song "" Badge "" for  Cream's  last album  Goodbye . George explains in  The Beatles Anthology  that Clapton's presence temporarily alleviated the studio tension and that all band members were on their best behaviour during his time with the band in the studio.   Clapton was not the only outside musician to sit in on the sessions.  Nicky Hopkins  provided electric piano for the single cut of "" Revolution "" (recorded during these sessions) as well as acoustic piano for a few others; several horns were also recorded on the album version of ""Revolution"". "" Savoy Truffle "" also features the horn section, and a group of clarinets is heard on "" I'm So Tired "".  Jack Fallon , a bluegrass fiddler was recruited for "" Don't Pass Me By "", and a team of orchestral players and soothing background singers ended up being important contributors to ""Good Night"". Despite these contributions, and the presence and influence of  Yoko Ono , no external contributors to  The Beatles  are listed in the album notes.     [ edit ]   Technical advances   The sessions for  The Beatles  were notable for the band's formal transition from 4-track to  8-track  recording. As work on this album began, Abbey Road Studios possessed, but had yet to install, an 8-track machine that had supposedly been sitting in a storage room for months. This was in accordance with EMI's policy of testing and customizing new gear, sometimes for months, before putting it into use in the studios. The Beatles recorded ""Hey Jude"" and ""Dear Prudence"" at Trident Studios in central London, which had an 8-track recorder. [ 13 ]  When they found out about EMI's 8-track recorder they insisted on using it, and engineers Ken Scott and Dave Harries took the machine (without authorization from the studio chiefs) into the Number 2 recording studio for the group to use. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Songs   Although most of the songs on any given Beatles album are usually credited to the Lennon/McCartney songwriting team, that description is often misleading, and rarely more so than on  The Beatles . With this album, each of the four band members began to showcase the range and depth of his individual songwriting talents, and to display styles that would be carried over to his eventual solo career. Indeed, some songs that the individual Beatles were working on during this period eventually were released on solo albums ( John Lennon 's ""Look At Me"" and "" Child of Nature ,"" eventually reworked as ""Jealous Guy"";  Paul McCartney 's "" Junk "" and "" Teddy Boy ""; and  George Harrison 's "" Not Guilty "" and ""Circles"").   Many of the songs on the album display experimentation with unlikely musical genres, borrowing directly from such sources as 1930s dance-hall music (in ""Honey Pie""), classical chamber music (in ""Piggies""), the avant-garde sensibilities of  Yoko Ono  and  John Cage  (in "" Revolution 9 ""), and the overproduced sentimentality of  elevator music  (in ""Good Night""). Such diversity was quite unprecedented in global pop music in 1968, and the album's sprawling approach provoked (and continues to provoke) both praise and criticism from observers. [ 16 ]  "" Revolution 9 "", in particular, a densely layered eight-minute-and-thirteen-second sound collage, has attracted bewilderment and disapproval from both fans and music critics over the years.   The only western instrument available to the group during their Indian visit was the  acoustic guitar , and thus most of the songs on  The Beatles  were written and first performed on that instrument. Some of these songs remained acoustic on  The Beatles  (notably ""Rocky Raccoon"", ""Julia"", ""Blackbird"" and "" Mother Nature's Son "") and were recorded in the studio either solo, or by only part of the group.     [ edit ]   Individual compositions   Lennon's contributions to the album are generally more hard-edged lyrically than his previous output, a trend which carried over to his solo career. Examples include his pleas for death on "" Yer Blues "", his parodic "" Glass Onion "", which mocks fans who read too much into The Beatles' lyrics (see also  Paul is dead ), and what may be references to drug addiction in "" Happiness Is a Warm Gun "" (""I need a fix...""). Lennon's intensely personal "" Julia "" may be seen as foreshadowing his later song ""Mother"" from his first solo album,  John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band ; the political "" Revolution 1 "" begins a pattern of overtly political songs like "" Give Peace a Chance "" and ""John Sinclair""; "" Revolution 9 "" reflects extensive contribution and influence from  Yoko Ono , another feature of much of Lennon's solo output. Lennon's songs on  The Beatles  embrace a wide array of styles, including blues (""Yer Blues""), acoustic ballads (""Julia"" and "" Cry Baby Cry ""), and rock ("" Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey ""). Lennon would later describe his contributions to the  The Beatles  as among his favourite songs recorded with The Beatles.   McCartney's songs for the album include pop ballads ("" I Will ""), the proto-heavy metal "" Helter Skelter "", a  Beach Boys  homage ("" Back in the U.S.S.R. ""), the up-beat "" Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da "", and a music-hall foxtrot ("" Honey Pie "") among others. The soothing, stripped-down ""I Will"" foreshadowed themes of McCartney's later solo career.   Harrison's sparse ballad "" Long, Long, Long "" is stylistically quite similar to much of his earlier solo output. His songs on  The Beatles  also includes the lyrically sophisticated "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "", a chronicle of gastronomic excess and dental trauma in "" Savoy Truffle "", and a class-driven piece of social commentary in "" Piggies "".   Even  Ringo Starr  was given leave to include the first song composed entirely by himself on a Beatles' album, the country number "" Don't Pass Me By "". Ringo was asked in an interview in 1964 if he was writing his own songs in which he replied ""Don't Pass Me By"" and in the background Paul can be heard kind of singing the song.   The album is the first by the group not to feature any genuine Lennon-McCartney collaborations - in fact there would only be one more co-write from the pair in the remainder of the band's career ("" I've Got a Feeling "" from the  Let It Be  album). This new lack of co-operation and focus is reflected in several fragmental, incomplete song ideas that were recorded and released on the album (""Why Don't We Do It in the Road?"", "" Wild Honey Pie "", and an officially untitled McCartney snippet at the end of ""Cry Baby Cry"" often referred to as ""Can You Take Me Back""). On previous albums, such undertakings might have been either abandoned or collaboratively developed before release, but here again,  The Beatles  represented a change of course for the band. The trend continued for the rest of the band's recording career: such song fragments were presented by joining them together as a long suite of songs on side two of  Abbey Road .     [ edit ]   Self-reflection and change             This section  may contain  original research  or  unverified claims . Please  improve the article  by adding  references . See the  talk page  for details.  (July 2008)       Many of the songs are personal and self-referencing; for example, "" Dear Prudence "" was written about actress  Mia Farrow 's sister, Prudence, who attended the transcendental meditation course with The Beatles in  Rishikesh . Often she stayed in her room, engaged in Transcendental Meditation. ""Julia"" was the name of Lennon's beloved but frequently absent mother, who died during his youth. ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" expresses concern over being ""bought and sold,"" a theme in later songs about Harrison himself, such as ""Handle with Care"", recorded with  The Traveling Wilburys . ""Glass Onion"" is a Beatles song about Beatles' songs.   Some of the songs on  The Beatles  mark important changes in the band's recording style. Previously, no female voices were to be heard on a Beatles album, but Yoko Ono made her first vocal appearance on this record, adding backing vocals in ""Birthday"" (along with  Pattie Harrison ); Yoko also sang backing vocals and a solo line on "" The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill "" and, as noted earlier, was a strong influence on Lennon's  musique concrte  piece, ""Revolution 9,"" an avant-garde sound collage that McCartney initially did not want to include on the album. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Compositions not included   A number of songs were recorded in demo form for possible inclusion but were not incorporated as part of the album. These included "" Mean Mr. Mustard "" and "" Polythene Pam "" (both of which would be used for the medley on  Abbey Road ); ""Child of Nature"" (recorded with drastically different lyrics as ""Jealous Guy"" for Lennon's  Imagine ), ""Jubilee"" (later retitled ""Junk"" and released on McCartney's first solo LP); ""Etcetera"" (a McCartney composition later recorded by the Black Dyke Mills Band as ""Thingumybob""); ""Circles"" (which Harrison would return to fourteen years later on his 1982 album ""Gone Troppo""); "" The Long and Winding Road "" (completed in 1969 for the  Let It Be  LP); "" Something "" (which ended up on  Abbey Road ); and "" Sour Milk Sea "" (which Harrison gave to friend and Apple artist  Jackie Lomax  for his first LP,  Is This What You Want ). Other songs recorded for, but ultimately left off  The Beatles  received significant exposure via bootlegs, notably Harrison's ""Circles"" and ""Not Guilty"" (which he would eventually re-record as solo tracks and release on his 1982 album,  Gone Troppo  and 1979 self-titled album,  George Harrison  respectively) and Lennon's manic "" What's the New Mary Jane "".     [ edit ]   Editing concerns, and release   The Beatles  was the first Beatles' album released by Apple Records, as well as their only original  double album . Producer George Martin has said that he was against the idea of a double album at the time and suggested to the group that they reduce the number of songs in order to form a single album featuring their stronger work, but that the band decided against this. [ 17 ]  Interviewed for the  Beatles Anthology , Starr said he now felt it should have been released as two separate albums. Harrison felt on reflection that some of the tracks could have been released as B sides, but ""there was a lot of ego in that band"". He also supported the idea of the double album, to clear out the backlog of songs the group had at the time. McCartney, by contrast, said it was fine as it was and that its wide variety of songs was a major part of the album's appeal. [ 18 ]   The Beatles  (1968) shares the same November 22 release date as The Beatles' second album,  With the Beatles  (1963).     [ edit ]   Singles   Although "" Hey Jude "" was not intended to be included on any LP release, it was recorded during the White Album sessions and was released as a stand-alone single before the release of  The Beatles . ""Hey Jude's"" B-side, ""Revolution"", was an alternate version of the album's ""Revolution 1"". Lennon had wanted the original version of ""Revolution"" to be released as a single, but the other three Beatles objected on the grounds that it was too slow. [ 15 ]  A new, faster version, with heavily distorted guitar and a high-energy keyboard solo from  Nicky Hopkins  was recorded, and was relegated to the flip side of ""Hey Jude"". The resulting release  ""Hey Jude"" on side A and ""Revolution"" on side B  emerged as the first release on the Beatles' new  Apple Records  label. It went on to become the best selling of all Beatles' singles in the US.   Four tracks from the ""White Album"" were released on two American and one British single almost eight years after the original album was released. In the summer 1976, to promote the compilation album,  Rock 'n' Roll Music , EMI's Parlophone label in the UK and its Capitol label in the US each released a single that contained A and B-sides that appeared on the compilation album. In Britain, Parlophone issued ""Back in the U.S.S.R."" as the single. (Its B-Side was ""Twist and Shout,"" which originally appeared on the group's first album,  Please Please Me .) In America, Capitol released ""Got to Get You Into My Life"" (from the group's 1966 album,  Revolver ) on the A-Side, but selected ""Helter Skelter,"" to serve as the flip side. ""Helter Skelter"" was likely chosen for the B-Side because a cover version of the song had been prominently featured in a made-for-tv movie about the Manson murders that had aired on  CBS  shortly before the release of  Rock 'n' Roll Music . The singles were successful, with ""Got to Get You into My Life"" hitting No. 7 on the  Billboard Hot 100  in the US and ""Back in the U.S.S.R."" hitting No. 18 on the New Musical Express chart in Britain. Both records also helped sell  Rock 'n' Roll Music , which hit No. 2 in the United States and No. 10 in the UK. With the success of the singles from the compilation album, Capitol followed-up ""Got To Get You Into My Life"" with the release of another single in November of 1976. Instead of taking two more tracks from  Rock 'n' Roll Music , however, Capitol selected two ""White Album"" tracks""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"" as the A-Side, and ""Julia"" as the B-Side. The ""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"" single was sold in an individually-numbered white picture sleeve that mimicked the design of the original album. ""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"" did not duplicate the success of its predecessor, however, as it failed to make the Top Forty, stalling out at No. 49 on  Billboard.     [ edit ]   Mono version   The Beatles  was the last Beatles album to be released with a unique, alternate  mono  mix, albeit one issued only in the UK. Twenty-nine of the album's thirty tracks (""Revolution 9"" being the only exception) exist in official alternate mono mixes.   Beatles' albums after  The Beatles  (except  Yellow Submarine  in the UK) occasionally had mono pressings in certain countries (such as Brazil), but these editions  of  Yellow Submarine ,  Let It Be , and  Abbey Road   were in each case mono fold-downs from the regular stereo mixes.   In the U.S., mono records were already being phased out; the U.S. release of  The Beatles  was the first Beatles LP to be issued in the U.S. in stereo only.     [ edit ]   Sleeve          A vintage circa-1970 pressing of  The Beatles.  Note the serial number and the embossed, rather than printed, album title.       The album's sleeve was designed by  Richard Hamilton , a notable pop artist who had organised a  Marcel Duchamp  retrospective at the  Tate Gallery  the previous year. Hamilton's design was in stark contrast to  Peter Blake's  vivid cover art for  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , and consisted of a plain white sleeve. The band's name was discreetly embossed slightly below the middle of the album's right side, and the cover also featured a unique stamped  serial number , ""to create,"" in Hamilton's words, ""the  ironic  situation of a numbered edition of something like five million copies."" [ citation needed ]  Indeed, the artist intended the cover to resemble the ""look"" of  conceptual art , an emerging movement in contemporary art at the time. Later  vinyl record  releases in the U.S. showed the title in grey printed (rather than embossed) letters. Early copies on  compact disc  were also numbered. Later CD releases rendered the album's title in black or grey. The 30th anniversary CD release was done to look like the original album sleeve, with an embossed title and serial number, including a small reproduction of the poster and pictures (see re-issues).   The album's inside packaging included a poster, the lyrics to the songs, and a set of photographs taken by  John Kelley  during the autumn of 1968 that have themselves become iconic. This is the only sleeve of a Beatles studio album not to show the members of the band on the front.   Tape versions of the album did not feature a white cover. Instead, cassette and 8-track versions (first issued on two cartridges in early 1969) contained cover artwork that featured a black and white (with no grey) version of the four Kelley photographs. [ citation needed ]  In both the cassette and 8-track versions of the album, the two tapes were sold in a black slip-cover box that bore the title, ""The BEATLES"" in gold lettering along the front. This departure from the LP's design not only made it difficult for less-informed fans to identify the tape in record stores, but it also led some fans at the time to jokingly refer to the 8-track or cassette not as the ""white album"" but as the ""black tape."" In 1988, Capitol/EMI re-issued the 2-cassette version of the album, still with the same cover artwork as the original cassettes - but without the black slip-cover box.     [ edit ]   Critical reception and legacy   The Beatles were at the peak of their global influence and visibility in late 1968.  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released the previous year, had enjoyed a combination of commercial success, critical acclaim, and immense cultural influence that had previously seemed inconceivable for a pop release.  Time  magazine, for instance, had written in 1967 that  Pepper  constituted a ""historic departure in the progress of musicany music,"" [ 19 ]  while  Timothy Leary , in a widely quoted assessment of the same period, declared that the band were prototypes of ""evolutionary agents sent by God, endowed with mysterious powers to create a new human species."" [ 20 ]  After creating an album that had delivered such critical, commercial, and generational shockwaves, The Beatles faced the inevitable question of what they could possibly do to top it. The next full-length album, whatever it was, was destined to draw considerable scrutiny. The intervening release of  Magical Mystery Tour  notwithstanding (released as a double-EP package in the UK),  The Beatles  represented the group's first major musical statement since  Pepper , and thus was a highly anticipated event for both the mainstream press and the youth-oriented counterculture movement with which the band had by this time become strongly associated. Expectations, to say the least, were high. The reviews were mixed.     Tony Palmer, in  The Observer , wrote shortly after the album's release: ""If there is still any doubt that Lennon and McCartney are the greatest songwriters since  Schubert , then . . . [the album  The Beatles ] . . . should surely see the last vestiges of cultural snobbery and bourgeois prejudice swept away in a deluge of joyful music making. . . ."" [ 21 ]       Richard Goldstein, writing in  The New York Times  on December 8, 1968, described the album as a ""major success."" [ 22 ]       Another review in  The New York Times , this one by  Nik Cohn , considered the album ""boring beyond belief"" and described ""more than half the songs"" as ""profound mediocrities."" [ 23 ]       Alan Smith, in an  NME  review entitled ""The Brilliant, the Bad, and the Ugly,"" derided ""Revolution #9"" as a ""pretentious"" example of ""idiot immaturity"" and, in the following sentence, assigned the benediction ""God Bless You, Beatles!"" to ""most of the rest"" of the album. [ 24 ]     Smith's review established a pattern that has endured for much of the critical assessment that followed. Many of the reviews since 1968and  The Beatles  surely ranks among the most-reviewed releases in rock historyhave tempered rapturous enthusiasm with a consistent note of criticism about the album's seemingly undisciplined structure and perceived excesses. Unlike such albums as  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  and  Revolver ,  The Beatles  is a release that, four decades on, tends to provoke heated discussions of such topics as continuity, style, and integrity.     The New Rolling Stone Album Guide  praises the album but maintains that it has ""loads of self-indulgent filler,"" identifying ""Revolution #9"" in particular as ""justly maligned,"" and suggests that listeners in the CD era, who can program digital players to skip over unwanted tracks, may have an advantage over the album's original audience. [ 25 ]     Some contemporary critics say the album's inclusion of supposedly extraneous material is a part of its appeal. The  allmusic.com  review contends that:     ""Each song on the sprawling double album  The Beatles  is an entity to itself, as the band touches on anything and everything they can. This makes for a frustratingly scattershot record or a singularly gripping musical experience, depending on your view, but what makes the White Album interesting is its mess."" [ 26 ]     One important current trend in critical assessments of the album is to draw parallels between the band's disintegrating ensemble and the chaotic events of the tumultuous year in which  The Beatles  was created, 1968. Along these lines,  Slant Magazine  observed that:     ""(The album) reveals the popping seams of a band that had the pressure of an entire fissuring generational/political gap on its back. Maybe it's because it shows The Beatles at the point where even their music couldn't hide the underlying tensions between John, Paul, George, and Ringo, or maybe because it was (coincidentally?) released at the tail end of a year anyone could agree was the embittered honeymoon's end for the Love Generation, the year when, to borrow from a famous Yeats poem, the center decidedly could not hold ... for whatever reason,  The Beatles  is still one of the few albums by the Fab Four that resists reflexive canonization, which, along with society's continued fragmentation, keeps the album fresh and surprising."" [ 27 ]     On the 40th anniversary of the album's release the Vatican issued an unusual review of the album. The official Vatican newspaper,  L'Osservatore Romano  published a lengthy article which declared that ""Forty years later, this album remains a type of magical musical anthology: 30 songs you can go through and listen to at will, certain of finding some pearls that even today remain unparalleled."" [ 28 ]  Forgiving John Lennon's ""more popular than Jesus"" slight, the paper called the White Album the ""creative summit"" of the Beatles' career, comparing it favorably to contemporary music and taking note of the now antiquated equipment used, concluding that ""a listening experience like that offered by the Beatles is truly rare.""     [ edit ]   Cultural responses   Ian MacDonald , in his book  Revolution in the Head , argues that  The Beatles  was the album in which the band's cryptic messages to its fan base became not merely vague but intentionally and perhaps dangerously open-ended, citing oblique passages in songs like ""Glass Onion"" (e.g., ""the walrus was Paul"") and ""Piggies"" (""what they need's a damn good whacking""). These pronouncements, and many others on the album, came to attract extraordinary popular interest at a time when more of the world's youth were  using drugs recreationally  and looking for spiritual, political, and strategic advice from The Beatles. Steve Turner, too, in his book  A Hard Day's Write , maintains that, with this album, ""The Beatles had perhaps laid themselves open to misinterpretation by mixing up the languages of poetry and nonsense."" [ 29 ]   Bob Dylan 's songs had been similarly mined for hidden meanings, but the massive countercultural analysis (or perhaps overanalysis) of  The Beatles  surpassed anything that had gone before. [ 30 ]   Even Lennon's seemingly direct engagement with the tumultuous political issues of 1968 in ""Revolution 1"" carried a nuanced obliqueness, and ended up sending messages the author may not have intended. In the album's version of the song, Lennon advises those who ""talk about destruction"" to ""count me out."" As McDonald notes, however, Lennon then follows the sung word ""out"" with the spoken word ""in."" At the time of the album's releasewhich followed, chronologically, the up-tempo single version of the song, ""Revolution,"" in which Lennon definitely wanted to be counted ""out""that single word ""in"" was taken by many on the radical left as Lennon's acknowledgment, after considered thought, that violence in the pursuit of political aims was indeed justified in some cases. At a time of increasing unrest in the streets and campuses of Paris and Berkeley, the album's (seemingly more equivocal) lyrics seemed to many to mark a reversal of Lennon's position on the question, which was hotly debated during this period. [ 30 ]   The search for hidden meanings within the songs reached its low point when cult leader  Charles Manson  used the record, and generous helpings of hallucinogens, to persuade members of his ""family"" that the album was in fact an  apocalyptic message  predicting a prolonged race war and justifying the murder of wealthy people [ 31 ] . The album's strange association with a high-profile mass murder was one of many factors that helped to deepen the accelerating divide between those who were profoundly skeptical of the ""youth culture"" movement that had unfolded in the middle and late 1960s in England, the United States, and elsewhere, and those who admired the openness and spontaneity of that movement. Prosecutor  Vincent Bugliosi  wrote a best-selling book about the Manson ""family"" that explicated, among other things, the cult's fixation with identifying hidden messages within  The Beatles ; Bugliosi's book was entitled  Helter Skelter , the term Manson took from the album's  song of that name  and construed as the conflict he thought impending.   Cultural responses to the album persisted for decades, and even offer a glimpse into the process of collective  myth-making.  In October 1969, a Detroit radio program began to promote theories based on ""clues"" supposedly left on  The Beatles  and other Beatles albums that  Paul McCartney had died  and been replaced by a lookalike. The ensuing hunt for ""clues"" to a ""coverup"" The Beatles presumably wanted to suppress (and simultaneously publicise) became one of the classic examples of the  development and persistence of urban legends .     [ edit ]   Sales   The album was a major commercial success, spending a total of eight weeks at #1 in the UK (the first week being that of December 7, 1968), [ 32 ]  and nine weeks at #1 in the United States (the first week being that of December 28, 1968). [ 33 ]  Total US sales are estimated at over 9.5 million copies (19 million units). [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   Re-issues   Two re-issues in 1978 (one by  Capitol Records , the other by  Parlophone ) saw the album pressed on white vinyl, completing the look of the ""white"" album. In 1985, EMI Electrola released a DMM (direct metal mastered) white vinyl pressing of the album in Germany, which was imported to the United States in large numbers. Another popular white vinyl pressing was manufactured in France. The 1978 Parlophone white vinyl export pressing and the German DMM pressing are widely considered the best-sounding versions of the album. [ citation needed ]  This is due to the use of the famed Neumann lathe on the 1978 export pressing and the use of the DMM process on the 1985 pressing.   On January 7th, 1982, Mobile Fidelty Sound Lab released the album in a non-embossed unnumbered version of ""The White Album"" cover with the ORIGINAL MASTER RECORDING banner at the top. Neither the poster nor portraits were included. The labels to the discs are white with primarily black text and the Capitol dome logo at three o'clock. The MFSL discs were made with Super Vinyl, a heavy and hard compound that that provides an extraordinary quiet playing surface. Although MFSL leased the album from Capitol and used the company's sub-master, the discs still sound superior to the standard British and American pressings. The discs were stored in ""rice paper"" static-free, dust-free inner sleeves enclosed in an off-white gatefold reinforced stiff board that fit into the custom fabricated album jacket.   In 1998, a 30th anniversary reissue of the album was released on a two-disc compact disc version in the  United Kingdom . The packaging of this release is virtually identical to its vinyl counterpart. It has the same pure white gatefold cover, complete with the title "" The BEATLES "" in a slightly raised, embossed graphic at a slight angle. It also included the now-classic sequentially numbered serial number on the front of this cover, thus making this one a  real  limited edition. The interior of this cover features the song titles on the left-hand side, and the four black-and-white photos of the group members on the right. This version of the cover even accurately mimics the original British vinyl pressing from 1968, with the openings for the discs at the top rather than the sides. There are miniatures of the four full-colour glossy portrait photos included, as well as an exact replica of the poster with the photo collage on one side, and the album's complete song lyrics on the opposite side. The CDs are housed in black sleeves, which were also used for the original British album. This commemorative double CD album is housed in a clear plastic slipcase.     [ edit ]   Influences, parodies and tributes   The album's cover, though stark and minimalistic, has been highly influential. Goth Rock band  The Damned  released  The Black Album  in 1980, and is considered the first album to draw influence from the cover, as well as the first band to use the term ""Black Album"". The 1984  Rob Reiner  ""rockumentary""  This Is Spinal Tap  also pays homage with their own ""Black Album"", which is juxtaposed to the original by A&R staff Bobbi Fleckman, who notes in a debate about appropriate packaging material: ""What about the White album? There's was nothing on that Goddamned cover."" The band are generally less enthusiastic, referring to it variously as ""a black mirror"", ""none more black"" and ""death"". The  self-titled debut album  of  They Might Be Giants  is commonly referred to as ""The Pink Album"" due to the excessive amount of the color pink on the cover. Comedian  Dennis Miller  released a stand-up comedy recording in October of 1988 titled ""The Off-White Album"" which mimicked the design of ""The Beatles"". In the 1990s, both  Prince  and  Metallica  released self-titled albums with their names printed against mostly plain black covers, and are both informally referred to as ""The Black Album"". In 2003, rapper  Jay-Z  released an album officially called  The Black Album . DJ  Danger Mouse  produced the  mashup   The Grey Album  by combining vocals from Jay-Z's  Black Album  with samples from  The White Album . Two compilations of Beatles' material, released in 1973 as  19621966  and  19671970 , are often referred to as ""The Red Album"" and ""The Blue Album"" respectively, in reference to their colour scheme. All three of  Weezer 's self-titled albums borrow from this idea as well and fans refer to them respectively as "" The Blue Album "" (1994), "" The Green Album "" (2001), and "" The Red Album "" (2008).  311's   self-titled release from 1995  is often referred to as ""The Blue Album"", and  The Dells ' 1973 self-titled album is often known as ""The Brown Album"", as is  The Band 's  1969 self-titled album . Australian comedy duo  Martin/Molloy  also released a CD called  The Brown Album  in 1995, while American rock band  Primus  did  likewise  in 1997. The animated television series  The Simpsons  and  SpongeBob Squarepants  both used the title  The Yellow Album  for their spin-off CDs, with  the latter  also parodying the plain cover.

For example, ""Wild Honey Pie"" is the fifth song from the beginning of the album and ""Honey Pie"" is the fifth song from the end. Also, the three songs containing animal names in their titles (""Blackbird"", ""Piggies"", and ""Rocky Raccoon"") are grouped together.

These pressings were also numbered.               The Beatles  is the ninth official U.K.  album  and the fifteenth U.S. album by  The Beatles , a  double album   released in 1968 . It is more commonly known as  The White Album  as it has no text other than the band's name (and, on the early LP and CD releases, a serial number) on its plain white sleeve. The album was the first The Beatles undertook following the death of their manager  Brian Epstein . Originally entitled  A Doll's House , the title was changed when the British progressive band  Family  released the similarly titled  Music in a Doll's House  earlier that year.   In 1997,  The Beatles  was named the 10th greatest album of all time in a 'Music of the Millennium' poll conducted by  HMV ,  Channel 4 ,  The Guardian  and  Classic FM . In 1998,  Q  magazine  readers placed it at number 17, while in 2000 the same magazine placed it at number 7 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. [ 2 ]  In 2001, the TV network  VH1  named it as the 11th greatest album ever. [ 3 ]  In 2006, the album was chosen by  Time Magazine  as one of the 100 best albums of all time. [ 4 ]  It was ranked number 10 in  Rolling Stone ' s list of the  500 greatest albums of all time  in 2003. [ 5 ]   According to the  Recording Industry Association of America ,  The Beatles  is The Beatles' best-selling album at 19-times  platinum  and the tenth- best-selling album of all time  in the  United States .

There, they had undertaken a  transcendental meditation  course with  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . Although the retreat, which had required long periods of meditation, was initially conceived by the band as a spiritual respite from all worldly endeavours  a chance, in Lennon's words, to ""get away from everything"" [ 6 ]   both Lennon and McCartney had quickly found themselves in songwriting mode, often meeting ""clandestinely in the afternoons in each other's rooms"" [ 7 ]  to review the new work. ""Regardless of what I was supposed to be doing,"" Lennon would later recall, ""I did write some of my best songs there."" [ 8 ]  Close to forty new compositions had emerged in Rishikesh, a little more than half of which would be laid down in very rough form at  Kinfauns , George Harrisons home in Esher.   The Beatles left Rishikesh before the end of the course, with Ringo Starr and then Paul McCartney departing first, and Lennon and George Harrison departing together later. According to some reports, Lennon left Rishikesh because he felt personally betrayed by rumours that Maharishi had made sexual advances toward  Mia Farrow , who had accompanied The Beatles on their trip. Shortly after he decided to leave, Lennon wrote a song called ""Maharishi"" which included the lyrics, ""Maharishi/You little twat""; the song became "" Sexy Sadie "". According to several authors,  Alexis Mardas  (aka ""Magic Alex"") deliberately engineered these rumours because he was bent on undermining the Maharishi's influence over each Beatle. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]  Lennon himself, in a 1980 interview, acknowledged that the Maharishi was the inspiration for the song. ""I just called him 'Sexy Sadie'."" [ 12 ]  In May 1968,  John Lennon ,  Paul McCartney , and  George Harrison  assembled at Kinfauns, and demoed 23 songs that they composed at Rishikesh.     [ edit ]   Recording sessions          Abbey Road Studios in 2006.       The Beatles  was recorded between 30 May 1968 and 14 October 1968, largely at  Abbey Road Studios , with some sessions at  Trident Studios . Although productive, the sessions were reportedly undisciplined and sometimes fractious, and they took place at a time when tensions were growing within the group. Concurrent with the recording of this album, The Beatles were launching their new multimedia business corporation  Apple Corps , an enterprise that proved to be a source of significant stress for the band.   The sessions for  The Beatles  marked the first appearance in the studio of Lennon's new girlfriend and artistic partner  Yoko Ono , who would thereafter be a more or less constant presence at all Beatles' sessions. Prior to Ono's appearance on the scene, the individual Beatles had been very insular during recording sessions, with influence from outsiders strictly limited. McCartney's girlfriend at the time,  Francie Schwartz , was also present at some of the recording sessions.   Author  Mark Lewisohn  reports that The Beatles held their first and only 24-hour recording/producing session near the end of the creation of  The Beatles , during which occurred the final mixing and sequencing for the album. The session was attended by Lennon, McCartney, and producer  George Martin . [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Division and discord in the studio   Despite the album's official title, which emphasized group identity, studio efforts on  The Beatles  captured the work of four increasingly individualized artists who frequently found themselves at odds. The band's work pattern changed dramatically with this project, and by most accounts the extraordinary synergy of The Beatles' previous studio sessions was harder to come by during this period. Sometimes McCartney would record in one studio for prolonged periods of time, while Lennon would record in another, each man using different engineers. [ 13 ]  At one point in the sessions, George Martin, whose authority over the band in the studio had waned, spontaneously left to go on holiday, leaving  Chris Thomas  in charge of producing. [ 14 ]  During one of these sessions, while recording "" Helter Skelter "", Harrison reportedly ran around the studio while holding a flaming ashtray above his head. [ 13 ]   Long after the recording of  The Beatles  was complete, Sir George Martin mentioned in interviews that his working relationship with The Beatles changed during this period, and that many of the band's efforts seemed unfocused, often yielding prolonged jam sessions that sounded uninspired. [ 15 ]  On 16 July recording engineer  Geoff Emerick , who had worked with the group since  Revolver , announced he was no longer willing to work with the group out of disgust with the deteriorating work environment. [ citation needed ]   The sudden departures were not limited to EMI personnel. On 22 August, drummer  Ringo Starr  abruptly left the studio, explaining later that he felt his role was minimized compared to that of the other members, and that he was tired of waiting through the long and contentious recording sessions. [ 15 ]  Lennon, McCartney and Harrison pleaded with Starr to return, and after two weeks he did. According to Mark Lewisohn's book  The Complete Beatles Chronicle , Paul McCartney played drums on ""Back in the U.S.S.R."" However, according to Lewisohn, in the case of ""Dear Prudence"" the three remaining Beatles each took a shot at bass and drums, with the result that those parts may be composite tracks played by Lennon, McCartney and/or Harrison. As of 2008, the actual musician/instrument lineup is still undetermined. Upon Starr's return, he found his drum kit decorated with red, white and blue flowers, a welcome-back gesture from Harrison. [ 15 ]  The reconciliation was, however, only temporary, and Starr's exit served as a precursor of future ""months and years of misery,"" in Starr's words. [ 15 ]  Indeed, after  The Beatles  was completed, both Harrison and Lennon would stage similar unpublicized departures from the band. [ 15 ]  McCartney, whose public departure in 1970 would mark the formal end of the band's ensemble, described the sessions for  The Beatles  as a turning point for the group. Up to this point, he observed, ""the world was a problem, but we weren't. You know, that was the best thing about The Beatles, until we started to break up, like during the  White Album  and stuff. Even the studio got a bit tense then."" [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Other musicians   Eric Clapton , at Harrison's invitation, provided lead guitar for Harrison's "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "". Harrison soon reciprocated by collaborating on the song "" Badge "" for  Cream's  last album  Goodbye . George explains in  The Beatles Anthology  that Clapton's presence temporarily alleviated the studio tension and that all band members were on their best behaviour during his time with the band in the studio.   Clapton was not the only outside musician to sit in on the sessions.  Nicky Hopkins  provided electric piano for the single cut of "" Revolution "" (recorded during these sessions) as well as acoustic piano for a few others; several horns were also recorded on the album version of ""Revolution"". "" Savoy Truffle "" also features the horn section, and a group of clarinets is heard on "" I'm So Tired "".  Jack Fallon , a bluegrass fiddler was recruited for "" Don't Pass Me By "", and a team of orchestral players and soothing background singers ended up being important contributors to ""Good Night"". Despite these contributions, and the presence and influence of  Yoko Ono , no external contributors to  The Beatles  are listed in the album notes.     [ edit ]   Technical advances   The sessions for  The Beatles  were notable for the band's formal transition from 4-track to  8-track  recording. As work on this album began, Abbey Road Studios possessed, but had yet to install, an 8-track machine that had supposedly been sitting in a storage room for months. This was in accordance with EMI's policy of testing and customizing new gear, sometimes for months, before putting it into use in the studios. The Beatles recorded ""Hey Jude"" and ""Dear Prudence"" at Trident Studios in central London, which had an 8-track recorder. [ 13 ]  When they found out about EMI's 8-track recorder they insisted on using it, and engineers Ken Scott and Dave Harries took the machine (without authorization from the studio chiefs) into the Number 2 recording studio for the group to use. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Songs   Although most of the songs on any given Beatles album are usually credited to the Lennon/McCartney songwriting team, that description is often misleading, and rarely more so than on  The Beatles . With this album, each of the four band members began to showcase the range and depth of his individual songwriting talents, and to display styles that would be carried over to his eventual solo career. Indeed, some songs that the individual Beatles were working on during this period eventually were released on solo albums ( John Lennon 's ""Look At Me"" and "" Child of Nature ,"" eventually reworked as ""Jealous Guy"";  Paul McCartney 's "" Junk "" and "" Teddy Boy ""; and  George Harrison 's "" Not Guilty "" and ""Circles"").   Many of the songs on the album display experimentation with unlikely musical genres, borrowing directly from such sources as 1930s dance-hall music (in ""Honey Pie""), classical chamber music (in ""Piggies""), the avant-garde sensibilities of  Yoko Ono  and  John Cage  (in "" Revolution 9 ""), and the overproduced sentimentality of  elevator music  (in ""Good Night""). Such diversity was quite unprecedented in global pop music in 1968, and the album's sprawling approach provoked (and continues to provoke) both praise and criticism from observers. [ 16 ]  "" Revolution 9 "", in particular, a densely layered eight-minute-and-thirteen-second sound collage, has attracted bewilderment and disapproval from both fans and music critics over the years.   The only western instrument available to the group during their Indian visit was the  acoustic guitar , and thus most of the songs on  The Beatles  were written and first performed on that instrument. Some of these songs remained acoustic on  The Beatles  (notably ""Rocky Raccoon"", ""Julia"", ""Blackbird"" and "" Mother Nature's Son "") and were recorded in the studio either solo, or by only part of the group.     [ edit ]   Individual compositions   Lennon's contributions to the album are generally more hard-edged lyrically than his previous output, a trend which carried over to his solo career. Examples include his pleas for death on "" Yer Blues "", his parodic "" Glass Onion "", which mocks fans who read too much into The Beatles' lyrics (see also  Paul is dead ), and what may be references to drug addiction in "" Happiness Is a Warm Gun "" (""I need a fix...""). Lennon's intensely personal "" Julia "" may be seen as foreshadowing his later song ""Mother"" from his first solo album,  John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band ; the political "" Revolution 1 "" begins a pattern of overtly political songs like "" Give Peace a Chance "" and ""John Sinclair""; "" Revolution 9 "" reflects extensive contribution and influence from  Yoko Ono , another feature of much of Lennon's solo output. Lennon's songs on  The Beatles  embrace a wide array of styles, including blues (""Yer Blues""), acoustic ballads (""Julia"" and "" Cry Baby Cry ""), and rock ("" Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey ""). Lennon would later describe his contributions to the  The Beatles  as among his favourite songs recorded with The Beatles.   McCartney's songs for the album include pop ballads ("" I Will ""), the proto-heavy metal "" Helter Skelter "", a  Beach Boys  homage ("" Back in the U.S.S.R. ""), the up-beat "" Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da "", and a music-hall foxtrot ("" Honey Pie "") among others. The soothing, stripped-down ""I Will"" foreshadowed themes of McCartney's later solo career.   Harrison's sparse ballad "" Long, Long, Long "" is stylistically quite similar to much of his earlier solo output. His songs on  The Beatles  also includes the lyrically sophisticated "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "", a chronicle of gastronomic excess and dental trauma in "" Savoy Truffle "", and a class-driven piece of social commentary in "" Piggies "".   Even  Ringo Starr  was given leave to include the first song composed entirely by himself on a Beatles' album, the country number "" Don't Pass Me By "". Ringo was asked in an interview in 1964 if he was writing his own songs in which he replied ""Don't Pass Me By"" and in the background Paul can be heard kind of singing the song.   The album is the first by the group not to feature any genuine Lennon-McCartney collaborations - in fact there would only be one more co-write from the pair in the remainder of the band's career ("" I've Got a Feeling "" from the  Let It Be  album). This new lack of co-operation and focus is reflected in several fragmental, incomplete song ideas that were recorded and released on the album (""Why Don't We Do It in the Road?"", "" Wild Honey Pie "", and an officially untitled McCartney snippet at the end of ""Cry Baby Cry"" often referred to as ""Can You Take Me Back""). On previous albums, such undertakings might have been either abandoned or collaboratively developed before release, but here again,  The Beatles  represented a change of course for the band. The trend continued for the rest of the band's recording career: such song fragments were presented by joining them together as a long suite of songs on side two of  Abbey Road .     [ edit ]   Self-reflection and change             This section  may contain  original research  or  unverified claims . Please  improve the article  by adding  references . See the  talk page  for details.  (July 2008)       Many of the songs are personal and self-referencing; for example, "" Dear Prudence "" was written about actress  Mia Farrow 's sister, Prudence, who attended the transcendental meditation course with The Beatles in  Rishikesh . Often she stayed in her room, engaged in Transcendental Meditation. ""Julia"" was the name of Lennon's beloved but frequently absent mother, who died during his youth. ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" expresses concern over being ""bought and sold,"" a theme in later songs about Harrison himself, such as ""Handle with Care"", recorded with  The Traveling Wilburys . ""Glass Onion"" is a Beatles song about Beatles' songs.   Some of the songs on  The Beatles  mark important changes in the band's recording style. Previously, no female voices were to be heard on a Beatles album, but Yoko Ono made her first vocal appearance on this record, adding backing vocals in ""Birthday"" (along with  Pattie Harrison ); Yoko also sang backing vocals and a solo line on "" The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill "" and, as noted earlier, was a strong influence on Lennon's  musique concrte  piece, ""Revolution 9,"" an avant-garde sound collage that McCartney initially did not want to include on the album. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Compositions not included   A number of songs were recorded in demo form for possible inclusion but were not incorporated as part of the album. These included "" Mean Mr. Mustard "" and "" Polythene Pam "" (both of which would be used for the medley on  Abbey Road ); ""Child of Nature"" (recorded with drastically different lyrics as ""Jealous Guy"" for Lennon's  Imagine ), ""Jubilee"" (later retitled ""Junk"" and released on McCartney's first solo LP); ""Etcetera"" (a McCartney composition later recorded by the Black Dyke Mills Band as ""Thingumybob""); ""Circles"" (which Harrison would return to fourteen years later on his 1982 album ""Gone Troppo""); "" The Long and Winding Road "" (completed in 1969 for the  Let It Be  LP); "" Something "" (which ended up on  Abbey Road ); and "" Sour Milk Sea "" (which Harrison gave to friend and Apple artist  Jackie Lomax  for his first LP,  Is This What You Want ). Other songs recorded for, but ultimately left off  The Beatles  received significant exposure via bootlegs, notably Harrison's ""Circles"" and ""Not Guilty"" (which he would eventually re-record as solo tracks and release on his 1982 album,  Gone Troppo  and 1979 self-titled album,  George Harrison  respectively) and Lennon's manic "" What's the New Mary Jane "".     [ edit ]   Editing concerns, and release   The Beatles  was the first Beatles' album released by Apple Records, as well as their only original  double album . Producer George Martin has said that he was against the idea of a double album at the time and suggested to the group that they reduce the number of songs in order to form a single album featuring their stronger work, but that the band decided against this. [ 17 ]  Interviewed for the  Beatles Anthology , Starr said he now felt it should have been released as two separate albums. Harrison felt on reflection that some of the tracks could have been released as B sides, but ""there was a lot of ego in that band"". He also supported the idea of the double album, to clear out the backlog of songs the group had at the time. McCartney, by contrast, said it was fine as it was and that its wide variety of songs was a major part of the album's appeal. [ 18 ]   The Beatles  (1968) shares the same November 22 release date as The Beatles' second album,  With the Beatles  (1963).     [ edit ]   Singles   Although "" Hey Jude "" was not intended to be included on any LP release, it was recorded during the White Album sessions and was released as a stand-alone single before the release of  The Beatles . ""Hey Jude's"" B-side, ""Revolution"", was an alternate version of the album's ""Revolution 1"". Lennon had wanted the original version of ""Revolution"" to be released as a single, but the other three Beatles objected on the grounds that it was too slow. [ 15 ]  A new, faster version, with heavily distorted guitar and a high-energy keyboard solo from  Nicky Hopkins  was recorded, and was relegated to the flip side of ""Hey Jude"". The resulting release  ""Hey Jude"" on side A and ""Revolution"" on side B  emerged as the first release on the Beatles' new  Apple Records  label. It went on to become the best selling of all Beatles' singles in the US.   Four tracks from the ""White Album"" were released on two American and one British single almost eight years after the original album was released. In the summer 1976, to promote the compilation album,  Rock 'n' Roll Music , EMI's Parlophone label in the UK and its Capitol label in the US each released a single that contained A and B-sides that appeared on the compilation album. In Britain, Parlophone issued ""Back in the U.S.S.R."" as the single. (Its B-Side was ""Twist and Shout,"" which originally appeared on the group's first album,  Please Please Me .) In America, Capitol released ""Got to Get You Into My Life"" (from the group's 1966 album,  Revolver ) on the A-Side, but selected ""Helter Skelter,"" to serve as the flip side. ""Helter Skelter"" was likely chosen for the B-Side because a cover version of the song had been prominently featured in a made-for-tv movie about the Manson murders that had aired on  CBS  shortly before the release of  Rock 'n' Roll Music . The singles were successful, with ""Got to Get You into My Life"" hitting No. 7 on the  Billboard Hot 100  in the US and ""Back in the U.S.S.R."" hitting No. 18 on the New Musical Express chart in Britain. Both records also helped sell  Rock 'n' Roll Music , which hit No. 2 in the United States and No. 10 in the UK. With the success of the singles from the compilation album, Capitol followed-up ""Got To Get You Into My Life"" with the release of another single in November of 1976. Instead of taking two more tracks from  Rock 'n' Roll Music , however, Capitol selected two ""White Album"" tracks""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"" as the A-Side, and ""Julia"" as the B-Side. The ""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"" single was sold in an individually-numbered white picture sleeve that mimicked the design of the original album. ""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"" did not duplicate the success of its predecessor, however, as it failed to make the Top Forty, stalling out at No. 49 on  Billboard.     [ edit ]   Mono version   The Beatles  was the last Beatles album to be released with a unique, alternate  mono  mix, albeit one issued only in the UK. Twenty-nine of the album's thirty tracks (""Revolution 9"" being the only exception) exist in official alternate mono mixes.   Beatles' albums after  The Beatles  (except  Yellow Submarine  in the UK) occasionally had mono pressings in certain countries (such as Brazil), but these editions  of  Yellow Submarine ,  Let It Be , and  Abbey Road   were in each case mono fold-downs from the regular stereo mixes.   In the U.S., mono records were already being phased out; the U.S. release of  The Beatles  was the first Beatles LP to be issued in the U.S. in stereo only.     [ edit ]   Sleeve          A vintage circa-1970 pressing of  The Beatles.  Note the serial number and the embossed, rather than printed, album title.       The album's sleeve was designed by  Richard Hamilton , a notable pop artist who had organised a  Marcel Duchamp  retrospective at the  Tate Gallery  the previous year. Hamilton's design was in stark contrast to  Peter Blake's  vivid cover art for  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , and consisted of a plain white sleeve. The band's name was discreetly embossed slightly below the middle of the album's right side, and the cover also featured a unique stamped  serial number , ""to create,"" in Hamilton's words, ""the  ironic  situation of a numbered edition of something like five million copies."" [ citation needed ]  Indeed, the artist intended the cover to resemble the ""look"" of  conceptual art , an emerging movement in contemporary art at the time. Later  vinyl record  releases in the U.S. showed the title in grey printed (rather than embossed) letters. Early copies on  compact disc  were also numbered. Later CD releases rendered the album's title in black or grey. The 30th anniversary CD release was done to look like the original album sleeve, with an embossed title and serial number, including a small reproduction of the poster and pictures (see re-issues).   The album's inside packaging included a poster, the lyrics to the songs, and a set of photographs taken by  John Kelley  during the autumn of 1968 that have themselves become iconic. This is the only sleeve of a Beatles studio album not to show the members of the band on the front.   Tape versions of the album did not feature a white cover. Instead, cassette and 8-track versions (first issued on two cartridges in early 1969) contained cover artwork that featured a black and white (with no grey) version of the four Kelley photographs. [ citation needed ]  In both the cassette and 8-track versions of the album, the two tapes were sold in a black slip-cover box that bore the title, ""The BEATLES"" in gold lettering along the front. This departure from the LP's design not only made it difficult for less-informed fans to identify the tape in record stores, but it also led some fans at the time to jokingly refer to the 8-track or cassette not as the ""white album"" but as the ""black tape."" In 1988, Capitol/EMI re-issued the 2-cassette version of the album, still with the same cover artwork as the original cassettes - but without the black slip-cover box.     [ edit ]   Critical reception and legacy   The Beatles were at the peak of their global influence and visibility in late 1968.  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released the previous year, had enjoyed a combination of commercial success, critical acclaim, and immense cultural influence that had previously seemed inconceivable for a pop release.  Time  magazine, for instance, had written in 1967 that  Pepper  constituted a ""historic departure in the progress of musicany music,"" [ 19 ]  while  Timothy Leary , in a widely quoted assessment of the same period, declared that the band were prototypes of ""evolutionary agents sent by God, endowed with mysterious powers to create a new human species."" [ 20 ]  After creating an album that had delivered such critical, commercial, and generational shockwaves, The Beatles faced the inevitable question of what they could possibly do to top it. The next full-length album, whatever it was, was destined to draw considerable scrutiny. The intervening release of  Magical Mystery Tour  notwithstanding (released as a double-EP package in the UK),  The Beatles  represented the group's first major musical statement since  Pepper , and thus was a highly anticipated event for both the mainstream press and the youth-oriented counterculture movement with which the band had by this time become strongly associated. Expectations, to say the least, were high. The reviews were mixed.     Tony Palmer, in  The Observer , wrote shortly after the album's release: ""If there is still any doubt that Lennon and McCartney are the greatest songwriters since  Schubert , then . . . [the album  The Beatles ] . . . should surely see the last vestiges of cultural snobbery and bourgeois prejudice swept away in a deluge of joyful music making. . . ."" [ 21 ]       Richard Goldstein, writing in  The New York Times  on December 8, 1968, described the album as a ""major success."" [ 22 ]       Another review in  The New York Times , this one by  Nik Cohn , considered the album ""boring beyond belief"" and described ""more than half the songs"" as ""profound mediocrities."" [ 23 ]       Alan Smith, in an  NME  review entitled ""The Brilliant, the Bad, and the Ugly,"" derided ""Revolution #9"" as a ""pretentious"" example of ""idiot immaturity"" and, in the following sentence, assigned the benediction ""God Bless You, Beatles!"" to ""most of the rest"" of the album. [ 24 ]     Smith's review established a pattern that has endured for much of the critical assessment that followed. Many of the reviews since 1968and  The Beatles  surely ranks among the most-reviewed releases in rock historyhave tempered rapturous enthusiasm with a consistent note of criticism about the album's seemingly undisciplined structure and perceived excesses. Unlike such albums as  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  and  Revolver ,  The Beatles  is a release that, four decades on, tends to provoke heated discussions of such topics as continuity, style, and integrity.     The New Rolling Stone Album Guide  praises the album but maintains that it has ""loads of self-indulgent filler,"" identifying ""Revolution #9"" in particular as ""justly maligned,"" and suggests that listeners in the CD era, who can program digital players to skip over unwanted tracks, may have an advantage over the album's original audience. [ 25 ]     Some contemporary critics say the album's inclusion of supposedly extraneous material is a part of its appeal. The  allmusic.com  review contends that:     ""Each song on the sprawling double album  The Beatles  is an entity to itself, as the band touches on anything and everything they can. This makes for a frustratingly scattershot record or a singularly gripping musical experience, depending on your view, but what makes the White Album interesting is its mess."" [ 26 ]     One important current trend in critical assessments of the album is to draw parallels between the band's disintegrating ensemble and the chaotic events of the tumultuous year in which  The Beatles  was created, 1968. Along these lines,  Slant Magazine  observed that:     ""(The album) reveals the popping seams of a band that had the pressure of an entire fissuring generational/political gap on its back. Maybe it's because it shows The Beatles at the point where even their music couldn't hide the underlying tensions between John, Paul, George, and Ringo, or maybe because it was (coincidentally?) released at the tail end of a year anyone could agree was the embittered honeymoon's end for the Love Generation, the year when, to borrow from a famous Yeats poem, the center decidedly could not hold ... for whatever reason,  The Beatles  is still one of the few albums by the Fab Four that resists reflexive canonization, which, along with society's continued fragmentation, keeps the album fresh and surprising."" [ 27 ]     On the 40th anniversary of the album's release the Vatican issued an unusual review of the album. The official Vatican newspaper,  L'Osservatore Romano  published a lengthy article which declared that ""Forty years later, this album remains a type of magical musical anthology: 30 songs you can go through and listen to at will, certain of finding some pearls that even today remain unparalleled."" [ 28 ]  Forgiving John Lennon's ""more popular than Jesus"" slight, the paper called the White Album the ""creative summit"" of the Beatles' career, comparing it favorably to contemporary music and taking note of the now antiquated equipment used, concluding that ""a listening experience like that offered by the Beatles is truly rare.""     [ edit ]   Cultural responses   Ian MacDonald , in his book  Revolution in the Head , argues that  The Beatles  was the album in which the band's cryptic messages to its fan base became not merely vague but intentionally and perhaps dangerously open-ended, citing oblique passages in songs like ""Glass Onion"" (e.g., ""the walrus was Paul"") and ""Piggies"" (""what they need's a damn good whacking""). These pronouncements, and many others on the album, came to attract extraordinary popular interest at a time when more of the world's youth were  using drugs recreationally  and looking for spiritual, political, and strategic advice from The Beatles. Steve Turner, too, in his book  A Hard Day's Write , maintains that, with this album, ""The Beatles had perhaps laid themselves open to misinterpretation by mixing up the languages of poetry and nonsense."" [ 29 ]   Bob Dylan 's songs had been similarly mined for hidden meanings, but the massive countercultural analysis (or perhaps overanalysis) of  The Beatles  surpassed anything that had gone before. [ 30 ]   Even Lennon's seemingly direct engagement with the tumultuous political issues of 1968 in ""Revolution 1"" carried a nuanced obliqueness, and ended up sending messages the author may not have intended. In the album's version of the song, Lennon advises those who ""talk about destruction"" to ""count me out."" As McDonald notes, however, Lennon then follows the sung word ""out"" with the spoken word ""in."" At the time of the album's releasewhich followed, chronologically, the up-tempo single version of the song, ""Revolution,"" in which Lennon definitely wanted to be counted ""out""that single word ""in"" was taken by many on the radical left as Lennon's acknowledgment, after considered thought, that violence in the pursuit of political aims was indeed justified in some cases. At a time of increasing unrest in the streets and campuses of Paris and Berkeley, the album's (seemingly more equivocal) lyrics seemed to many to mark a reversal of Lennon's position on the question, which was hotly debated during this period. [ 30 ]   The search for hidden meanings within the songs reached its low point when cult leader  Charles Manson  used the record, and generous helpings of hallucinogens, to persuade members of his ""family"" that the album was in fact an  apocalyptic message  predicting a prolonged race war and justifying the murder of wealthy people [ 31 ] . The album's strange association with a high-profile mass murder was one of many factors that helped to deepen the accelerating divide between those who were profoundly skeptical of the ""youth culture"" movement that had unfolded in the middle and late 1960s in England, the United States, and elsewhere, and those who admired the openness and spontaneity of that movement. Prosecutor  Vincent Bugliosi  wrote a best-selling book about the Manson ""family"" that explicated, among other things, the cult's fixation with identifying hidden messages within  The Beatles ; Bugliosi's book was entitled  Helter Skelter , the term Manson took from the album's  song of that name  and construed as the conflict he thought impending.   Cultural responses to the album persisted for decades, and even offer a glimpse into the process of collective  myth-making.  In October 1969, a Detroit radio program began to promote theories based on ""clues"" supposedly left on  The Beatles  and other Beatles albums that  Paul McCartney had died  and been replaced by a lookalike. The ensuing hunt for ""clues"" to a ""coverup"" The Beatles presumably wanted to suppress (and simultaneously publicise) became one of the classic examples of the  development and persistence of urban legends .     [ edit ]   Sales   The album was a major commercial success, spending a total of eight weeks at #1 in the UK (the first week being that of December 7, 1968), [ 32 ]  and nine weeks at #1 in the United States (the first week being that of December 28, 1968). [ 33 ]  Total US sales are estimated at over 9.5 million copies (19 million units). [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   Re-issues   Two re-issues in 1978 (one by  Capitol Records , the other by  Parlophone ) saw the album pressed on white vinyl, completing the look of the ""white"" album. In 1985, EMI Electrola released a DMM (direct metal mastered) white vinyl pressing of the album in Germany, which was imported to the United States in large numbers. Another popular white vinyl pressing was manufactured in France. The 1978 Parlophone white vinyl export pressing and the German DMM pressing are widely considered the best-sounding versions of the album. [ citation needed ]  This is due to the use of the famed Neumann lathe on the 1978 export pressing and the use of the DMM process on the 1985 pressing.   On January 7th, 1982, Mobile Fidelty Sound Lab released the album in a non-embossed unnumbered version of ""The White Album"" cover with the ORIGINAL MASTER RECORDING banner at the top. Neither the poster nor portraits were included. The labels to the discs are white with primarily black text and the Capitol dome logo at three o'clock. The MFSL discs were made with Super Vinyl, a heavy and hard compound that that provides an extraordinary quiet playing surface. Although MFSL leased the album from Capitol and used the company's sub-master, the discs still sound superior to the standard British and American pressings. The discs were stored in ""rice paper"" static-free, dust-free inner sleeves enclosed in an off-white gatefold reinforced stiff board that fit into the custom fabricated album jacket.   In 1998, a 30th anniversary reissue of the album was released on a two-disc compact disc version in the  United Kingdom . The packaging of this release is virtually identical to its vinyl counterpart. It has the same pure white gatefold cover, complete with the title "" The BEATLES "" in a slightly raised, embossed graphic at a slight angle. It also included the now-classic sequentially numbered serial number on the front of this cover, thus making this one a  real  limited edition. The interior of this cover features the song titles on the left-hand side, and the four black-and-white photos of the group members on the right. This version of the cover even accurately mimics the original British vinyl pressing from 1968, with the openings for the discs at the top rather than the sides. There are miniatures of the four full-colour glossy portrait photos included, as well as an exact replica of the poster with the photo collage on one side, and the album's complete song lyrics on the opposite side. The CDs are housed in black sleeves, which were also used for the original British album. This commemorative double CD album is housed in a clear plastic slipcase.     [ edit ]   Influences, parodies and tributes   The album's cover, though stark and minimalistic, has been highly influential. Goth Rock band  The Damned  released  The Black Album  in 1980, and is considered the first album to draw influence from the cover, as well as the first band to use the term ""Black Album"". The 1984  Rob Reiner  ""rockumentary""  This Is Spinal Tap  also pays homage with their own ""Black Album"", which is juxtaposed to the original by A&R staff Bobbi Fleckman, who notes in a debate about appropriate packaging material: ""What about the White album? There's was nothing on that Goddamned cover."" The band are generally less enthusiastic, referring to it variously as ""a black mirror"", ""none more black"" and ""death"". The  self-titled debut album  of  They Might Be Giants  is commonly referred to as ""The Pink Album"" due to the excessive amount of the color pink on the cover. Comedian  Dennis Miller  released a stand-up comedy recording in October of 1988 titled ""The Off-White Album"" which mimicked the design of ""The Beatles"". In the 1990s, both  Prince  and  Metallica  released self-titled albums with their names printed against mostly plain black covers, and are both informally referred to as ""The Black Album"". In 2003, rapper  Jay-Z  released an album officially called  The Black Album . DJ  Danger Mouse  produced the  mashup   The Grey Album  by combining vocals from Jay-Z's  Black Album  with samples from  The White Album . Two compilations of Beatles' material, released in 1973 as  19621966  and  19671970 , are often referred to as ""The Red Album"" and ""The Blue Album"" respectively, in reference to their colour scheme. All three of  Weezer 's self-titled albums borrow from this idea as well and fans refer to them respectively as "" The Blue Album "" (1994), "" The Green Album "" (2001), and "" The Red Album "" (2008).  311's   self-titled release from 1995  is often referred to as ""The Blue Album"", and  The Dells ' 1973 self-titled album is often known as ""The Brown Album"", as is  The Band 's  1969 self-titled album . Australian comedy duo  Martin/Molloy  also released a CD called  The Brown Album  in 1995, while American rock band  Primus  did  likewise  in 1997. The animated television series  The Simpsons  and  SpongeBob Squarepants  both used the title  The Yellow Album  for their spin-off CDs, with  the latter  also parodying the plain cover.

Also, the three songs containing animal names in their titles (""Blackbird"", ""Piggies"", and ""Rocky Raccoon"") are grouped together. ""Savoy Truffle"" contains a reference to ""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,"" a previous song on the album. In addition, the four songs composed by George Harrison are distributed with one on each of the four sides.

These pressings were also numbered.         The Beatles  is the ninth official U.K.  album  and the fifteenth U.S. album by  The Beatles , a  double album   released in 1968 . It is more commonly known as  The White Album  as it has no text other than the band's name (and, on the early LP and CD releases, a serial number) on its plain white sleeve. The album was the first The Beatles undertook following the death of their manager  Brian Epstein . Originally entitled  A Doll's House , the title was changed when the British progressive band  Family  released an album earlier that year  bearing a similar title.   In 1997,  The Beatles  was named the 10th greatest album of all time in a 'Music of the Millennium' poll conducted by  HMV ,  Channel 4 ,  The Guardian  and  Classic FM . In 1998,  Q  magazine  readers placed it at number 17, while in 2000 the same magazine placed it at number 7 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. [ 2 ]  In 2001, the TV network  VH1  named it as the 11th greatest album ever. [ 3 ]  In 2006, the album was chosen by  Time Magazine  as one of the 100 best albums of all time. [ 4 ]  It was ranked number 10 in  Rolling Stone ' s list of the  500 greatest albums of all time  in 2003. [ 5 ]   According to the  Recording Industry Association of America ,  The Beatles  is The Beatles' best-selling album at 19-times  platinum  and the tenth- best-selling album of all time  in the  United States .

There, they had undertaken a  transcendental meditation  course with  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . Although the retreat, which had required long periods of meditation, was initially conceived by the band as a spiritual respite from all worldly endeavours  a chance, in Lennon's words, to ""get away from everything"" [ 6 ]   both Lennon and McCartney had quickly found themselves in songwriting mode, often meeting ""clandestinely in the afternoons in each other's rooms"" [ 7 ]  to review the new work. ""Regardless of what I was supposed to be doing,"" Lennon would later recall, ""I did write some of my best songs there."" [ 8 ]  Close to forty new compositions had emerged in Rishikesh, a little more than half of which would be laid down in very rough form at  Kinfauns , George Harrisons home in Esher.   The Beatles left Rishikesh before the end of the course, with Ringo Starr and then Paul McCartney departing first, and Lennon and George Harrison departing together later. According to some reports, Lennon left Rishikesh because he felt personally betrayed by rumours that Maharishi had made sexual advances toward  Mia Farrow , who had accompanied The Beatles on their trip. Shortly after he decided to leave, Lennon wrote a song called ""Maharishi"" which included the lyrics, ""Maharishi/You little twat""; the song became "" Sexy Sadie "". According to several authors,  Alexis Mardas  (aka ""Magic Alex"") deliberately engineered these rumours because he was bent on undermining the Maharishi's influence over each Beatle. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]  Lennon himself, in a 1980 interview, acknowledged that the Maharishi was the inspiration for the song. ""I just called him 'Sexy Sadie'."" [ 12 ]  In May 1968,  John Lennon ,  Paul McCartney , and  George Harrison  assembled at Kinfauns, and demoed 23 songs that they composed at Rishikesh.     [ edit ]   Recording sessions          Abbey Road Studios in 2006.       The Beatles  was recorded between 30 May 1968 and 14 October 1968, largely at  Abbey Road Studios , with some sessions at  Trident Studios . Although productive, the sessions were reportedly undisciplined and sometimes fractious, and they took place at a time when tensions were growing within the group. Concurrent with the recording of this album, The Beatles were launching their new multimedia business corporation  Apple Corps , an enterprise that proved to be a source of significant stress for the band.   The sessions for  The Beatles  marked the first appearance in the studio of Lennon's new girlfriend and artistic partner  Yoko Ono , who would thereafter be a more or less constant presence at all Beatles' sessions. Prior to Ono's appearance on the scene, the individual Beatles had been very insular during recording sessions, with influence from outsiders strictly limited. McCartney's girlfriend at the time,  Francie Schwartz , was also present at some of the recording sessions.   Author  Mark Lewisohn  reports that The Beatles held their first and only 24-hour recording/producing session near the end of the creation of  The Beatles , during which occurred the final mixing and sequencing for the album. The session was attended by Lennon, McCartney, and producer  George Martin . [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Division and discord in the studio   Despite the album's official title, which emphasized group identity, studio efforts on  The Beatles  captured the work of four increasingly individualized artists who frequently found themselves at odds. The band's work pattern changed dramatically with this project, and by most accounts the extraordinary synergy of The Beatles' previous studio sessions was harder to come by during this period. Sometimes McCartney would record in one studio for prolonged periods of time, while Lennon would record in another, each man using different engineers. [ 13 ]  At one point in the sessions, George Martin, whose authority over the band in the studio had waned, spontaneously left to go on holiday, leaving  Chris Thomas  in charge of producing. [ 14 ]  During one of these sessions, while recording "" Helter Skelter "", Harrison reportedly ran around the studio while holding a flaming ashtray above his head. [ 13 ]   Long after the recording of  The Beatles  was complete, Sir George Martin mentioned in interviews that his working relationship with The Beatles changed during this period, and that many of the band's efforts seemed unfocused, often yielding prolonged jam sessions that sounded uninspired. [ 15 ]  On 16 July recording engineer  Geoff Emerick , who had worked with the group since  Revolver , announced he was no longer willing to work with the group out of disgust with the deteriorating work environment. [ citation needed ]   The sudden departures were not limited to EMI personnel. On 22 August, drummer  Ringo Starr  abruptly left the studio, explaining later that he felt his role was minimized compared to that of the other members, and that he was tired of waiting through the long and contentious recording sessions. [ 15 ]  Lennon, McCartney and Harrison pleaded with Starr to return, and after two weeks he did. According to Mark Lewisohn's book  The Complete Beatles Chronicle , Paul McCartney played drums on ""Back in the U.S.S.R."" However, according to Lewisohn, in the case of ""Dear Prudence"" the three remaining Beatles each took a shot at bass and drums, with the result that those parts may be composite tracks played by Lennon, McCartney and/or Harrison. As of 2008, the actual musician/instrument lineup is still undetermined. Upon Starr's return, he found his drum kit decorated with red, white and blue flowers, a welcome-back gesture from Harrison. [ 15 ]  The reconciliation was, however, only temporary, and Starr's exit served as a precursor of future ""months and years of misery,"" in Starr's words. [ 15 ]  Indeed, after  The Beatles  was completed, both Harrison and Lennon would stage similar unpublicized departures from the band. [ 15 ]  McCartney, whose public departure in 1970 would mark the formal end of the band's ensemble, described the sessions for  The Beatles  as a turning point for the group. Up to this point, he observed, ""the world was a problem, but we weren't. You know, that was the best thing about The Beatles, until we started to break up, like during the  White Album  and stuff. Even the studio got a bit tense then."" [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Other musicians   Eric Clapton , at Harrison's invitation, provided lead guitar for Harrison's ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"". Harrison soon reciprocated by collaborating on the song "" Badge "" for  Cream's  last album  Goodbye . George explains in  The Beatles Anthology  that Clapton's presence temporarily alleviated the studio tension and that all band members were on their best behaviour during his time with the band in the studio.   Clapton was not the only outside musician to sit in on the sessions.  Nicky Hopkins  provided electric piano for the single cut of "" Revolution "" (recorded during these sessions) as well as acoustic piano for a few others; several horns were also recorded on the album version of ""Revolution"". "" Savoy Truffle "" also features the horn section, and a group of clarinets is heard on "" I'm So Tired "".  Jack Fallon , a bluegrass fiddler was recruited for "" Don't Pass Me By "", and a team of orchestral players and soothing background singers ended up being important contributors to ""Good Night"". Despite these contributions, and the presence and influence of  Yoko Ono , no external contributors to  The Beatles  are listed in the album notes.     [ edit ]   Technical advances   The sessions for  The Beatles  were notable for the band's formal transition from 4-track to  8-track  recording. As work on this album began, Abbey Road Studios possessed, but had yet to install, an 8-track machine that had supposedly been sitting in a storage room for months. This was in accordance with EMI's policy of testing and customizing new gear, sometimes for months, before putting it into use in the studios. The Beatles recorded ""Hey Jude"" and ""Dear Prudence"" at Trident Studios in central London, which had an 8-track recorder. [ 13 ]  When they found out about EMI's 8-track recorder they insisted on using it, and engineers Ken Scott and Dave Harries took the machine (without authorization from the studio chiefs) into the Number 2 recording studio for the group to use. [ 13 ]     [ edit ]   Songs   Although most of the songs on any given Beatles album are usually credited to the Lennon/McCartney songwriting team, that description is often misleading, and rarely more so than on  The Beatles . With this album, each of the four band members began to showcase the range and depth of his individual songwriting talents, and to display styles that would be carried over to his eventual solo career. Indeed, some songs that the individual Beatles were working on during this period eventually were released on solo albums ( John Lennon 's ""Look At Me"" and "" Child of Nature ,"" eventually reworked as ""Jealous Guy"";  Paul McCartney 's "" Junk "" and "" Teddy Boy ""; and  George Harrison 's "" Not Guilty "" and ""Circles"").   Many of the songs on the album display experimentation with unlikely musical genres, borrowing directly from such sources as 1930s dance-hall music (in ""Honey Pie""), classical chamber music (in ""Piggies""), the avant-garde sensibilities of  Yoko Ono  and  John Cage  (in "" Revolution 9 ""), and the overproduced sentimentality of  elevator music  (in ""Good Night""). Such diversity was quite unprecedented in global pop music in 1968, and the album's sprawling approach provoked (and continues to provoke) both praise and criticism from observers. [ 16 ]  "" Revolution 9 "", in particular, a densely layered eight-minute-and-thirteen-second sound collage, has attracted bewilderment and disapproval from both fans and music critics over the years.   The only western instrument available to the group during their Indian visit was the  acoustic guitar , and thus most of the songs on  The Beatles  were written and first performed on that instrument. Some of these songs remained acoustic on  The Beatles  (notably ""Rocky Raccoon"", ""Julia"", ""Blackbird"" and "" Mother Nature's Son "") and were recorded in the studio either solo, or by only part of the group.     [ edit ]   Individual compositions   Lennon's contributions to the album are generally more hard-edged lyrically than his previous output, a trend which carried over to his solo career. Examples include his pleas for death on "" Yer Blues "", his parodic "" Glass Onion "", which mocks fans who read too much into The Beatles' lyrics (see also  Paul is dead ), and what may be references to drug addiction in "" Happiness Is a Warm Gun "" (""I need a fix...""). Lennon's intensely personal "" Julia "" may be seen as foreshadowing his later song ""Mother"" from his first solo album,  John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band ; the political "" Revolution 1 "" begins a pattern of overtly political songs like "" Give Peace a Chance "" and ""John Sinclair""; "" Revolution 9 "" reflects extensive contribution and influence from  Yoko Ono , another feature of much of Lennon's solo output. Lennon's songs on  The Beatles  embrace a wide array of styles, including blues (""Yer Blues""), acoustic ballads (""Julia"" and "" Cry Baby Cry ""), and rock ("" Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey ""). Lennon would later describe his contributions to the  White Album  as among his favourite songs recorded with The Beatles.   McCartney's songs for the album include pop ballads ("" I Will ""), the proto-heavy metal "" Helter Skelter "", a  Beach Boys  homage ("" Back in the U.S.S.R. ""), the up-beat ""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"", and a music-hall foxtrot ("" Honey Pie "") among others. The soothing, stripped-down ""I Will"" foreshadowed themes of McCartney's later solo career.   Harrison's sparse ballad "" Long, Long, Long "" is stylistically quite similar to much of his earlier solo output. His songs on  The Beatles  also includes the lyrically sophisticated "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "", a chronicle of gastronomic excess and dental trauma in "" Savoy Truffle "", and a class-driven piece of social commentary in "" Piggies "".   Even  Ringo Starr  was given leave to include the first song composed entirely by himself on a Beatles' album, the country number "" Don't Pass Me By "". Ringo was asked in an interview in 1964 if he was writing his own songs in which he replied ""Don't Pass Me By"" and in the background Paul can be heard kind of singing the song.   The album is the first by the group not to feature any genuine Lennon-McCartney collaborations - in fact there would only be one more co-write from the pair in the remainder of the band's career ("" I've Got a Feeling "" from the  Let It Be  album). This new lack of co-operation and focus is reflected in several fragmental, incomplete song ideas that were recorded and released on the album (""Why Don't We Do It in the Road?"", "" Wild Honey Pie "", and an officially untitled McCartney snippet at the end of ""Cry Baby Cry"" often referred to as ""Can You Take Me Back""). On previous albums, such undertakings might have been either abandoned or collaboratively developed before release, but here again,  The Beatles  represented a change of course for the band. The trend continued for the rest of the band's recording career: such song fragments were presented by joining them together as a long suite of songs on side two of  Abbey Road .     [ edit ]   Self-reflection and change             This section  may contain  original research  or  unverified claims . Please  improve the article  by adding  references . See the  talk page  for details.  (July 2008)       Many of the songs are personal and self-referencing; for example, "" Dear Prudence "" was written about actress  Mia Farrow 's sister, Prudence, who attended the transcendental meditation course with The Beatles in  Rishikesh . Often she stayed in her room, engaged in Transcendental Meditation. ""Julia"" was the name of Lennon's beloved but frequently absent mother, who died during his youth. ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" expresses concern over being ""bought and sold,"" a theme in later songs about Harrison himself, such as ""Handle with Care"", recorded with  The Traveling Wilburys . ""Glass Onion"" is a Beatles song about Beatles' songs.   Some of the songs on  The Beatles  mark important changes in the band's recording style. Previously, no female voices were to be heard on a Beatles album, but Yoko Ono made her first vocal appearance on this record, adding backing vocals in ""Birthday"" (along with  Pattie Harrison ); Yoko also sang backing vocals and a solo line on "" The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill "" and, as noted earlier, was a strong influence on Lennon's  musique concrte  piece, ""Revolution 9,"" an avant-garde sound collage that McCartney initially did not want to include on the album. [ 15 ]     [ edit ]   Compositions not included   A number of songs were recorded in demo form for possible inclusion but were not incorporated as part of the album. These included "" Mean Mr. Mustard "" and "" Polythene Pam "" (both of which would be used for the medley on  Abbey Road ); ""Child of Nature"" (recorded with drastically different lyrics as ""Jealous Guy"" for Lennon's  Imagine ), ""Jubilee"" (later retitled ""Junk"" and released on McCartney's first solo LP); ""Etcetera"" (a McCartney composition later recorded by the Black Dyke Mills Band as ""Thingumybob""); ""Circles"" (which Harrison would return to fourteen years later on his 1982 album ""Gone Troppo""); "" The Long and Winding Road "" (completed in 1969 for the  Let It Be  LP); "" Something "" (which ended up on  Abbey Road ); and "" Sour Milk Sea "" (which Harrison gave to friend and Apple artist  Jackie Lomax  for his first LP,  Is This What You Want ). Other songs recorded for, but ultimately left off  The Beatles  received significant exposure via bootlegs, notably Harrison's ""Circles"" and ""Not Guilty"" (which he would eventually re-record as solo tracks and release on his 1982 album,  Gone Troppo  and 1979 self-titled album,  George Harrison  respectively) and Lennon's manic "" What's the New Mary Jane "".     [ edit ]   Editing concerns, and release   The Beatles  was the first Beatles' album released by Apple Records, as well as their only original  double album . Producer George Martin has said that he was against the idea of a double album at the time and suggested to the group that they reduce the number of songs in order to form a single album featuring their stronger work, but that the band decided against this. [ 17 ]  Interviewed for the  Beatles Anthology , Starr said he now felt it should have been released as two separate albums. Harrison felt on reflection that some of the tracks could have been released as B sides, but ""there was a lot of ego in that band"". He also supported the idea of the double album, to clear out the backlog of songs the group had at the time. McCartney, by contrast, said it was fine as it was and that its wide variety of songs was a major part of the album's appeal. [ 18 ]   The Beatles  (1968) shares the same November 22 release date as The Beatles' second album,  With the Beatles  (1963).     [ edit ]   Singles   Although "" Hey Jude "" was not intended to be included on any LP release, it was recorded during the White Album sessions and was released as a stand-alone single before the release of  The Beatles . ""Hey Jude's"" B-side, ""Revolution"", was an alternate version of the album's ""Revolution 1"". Lennon had wanted the original version of ""Revolution"" to be released as a single, but the other three Beatles objected on the grounds that it was too slow. [ 15 ]  A new, faster version, with heavily distorted guitar and a high-energy keyboard solo from  Nicky Hopkins  was recorded, and was relegated to the flip side of ""Hey Jude"". The resulting release  ""Hey Jude"" on side A and ""Revolution"" on side B  emerged as the first release on the Beatles' new  Apple Records  label. It went on to become the best selling of all Beatles' singles in the US.   Four tracks from the ""White Album"" were released on two American and one British single almost eight years after the original album was released. In the summer 1976, to promote the compilation album,  Rock 'n' Roll Music , EMI's Parlophone label in the UK and its Capitol label in the US each released a single that contained A and B-sides that appeared on the compilation album. In Britain, Parlophone issued ""Back in the U.S.S.R."" as the single. (Its B-Side was ""Twist and Shout,"" which originally appeared on the group's first album,  Please Please Me .) In America, Capitol released ""Got to Get You Into My Life"" (from the group's 1966 album,  Revolver ) on the A-Side, but selected ""Helter Skelter,"" to serve as the flip side. ""Helter Skelter"" was likely chosen for the B-Side because a cover version of the song had been prominently featured in a made-for-tv movie about the Manson murders that had aired on  CBS  shortly before the release of  Rock 'n' Roll Music . The singles were successful, with ""Got to Get You into My Life"" hitting No. 7 on the  Billboard Hot 100  in the US and ""Back in the U.S.S.R."" hitting No. 18 on the New Musical Express chart in Britain. Both records also helped sell  Rock 'n' Roll Music , which hit No. 2 in the United States and No. 10 in the UK. With the success of the singles from the compilation album, Capitol followed-up ""Got To Get You Into My Life"" with the release of another single in November of 1976. Instead of taking two more tracks from  Rock 'n' Roll Music , however, Capitol selected two ""White Album"" tracks""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"" as the A-Side, and ""Julia"" as the B-Side. The ""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"" single was sold in an individually-numbered white picture sleeve that mimicked the design of the original album. ""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da"" did not duplicate the success of its predecessor, however, as it failed to make the Top Forty, stalling out at No. 49 on  Billboard.     [ edit ]   Mono version   The Beatles  was the last Beatles album to be released with a unique, alternate  mono  mix, albeit one issued only in the UK. Twenty-nine of the album's thirty tracks (""Revolution 9"" being the only exception) exist in official alternate mono mixes.   Beatles' albums after  The Beatles  (except  Yellow Submarine  in the UK) occasionally had mono pressings in certain countries (such as Brazil), but these editions  of  Yellow Submarine ,  Let It Be , and  Abbey Road   were in each case mono fold-downs from the regular stereo mixes.   In the U.S., mono records were already being phased out; the U.S. release of  The Beatles  was the first Beatles LP to be issued in the U.S. in stereo only.     [ edit ]   Sleeve          A vintage circa-1970 pressing of  The Beatles.  Note the serial number and the embossed, rather than printed, album title.       The album's sleeve was designed by  Richard Hamilton , a notable pop artist who had organised a  Marcel Duchamp  retrospective at the  Tate Gallery  the previous year. Hamilton's design was in stark contrast to  Peter Blake's  vivid cover art for  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , and consisted of a plain white sleeve. The band's name was discreetly embossed slightly below the middle of the album's right side, and the cover also featured a unique stamped  serial number , ""to create,"" in Hamilton's words, ""the  ironic  situation of a numbered edition of something like five million copies."" [ citation needed ]  Indeed, the artist intended the cover to resemble the ""look"" of  conceptual art , an emerging movement in contemporary art at the time. Later  vinyl record  releases in the U.S. showed the title in grey printed (rather than embossed) letters. Early copies on  compact disc  were also numbered. Later CD releases rendered the album's title in black or grey. The 30th anniversary CD release was done to look like the original album sleeve, with an embossed title and serial number, including a small reproduction of the poster and pictures (see re-issues).   The album's inside packaging included a poster, the lyrics to the songs, and a set of photographs taken by  John Kelley  during the autumn of 1968 that have themselves become iconic. This is the only sleeve of a Beatles studio album not to show the members of the band on the front.   Tape versions of the album did not feature a white cover. Instead, cassette and 8-track versions (first issued on two cartridges in early 1969) contained cover artwork that featured a black and white (with no grey) version of the four Kelley photographs. [ citation needed ]  In both the cassette and 8-track versions of the album, the two tapes were sold in a black slip-cover box that bore the title, ""The BEATLES"" in gold lettering along the front. This departure from the LP's design not only made it difficult for less-informed fans to identify the tape in record stores, but it also led some fans at the time to jokingly refer to the 8-track or cassette not as the ""white album"" but as the ""black tape."" In 1988, Capitol/EMI re-issued the 2-cassette version of the album, still with the same cover artwork as the original cassettes - but without the black slip-cover box.     [ edit ]   Critical reception and legacy   The Beatles were at the peak of their global influence and visibility in late 1968.  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released the previous year, had enjoyed a combination of commercial success, critical acclaim, and immense cultural influence that had previously seemed inconceivable for a pop release.  Time  magazine, for instance, had written in 1967 that  Pepper  constituted a ""historic departure in the progress of musicany music,"" [ 19 ]  while  Timothy Leary , in a widely quoted assessment of the same period, declared that the band were prototypes of ""evolutionary agents sent by God, endowed with mysterious powers to create a new human species."" [ 20 ]  After creating an album that had delivered such critical, commercial, and generational shockwaves, The Beatles faced the inevitable question of what they could possibly do to top it. The next full-length album, whatever it was, was destined to draw considerable scrutiny. The intervening release of  Magical Mystery Tour  notwithstanding (released as a double-EP package in the UK),  The Beatles  represented the group's first major musical statement since  Pepper , and thus was a highly anticipated event for both the mainstream press and the youth-oriented counterculture movement with which the band had by this time become strongly associated. Expectations, to say the least, were high. The reviews were mixed.     Tony Palmer, in  The Observer , wrote shortly after the album's release: ""If there is still any doubt that Lennon and McCartney are the greatest songwriters since  Schubert , then . . . [the album  The Beatles ] . . . should surely see the last vestiges of cultural snobbery and bourgeois prejudice swept away in a deluge of joyful music making. . . ."" [ 21 ]       Richard Goldstein, writing in  The New York Times  on December 8, 1968, described the album as a ""major success."" [ 22 ]       Another review in  The New York Times , this one by  Nik Cohn , considered the album ""boring beyond belief"" and described ""more than half the songs"" as ""profound mediocrities."" [ 23 ]       Alan Smith, in an  NME  review entitled ""The Brilliant, the Bad, and the Ugly,"" derided ""Revolution #9"" as a ""pretentious"" example of ""idiot immaturity"" and, in the following sentence, assigned the benediction ""God Bless You, Beatles!"" to ""most of the rest"" of the album. [ 24 ]     Smith's review established a pattern that has endured for much of the critical assessment that followed. Many of the reviews since 1968and  The Beatles  surely ranks among the most-reviewed releases in rock historyhave tempered rapturous enthusiasm with a consistent note of criticism about the album's seemingly undisciplined structure and perceived excesses. Unlike such albums as  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  and  Revolver ,  The Beatles  is a release that, four decades on, tends to provoke heated discussions of such topics as continuity, style, and integrity.     The New Rolling Stone Album Guide  praises the album but maintains that it has ""loads of self-indulgent filler,"" identifying ""Revolution #9"" in particular as ""justly maligned,"" and suggests that listeners in the CD era, who can program digital players to skip over unwanted tracks, may have an advantage over the album's original audience. [ 25 ]     Some contemporary critics say the album's inclusion of supposedly extraneous material is a part of its appeal. The  allmusic.com  review contends that:     ""Each song on the sprawling double album  The Beatles  is an entity to itself, as the band touches on anything and everything they can. This makes for a frustratingly scattershot record or a singularly gripping musical experience, depending on your view, but what makes the White Album interesting is its mess."" [ 26 ]     One important current trend in critical assessments of the album is to draw parallels between the band's disintegrating ensemble and the chaotic events of the tumultuous year in which  The Beatles  was created, 1968. Along these lines,  Slant Magazine  observed that:     ""(The album) reveals the popping seams of a band that had the pressure of an entire fissuring generational/political gap on its back. Maybe it's because it shows The Beatles at the point where even their music couldn't hide the underlying tensions between John, Paul, George, and Ringo, or maybe because it was (coincidentally?) released at the tail end of a year anyone could agree was the embittered honeymoon's end for the Love Generation, the year when, to borrow from a famous Yeats poem, the center decidedly could not hold ... for whatever reason,  The Beatles  is still one of the few albums by the Fab Four that resists reflexive canonization, which, along with society's continued fragmentation, keeps the album fresh and surprising."" [ 27 ]     On the 40th anniversary of the album's release the Vatican issued an unusual review of the album. The official Vatican newspaper,  L'Osservatore Romano  published a lengthy article which declared that ""Forty years later, this album remains a type of magical musical anthology: 30 songs you can go through and listen to at will, certain of finding some pearls that even today remain unparalleled."" [ 28 ]  Forgiving John Lennon's ""more popular than Jesus"" slight, the paper called the White Album the ""creative summit"" of the Beatles' career, comparing it favorably to contemporary music and taking note of the now antiquated equipment used, concluding that ""a listening experience like that offered by the Beatles is truly rare.""     [ edit ]   Cultural responses   Ian MacDonald , in his book  Revolution in the Head , argues that  The Beatles  was the album in which the band's cryptic messages to its fan base became not merely vague but intentionally and perhaps dangerously open-ended, citing oblique passages in songs like ""Glass Onion"" (e.g., ""the walrus was Paul"") and ""Piggies"" (""what they need's a damn good whacking""). These pronouncements, and many others on the album, came to attract extraordinary popular interest at a time when more of the world's youth were  using drugs recreationally  and looking for spiritual, political, and strategic advice from The Beatles. Steve Turner, too, in his book  A Hard Day's Write , maintains that, with this album, ""The Beatles had perhaps laid themselves open to misinterpretation by mixing up the languages of poetry and nonsense."" [ 29 ]   Bob Dylan 's songs had been similarly mined for hidden meanings, but the massive countercultural analysis (or perhaps overanalysis) of  The Beatles  surpassed anything that had gone before. [ 30 ]   Even Lennon's seemingly direct engagement with the tumultuous political issues of 1968 in ""Revolution 1"" carried a nuanced obliqueness, and ended up sending messages the author may not have intended. In the album's version of the song, Lennon advises those who ""talk about destruction"" to ""count me out."" As McDonald notes, however, Lennon then follows the sung word ""out"" with the spoken word ""in."" At the time of the album's releasewhich followed, chronologically, the up-tempo single version of the song, ""Revolution,"" in which Lennon definitely wanted to be counted ""out""that single word ""in"" was taken by many on the radical left as Lennon's acknowledgment, after considered thought, that violence in the pursuit of political aims was indeed justified in some cases. At a time of increasing unrest in the streets and campuses of Paris and Berkeley, the album's (seemingly more equivocal) lyrics seemed to many to mark a reversal of Lennon's position on the question, which was hotly debated during this period. [ 30 ]   The search for hidden meanings within the songs reached its low point when cult leader  Charles Manson  used the record, and generous helpings of hallucinogens, to persuade members of his ""family"" that the album was in fact an  apocalyptic message  predicting a prolonged race war and justifying the murder of wealthy people [ 31 ] . The album's strange association with a high-profile mass murder was one of many factors that helped to deepen the accelerating divide between those who were profoundly skeptical of the ""youth culture"" movement that had unfolded in the middle and late 1960s in England, the United States, and elsewhere, and those who admired the openness and spontaneity of that movement. Prosecutor  Vincent Bugliosi  wrote a best-selling book about the Manson ""family"" that explicated, among other things, the cult's fixation with identifying hidden messages within  The Beatles ; Bugliosi's book was entitled  Helter Skelter , the term Manson took from the album's  song of that name  and construed as the conflict he thought impending.   Cultural responses to the album persisted for decades, and even offer a glimpse into the process of collective  myth-making.  In October 1969, a Detroit radio program began to promote theories based on ""clues"" supposedly left on  The Beatles  and other Beatles albums that  Paul McCartney had died  and been replaced by a lookalike. The ensuing hunt for ""clues"" to a ""coverup"" The Beatles presumably wanted to suppress (and simultaneously publicise) became one of the classic examples of the  development and persistence of urban legends .     [ edit ]   Sales   The album was a major commercial success, spending a total of eight weeks at #1 in the UK (the first week being that of December 7, 1968), [ 32 ]  and nine weeks at #1 in the United States (the first week being that of December 28, 1968). [ 33 ]  Total US sales are estimated at over 9.5 million copies (19 million units). [ 34 ]     [ edit ]   Re-issues   Two re-issues in 1978 (one by  Capitol Records , the other by  Parlophone ) saw the album pressed on white vinyl, completing the look of the ""white"" album. In 1985, EMI Electrola released a DMM (direct metal mastered) white vinyl pressing of the album in Germany, which was imported to the United States in large numbers. Another popular white vinyl pressing was manufactured in France. The 1978 Parlophone white vinyl export pressing and the German DMM pressing are widely considered the best-sounding versions of the album. [ citation needed ]  This is due to the use of the famed Neumann lathe on the 1978 export pressing and the use of the DMM process on the 1985 pressing.   On January 7th, 1982, Mobile Fidelty Sound Lab released the album in a non-embossed unnumbered version of ""The White Album"" cover with the ORIGINAL MASTER RECORDING banner at the top. Neither the poster nor portraits were included. The labels to the discs are white with primarily black text and the Capitol dome logo at three o'clock. The MFSL discs were made with Super Vinyl, a heavy and hard compound that that provides an extraordinary quiet playing surface. Although MFSL leased the album from Capitol and used the company's sub-master, the discs still sound superior to the standard British and American pressings. The discs were stored in ""rice paper"" static-free, dust-free inner sleeves enclosed in an off-white gatefold reinforced stiff board that fit into the custom fabricated album jacket.   In 1998, a 30th anniversary reissue of the album was released on a two-disc compact disc version in the  United Kingdom . The packaging of this release is virtually identical to its vinyl counterpart. It has the same pure white gatefold cover, complete with the title "" The BEATLES "" in a slightly raised, embossed graphic at a slight angle. It also included the now-classic sequentially numbered serial number on the front of this cover, thus making this one a  real  limited edition. The interior of this cover features the song titles on the left-hand side, and the four black-and-white photos of the group members on the right. This version of the cover even accurately mimics the original British vinyl pressing from 1968, with the openings for the discs at the top rather than the sides. There are miniatures of the four full-colour glossy portrait photos included, as well as an exact replica of the poster with the photo collage on one side, and the album's complete song lyrics on the opposite side. The CDs are housed in black sleeves, which were also used for the original British album. This commemorative double CD album is housed in a clear plastic slipcase.     [ edit ]   Influences, parodies and tributes   The album's cover, though stark and minimalistic, has been highly influential. Goth Rock band  The Damned  released  The Black Album  in 1980, and is considered the first album to draw influence from the cover, as well as the first band to use the term ""Black Album"". The 1984  Rob Reiner  ""rockumentary""  This Is Spinal Tap  also pays homage with their own ""Black Album"", which is juxtaposed to the original by A&R staff Bobbi Fleckman, who notes in a debate about appropriate packaging material: ""What about the White album? There's was nothing on that Goddamned cover."" The band are generally less enthusiastic, referring to it variously as ""a black mirror"", ""none more black"" and ""death"". The  self-titled debut album  of  They Might Be Giants  is commonly referred to as ""The Pink Album"" due to the excessive amount of the color pink on the cover. Comedian  Dennis Miller  released a stand-up comedy recording in October of 1988 titled ""The Off-White Album"" which mimicked the design of ""The Beatles"". In the 1990s, both  Prince  and  Metallica  released self-titled albums with their names printed against mostly plain black covers, and are both informally referred to as ""The Black Album"". In 2003, rapper  Jay-Z  released an album officially called  The Black Album . DJ  Danger Mouse  produced the  mashup   The Grey Album  by combining vocals from Jay-Z's  Black Album  with samples from  The White Album . Two compilations of Beatles' material, released in 1973 as  19621966  and  19671970 , are often referred to as ""The Red Album"" and ""The Blue Album"" respectively, in reference to their colour scheme. All three of  Weezer 's self-titled albums borrow from this idea as well and fans refer to them respectively as "" The Blue Album "" (1994), "" The Green Album "" (2001), and "" The Red Album "" (2008).  311's   self-titled release from 1995  is often referred to as ""The Blue Album"", and  The Dells ' 1973 self-titled album is often known as ""The Brown Album"", as is  The Band 's  1969 self-titled album . Australian comedy duo  Martin/Molloy  also released a CD called  The Brown Album  in 1995, while American rock band  Primus  did  likewise  in 1997. The animated television series  The Simpsons  and  SpongeBob Squarepants  both used the title  The Yellow Album  for their spin-off CDs, with  the latter  also parodying the plain cover.

Also, the three songs containing animal names in their titles (""Blackbird"", ""Piggies"", and ""Rocky Raccoon"") are grouped together. ""Savoy Truffle"" contains a reference to ""Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,"" a previous song on the album. In addition, the four songs composed by George Harrison are distributed with one on each of the four sides.

During their career, the group primarily consisted of  John Lennon  (rhythm guitar, vocals),  Paul McCartney  (bass guitar, vocals),  George Harrison  (lead guitar, vocals) and  Ringo Starr  (drums, vocals). Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s  rock and roll  and  skiffle , the group worked with different musical  genres , ranging from  Tin Pan Alley  to  psychedelic rock . Their clothes, style and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon successful solo careers.   The Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the  history of popular music ,  selling over one billion records  internationally. [ 1 ]  In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different  singles ,  albums , and  EPs  that reached  number one , earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history. This commercial success was repeated in many other countries; their record company,  EMI , estimated that by 1985 they had sold over one billion records worldwide. [ 2 ]  According to the  Recording Industry Association of America , The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. [ 3 ]  In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [ 4 ]  According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008,  Billboard  magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles topped it.

[ 6 ]  Lennon met Paul McCartney on 6 July 1957; Lennon added him to the group a few days later. [ 7 ]  On 6 February 1958, George Harrison was invited to watch the group. [ 8 ]  Harrison joined the Quarrymen as  lead guitarist  after a rehearsal in March 1958. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Lennon and McCartney both played  rhythm guitar  during that period. After original Quarrymen drummer  Colin Hanton  left the band in 1959, the band had a high turnover of drummers. Lennon's friend  Stuart Sutcliffe  joined on  bass  in January 1960. [ 11 ] [ 12 ]   The Quarrymen went through a progression of names, including ""Johnny and the Moondogs"" and ""Long John and The Beatles"". Sutcliffe suggested the name ""The Beetles"" as a tribute to  Buddy Holly  and  The Crickets . The band changed their name to ""The Beatles"". The band's lack of a drummer posed a serious problem, for the group's unofficial manager,  Allan Williams , had arranged for them to perform in clubs on the  Reeperbahn  in  Hamburg ,  West Germany . [ 13 ]     Hamburg, Cavern Club and Brian Epstein   The group invited  Pete Best  to become their drummer on 12 August 1960. [ 14 ]  Four days after hiring Best, the group left for Hamburg. The Beatles began a 48-night residency in Hamburg at  Bruno Koschmider 's Indra Club, and moved to the  Kaiserkeller  in October 1960, although they then accepted an offer to play at the  Top Ten Club . [ 15 ]  Koschmider was furious that they had broken his contract, so on 21 November 1960 Harrison was deported for having lied to the German authorities about his age. [ 16 ]  McCartney and Best were arrested for arson a week later, after setting fire to a  condom , and subsequently deported. [ 17 ]  Lennon returned to Liverpool in mid-December while Sutcliffe stayed behind in Hamburg with his new German fiance  Astrid Kirchherr . The reunited group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 at the Casbah Club, with  Chas Newby  substituting for Sutcliffe. [ 18 ]          The Indra Club, where The Beatles first played on arriving in Hamburg, as it appeared in 2007.       The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961, performing at the  Top Ten Club . They were recruited by singer  Tony Sheridan  (who also had a residency at the club) to act as his  backing band  on a series of recordings for the German  Polydor Records  label, [ 19 ]  produced by famed bandleader  Bert Kaempfert . [ 20 ]  Kaempfert signed the group to its own Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961. On 31 October Polydor released the recording "" My Bonnie  (Mein Herz ist bei dir nur)"", which appeared on the German charts. [ 21 ]  A few copies were also pressed under the American  Decca Records  label. [ 22 ]  When the group returned to Liverpool, Sutcliffe stayed in Hamburg with Kirchherr. [ 23 ]  McCartney took over  bass  duties. [ 24 ]   The band returned to Liverpool, and on Tuesday, 21 February 1961, they made their first lunchtime appearance at  The Cavern Club . From 1961 to 1962 The Beatles made 292 appearances at the club, culminating in a final appearance there on 3 August 1963. [ 25 ]  On 9 November 1961,  Brian Epstein  saw The Beatles for the first time in the club. [ 26 ]  Epstein's version of the story was that a customer, Raymond Jones, walked into the NEMS shop and asked Epstein for the ""My Bonnie"" single the group had recorded with Sheridan. [ 27 ]   The Beatles signed a five-year contract with Brian Epstein on 24 January 1962. [ 26 ]  He then formed the management company NEMS Enterprises. Kaempfert agreed to release The Beatles from their Polydor contract. Decca Records  A&R  executive  Dick Rowe  turned Epstein down flat, informing him that ""guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein."" [ 28 ]  ( See  The Decca audition . ) While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he approached  EMI  marketing executive Ron White. [ 29 ]  White contacted EMI producers  Norrie Paramor , Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell; all of them declined to record The Beatles. White did not approach EMI's fourth staff producer   George Martin   who was on holiday at the time. [ 30 ]  The Beatles returned to Hamburg from 13 April to 31 May 1962, where they performed at the opening of The  Star Club . [ 31 ]  Upon their arrival, they were informed of Sutcliffe's death from a  brain haemorrhage . [ 32 ]     Record contract   Epstein went to the  HMV  store on  Oxford Street  in London to transfer the Decca tapes to discs. There, he was referred to Sid Coleman, who ran EMI's publishing arm. Epstein eventually met with Martin, who signed the group to EMI's  Parlophone  label on a one-year renewable contract. [ 33 ]   Martin had a problem with Pete Best. [ 34 ]  Martin privately suggested to Epstein that the band use another drummer in the studio. [ 35 ]  In addition, Epstein became exasperated with his refusal to adopt the distinctive hairstyle as part of the band's unified look. Best had also missed a number of engagements because of illness. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August 1962. [ 36 ]  They asked  Richard Starkey , known as Ringo Starr, to join the band; Starr was the drummer for  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , and had performed occasionally with The Beatles in Hamburg. [ 37 ]  Starr played on The Beatles' second EMI recording session on 4 September 1962, but Martin hired session drummer  Andy White  for their next session on 11 September. [ 38 ]  White's only released performances were recordings of "" Love Me Do "" and "" P.S. I Love You "", found on The Beatles'  first album .   The Beatles' first EMI session on 6 June 1962 did not yield any recordings considered worthy of release, but the September sessions produced a minor UK hit ""Love Me Do"", which peaked on the charts at number seventeen. [ 39 ]  ""Love Me Do"" would reach the top of the U.S. singles chart in May 1964.          The ""drop-T"" logo       On 26 November 1962 the band recorded their second single "" Please Please Me "", which reached number two on the official UK charts and number one on the  NME  chart. Three months later, they recorded their first album, also titled  Please Please Me . The band's first televised performance was on the  People and Places  programme, transmitted live from  Manchester  by  Granada Television  on 17 October 1962. [ 40 ]  As The Beatles' fame spread, the frenzied adulation of the group was dubbed "" Beatlemania "". In 1963, The Beatles' iconic logo (referred to as the ""drop-T"" logo) made its debut. [ 41 ] [ 42 ]     American releases   EMI's American operation,  Capitol Records , declined to issue the singles ""Please Please Me"" and "" From Me to You "". [ 43 ]   Vee-Jay Records  issued the singles. Art Roberts, music director of  WLS , placed ""Please Please Me"" into radio rotation in late February 1963. Vee-Jay's rights to The Beatles were later cancelled for non-payment of royalties. [ 44 ]   In August 1963,  Swan Records  released "" She Loves You "", which also failed to receive airplay. A testing of the song on  Dick Clark 's TV show  American Bandstand  produced laughter from American teenagers when they saw the group's  distinctive hairstyles . [ 45 ]  In early November 1963, Brian Epstein persuaded  Ed Sullivan  to present The Beatles on three editions of his show in February, and parlayed this guaranteed exposure into a record deal with Capitol Records. Capitol committed to a mid-January release of "" I Want to Hold Your Hand "". [ 46 ]  On 10 December 1963, a 5-minute story shot in England about the phenomenon of Beatlemania was shown on the  CBS Evening News . The segment first aired on the  CBS Morning News  on 22 November and had originally been scheduled to be repeated on that day's Evening News, but regular programming was cancelled following the assassination of  John F. Kennedy  that day. The segment inspired a teenage girl named Marsha Albert living in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland  to write to Carroll James, a disc jockey at Washington DC's  WWDC  radio station, requesting that he play records by The Beatles. Carroll James had seen the same news story and arranged through a friend to have a copy of The Beatles' new single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" sent over to him in  Washington DC . Immediately after debuting the record on December 17, the station received overwhelming positive audience reaction, with the station escalating airplay of the record. Made aware of the overwhelming listener response, Capitol Records president Alan Livingston decided a few days later to take advantage of the response and rush-release the already-prepared single three weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December 1963. [ 47 ]                         ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""                     Sample of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       Several New York radio stations began playing ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" on its release day. The positive response to the record that had started in Washington was duplicated in New York and quickly spread to other markets. The record sold one million copies in just ten days, and by 16 January 1964,  Cashbox  magazine had certified the record number one, in the edition datelined 23 January.   It was around this time that Brian Epstein was besieged by offers of merchandising and, completely underestimating this relatively new market within the pop industry, chose to effectively give it away.  Seltaeb  was a company set up in 1963 by Nicky Byrne exclusively to look after The Beatles  merchandising  rights on a 90 /10 basis in Byrnes favour. This quickly led to contractual disputes and lawsuits which was estimated to have eventually lost NEMS approximately $100 million in licensing fees. [ 48 ]     America   On 7 February 1964, The Beatles took off for their first trip to the United States as a group. [ 49 ]  They were accompanied by photographers, journalists (including  Maureen Cleave ), and  Phil Spector , who had booked himself on the same flight. [ 50 ]  When the group arrived at New York's newly renamed  John F. Kennedy Airport , they were greeted by a large crowd. The airport had never experienced such a crowd, estimated at about 3,000 fans. [ 51 ]          The Beatles as they arrive at  JFK Airport , New York City on 7 February 1964       After a  press conference , The Beatles were driven to New York City. On the way, McCartney turned on a radio and listened to a running commentary: ""[The Beatles] have just left the airport and are coming to New York City..."" [ 52 ]  After reaching the Plaza Hotel, they were besieged by fans and reporters. Harrison had a fever of 102 F (39 C) the next day and was ordered to stay in bed, so  Neil Aspinall  replaced him for the band's first rehearsal for their appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show . [ 53 ]   The Beatles made their first live American television appearance on  The Ed Sullivan Show  on 9 February 1964. Approximately 74 million viewers  about half of the American population  watched the group perform on the show. [ 54 ]  The next morning, many newspapers wrote that The Beatles were nothing more than a ""fad"", and ""could not carry a tune across the  Atlantic "". [ 55 ]  The band's first American concert appearance was at  Washington Coliseum  in Washington, D.C. on 11 February 1964. [ 56 ]   After The Beatles' success in 1964,  Vee-Jay Records  and  Swan Records  took advantage of their previously secured rights to the group's early recordings and reissued the songs; all the songs reached the top ten this time. (MGM and Atco also secured rights to The Beatles' early Tony Sheridan-era recordings and had minor hits with "" My Bonnie "" and "" Ain't She Sweet "", the latter featuring John Lennon on lead vocal.) In addition to  Introducing... The Beatles  (1964), Vee-Jay also issued an unusual  LP  called  The Beatles Vs The Four Seasons . This 2-LP set paired  Introducing... The Beatles  and  The Golden Hits Of The Four Seasons , another successful act that Vee-Jay had under contract, in a 'contest' (the back cover featured a 'score card'). Another unusual release was the  Hear The Beatles Tell All  album, which consisted of two lengthy interviews with Los Angeles radio disc jockeys (side one was titled ""Dave Hull interviews John Lennon"", while side two was titled ""Jim Steck interviews John, Paul, George, Ringo""). No Beatles music was included on this interview album, which turned out to be the only Vee-Jay Beatles album Capitol Records could not reclaim.   The Vee-Jay/Swan-issued recordings eventually ended up with Capitol, which issued most of the Vee-Jay material on the American-only Capitol release  The Early Beatles , with three songs left off this final US version of the album. (""I Saw Her Standing There"" was issued as the American B-side of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"", and also appeared on the Capitol Records album  Meet The Beatles . ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"" were issued as a Capitol ""Starline"" reissue single in 1964, and reappeared on Capitol's 1980 US version of the  Rarities  compilation album.) The early Vee-Jay and Swan Beatles records command a high price on the record collectors' market today, and all have been copiously bootlegged. [ 57 ]  The Swan tracks ""She Loves You"" and ""I'll Get You"" were issued on the Capitol LP  The Beatles' Second Album . Swan also issued the German-language version of ""She Loves You"", called ""Sie Liebt Dich"". This song later appeared (in stereo) on Capitol's  Rarities  album.   In mid-1964 the band undertook their first appearances outside of Europe and North America, touring Australia; Ringo Starr was suffering from tonsillitis and was temporarily replaced by session drummer  Jimmy Nicol . In  Adelaide , The Beatles were greeted by over 300,000 people at  Adelaide Town Hall . [ 58 ]  Ringo had rejoined by the time they arrived in New Zealand on 21 June 1964. [ 59 ]   On 6 June 1964,  A Hard Day's Night , the first movie starring The Beatles, was released in the United Kingdom. Directed by  Richard Lester , the film is a  mockumentary  of the four members as they make their way to a London television programme. The film, released at the height of Beatlemania, was well-received by critics, and remains one of the most influential  jukebox musicals . [ 60 ] [ 61 ]  That December the group released their fourth album,  Beatles for Sale .     Help! Elvis and Rubber Soul   In June 1965,  Queen Elizabeth II  appointed the four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire,  MBE . The band members were nominated by Prime Minister  Harold Wilson , who also was the  M.P.  for  Huyton ,  Liverpool . [ 62 ]  The appointment  at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders  sparked some conservative MBE recipients to return their insignia in protest. [ 63 ]  In July 1965, The Beatles's second feature film,  Help! , was released. The film was accompanied by the band's fifth British studio album  Help! , which also functioned as the soundtrack for the movie. On 15 August 1965, The Beatles performed the first major stadium concert in the history of rock 'n' roll at  Shea Stadium  in New York to a crowd of 55,600. [ 64 ]   On 27 August 1965, the group arrived at a  Bel Air  mansion to meet  Elvis Presley . [ 65 ]  Biographer  Peter Guralnick  maintains that Presley was at best ""lukewarm"" about playing host to people he did not really know. [ 65 ]  Paul McCartney later said: ""It was one of the great meetings of my life ... I only met him that once, and then I think the success of our career started to push him out a little, which we were very sad about, because we wanted to coexist with him."" [ 66 ]  Marty Lacker, a friend of Presley's, recalls the singer saying: ""'Quite frankly, if you guys are going to stare at me all night, I'm going to bed. I thought we'd talk a while and maybe jam a little.' And when he said that, they [The Beatles] went nuts."" [ 67 ]  The group told stories, joked and listened to records. The five of them had an impromptu jam session. [ 66 ]  ""They all went to the piano,"" says Lacker, ""and Elvis handed out a couple of guitars. And they started singing Elvis songs, Beatle songs,  Chuck Berry  songs. Elvis played Paul's bass part on "" I Feel Fine "", and Paul said something like, 'You're coming along quite promising on the bass there, Elvis.' I remember thinking later, 'Man, if we'd only had a tape recorder.'"" [ 67 ]   Their sixth album,  Rubber Soul , was released in early December 1965. It was hailed as a major leap forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. [ 68 ]     Backlash and controversy   In July 1966, when The Beatles toured the  Philippines , they unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady,  Imelda Marcos , who had expected the group to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. [ 69 ]  When presented with the invitation,  Brian Epstein  politely declined on behalf of the group, as it had never been the group's policy to accept such ""official"" invitations. [ 70 ]  The group soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to accepting ""no"" for an answer. After the snub was broadcast on Philippine television and radio, all of The Beatles' police protection disappeared. The group and their entourage had to make their way to  Manila  airport on their own. At the airport, road manager  Mal Evans  was beaten and kicked, and the band members were pushed and jostled about by a hostile crowd. [ 71 ]  Once the group boarded the plane, Epstein and Evans were ordered off, and Evans said, ""Tell my wife that I love her."" [ 72 ]  Epstein was forced to give back all the money that the band had earned while they were there before being allowed back on the plane. [ 73 ]   Almost as soon as they returned from the Philippines, an earlier comment by Lennon made in March that year launched a backlash against The Beatles from religious and social conservatives in the United States. In an interview with British reporter  Maureen Cleave , [ 74 ]  Lennon had offered his opinion that  Christianity  was dying and that The Beatles were ""more popular than  Jesus  now"". [ 75 ]  Afterwards, a radio station in  Birmingham, Alabama , ran a story on burning Beatles records, in what was considered to be a joke. However, many people affiliated with rural churches in the  American South  started taking the suggestion seriously. Towns across the United States and South Africa started to burn Beatles records in protest. Attempting to make light of the incident, Harrison said, ""They've got to buy them before they can burn them."" [ 76 ]  Under tremendous pressure from the American media, Lennon apologised for his remarks at a press conference in Chicago on 11 August 1966, the eve of the first performance of what turned out to be their final tour. [ 77 ]  In November, 2008, The Vatican publicly announced that it had forgiven John Lennon for his remarks, saying it was a ""boast"" by a young man grappling with sudden fame. [ 78 ]   The group's two-year series of Capitol compilations also took a strange twist in the United States when one of their publicity shots, used for a  Yesterday and Today  album and a poster promoting the UK release of ""Paperback Writer"", created an uproar, as it featured the band dressed in butchers' overalls, draped in meat and plastic dolls. A popular, though  apocryphal , rumour said that this was meant as a response to the way Capitol had ""butchered"" their albums. [ 79 ]  Thousands of copies of the album had a new cover pasted over. Years later, a commentator linked the cover shot with the group's interest in  German expressionism . [ 77 ]  Uncensored copies of  Yesterday and Today  command a high price today, with one copy selling for $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. [ 80 ]   Elvis Presley  apparently disapproved of The Beatles's anti-war activism and open use of drugs, later asking  President Richard Nixon  to ban all four members of the group from entering the United States.  Peter Guralnick  writes, ""The Beatles, Elvis said, [...] had been a focal point for  anti-Americanism . They had come to this country, made their money, then gone back to England where they fomented anti-American feeling."" [ 81 ]  Guralnick adds, ""Presley indicated that he is of the opinion that The Beatles laid the groundwork for many of the problems we are having with young people by their filthy unkempt appearances and suggestive music while entertaining in this country during the early and middle 1960s."" [ 82 ]  Despite Presley's remarks, Lennon still had some positive feelings towards him: ""Before Elvis, there was nothing."" [ 83 ]  McCartney later remarked that he ""felt a bit betrayed [by Presley's views] ... The great joke was that we were taking drugs, and look what happened to [Elvis]. ... It was sad, but I still love him. ..."" [ 84 ]   Bob Dylan  however, recognised The Beatles' contribution, stating: ""America should put up statues to The Beatles. They helped give this country's pride back to it."" [ 85 ]     Studio years                       ""Strawberry Fields Forever""                     Sample of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       During the recording sessions for  Revolver ,  tape looping  and early  sampling  were introduced in a complex mix of  ballad ,  R&B ,  soul , and  world music . The Beatles performed their last concert before paying fans at  Candlestick Park  in  San Francisco  on 29 August 1966. [ 77 ] [ 86 ]  From then on, The Beatles concentrated on recording. Less than seven months after recording  Revolver , The Beatles returned to  Abbey Road Studios  on 24 November 1966 to begin the 129-day recording sessions for their eighth album,  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band , released on 1 June 1967.   The band appeared in a segment within the first-ever worldwide television  satellite  hook-up, a show titled  Our World . The Beatles were transmitted live from Abbey Road Studios, and their new song "" All You Need Is Love "" was recorded live during the show, albeit to the accompaniment of a backing track they had spent five days recording and mixing in the studio prior to the broadcast. [ 87 ]   On 24 August 1967, The Beatles met the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  at the London  Hilton . A few days later they went to  Bangor , in North Wales, to attend a weekend 'initiation' conference. [ 88 ]  There, the Maharishi gave each of them a  mantra . [ 89 ] [ 86 ]  While in Bangor, The Beatles learned of the death of Brian Epstein at age 32 from an accidental prescription  drug overdose . At the end of 1967, they received their first major negative press in the UK with disparaging reviews of their surrealistic TV film  Magical Mystery Tour . [ 90 ]  Part of the criticism arose because colour was an integral part of the film, yet the film was shown on  Boxing Day  in black and white. The  Magical Mystery Tour  film soundtrack was released in the United Kingdom as a  double EP , and in the United States as a full LP (the LP is now the official version).   The group spent the early part of 1968 in  Rishikesh ,  Uttar Pradesh , India, studying  transcendental meditation  with the  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . [ 91 ]  Their time at the Maharishi's  ashram  was highly productive from a musical standpoint, as many of the songs that would later be recorded for their next two albums were composed there by Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison. [ 91 ]  Upon their return, Lennon and McCartney went to New York to announce the formation of  Apple Corps . [ 92 ]  The middle of 1968 saw the band busy recording the double album  The Beatles , popularly known as  The White Album  because of its plain white cover. These sessions saw deep divisions opening within the band, with Starr temporarily leaving the band. The band carried on, with McCartney taking over the drums on the tracks "" Martha My Dear "", "" Wild Honey Pie "", "" Dear Prudence "" and "" Back in the USSR "". Among the other causes of dissension were that Lennon's new girlfriend,  Yoko Ono , was at his side through almost all of the sessions, and that the others felt that McCartney was becoming too dominant. [ 93 ]  Internal divisions had been a small but growing problem in the band; most notably, this was reflected in the difficulty that Harrison experienced in getting his songs onto The Beatles albums.   On the business side, Lennon, Harrison and Starr wanted New York manager  Allen Klein  to manage The Beatles; however, McCartney wanted businessman  Lee Eastman  (the father of McCartney's then-girlfriend  Linda ). All past Beatles decisions had been unanimous, but this time the four could not agree. The other three members felt Eastman would put McCartney's interests before those of the group (during the  Anthology  interviews, McCartney said, ""Looking back, I can understand why they would feel that (Eastman) was biased for me and against them""). In 1971, it was discovered that Klein, who had been appointed manager, had stolen 5 million from The Beatles' holdings.     Let It Be  project and breakup       Main article:  The Beatles' breakup       In January 1969, The Beatles began a film project documenting the making of their next record, originally titled  Get Back . During the recording sessions, the band undertook their final live performance on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3  Savile Row , London, on 30 January 1969. Most of the performance was filmed and later included in the film  Let It Be . The project was temporarily shelved, and The Beatles recorded their final album,  Abbey Road , in the summer of 1969. The completion of the song "" I Want You (She's So Heavy) "" for the album on 20 August 1969 was the last time all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September 1969, but agreed that no announcement was to be publicly made until a number of legal matters were resolved. Their final new song was Harrison's "" I Me Mine "", recorded 3 January 1970 and released on the  Let It Be  album. It was recorded without Lennon, who was in Denmark at the time. [ 94 ]                         ""Get Back""                     Sample of ""Get Back"".                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       In March 1970, the  Get Back  session tapes were given to American producer  Phil Spector , who had produced Lennon's solo single "" Instant Karma! "". Spector's  Wall of Sound  production values went against the original intent of the record, which had been to record a stripped-down live performance. McCartney was deeply dissatisfied with Spector's treatment of "" The Long and Winding Road "" and unsuccessfully attempted to halt release of Spector's version of the song. McCartney publicly announced the break-up on 10 April 1970, a week before releasing his first solo album,  McCartney . Pre-release copies included a press release with a self-written interview explaining the end of The Beatles and his hopes for the future. [ 95 ]  On 8 May 1970 the Spector-produced version of  Get Back  was released as  Let It Be , followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles' partnership was not dissolved until 1975, [ 96 ]  though McCartney filed a suit for the dissolution on 31 December 1970, effectively ending the band's career together. [ 97 ]     Post-breakup          Apple Building at 3 Savile Row, site of the  Let It Be  rooftop concert       Shortly before and after the official dissolution of the group, all four Beatles released solo albums. Some of their albums featured contributions by other former Beatles; Starr's  Ringo  (1973) was the only one to include compositions and performances by all four, albeit on separate songs. Harrison showed his socio-political consciousness and earned respect for his contribution for arranging the  Concert For Bangladesh  in New York City in August 1971 along with sitar maestro  Ravi Shankar . Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974 (later bootlegged as  A Toot and a Snore in '74 ), Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.   In the wake of the expiration in 1975 of The Beatles' contract with EMI-Capitol, the American Capitol label, rushing to cash in on its vast Beatles holdings and freed from the group's creative control, released five LPs:  Rock 'n' Roll Music  (a compilation of their more uptempo numbers),  The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl  (containing portions of two unreleased shows at the Hollywood Bowl),  Love Songs  (a compilation of their slower numbers),  Rarities  (a compilation of tracks that either had never been released in the U.S. or had gone out of print), and  Reel Music  (a compilation of songs from their films). There was also a non-Capitol-EMI release entitled  Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 , which was a recording of a show from the group's early days at the Star Club in Hamburg captured on a poor-quality tape. Of all these post-breakup LPs, only the Hollywood Bowl LP had the approval of the group members. Upon the American release of the original British CDs in 1986, these post-breakup Capitol American compilation LPs were deleted from the Capitol catalogue.   John Lennon  was shot and killed  by  Mark David Chapman  on 8 December 1980 in New York City. In May 1981, George Harrison released "" All Those Years Ago ""; a single written about his time with The Beatles. It was recorded the month before Lennon's death, with Starr on drums, and was later overdubbed with new lyrics as a tribute to Lennon. Paul and  Linda McCartney  later contributed backing vocals to the track. [ 98 ]  In April 1982, Paul McCartney released his  Tug of War  album, containing his tribute song to John Lennon, titled ""Here Today"".   In 1988, The Beatles were  inducted  into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  during their first year of eligibility. [ 99 ]  On the night of their induction, Harrison and Starr appeared to accept their award along with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono and his two sons. McCartney stayed away, issuing a press release citing ""unresolved difficulties"" with Harrison, Starr and Lennon's estate.     Reunion and  Anthology   In February 1994, the three surviving Beatles reunited to produce and record additional music for a few of Lennon's home recordings. "" Free as a Bird "" premiered as part of  The Beatles Anthology  series of television documentaries and was released as a  single  in December 1995, with "" Real Love "" following in March 1996. These songs were also included in the three  Anthology  collections of CDs released in 1995 and 1996, each of which consisted of two CDs of never-before-released Beatles material.  Klaus Voormann , who had known The Beatles since their Hamburg days and had previously illustrated the  Revolver  album cover, directed the  Anthology  cover concept. 450,000 copies of  Anthology 1  were sold on its first day of release. In 2000, the compilation album  1  was released, containing almost every number-one single released by the band from 1962 to 1970. The collection sold 3.6 million copies in its first week (selling 3 copies a second) and more than 12 million in three weeks worldwide. The collection also reached number one in the United States and 33 other countries, and had sold 25 million copies by 2005 (about the ninth best selling album of all time).     Recent projects and developments   In the late 1990s, George Harrison was diagnosed with  lung cancer . He succumbed to the disease on 29 November 2001. [ 100 ]   George Martin and his son  Giles Martin  remixed original Beatles recordings to create a soundtrack to accompany  Cirque du Soleil 's theatrical production  Love . The soundtrack album  Love  was released in 2006. In 2007, McCartney and Starr reunited for an interview on  Larry King Live  to discuss their thoughts on the show. Beatles widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison also appeared with McCartney and Starr in Las Vegas for the one-year anniversary of  Love .   Also in 2007, reports circulated [ 101 ]  that McCartney was hoping to complete "" Now and Then "", the third Lennon track the band worked on during the  Anthology  sessions. It would be credited as a ""Lennon/McCartney composition"" by writing new verses, and reworked by laying down a new drum track recorded by Starr and utilising archival recordings of Harrison's guitar work.   Lawyers for The Beatles sued on 21 March 2008 to prevent the distribution of unreleased recordings purportedly made during  Ringo Starr 's first performance with the group in 1962. The dispute between  Apple Corps Ltd.  and Fuego Entertainment Inc. of  Miami Lakes  stems from recordings apparently made during a performance at the  Star Club  in  Hamburg , Germany. [ 102 ]   In November 2008, McCartney revealed the existence of a 14-minute experimental recording The Beatles made called "" Carnival of Light ."" which he would like to see released but would require approval from Ringo Starr and Beatle widows Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison. [ 103 ]   On January 14 2009 Paul McCartney announced on the Howard Stern Show on Sirius Radio that there will be a Beatles music game created by Harmonix Music Systems, Inc.     Musical evolution     See also:  The Beatles' influence on music recording     The Beatles' constant demands to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with George Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers such as  Norman Smith ,  Ken Townsend  and  Geoff Emerick , all played significant parts in the innovative sounds of the albums  Rubber Soul  (1965),  Revolver  (1966) and  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  (1967).   The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries. Other contemporary influences included  the Byrds  and  the Beach Boys , whose album  Pet Sounds  was a favourite of McCartney's. [ 104 ]  Beatles producer  George Martin  stated that ""Without  Pet Sounds ,  Sgt. Pepper  wouldn't have happened...  Pepper  was an attempt to equal  Pet Sounds ."" [ 105 ]  After  Sgt. Pepper  was released, Beach Boys' leader  Brian Wilson  was so despondent that he went to bed for months. [ 106 ]  Lennon also named  Elvis Presley  as a spark that interested him in music:       It was  Elvis  who really got me buying records. I thought that early stuff of his was great. The  Bill Haley  era passed me by, in a way. When his records came on the wireless, my mother used to hear them, but they didnt do anything for me. It was Elvis who got me hooked on beat music. When I heard ' Heartbreak Hotel ', I thought this is it and I started to grow sideboards and all that gear...."" [ 107 ]       Along with studio tricks such as  sound effects , unconventional microphone placements,  tape loops ,  double tracking  and  vari-speed  recording, The Beatles began to augment their recordings with instruments that were unconventional for rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the  sitar  in ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" and the  swarmandel  in "" Strawberry Fields Forever "". [ 108 ]  They also used early electronic instruments such as the  Mellotron , with which McCartney supplied the  flute  voices on the intro to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", [ 109 ]  and the  clavioline , an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on "" Baby You're a Rich Man "". [ 110 ]   Beginning with the use of a string quartet (arranged by George Martin with input from McCartney) on "" Yesterday "" in 1965, The Beatles pioneered a modern form of  art song , exemplified by the double-quartet string arrangement on "" Eleanor Rigby "" (1966), "" Here, There and Everywhere "" (1966) and "" She's Leaving Home "" (1967). A televised performance of  Bach's   Brandenburg Concerto No. 2  directly inspired McCartney's idea to include a  piccolo trumpet  on the arrangement of "" Penny Lane "". [ 111 ]  The Beatles moved towards  psychedelia  with "" Rain "" and "" Tomorrow Never Knows "" from 1966, and "" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds "", "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" I Am the Walrus "" from 1967.     Films       Main article:  The Beatles in film       The Beatles appeared in five  motion pictures , all of which featured associated  soundtrack albums . The band played themselves in two films directed by  Richard Lester ,  A Hard Day's Night  (1964) and  Help!  (1965). The group produced, directed, and starred in the hour-long  television movie   Magical Mystery Tour  (1967). The psychedelic  animated film   Yellow Submarine  (1968) followed the adventures of a cartoon version of the band; the members did not provide their own voices, appearing only in a brief live-action epilogue. Their final film, the documentary  Let It Be , released in 1970, followed the rehearsals and recording sessions for the early 1969  Get Back  project and won the  Academy Award  in 1971 for Best Original Song Score.   During 1965-1969, The Beatles were the subject of their own  Saturday morning cartoon series , which loosely continued the kind of slapstick antics of  A Hard Day's Night . Two Beatles songs were played in each half-hour show, with The Beatles' cartoon counterparts ""lip-synching"" the actual Beatles recordings. Some of the song performances, such as those from  A Hard Day's Night , appeared to have been  rotoscoped . The regular speaking voices of the characters were not supplied by The Beatles themselves, but rather by voice artists  Paul Frees  and  Lance Percival . [ 112 ]     Legacy       Main article:  The Beatles' influence on popular culture         Radio   The arrival of The Beatles is seen in radio as a touchstone in music signalling an end to the rock-and-roll era of the 1950s. Program Directors like  Rick Sklar  of  WABC  in New York went as far as forbidding DJs from playing any ""pre-Beatles"" music. [ 113 ]     Recreational drug use   In Hamburg, The Beatles used ""prellies"" ( Preludin ) both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. [ 114 ]  McCartney would usually take one, but Lennon would often take four or five. [ 114 ]   Bob Dylan  introduced them to  cannabis  during a 1964 visit to New York. [ 115 ]  McCartney remembered them all getting ""very high"" and giggling. [ 116 ]  The Beatles occasionally smoked a  joint  in the car on the way to the studio during the filming of  Help! , which often made them forget their lines. [ 117 ]   In April 1965, Lennon and Harrison were introduced to  LSD  by an acquaintance, dentist John Riley, who slipped some into their  coffees . [ 118 ]  McCartney was more reluctant to try the drug, but finally did so in 1966 and was the first Beatle to talk about it in the press, saying in June 1967 that he took it four times.   The Beatles added their names to an  advertisement  in  The Times , on 24 July 1967, which asked for the legalisation of cannabis, the release of all prisoners imprisoned because of possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses. The advertisement was sponsored by a group called Soma, and was signed by 65 people, including  Brian Epstein ,  Graham Greene ,  R.D. Laing , 15 doctors, and two  MPs . [ 119 ]     Discography       Main article:  The Beatles discography       Further information:  List of Beatles songs ,  List of The Beatles' record sales , and  The Beatles bootlegs     Song catalogue       Main article:  Northern Songs       In 1963 Lennon and McCartney agreed to assign their song publishing rights to  Northern Songs , a company created by music publisher  Dick James . [ 120 ]  The company was administered by James' own company  Dick James Music . Northern Songs went public in 1965, with Lennon and McCartney each holding 15% of the company's shares Dick James and the company's chairman, Charles Silver, held a controlling 37.5%. In 1969, following a failed attempt by Lennon and McCartney to buy the company, James and Silver sold Northern Songs to British TV company  Associated TeleVision  (ATV), from which Lennon and McCartney received stock.   In 1985, after a short period in which the parent company was owned by Australian business magnate  Robert Holmes  Court ,  ATV Music  was sold to  Michael Jackson  for a reported $47 million [ 121 ]  (trumping a joint bid by McCartney and  Yoko Ono ), including the  publishing rights  to over 200 songs composed by Lennon and McCartney.   A decade later Jackson and  Sony  merged its music publishing businesses. [ 121 ]  Since 1995, Jackson and  Sony/ATV Music Publishing  have jointly owned most of the Lennon-McCartney songs recorded by The Beatles. Meanwhile, Lennon's estate and McCartney still receive their respective songwriter shares of the royalties. (Despite his ownership of most of the Lennon-McCartney publishing, Jackson has only recorded one Lennon-McCartney composition himself, "" Come Together "" which was featured in his film  Moonwalker  and  HIStory  album)   Although the Jackson-Sony catalogue includes most of The Beatles' greatest hits, four of their earliest songs had been published by one of  EMI 's publishing companies prior to Lennon and McCartney signing with Dick James  and McCartney later succeeded in personally acquiring the publishing rights to "" Love Me Do "", "" Please Please Me "", "" P.S. I Love You "" and "" Ask Me Why "" from EMI.   Harrison and Starr did not renew their songwriting contracts with Northern Songs in 1968, signing with  Apple Publishing  instead. Harrison later created  Harrisongs , which still owns the rights to his post-1967 songs such as "" While My Guitar Gently Weeps "" and "" Something "". Starr also created his own company, called  Startling Music . It holds the rights to his two post-1967 songs recorded by The Beatles, "" Don't Pass Me By "" and "" Octopus's Garden "".   The Beatles are one of the few major artists who have not released their recorded catalogue through online music services (for example,  iTunes  and  Napster ).  Apple Corp's dispute with Apple, Inc.  (the owners of iTunes) over the use of the name ""Apple"" has played a particular part in this. An uneasy truce between the two companies broke when Apple Computers opened the  iTunes Store , after which Apple Corp sued Apple, Inc. This was resolved in February 2007, with Apple Computer owning the Apple name but licensing it back to Apple Records. Following the resolution, several solo albums by Lennon and McCartney were released to the iTunes Music Store. As of November 2007, all of the band members' solo catalogues have been released on iTunes.   On October 30, 2008, it was announced that  Harmonix Music Systems ,  MTV , and  Apple Corps  are collaborating on an exclusive  Beatles music video game  that makes use of The Beatles' catalogue.

Apple Corps decided to standardise The Beatles catalogue throughout the world. They chose to release the twelve original studio albums as released in the United Kingdom, as well as the  Magical Mystery Tour  U.S. album, which had been released as a shorter Double EP in the UK. All of the remaining Beatles material from the singles and EPs from 19621970 which had not been issued on the original British studio albums were gathered on the  Past Masters  double album compilation:     Past Masters, Volume One  (1988)   Past Masters, Volume Two  (1988)     The U.S. album configurations from 1964-65 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 ( The Capitol Albums   Volume 1  and  Volume 2  respectively); these included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of their original 1960s releases in the United States.     2009 CD remasters   All albums by the Beatles (including  Past Masters, Volume One  and  Past Masters, Volume Two ) will be released newly remastered sometime in 2009 on CD. [ 123 ] [ 124 ]  The 2009 remasters will replace the infamously poor quality 1987 remasters. [ 123 ] [ 124 ]  Mojo Magazine's Mat Snow was invited to hear 10 remastered tracks from 1968's  The White Album  and stated that they were ""Better even than we'd hoped.""

It was subsequently performed live, with elaborate theatrical effects, and made into  a film .   Following in the footsteps of their previous albums,  The Wall  is a  concept album   specifically, it deals largely with the theme of  isolation  from one's peers. The concept was largely inspired by the band's  1977  tour promoting the album  Animals , with regards to an incident where  Roger Waters ' frustration with the audience reached a point where Waters spat in the face of a fan who was attempting to climb on stage; this, in turn, led him to lament that such a wall exists. With its significantly darker theme,  The Wall  featured a notably harsher and more theatrical sound than their previous releases.   The Wall  is a  rock opera  that centres on the character ""Pink"". Largely based on Waters' personal life, Pink struggles in life from an early age, having lost his father in war ("" Another Brick in the Wall  (Part 1)""), abused by teachers ("" The Happiest Days of Our Lives ""), nurtured by an overprotective mother ("" Mother ""), and deserted by his wife later on ("" Don't Leave Me Now "")  all of which factored into Pink's mental isolation from society, figuratively referred to as ""The Wall"".   In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine listed  The Wall  as #87 in  Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time .

There are two different accounts of what happened at the show in  Montreal, Canada  that inspired Waters to write ""The Wall"". The first is from The Wall Live booklet where Waters states that a fan was trying to climb the netting between the audience and the band. The second is from Nick Mason's book ""Inside Out"". He states that a fan was yelling at Roger for them to play ""Careful with that Axe, Eugene"". In the end of both accounts Waters spits in the face of the fan.  [ 1 ]  The album was recorded at four studios over eight months, owing to English tax laws and to benefit from the cheaper recording costs in the South of France. Tensions between Waters and the band were increasing significantly, largely due to his dominance over the rest of the band. During the recording, Waters dismissed  Richard Wright , and told him to leave immediately after  The Wall  was finished, arguing that Wright was not contributing much, in part owing to a  cocaine  addiction. [ citation needed ]  Waters claimed that  David Gilmour  and  Nick Mason  had supported his decision to fire Wright, but in 2000, Gilmour stated that he and Mason were against Wright's dismissal. [ citation needed ]  In his book  Inside Out ,  Nick Mason  claims that Wright was fired because Columbia Records had offered Waters a substantial bonus to finish the album in time for a 1979 release. Since Wright refused to return early from his summer holiday, Waters wanted to dismiss Wright. [ 2 ]  However, he returned for their live performances as a paid musician.   For "" Another Brick in the Wall  (Part II)"", Pink Floyd needed to record a school  choir , so they approached music teacher Alun Renshaw of  Islington Green School , around the corner from their  Britannia Row Studios . The chorus was  overdubbed  twelve times to give the impression that the choir was larger. The choir were not allowed to hear the rest of the song after singing the chorus. Though the school received a lump sum payment of   1000, there was no contractual arrangement for royalties. Under 1996  UK  copyright law, they became eligible, and after choir members were tracked down by royalties agent Peter Rowan of  RBL Music , through the website  Friends Reunited , they claimed the money. [ 3 ]  Music industry professionals estimated that each student would be owed around 500. [ 4 ]   Originally released on  Columbia Records  in the U.S. and  Harvest Records  in the UK,  The Wall  was then re-released as a  digitally remastered   CD  in 1994 in the UK on  EMI . In 1997, Columbia Records issued an updated remaster in the United States, Canada, Australia, South America and Japan. For  The Wall' s 20th Anniversary in April 2000,  Capitol Records  in the U.S. and EMI in Canada, Australia, South America and Japan re-released the 1997 remaster with the artwork from the EMI Europe remaster.  The Wall  was the first Pink Floyd album since 1967's  The Piper at the Gates of Dawn  whose cover was not done by  Storm Thorgerson  and  Hipgnosis . Instead,  Gerald Scarfe  designed the cover and gatefold sleeve. David Gilmour recalls Storm Thorgerson falling out with Roger Waters over issues such as the credit for the  Animals  sleeve design. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Concept and storyline                       ""Isn't this where...we came in?""                     The last second of  Outside the Wall  and the first second of  In the Flesh?                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       The album's overriding themes are the causes and implications of self-imposed isolation, symbolized by the metaphorical  wall  of the title. The album's songs create a very loose storyline sketching events in the life of the protagonist, Pink. Pink loses his father as a child (Waters's own father was killed in  Anzio  during  World War II ), is smothered by his overprotective mother, and is oppressed at school by tyrannical, abusive teachers, each of these traumas becoming ""another brick in the wall"". As an adult Pink becomes a rock star, but his relationships are marred by infidelity and outbursts of violence. As his marriage crumbles, Pink finishes building the wall and completes his isolation from human contact.   Pink's mindset deteriorates behind his freshly completed wall, with his personal crisis culminating during an onstage performance. Hallucinating, Pink believes that he is a fascist dictator, and his concerts are like  Neo-Nazi  rallies where he sets his men on fans he considers unworthy, only to have his conscience rebel at this and put himself on trial, his inner judge ordering him to ""tear down the wall"" in order to open himself to the outside world, and apologizing to his closest friends who are hurt most by his self-isolation. At this point the album's end runs into its beginning with the closing words ""Isn't this where...""; the first song on the album, "" In the Flesh? "", begins with the words ""...we came in?""  with a continuation of the melody of the last song, "" Outside the Wall ""  hinting at the cyclical nature of Waters's theme.   The LP's sleeve art and custom picture labels by  Gerald Scarfe  tied in with the album's concept. Side one had a quarter of the wall erected and a sketch of the teacher. Side two saw half of the wall erected and a sketch of the wife. Side three had three-quarters of the wall erected and a sketch of the character of Pink, while side four had the wall completely erected and a sketch of the prosecutor. Bob Ezrin played a major part in taking Waters's demo material and clarifying the storyline by writing a script, which even called for additional songs to complete the plot. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Film version       Main article:  Pink Floyd The Wall (film)       A film version of  The Wall  was released in 1982 entitled  Pink Floyd The Wall , directed by  Alan Parker  and starring  Bob Geldof . The screenplay was written by Roger Waters. The film features music from the original album, much of which was re-recorded by the band with additional orchestration, some with minor lyrical and musical changes.   Originally the film was intended to be intercut with concert footage and a few of the live shows were actually filmed, but subsequently not used in the film at all. Footage from these concerts has appeared on different websites from time to time and on  YouTube . However, an official release of this footage by Pink Floyd has not been authorized other than what was used in the documentary  Behind the Wall .     [ edit ]   Reception   Immensely successful upon release,  The Wall  quickly jumped to #1 on the  Billboard 200  in the U.S in its fourth week (it debuted at #53) and #3 in the  U.K. . Its worldwide sales are estimated at 15 million copies (30 million units), and in the U.S. it has achieved 23 times platinum (for sales of 11.5 million double-disc sets [ 6 ] ; statistics mistakenly identifying  The Wall  as the best selling multiple-disc album of all-time in the U.S. and third best-selling album by any artist in the U.S. do not take into account that double albums count as two platinum sales), and is their second best-selling album in the U.S. after  The Dark Side of the Moon . It was among the most popular albums of the early 1980s, to the extent that film director  Alan Parker  created  a film based on it . The album had a string of hit singles, with "" Another Brick in the Wall Part 2 "" being their only song to hit #1 on the Billboard.   In addition to its commercial success, critical reception of  The Wall  was, and remains, mostly positive.  Carlo Twist  of  Blender  gave it 5 stars out of a possible 5, stating that, ""For all its pomp and lofty ambition, theres a streak of almost punk-rock venom within, not to mention some of the bands best humping, thumping heavy rock."" [ 7 ]   Stephen Thomas Erlewine  of  AllMusic Guide  was slightly more critical, but nevertheless said that, ""its seamless surface, blending melodic fragments and sound effects, makes the musical shortcomings and questionable lyrics easy to ignore."" [ 8 ]   Kurt Loder  of  Rolling Stone  remarked, "" The Wall  is the most startling rhetorical achievement in the group's singular, thirteen-year career."" [ 9 ]  That same magazine later ranked  The Wall  at #87 on its list of  The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time . [ 10 ]   The Wall  would also be included in the book  1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die .     [ edit ]   Post-split   After Waters left Pink Floyd in 1985, a legal battle ensued over the rights to the name ""Pink Floyd"" and its material. In the end, Waters retained the right to use  The Wall , and its material and imagery (save for three songs which Gilmour co-wrote: "" Young Lust "", "" Comfortably Numb "" and "" Run Like Hell ""), as his name has been most closely associated with the album. This meant that the three remaining members' 19871990 and 1994 tours under the name Pink Floyd required payments to Waters. [ citation needed ]   Waters staged a  concert performance  of  The Wall  at  Potsdamer Platz  in  Berlin  on 21 July 1990 both to commemorate the fall of the  Berlin Wall  and as a fundraising effort for the World War Memorial Fund for Disaster Relief. This performance featured guest artists including  Bryan Adams ,  Cyndi Lauper  and  Van Morrison . This performance also differed from previous shows in that some songs from the original album and Pink Floyd concert version were omitted, others were slightly modified, and one Waters solo song, "" The Tide Is Turning "" was substituted for ""Outside The Wall"" as the concluding song.

Young's work is characterized by deeply personal lyrics, distinctive guitar work, and signature nasal   tenor (and frequently   alto) singing voice. Although he accompanies himself on several different instruments—including  piano  and  harmonica —his style of   hammer-on   acoustic guitar and often idiosyncratic soloing on electric guitar are the linchpins of a sometimes ragged, sometimes polished sound. Although Young has experimented widely with differing music styles, including   swing,  jazz ,   rockabilly,   blues, and   electronica throughout a varied career, his best known work usually falls into either of two distinct styles:   folk-esque   acoustic   rock (as heard in songs such as ""  Heart of Gold"" (  sample  ), ""Harvest Moon"" and ""  Old Man"") and   electric-charged   hard rock (in songs like ""  Cinnamon Girl"", ""  Rockin' in the Free World"" and ""  Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)""). In more recent years, Young has started to adopt elements from newer styles of music, such as   industrial,   alternative country and   grunge, the latter of which was profoundly influenced by his own style of playing, often bringing him the title of ""the   godfather of   grunge"". Young has directed (or co-directed) a number of  films  using the   pseudonym Bernard Shakey, including  Journey Through the Past  (1973),  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979),   Human Highway  (1982), and   Greendale  (2003). He is also an outspoken advocate for environmental issues and small farmers, having co-founded the   benefit concert   Farm Aid, and in 1986 helped found The Bridge School, and its annual supporting   Bridge School Benefit concerts, together with his wife Pegi. Young remains a Canadian citizen and has never wanted to relinquish his Canadian citizenship, even though he has lived in the U.S. for ""so long"" and has stated, about U.S. elections, that he has ""got just as much right to vote in them as anybody else."" Biography         Early years         Neil Young was born in Toronto to sportswriter and novelist   Scott Young and   Rassy Ragland, who had moved to Toronto from their family home of   Manitoba to pursue a sport journalism career. Neil spent his early years in the small country town of   Omemee, in southern   Ontario (130 km northeast of  Toronto ). He was diagnosed with diabetes as a child and a bout of  polio  at the age of 6 left him with a weakened left side; he still walks with a slight limp. Winnipeg bands         His parents divorced when Young was 12, and he moved with his mother back to the family home of   Winnipeg,   Manitoba, where his music career began. When Neil Young arrived in Winnipeg from Ontario, he already knew what it was like to be uprooted, since his family had gone wherever his father's career in journalism had taken him. But after the break-up of his parents' marriage, Neil and his mother Rassy settled into the working class suburb of   Fort Rouge where the shy, dry-humoured youth enrolled at Earl Grey Junior High School. It was there that he met Ken Koblun, later to join him in The Squires, and there that he formed his first band   the Jades. While attending   Kelvin High School in Winnipeg, he played in several instrumental rock bands. Young's first stable band was called the Squires, and they had a local hit called ""The Sultan."" Young dropped out of high school and also played in   Fort William, where they recorded a series of demos produced by a local producer named Ray Dee, whom Young called, ""...the original Briggs."" While in Thunder Bay, Young first encountered   Stephen Stills. In the   2006 film  Heart of Gold  Young relates how he used to spend time as a teenager at   Falcon Lake, Manitoba where he would endlessly plug coins into the jukebox to hear   Ian Tyson's ""  Four Strong Winds."" After leaving the Squires, Neil worked folk clubs in Winnipeg, where he first met   Joni Mitchell. Here he wrote some of his earliest and most enduring folk songs such as the classic ""Sugar Mountain"" about his lost youth. Mitchell wrote ""The Circle Game"" in response. In 1965 Young toured Canada as a solo artist and composing music for commercial advertisements. In 1966, he joined   Rick James-fronted   Mynah Birds. The band managed to secure a record deal with the   Motown label. Unfortunately, as their first album was being recorded James was arrested for being   AWOL from the army. After the Mynah Birds disbanded, Young and bass player   Bruce Palmer relocated to  Los Angeles . Young has admitted in an interview that he was in the United States illegally until receiving a green card in 1970. Buffalo Springfield         Once they reached Los Angeles, Young and Palmer met up with   Stephen Stills,   Richie Furay, and Dewey Martin to form   Buffalo Springfield. A mixture of folk, country,   psychedelia, and rock lent a hard edge by the twin lead guitars of Stills and Young made Buffalo Springfield a critical success, and their first record   Buffalo Springfield  (1967) sold well after Stills' topical song ""  For What It's Worth"" became a hit - aided by Young's melodic harmonics played on electric guitar. Distrust of their management and the arrest and deportation of Palmer exacerbated already strained relations among group members and led to Buffalo Springfield's demise. A second album,   Buffalo Springfield Again , was released in late 1967, but two of Young’s three contributions were actually solo tracks recorded apart from the rest of the group. In many ways, these three songs on  Buffalo Springfield Again  are harbingers of much of Young's later work in that, although they all share deeply personal, almost idiosyncratic lyrics, they also present three very different musical approaches to the arrangement of what is essentially an original folk song. ""Mr Soul,"" the only Young song of the three that all five members of the group perform together. In contrast, ""  Broken Arrow"" was confessional folk rock of a kind that would characterize much of the music that emerged from the singer-songwriter movement. Young’s experimental production intersperses each verse with snippets of sound from other sources, including opening the song with a sound bite of Dewey Martin singing ""Mr. Soul"" and closing it with the thumping of a heartbeat. ""Expecting to Fly"" was a lushly produced   ballad featuring a string arrangement that Young's co-producer for the track,   Jack Nitzsche, would dub ""symphonic pop."" In May 1968, the band split up for good, but in order to fulfill a contractual obligation, a final album,   Last Time Around , was recorded, primarily from recordings made earlier that year. Young contributed the songs ""On the Way Home"" and ""I Am a Child"", singing lead on the latter. Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young and solo success         After the breakup of Buffalo Springfield, Young signed a solo deal with   Reprise Records, home of his colleague and friend   Joni Mitchell, with whom he shared a manager, Elliot Roberts. Young and Nitzsche immediately began work on Young's first solo record,   Neil Young  (November 1968), which received mixed reviews. In a 1970 interview, Young deprecated the album as being ""overdubbed rather than played,"" and the quest for music that expresses the spontaneity of the moment has long been a feature of his career. Nevertheless, the album contains some tunes that remain a staple of his live shows, most notably ""The Loner."" For his next album, Young recruited three musicians from a band called The Rockets:   Danny Whitten on guitar,   Billy Talbot on bass guitar, and   Ralph Molina on   drums. These three took the name Crazy Horse (after the historical figure of the   same name), and   Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere  (May 1969), is credited to ""Neil Young with Crazy Horse."" Recorded in just two weeks, the album opens with one of Young's most familiar songs, ""Cinnamon Girl,"" and is dominated by two more, ""Cowgirl in the Sand"" and ""Down by the River,"" that feature lengthy jams showcasing Young's idiosyncratic guitar soloing accompanied sympathetically by Crazy Horse. Young reportedly wrote all three songs on the same day, while nursing a high fever of 103 °F (39.5 °C) in bed. Shortly after the release of  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere , Young reunited with Stephen Stills by joining   Crosby, Stills, & Nash, who had already released one album as a trio. Young was originally offered a position as a sideman, but agreed to join only if he received full membership, and the group was renamed Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. The quartet debuted in  Chicago  on   August 16,  1969 , and later performed at the famous   Woodstock Festival, during which Young skipped the acoustic set and refused to be filmed during the electric set, even telling the cameramen: ""One of you fuckin' guys comes near me and I'm gonna hit you with my guitar"". During the making of their first album,   Déjà Vu , the musicians frequently argued, particularly Young and Stills, who both fought for control. ""  Ohio"" was written following the   Kent State massacre on   May 4,   1970, and was a staple of anti-war rallies in the 1970s. The song was quickly recorded by CSNY and immediately released as a single, even though CSNY's ""Teach Your Children"" was still climbing the singles charts. Many believe that the release ""Ohio"" as a single cut into the sales of ""Teach Your Children"" and prevented that song from reaching the top ten. In the late 1970s and for much of the 1980s, Young refrained from performing ""Ohio"" live, as he considered the song to be dated. In the wake of the 1989  Tiananmen Square massacre , however, Young revived the song in concert, often dedicating it to the  Chinese  students who were killed in the massacre. Interestingly, Crosby, Stills & Nash, as a trio, also returned the song to their live repertoire around the same time, even though Young had provided the lead vocals on the original recording. Also that year, Young released his third solo album,   After the Gold Rush  (1970), which featured, among others, a young   Nils Lofgren,   Stephen Stills, and CSNY bassist Greg Reeves. Young also recorded some tracks with Crazy Horse, but dismissed them early in the sessions. Aided by his newfound fame with CSNY, the album was a commercial breakthrough for Young and contains some of his best known work. Notable tracks include the title track, with dream-like lyrics that run a gamut of subjects from drugs and interpersonal relationships to environmental concerns, as well as Young’s controversial and acerbic condemnation of   racism in ""  Southern Man,"" which, along with a later song entitled ""Alabama,"" later prompted   Lynyrd Skynyrd to decry Young by name in the lyrics to ""  Sweet Home Alabama."" With CSNY splitting up and Crazy Horse having signed their own record deal, Young began the year 1971 with a solo tour entitled ""Journey Through the Past."" Later, he recruited a new group of country-music session musicians, whom he christened   The Stray Gators, to record much of the new material that had been premiered on tour for the album   Harvest  (1972).  Harvest  was a massive hit (especially with the country-music crowd) and ""Heart of Gold"" became a US number one single. Another notable song was ""  The Needle and the Damage Done,"" a lament for talented artists who died because of heroin addiction; inspired in part by the heroin use of Crazy Horse member Danny Whitten, who would eventually die of an overdose. The album's success, however, caught Young off guard, and his first instinct was to back away from stardom. In the handwritten liner notes to the   Decade  compilation, Young described 'Heart of Gold' as the song that ""put me in the middle of the road. Travelling there soon became a bore, so I headed for the ditch. A rougher ride but I saw more interesting people there."" On   September 8,  1972 , the Academy Award-nominated actress   Carrie Snodgress, with whom he had been living, gave birth to Neil Young's first child. The boy, Zeke, was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy. The Ditch Trilogy         Although a new tour had been planned to follow up on the success of  Harvest , it became apparent during rehearsals that Danny Whitten could not function due to   drug abuse. On   November 18, 1972, shortly after he was fired from the tour preparations, Whitten was found dead of an   overdose. Young described the incident to   Rolling Stone ’s   Cameron Crowe in 1975, ""[We] were rehearsing with him and he just couldn't cut it. He couldn't remember anything. He was too out of it. Too far gone. I had to tell him to go back to L.A. 'It's not happening, man. You're not together enough.' He just said, 'I've got nowhere else to go, man. How am I gonna tell my friends?' And he split. That night the coroner called me from L.A. and told me he'd ODed. That blew my mind. blew my mind. I loved Danny. I felt responsible. And from there, I had to go right out on this huge tour of huge arenas. I was very nervous and . . . insecure."" The album made in the aftermath of this incident,   Time Fades Away  (1973), has often been described by Young as ""my least favourite record,"" and it is, in fact, one of only two of Young’s early recordings that has yet to be re-released on CD (The other being the soundtrack album   Journey Through the Past ). The album was recorded live over a tour where Neil struggled with his voice and called   David Crosby and   Graham Nash to help perform the music. The tour was also notable as   Linda Ronstadt began touring as the opening act for the Time Fades Away tour.  Time Fades Away  occupies a unique position in Young’s discography as the first of three albums known collectively as the ""  Ditch Trilogy,"" and has also been referred to as the ""Doom Trilogy"" by some writers. In the second half of 1973, Young formed The Santa Monica Flyers, with Crazy Horse's rhythm section augmented by Nils Lofgren on guitar. Deeply affected by the drug-induced deaths of Whitten and   roadie   Bruce Berry, Young recorded   Tonight's the Night . The album's dark tone and rawness caused Reprise to delay the release until two years later and only after being pressured by Young to do so. The album received mixed reviews at the time, but is now regarded by some as a precursor to   punk rock. In Young's own opinion, it was the closest he ever came to art. While his record company delayed the release of  Tonight's the Night,  Young recorded   On the Beach  (1974), which dealt with themes such as the downside of fame and the Californian lifestyle. Like  Time Fades Away  and  Tonight's the Night , it sold poorly but would eventually become a critical favourite, presenting some of Young's most original work. In a review of the 2003 re-release on CD of  On the Beach  Derek Svennungsen described the music as ""mesmerizing, harrowing, lucid, and bleary,"" a characterization that many would say is an apt description of the entire Ditch Trilogy. Return to prominence         After completing  On the Beach , Young reunited with  Harvest  producer Elliot Mazer to record another acoustic album,   Homegrown . Most of the songs were written after Young's breakup with Snodgress, and thus the tone of the album was somewhat dark. Though the album was entirely completed, Young decided to drop the album and release  Tonight's the Night  instead, at the suggestion of   The Band bassist   Rick Danko. Young further explained his move by saying: ""It was a little too personal... it scared me"". Young reformed Crazy Horse with   Frank Sampedro on guitar as his backup band for   Zuma  (1975). Many of the songs are overtly concerned with failed relationships, and even the epic ""  Cortez the Killer,"" outwardly a retelling of the   Spanish conquest of  Mexico  from the viewpoint of the  Aztecs , can be seen as an allegory of love lost—something that didn’t save it, however, from being banned in   Franco's  Spain . The following year, Young reunited with Stephen Stills for the album   Long May You Run  (1976), credited to   The Stills-Young Band; the follow-up tour was ended midway through by Young, who sent Stills a   telegram that read: ""Funny how some things that start spontaneously end that way. Eat a peach, Neil."" In 1976, Young performed with   The Band, Joni Mitchell, and other rock musicians in the high profile all-star concert   The Last Waltz . The release of   Martin Scorsese's movie of the concert was delayed while Scorsese unwillingly re-edited it to deemphasize the lump of cocaine that was clearly visible hanging from Young's nose during his performance of   ""Helpless."" Young later said, ""I'm not proud of that,"" according to one of his biographers.  American Stars 'N Bars  (1977) contained two songs originally recorded for  Homegrown  album, ""Homegrown"" and ""Star of Bethelehem,"" as well as newer material. Performers included   Linda Ronstadt,   Emmylou Harris and Young protégé   Nicolette Larson along with Crazy Horse. Also in 1977, Young released   Decade : a personally selected career summary of material spanning every aspect of his various interests and affiliations, including a handful of unreleased songs.   Comes a Time  (1978) also featured Nicolette Larson and Crazy Horse and became Young's most commercially accessible album in quite some time, marked by a return to his folk roots. Young next set out on the lengthy ""Rust Never Sleeps"" tour, in which each concert was divided into a solo acoustic set and an electric set with Crazy Horse. Much of the electric set was later seen as a response to punk rock's burgeoning popularity. ""Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)"" compared the changing public perception of   Johnny Rotten with that of the recently deceased  Elvis Presley , who himself had once been disparaged as a dangerous influence only to later become an   icon. Rotten, meanwhile, returned the favour by playing one of Young's records on a  London  radio show. The accompanying albums   Rust Never Sleeps  (new material, culled from live recordings, but featuring studio overdubs) and   Live Rust  (a mixture of old and new, and a genuine concert recording) captured the two sides of the concerts, with solo acoustic songs on side A, and fierce, uptempo, electric songs on side B. A movie version of the concerts, also called  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979), was directed by Young under the pseudonym Bernard Shakey. Young was suddenly hip again, and the readers and critics of   Rolling Stone  voted him Artist Of The Year for 1979 (along with The Who), selected   Rust Never Sleeps  as Album Of The Year, and voted him Male Vocalist Of The Year as well. 1980s - Experimental years         The 1980s were a lean time for Young both critically and commercially. After providing the incidental music to a   biopic of   Hunter S. Thompson entitled   Where the Buffalo Roam , he recorded   Hawks & Doves  (1980), a folk/country record.   Re-ac-tor  (1981), once again with Crazy Horse, was a façade of distortion and feedback obscuring a relatively weak selection of songs, but his strangest record of the decade came with   Trans  (1982). Recorded partially with   vocoders,  synthesizers , and other devices that modified instruments and vocals with electronic effects, it is sometimes considered an experiment related to finding a technology that would become a means to communicate for Young’s son (with his wife Pegi), Ben, who has severe   cerebral palsy and cannot speak. Many fans were baffled by the radical forms of this album and   rockabilly-styled   Everybody's Rockin'  (1983), and record company head   David Geffen even sued Young for making ""unrepresentative"" music - i.e. music that did not sound like Neil Young. Young later stated that he would have preferred to release the songs featuring the   synclavier and   vocoder as an EP, and that their inclusion with the Hawaiian-themed rockabilly was a mistake. Also premiered at this time though little seen was an eclectic full-length comedy film   Human Highway  starring, co-directed and co-written by Young. In 1983, Young worked with British video director Tim Pope, making two videos - ""Wonderin'"" and ""Cry, Cry, Cry."" In 1985, he reunited with Crosby, Stills and Nash at   Live Aid at Philadelphia's   John F. Kennedy Stadium. The two songs that they played, ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"" and ""  Daylight Again/Find The Cost of Freedom,"" were the first songs they had played as a quartet in front of a paying audience since 1974.  Old Ways  (1985) saw a return to country music, recorded with a group of friends and session musicians.   Landing on Water  (1986) is entertaining for the blending of synthesizers and other instruments related to the 80's into Young’s own style, with lyrics that take pot shots at some favourite targets, including CSN in ""Hippie Dream,"" with a chorus that goes: ""But the wooden ships/Were just a hippie dream,"" and David Geffen in ""Drifter,"" with the line: ""Don’t try to tell me what I gotta do to fit."" The resumption of his partnership with Crazy Horse on   Life  (1987) fulfilled his contract with Geffen, and Young was finally able to switch labels. Signing with   Warner Brothers (which distributed Geffen at the time) and returning to Reprise Records, Young produced   This Note's For You  (1988) with a new band, The Bluenotes, whose name rights were owned by musician   Harold Melvin. Neil named his band after a cafe called the Blue Note on Main Street in Winnipeg Manitoba, where he had played. The addition of a  brass  section provided a new  jazzier  sound and the title track became his first hit single of the decade. Accompanied by a witty video which parodied corporate rock, the pretensions of advertising and   Michael Jackson in particular, the song was initially banned by   MTV (although the Canadian music channel,   MuchMusic ran it immediately) before being put into heavy rotation and finally given the   MTV Video Music Award for Best Video of the Year for 1989. After Melvin sued over the use of the Bluenotes name, Young renamed his back-up group ""Ten Men Workin'"" for the balance of the concert tour. Young also contributed to that year's CSNY reunion   American Dream  (1988) and CSNY played a few benefit concerts. Young, however, refused to book a full tour with CSN and the foursome would not embark upon a nationwide tour until 2000. 1990s - Return to country-rock roots          Freedom  was a mixture of acoustic and electric rock dealing with the state of the U.S. and the world in 1989, alongside a set of love songs and a version of the standard ""On Broadway."" ""  Rockin' in the Free World"", two versions of which bookended the album, again caught the mood. Some say it became a  de facto  anthem during the fall of the  Berlin Wall , a few months after the record's release. However, most Germans don't remember the song being related to the reunification, understandably so, since the lyrics are not about political repression. Like  Bruce Springsteen 's ""  Born in the U.S.A."", the anthemic use of this song was based on largely ignoring the verses, which evoke social problems and implicitly criticize American government policies. In the summer of 1989, record executive   Terry Tolkin conceived and produced a tribute album to Young's songs called ""The Bridge: A Tribute To Neil Young,"" released on his   No.6 Records label. It featured cover versions of 15 of Young's songs by the cream of the up and coming  Alternative Music  and   Grunge music bands including   Sonic Youth,   Nick Cave,   Soul Asylum,   dinosaur jr,and   The Pixies. By 1990,   grunge music was beginning to make its first inroads in the charts and many of its prime movers, including   Nirvana's   Kurt Cobain and   Pearl Jam's   Eddie Vedder, cited Young as a major influence. Using a barn on his   Northern California ranch as a studio, he rapidly recorded   Ragged Glory  with Crazy Horse, whose guitar riffs and feedback driven sound showed his new admirers that he could still cut it. Young then headed back out on the road with LA punk band   Social Distortion and  alternative rock  elder statesmen   Sonic Youth as support, much to the consternation of many of his old fans. Yet the influence of Sonic Youth could be clearly heard on the accompanying home video and live album,   Weld , which also included a bonus CD entitled   Arc , a single 35-minute-long collage of   feedback and guitar noise that Neil included, evidently at the suggestion of Sonic Youth's   Thurston Moore.  Arc  was later sold separately. Young's next move was another return to country music.   Harvest Moon  (1992) was the long awaited sequel to  Harvest  and reunited him with some of the musicians from that session, as well as singers   Linda Ronstadt and   James Taylor. The title track was a minor hit and the record was reviewed and sold equally well, containing songs such as ""From Hank to   Hendrix"" and ""Unknown Legend"", a tribute to his wife. His resurgent popularity saw him booked on   MTV Unplugged  in 1993. In 1992 he accompanied fellow   Winnipegger   Randy Bachman on ""Prairie Town,"" a song that recounts their days in the Winnipeg music scene of the 1960s. That year, he contributed music to the   soundtrack of the   Jonathan Demme movie   Philadelphia , and his song ""Philadelphia"" was nominated for the   Academy Award for Best Song, losing out to Bruce Springsteen's contribution to the same film. A summer tour covering both Europe and North America with   Booker T. and the MGs (with whom he played two songs at a 1992  Bob Dylan  tribute concert at   Madison Square Garden) was widely praised as a triumph. On a few of these dates, the show ended with a rendition of ""Rockin' in the Free World"" played with   Pearl Jam. Young was back with Crazy Horse for 1994's   Sleeps with Angels , a much darker record. The title track told the story of   Kurt Cobain's death; Young had reportedly made repeated attempts to contact Cobain prior to this event. Cobain had quoted Young's ""It's better to burn out than fade away"" (a line from ""  My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)"") in his alleged   suicide note, causing Young to emphasize the line ""'cause once you're gone you can't come back"" in live performances at the time. Other songs dealt with drive-by shootings (""Driveby""),   environmentalism (""Piece of Crap"") and Young's own vision of America (the archetypal car metaphor of ""Trans Am""). Young was inspired to make the record after viewing Cobain's performance on   MTV Unplugged. Still admired by the prime movers of grunge, Young eventually performed with Pearl Jam at the MTV Music Awards during what was described as the highlight of a lackluster show. Their collaboration led to a joint tour, with the band and producer   Brendan O'Brien backing Young. The accompanying album,   Mirror Ball  (1995), recorded as live in the studio captured their loose rock sound, and featured the standout track ""I'm the Ocean"". The year of 1995 also featured Young's entry into the   Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. After composing an abstract, distorted feedback-led guitar instrumental soundtrack to   Jim Jarmusch's   acid western film   Dead Man  Young recorded a series of loose jams with Crazy Horse that eventually appeared as the critically denigrated   Broken Arrow . The return to Crazy Horse was prompted by the death of mentor, friend, and longtime   producer   David Briggs in late 1995. The subsequent tours of Europe and North America in 1996 resulted in both a live album and a tour documentary directed by   Jim Jarmusch. Both releases took the name   Year of the Horse . In 1997, Young participated in the   H.O.R.D.E. Festival's sixth annual tour. In 1998, Young shared the stage with the rock band   Phish at the annual   Farm Aid concert, and later offered them an opportunity to headline both nights of the Bridge School Benefit concert.   Phish passed on Young's offer and also declined Young's later invitation to be his backing band on a 1999 tour. The decade ended with   Looking Forward , another reunion with Crosby, Stills and Nash. The subsequent tour of the United States and Canada with the reformed super quartet was a huge success and brought in earnings of $42.1 million, making it the eighth largest grossing tour of 2000. Young's next album,   Silver & Gold  (2000), contained a number of understated songs with personal lyrics, which was promoted through a mini-tour of solo acoustic shows. This style was continued in   Are You Passionate?  (2002), an album of love songs dedicated to his wife, Pegi. In the aftermath of 9/11         Young's 2001 single ""  Let's Roll"", was a tribute to the victims of the  September 11 terrorist attacks , and the passengers and crew on   Flight 93 in particular. At the ""  America: A Tribute to Heroes"" concert he performed a   cover version of  John Lennon's  ""  Imagine"". In 2002,    Q  magazine named Neil Young in their list of the ""50 Bands To See Before You Die."" Young hauled out his concept album   Greendale  in 2003 -- about an extended family in a small town called Greendale, and how they are torn apart by a murder.  Greendale  was recorded with Crazy Horse members Billy Talbot and Ralph Molina. This tale of the Green family also resulted in a movie called  Greendale , written and directed by Young (again using his ""Bernard Shakey"" pseudonym) and starring a few of his friends, who act out and   lip sync the songs from the album. The film was indeed thoroughly experimental, from Young's rambling on-stage between-song narratives, to his reading apparent transcriptions of these ramblings in the liner notes. ""When I was writing this I had no idea what I was doing, so I was just as surprised as you are,"" Young said later. Young toured extensively with the  Greendale  material throughout 2003 and 2004, first with a solo, acoustic version in Europe, then with a full-cast stage show in North America,  Japan , and  Australia . While audience reaction was sometimes mixed (drunken requests for ""Southern Man"" being an aesthetic impediment at most Young performances), the live stage version of Greendale was for many critics the most satisfying incarnation of the material, and bootlegs of the shows have been widely traded. The second half of each concert consisted of high-decibel renditions of Young classics such as ""Hey Hey, My My,"" ""Cinnamon Girl,"" ""Powderfinger,"" and   Rockin' in the Free World, as well as rarities such as ""The Losing End,"" ""The Old Country Waltz,"" and ""Danger Bird."" Young spent the latter portion of 2004 giving a series of intimate acoustic concerts in various cities with his wife, Pegi, who is a trained vocalist. Recent events                         On   March 31,   2005, Young was admitted to a hospital in New York for treatment for a brain   aneurysm. He was treated successfully by a minimally invasive   neuroradiological procedure. Prior to undergoing the procedure, he wrote the first eight songs of a new album,   Prairie Wind , in  Nashville , with session musicians that included regular Young sideman   Ben Keith on lap and   pedal steel guitars. The last two songs on the album were written after his aneurysm procedure. Many of the songs, such as ""Fallin' Off the Face of the Earth,"" seem to be inspired by Young's brush with  mortality , the recent death of his father (who suffered   senile dementia), as well as a connection with his   Manitoba roots. Two days after the procedure, Young was forced to cancel a scheduled appearance on the   Juno Awards telecast in Winnipeg when the area where the surgeons did his procedure (via the   femoral artery) suddenly began to bleed. Young finally was able to return to Winnipeg in 2006 with Crosby, Stills and Nash. He next performed on   July 2,   2005, at the close of the   Live 8 concert in   Barrie, Ontario. He presented a new song, a soft hymn called ""When God Made Me,"" and ended with ""  Rockin' in the Free World"". He began his set with a cover of the Canadian folk classic ""  Four Strong Winds"" by   Ian &   Sylvia Tyson. (He had recorded this song on his   Comes a Time album) On   September 28,   2005,  Prairie Wind  was released as a regular CD, a special limited-edition CD and DVD package, and on vinyl. In an interview given to    Time  magazine, Young revealed that he had planned to keep the news of his aneurysm private until he had the bleeding scare, after which he decided to make news of his condition public. In 2006,   Neil Young: Heart of Gold , a film made by   Jonathan Demme, premiered at the   Sundance Film Festival. Filmed over two nights at the   Ryman Auditorium in  Nashville, Tennessee  during the premiere of  Prairie Wind , it includes both new and old songs as well as behind-the scenes-commentary by Young, his wife Pegi and others. In April 2006, Young confirmed on his website that he was going to release an album full of protest songs, titled   Living with War , one of whose songs is titled ""  Let's Impeach the President."" Recorded using his famous   Les Paul electric guitar, ""  Old Black,"" along with Chad Cromwell (drums), Rick Rosas (bass), and Tommy Brea (trumpet), it was intended to be a stinging rebuke of  President George W. Bush  and the  War in Iraq . The album was recorded in a two week period in April, and was then made available over the internet from 28 April 2006 before being released as a CD on 5 May.   Living with War  was Young's most talked about release for years, creating heated political debate and a return to form with perhaps his most critically-acclaimed album since the early 1990s ""Godfather of Grunge"" era when he was hailed as major influences on grunge pioneers   Pearl Jam and seminal indie band   Sonic Youth among others.                      Neil Young on the CSNY ""Freedom Of Speech Tour '06""                          In April 2006, it was announced that   Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young would embark on their ""Freedom Of Speech Tour '06"" with Chad Cromwell and Rick Rosas making up the rhythm section. The tour would see them play dates all across North America. The entire   Living with War  album was performed on the tour, in addition to other CSN and Neil Young classics such as ""  Ohio"" and ""  Rockin' in the Free World."" In September 2006, the first release from his long awaited   Archives  project was announced.   Live at the Fillmore East  features a live set with   Crazy Horse including   Danny Whitten from 1970. Young had stated in interviews that the release would be followed by a much larger box set of recordings from his early career. In October 2006, it was announced that a rough-mix version of   Living with War, titled  Living with War - Raw , would be made available for digital download on November 7. It was also announced that a CD/DVD set of this early version of the album would be released on December 19. The DVD includes videos directed by Young of every song on the album, and contain footage of the  Iraq War , demonstrations in the US, and   Al Gore's   An Inconvenient Truth . However, when the CD was released, it was titled   Living with War: In the Beginning . It was announced   January 16,   2007 that the next release in the  Archives Performance Series  project would be from   January 19,  1971  where Neil performed at Toronto's Massey Hall. The new release, titled   Live at Massey Hall 1971  was released March 13. The first installment of Young's oft-delayed box set   The Archives Vol.01 1963-1972  was officially announced with a trailer and website  The box set will feature 8  CDs  and 2  DVDs  comprising unreleased studio and live recordings, film footage, photographs and personal letters. Also accompanying the release is a 150-page book. It was announced in August 2007 that Neil Young's  Greendale  will be made into a graphic novel. A release date has yet to be confirmed. On   August 15,   2007, Young played a new album for 100 people at Reprise Records entitled   Chrome Dreams II . (  Chrome Dreams  was an album he scrapped in 1977, and the name of two different bootlegs.) The new album includes two long songs that time in at 18:13 (""Ordinary People"") and 14:31 (""No Hidden Path""), respectively. The album consists of three songs written previously and seven new songs, all by Young. The album was released on October 23, 2007, timed to coincide with a seven-week tour that had kicked off in Boise, Idaho, ten days earlier. The album and tour is cited as one of the reasons for the delay of Archives Vol. 1, which is scheduled for release on   February 14,   2008, according to Rolling Stone magazine. Young currently lives on a 1500-acre (6 km²) ranch in   La Honda, California, called Broken Arrow. He also owns property in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and on the islands of Hawaii. Influence, importance and inspiration         Neil Young has undeniably been an important artist in the history of American popular music and remains a distinct influence upon other recording artists.   Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “  Sweet Home Alabama” was written in response to two of Neil Young’s songs, “Southern Man” and “Alabama”. “Ohio” which Young recorded with Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, was a recollection of the tragic events that transpired at Kent State University in May, 1970. Young's willingness to be politically outspoken and socially conscious allowed him to influence such important artists such as   Phish,   Pearl Jam and   Nirvana. Neil Young is referred to as “the Godfather of   Grunge” because of the influence he had on   Kurt Cobain and   Eddie Vedder and the entire grunge movement. Kurt Cobain quoted Neil Young in his suicide note, using the line “It’s better to burn out, than to fade away” from Young’s song ""Hey Hey, My My"". Because of this, Young decided not to play the song live anymore. Eddie Vedder, of Pearl Jam, inducted Neil Young into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, citing him as a huge influence. He has also been a big influence on   experimental rock acts like   Sonic Youth and  Radiohead . Young’s influence, importance and inspiration within the music scene derive in part from his longevity, a career spanning more than four decades. His first album was released in 1966 and his latest in 2007. The Australian rock group   Powderfinger attribute their group name to their love of Young. Achievements         Young was inducted into the   Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1982. He has been inducted into the   Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice: first in 1995 for his solo work, with an induction speech given by   Eddie Vedder, and again in 1997 as a member of Buffalo Springfield. He has also directed four movies under his pseudonym Bernard Shakey, and released them through his own Shakey Pictures imprint:   Journey Through the Past  (1973),   Rust Never Sleeps  (1979)   Human Highway  (1982) (starring new wave band   Devo), and  Greendale  (2003). The bonus  DVDs  included in both versions of  Greendale  and in  Prairie Wind  are also directed by Young under the Bernard Shakey alias, and all of Young's home video and DVD releases have been co-released under the Shakey Pictures imprint. As one of the founders of Farm Aid, he remains on their board of directors. For one weekend each October, in   Mountain View, California, he and his wife host the   Bridge School Concerts, which have been drawing international talent and sell-out crowds for nearly two decades with some of the biggest names in rock having performed at the event including  Bruce Springsteen ,   David Bowie,   The Who,   Trent Reznor of   Nine Inch Nails,   Pearl Jam,   Sonic Youth and  Sir Paul McCartney . The concerts are a benefit for the   Bridge School, which develops and uses advanced technologies to aid in the instruction of children with disabilities. Young's involvement stems at least partially from the fact that both of his sons have   cerebral palsy and his daughter, like Young himself, has  epilepsy . Young was nominated for an  Oscar  in 1994 for his song ""Philadelphia"" from the film   Philadelphia  (Bruce Springsteen ended up winning the award for his song ""  Streets of Philadelphia"" from the same film). In his acceptance speech, Springsteen said that ""the award really deserved to be shared by the other nominee's song."" That same night,   Tom Hanks accepted the Oscar for Best Actor and gave credit for his inspiration to the song ""Philadelphia"". He is part owner of   Lionel, LLC, a company that makes toy trains and railroads. Young is also an inventor, and has been named as co-inventor of seven U.S. Patents related to model trains: Nos. 7,264,208;   7,211,976;   6,765,356;   5,749,547;   5,555,815;   5,441,223; and   5,251,856. Young has twice received honorary doctorates. First in 1992, an Honorary Doctorate of Music from   Lakehead University in   Thunder Bay,   Ontario and secondly in 2006, an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from   San Francisco State University. The latter honour was shared with his wife Pegi for their creation of the Bridge School. In a ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"" list in the June 1996 issue of    Mojo  magazine, Young was ranked number 9. In 2000, Young was inducted into   Canada's Walk of Fame. He ranked #39 on   VH1's 100 Greatest Artist of Hard Rock  that same year. In 2001, Young was awarded the Spirit of Liberty award from the civil liberties group   People for the American Way. In 2004,   Rolling Stone Magazine ranked   Neil Young #34 on their list of the   100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In a ""Greatest Living Songwriters"" list in 2006 by Paste Magazine Young was ranked number 2 behind  Bob Dylan . Instruments         Neil Young is a collector of second-hand guitars, but in recording and performing, he frequently uses just a few instruments. As explained by his longtime guitar technician Larry Cragg in the film   Neil Young: Heart of Gold , they include:          1953   Gibson Les Paul Goldtop—Nicknamed ""  Old Black"", this is Young's primary   electric guitar and is featured on   Rust Never Sleeps  and most other albums. Old Black got its name from a purely amateur paintjob applied to the originally-gold body of the instrument, sometime before Neil acquired the guitar in the late 1960s. In 1972, a mini-  humbucker pickup from a   Gibson Firebird guitar was installed into the lead/treble position, replacing a   P-90 as standard on Les Paul guitars from that era. This pickup, severely   microphonic, is considered a crucial component of Neil's sound. A   Bigsby vibrato unit was installed as early as 1969 on the guitar, and can be heard clearly during the opening of ""Cowgirl in the Sand"" from   Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere . This guitar also features a mini-switch that is used to send the signal from the mini-humbucker direct to the amp, without going through the volume or tone controls. A Les Paul Gold Top of the same year as Old Black was assembled by Neil's guitar tech, using same style Firebird pick up in the guitar as well as the same model Bigsby Vib; but, according to Young, was just not the same as the original.  Martin D-45—His primary   steel-string acoustic guitar; used to write ""Old Man"" and many other hit songs. Martin D-28—Nicknamed ""Hank"" after its previous owner,   Hank Williams. The guitar came into Young's possession after   Hank Williams, Jr. had traded it to another owner for some shotguns and it went through a succession of other owners until it was located by Young's longtime friend Grant Boatwright. The guitar was purchased by Young from Tut Taylor. Young has toured with it for over 30 years. A story about the guitar and inspired song known as ""This Old Guitar"" can be seen about 50 minutes into the film   Neil Young: Heart of Gold . It is Young's primary guitar for the album,   Prairie Wind . Neil Young can be seen playing a Vagabond Travel Guitar as he sings ""Let's Impeach the President"" on   The Colbert Report  on   Comedy Central. 1927   Gibson Mastertone—A six-string  banjo , tuned like a guitar. It has been used on many recordings and was played by   James Taylor on ""Old Man"". Various vintage   Fender Deluxe amplifiers— Young's preferred amplifier for electric guitar is the diminutive Fender Deluxe, specifically a Tweed-era model from 1959. Neil purchased his first vintage Deluxe in 1967 for $50 from the drummer of Crazy Horse, Ralph Molina, and has since acquired nearly 450 different examples, all from the same era, but he maintains that it's the original model that sounds superior, and is a crucial component to his trademark sound. A notable and unique accessory to Young's Deluxe is the Whizzer, a device created specifically for Young, which physically changes the amplifier's settings to pre-set combinations. It has gone through many incarnations, and now includes effects pedals hardwired into its circuitry.  Gretsch 6120 (Chet Atkins)—Before Young bought Old Black, this was his primary electric guitar used during his   Buffalo Springfield days.  Gretsch White Falcon – Late '50s hollow body that Young purchased near the end of the   Buffalo Springfield era; in 1969 Young acquired a stereo version of the same vintage guitar from Stills, and this instrument is featured prominently during Young's early '70s period, and can be heard on tracks like ""Ohio,"" ""Southern Man,"" ""Alabama,"" ""L.A.,"" others. It is Neil's primary electric guitar during the  Harvest  era.         In a large garage underneath his Woodside ranch, Young also maintains a large private collection of classic Detroit-made American cars. Popular culture                  Two of the domesticated buffalo used in the production of the film   Dances with Wolves  were borrowed from Neil Young. An edited version of Young's song ""Rockin' in the Free World"" plays in the ending credits of the   Michael Moore   documentary   Fahrenheit 9/11 . In a sketch of   Saturday Night Live , guest host  Kevin Spacey  portrayed Young with his upcoming fictional   album entitled ""I Do Not Agree with Many of this Administration's Policies"". Featured songs included: ""George W. Liar"", ""I'm Just Going to Go Ahead and Say It, I Don't Think Iraq is Going Well"", ""Donald Rumsfeld is a Straight-Up Murderer"", and ""Dick Cheney is Overweight"". In the   Futurama  episode, ""  Bendin' in the Wind"", when Beck and his entourage chase after Bender they get on to   Beck's tour bus. As Beck's bus pulls away Neil Young's head is in a jar looking out the window. Behind Young is the head of his Los Angeles scene peer and fellow Canadian   Joni Mitchell. In his song '  Williamsburg Will Oldham Horror',   Anti-folk singer   Jeffrey Lewis describes Neil Young as a standard of songwriter that both he and   Will Oldham can only fail to reach - a reason for him to abandon his hopes of being a famous artist. The film   Canadian Bacon  includes the line ""Canadians are always trying to figure out a lot of ways to   "

Young's work is characterized by deeply personal lyrics, distinctive guitar work, and signature falsetto  tenor  singing voice. Although he accompanies himself on several different instrumentsincluding  piano  and  harmonica his claw-hammer  acoustic guitar  style and often idiosyncratic electric guitar soloing are the linchpins of a sometimes ragged, sometimes polished sound. Although Young has experimented widely with differing music styles, including  swing ,  jazz ,  rockabilly ,  blues , and  electronic music  throughout a varied career, his best known work usually falls into either of two distinct styles:  folk -esque  acoustic   rock  ("" Heart of Gold "", ""Harvest Moon"" and "" Old Man "") and  electric -charged  hard rock  (like "" Cinnamon Girl "", "" Rockin' in the Free World "" and "" Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black) ""). In recent years, Young has adopted elements from newer styles like  industrial ,  alternative country  and  grunge . Young's profound influence on the latter caused some to dub him ""the godfather of grunge"".   Young has directed (or co-directed) a number of  films  using the  pseudonym  Bernard Shakey, including  Journey Through the Past  (1973),  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979),  Human Highway  (1982),  Greendale  (2003), and  CSNY Dj Vu  (2008). He is currently working on a documentary about electric car technology, tentatively titled  Linc/Volt . The project involves a 1959  Lincoln Continental  converted to hybrid technology, which Young plans to drive to  Washington, DC  as an example to lawmakers there. [ 2 ]   He is also an outspoken advocate for environmental issues and small farmers, having co-founded in 1985 the  benefit concert   Farm Aid , and in 1986 helped found The Bridge School, [ 3 ]  and its annual supporting  Bridge School Benefit  concerts, together with his wife Pegi (in this, Young's involvement stems at least partially from the fact that both of his sons have  cerebral palsy  and his daughter, like Young himself, has  epilepsy ).   Although Young sings as frequently about U.S. legends and myths ( Pocahontas ,  space stations , and the settlement of the American West) [ 4 ]  as he does about his native country, he remains a Canadian citizen and has never wanted to relinquish his Canadian citizenship. He has lived in the U.S. for ""so long"" and has stated he has ""got just as much right to vote in them (American elections) as anybody else.""

He spent his early years in the small country town of  Omemee , 130  kilometres  (81  mi ) northeast of Toronto.   Young was diagnosed with diabetes as a child [ 6 ]  and a bout of  polio  at the age of 6 left him with a weakened left side; he still walks with a slight limp.   His parents divorced when Young was 12, and he moved with his mother back to the family home of  Winnipeg , Manitoba, where the formative years of his music career began. Neil and his mother Rassy settled into the working class suburb of  Fort Rouge  where the shy, dry-humoured youth enrolled at Earl Grey Junior High School. It was there that he formed his first band  the Jades , and met  Ken Koblun , later to join him in the Squires.   While attending  Kelvin High School  in Winnipeg, he played in several instrumental rock bands. Young's first stable band was called the Squires, who had a local hit called ""The Sultan"". Young dropped out of high school [ 7 ]  and also played in  Fort William , where they recorded a series of demos produced by a local producer named Ray Dee, whom Young called ""the original Briggs."" [ 8 ]  While in Thunder Bay, Young first encountered  Stephen Stills . In the  2006  film  Heart of Gold  Young relates how he used to spend time as a teenager at  Falcon Lake, Manitoba  where he would endlessly plug coins into the jukebox to hear  Ian Tyson 's "" Four Strong Winds "". Neil also formed a friendship with musician  Randy Bachman .   After leaving the Squires, Neil worked folk clubs in Winnipeg, where he first met  Joni Mitchell . [ 9 ]  Here he wrote some of his earliest and most enduring folk songs such as the classic "" Sugar Mountain "", about his lost youth. Mitchell wrote ""The Circle Game"" in response. [ citation needed ]   In 1965 Young toured Canada as a solo artist. In 1966, he joined the  Rick James -fronted  Mynah Birds . The band managed to secure a record deal with the  Motown  label, but as their first album was being recorded, James was arrested for being  AWOL  from the army. [ 10 ]  After the Mynah Birds disbanded, Young and bass player  Bruce Palmer  relocated to  Los Angeles . Young has admitted in an interview that he was in the United States illegally until receiving a green card in 1970. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Buffalo Springfield   Once they reached Los Angeles, Young and Palmer met up with  Stephen Stills ,  Richie Furay , and  Dewey Martin  to form  Buffalo Springfield . A mixture of folk, country,  psychedelia , and rock lent a hard edge by the twin lead guitars of Stills and Young made Buffalo Springfield a critical success, and their first record  Buffalo Springfield  (1967) sold well after Stills' topical song "" For What It's Worth "" became a hit, aided by Young's melodic harmonics played on electric guitar.   Distrust of their management, as well as the arrest and deportation of Palmer, exacerbated the already strained relations among the group members and led to Buffalo Springfield's demise. A second album,  Buffalo Springfield Again , was released in late 1967, but two of Youngs three contributions were solo tracks recorded apart from the rest of the group.   In many ways, these three songs on  Buffalo Springfield Again  are harbingers of much of Young's later work in that, although they all share deeply personal, almost idiosyncratic lyrics, they also present three very different musical approaches to the arrangement of what is essentially an original folk song. ""Mr Soul"" is the only Young song of the three that all five members of the group perform together. In contrast, "" Broken Arrow "" was confessional folk rock of a kind that would characterize much of the music that emerged from the singer-songwriter movement. Youngs experimental production intersperses each verse with snippets of sound from other sources, including opening the song with a sound bite of Dewey Martin singing ""Mr. Soul"" and closing it with the thumping of a heartbeat. ""Expecting to Fly"" was a lushly produced  ballad  featuring a string arrangement that Young's co-producer for the track,  Jack Nitzsche , would dub ""symphonic pop.""   In May 1968, the band split up for good, but in order to fulfill a contractual obligation, a final album,  Last Time Around , was recorded, primarily from recordings made earlier that year. Young contributed the songs ""On the Way Home"" and ""I Am a Child"", singing lead on the latter. In 1997, the band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame; Young did not appear at the ceremony.     [ edit ]   Solo success & CSNY   After the breakup of Buffalo Springfield, Young signed a solo deal with  Reprise Records , home of his colleague and friend  Joni Mitchell , with whom he shared a manager, Elliot Roberts, who manages Young to this day. Young and Nitzsche immediately began work on Young's first solo record,  Neil Young  (November 1968), which received mixed reviews. In a 1970 interview, [ 12 ]  Young deprecated the album as being ""overdubbed rather than played,"" and the quest for music that expresses the spontaneity of the moment has long been a feature of his career. Nevertheless, the album contains some tunes that remain a staple of his live shows, most notably ""The Loner.""   For his next album, Young recruited three musicians from a band called The Rockets:  Danny Whitten  on guitar,  Billy Talbot  on bass guitar, and  Ralph Molina  on  drums . These three took the name  Crazy Horse  (after  the historical figure of the same name ), and  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere  (May 1969), is credited to ""Neil Young with Crazy Horse."" Recorded in just two weeks, the album opens with one of Young's most familiar songs, ""Cinnamon Girl,"" and is dominated by two more, ""Cowgirl in the Sand"" and ""Down by the River,"" that feature lengthy jams showcasing Young's idiosyncratic guitar soloing accompanied sympathetically by Crazy Horse. Young reportedly wrote all three songs on the same day, while nursing a high fever of 103 F (39.5 C) in bed.   Shortly after the release of  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere , Young reunited with Stephen Stills by joining  Crosby, Stills, & Nash , who had already released one album as a trio. Young was originally offered a position as a sideman, but agreed to join only if he received full membership, and the group - winners of the 1969 ""Best New Artist"" Grammy - was renamed Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. [ 13 ]  The quartet debuted in  Chicago  on  August 16 ,  1969 , and later performed at the famous  Woodstock Festival , during which Young skipped the acoustic set and refused to be filmed during the electric set, even telling the cameramen: ""One of you fuckin' guys comes near me and I'm gonna fuckin' hit you with my guitar"". [ 14 ]  During the making of their first album,  Dj Vu , the musicians frequently argued, particularly Young and Stills, who both fought for control. [ 15 ]   "" Ohio "" was written following the  Kent State massacre  on  May 4 ,  1970 , and was a staple of anti-war rallies in the 1970s. The song was quickly recorded by CSNY and immediately released as a single, even though CSNY's ""Teach Your Children"" was still climbing the singles charts. Many believe that the release of ""Ohio"" as a single cut into the sales of ""Teach Your Children"" and prevented that song from reaching the top ten. In the late 1970s and for much of the 1980s, Young refrained from performing ""Ohio"" live, as he considered the song to be dated. In the wake of the 1989  Tiananmen Square massacre , however, Young revived the song in concert, often dedicating it to the  Chinese  students who were killed in the massacre. Crosby, Stills & Nash, as a trio, also returned the song to their live repertoire around the same time, even though Young had provided the lead vocals on the original recording.   Also that year, Young released his third solo album,  After the Gold Rush  (1970), which featured, among others, a young  Nils Lofgren ,  Stephen Stills , and CSNY bassist Greg Reeves. Young also recorded some tracks with Crazy Horse, but dismissed them early in the sessions. Aided by his newfound fame with CSNY, the album was a commercial breakthrough for Young and contains some of his best known work. Notable tracks include the title track, with dream-like lyrics that run a gamut of subjects from drugs and interpersonal relationships to environmental concerns, as well as Youngs controversial and acerbic condemnation of  racism  in "" Southern Man ,"" which, along with a later song entitled ""Alabama,"" later prompted  Lynyrd Skynyrd  to decry Young by name in the lyrics to "" Sweet Home Alabama ."" Young was one of Skynyrd's biggest influences, and Young was an admirer of Skynyrd's music. The respectful rivalry and friendship between Young and Skynyrd front man  Ronnie Van Zant  would serve as a recurring theme in the  Drive-By Truckers ' 2001  concept album   Southern Rock Opera .   With CSNY splitting up and Crazy Horse having signed their own record deal, Young began the year 1971 with a solo tour entitled ""Journey Through the Past."" Later, he recruited a new group of country-music session musicians, whom he christened  The Stray Gators , to record much of the new material that had been premiered on tour for the album  Harvest  (1972).  Harvest  was a massive hit (especially with the country-music crowd) and ""Heart of Gold"" became a US number one single; incidentally, to this day it remains the only No. 1 hit in his long career.   Another notable song was "" The Needle and the Damage Done ,"" a somber lament on the pain caused by heroin addiction; inspired in part by the heavy heroin use of Crazy Horse member Danny Whitten, who would eventually die of an overdose. [ 16 ]   The album's success, however, caught Young off guard, and his first instinct was to back away from stardom. In the handwritten liner notes to the  Decade  compilation, Young described ""Heart of Gold"" as the song that ""put me in the middle of the road. Traveling there soon became a bore, so I headed for the ditch. A rougher ride but I saw more interesting people there.""   On  September 8 ,  1972 , the Academy Award-nominated actress  Carrie Snodgress , with whom he had been living, gave birth to Neil Young's first child. The boy, Zeke, was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Young fell in love with Snodgress after seeing her in a movie (""Diary of a Mad Housewife"") on television after which Young wrote the song "" A Man Needs a Maid "" from the Harvest album, featuring the lyric ""I fell in love with the actress/she was playing a part that I could understand.""     [ edit ]   The Ditch Trilogy   Although a new tour had been planned to follow up on the success of  Harvest , it became apparent during rehearsals that Danny Whitten could not function due to  drug abuse . On  November 18 , 1972, shortly after he was fired from the tour preparations, Whitten was found dead of an  overdose . Young described the incident to  Rolling Stone s  Cameron Crowe  in 1975:  [ 17 ]  ""[We] were rehearsing with him and he just couldn't cut it. He couldn't remember anything. He was too out of it. Too far gone. I had to tell him to go back to L.A. 'It's not happening, man. You're not together enough.' He just said, 'I've got nowhere else to go, man. How am I gonna tell my friends?' And he split. That night the coroner called me from L.A. and told me he'd ODed. That blew my mind. Fucking blew my mind. I loved Danny. I felt responsible. And from there, I had to go right out on this huge tour of huge arenas. I was very nervous and  insecure.""   The album made in the aftermath of this incident,  Time Fades Away  (1973), has often been described by Young as ""my least favourite record,"" and it is, in fact, one of only two of Youngs early recordings that has yet to be officially re-released on CD (the other being the soundtrack album  Journey Through the Past ). The album was recorded live over a tour where Young struggled with his voice and called  David Crosby  and  Graham Nash  to help perform the music. The tour featured  Linda Ronstadt  as the opening act.  Time Fades Away  occupies a unique position in Youngs discography as the first of three albums known collectively as the "" Ditch Trilogy .""   In the second half of 1973, Young formed The Santa Monica Flyers, with Crazy Horse's rhythm section augmented by Nils Lofgren on guitar. Deeply affected by the drug-induced deaths of Whitten and  roadie   Bruce Berry , Young recorded  Tonight's the Night . The album's dark tone and rawness caused Reprise to delay the release until two years later and only after being pressured by Young to do so. [ 18 ]  It received mixed reviews at the time, but is now regarded as a landmark album. In Young's own opinion, it was the closest he ever came to art. [ 19 ]   While his record company delayed the release of  Tonight's the Night,  Young recorded  On the Beach  (1974), which dealt with themes such as the downside of fame and the Californian lifestyle. Like  Time Fades Away  and  Tonight's the Night , it sold poorly but eventually became a critical favourite, presenting some of Young's most original work. In a review of the 2003 re-release on CD of  On the Beach  Derek Svennungsen described the music as ""mesmerizing, harrowing, lucid, and bleary,"" [ 20 ] .     [ edit ]   Return to prominence   After completing  On the Beach , Young reunited with  Harvest  producer Elliot Mazer to record another acoustic album,  Homegrown . Most of the songs were written after Young's breakup with Snodgress, and thus the tone of the album was somewhat dark. Though the album was entirely completed, Young decided to drop the album and release  Tonight's the Night  instead, at the suggestion of  The Band  bassist  Rick Danko . [ 21 ]  Young further explained his move by saying: ""It was a little too personal... it scared me"". [ 22 ]          Neil Young in Austin, Texas on November 9, 1976       Young reformed Crazy Horse with  Frank Sampedro  on guitar as his backup band for  Zuma  (1975). Many of the songs are overtly concerned with failed relationships, and even the epic "" Cortez the Killer ,"" outwardly a retelling of the  Spanish conquest  of  Mexico  from the viewpoint of the  Aztecs , can be seen as an allegory of love lostsomething that didnt save it, however, from being banned in  Franco 's  Spain .   The following year, Young reunited with Stephen Stills for the album  Long May You Run  (1976), credited to  The Stills-Young Band ; the follow-up tour was ended midway through by Young, who sent Stills a  telegram  that read: ""Funny how some things that start spontaneously end that way. Eat a peach, Neil."" [ 23 ]   In 1976, Young performed with  The Band , Joni Mitchell, and other rock musicians in the high profile all-star concert  The Last Waltz . The release of  Martin Scorsese 's movie of the concert was delayed while Scorsese unwillingly re-edited it to obscure the lump of cocaine that was clearly visible hanging from Young's nose during his performance of  ""Helpless."" [ 24 ]  Young later said, ""I'm not proud of that,"" according to one of his biographers.   American Stars 'N Bars  (1977) contained two songs originally recorded for  Homegrown  album, ""Homegrown"" and ""Star of Bethelehem,"" as well as newer material, including the future concert staple "" Like A Hurricane "". Performers included  Linda Ronstadt ,  Emmylou Harris  and Young protg  Nicolette Larson  along with Crazy Horse. Also in 1977, Young released  Decade : a personally selected career summary of material spanning every aspect of his various interests and affiliations, including a handful of unreleased songs.  Comes a Time  (1978) also featured Nicolette Larson and Crazy Horse and became Young's most commercially accessible album in quite some time, marked by a return to his folk roots.   Young next set out on the lengthy ""Rust Never Sleeps"" tour, in which each concert was divided into a solo acoustic set and an electric set with Crazy Horse. Much of the electric set was later seen as a response to punk rock's burgeoning popularity. ""Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)"" compared the changing public perception of  Johnny Rotten  with that of the recently deceased  Elvis Presley , who himself had once been disparaged as a dangerous influence only to later become an  icon . Rotten, meanwhile, returned the favour by playing one of Young's records on a  London  radio show. The accompanying albums  Rust Never Sleeps  (new material, culled from live recordings, but featuring studio overdubs) and  Live Rust  (a mixture of old and new, and a genuine concert recording) captured the two sides of the concerts, with solo acoustic songs on side A, and fierce, uptempo, electric songs on side B. A movie version of the concerts, also called  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979), was directed by Young under the pseudonym Bernard Shakey.   Young was suddenly hip again, and the readers and critics of  Rolling Stone  voted him Artist Of The Year for 1979 (along with The Who), selected  Rust Never Sleeps  as Album Of The Year, and voted him Male Vocalist Of The Year as well.  The Village Voice , meanwhile, honored Young as the Artist of the Decade.     [ edit ]   1980s - Experimental years   The 1980s were a lean time for Young both critically and commercially. After providing the incidental music to a  biopic  of  Hunter S. Thompson  entitled  Where the Buffalo Roam , he recorded  Hawks & Doves  (1980), a folk/country record.  Re-ac-tor  (1981), once again with Crazy Horse, was a faade of distortion and feedback obscuring a relatively weak selection of songs, but his strangest record of the decade came with  Trans  (1982). Recorded partially with  vocoders ,  synthesizers , and other devices that modified instruments and vocals with electronic effects, it is sometimes considered an experiment related to finding a technology that would become a means to communicate for Youngs son (with his wife Pegi), Ben, who has severe  cerebral palsy  and cannot speak. Many fans were baffled by the radical forms of this album and  rockabilly -styled  Everybody's Rockin'  (1983), and record company head  David Geffen  even sued Young for making ""unrepresentative"" musici.e. music that did not sound like Neil Youngthat deliberately lacked commercial appeal. [ 25 ]  Young later stated that he would have preferred to release the songs featuring the  synclavier  and  vocoder  as an EP, and that their inclusion with the Hawaiian-themed rockabilly was a mistake. Also premiered at this time though little seen was an eclectic full-length comedy film  Human Highway  starring, co-directed and co-written by Young.   In 1983, Young worked with British video director  Tim Pope , making two videos - ""Wonderin'"" and ""Cry, Cry, Cry.""   In 1985, he reunited with Crosby, Stills and Nash at  Live Aid  at Philadelphia's  John F. Kennedy Stadium . The two songs that they played, ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"" and "" Daylight Again /Find The Cost of Freedom,"" were the first songs they had played as a quartet in front of a paying audience since 1974.   Old Ways  (1985) saw a return to country music, recorded with a group of friends and session musicians.  Landing on Water  (1986) is entertaining for the blending of synthesizers and other instruments related to the 1980s into Youngs own style, with lyrics that take pot shots at some favourite targets, including CSN in ""Hippie Dream,"" with a chorus that goes: ""But the wooden ships/Were just a hippie dream,"" and David Geffen in ""Drifter,"" with the line: ""Dont try to tell me what I gotta do to fit."" The resumption of his partnership with Crazy Horse on  Life  (1987) fulfilled his contract with Geffen, and Young was finally able to switch labels.   Director Pope again made a series of videos from the album, including ""Touch the Night"" and ""People on the Street"".   Signing with  Warner Brothers  (which distributed Geffen at the time) and returning to Reprise Records, Young produced  This Note's For You  (1988) with a new band, The Bluenotes, whose name rights were owned by musician  Harold Melvin . Young named his band after a cafe called the Blue Note on Main Street in Winnipeg Manitoba, where he had played. The addition of a  brass  section provided a new  jazzier  sound and the title track became his first hit single of the decade. Accompanied by a video which parodied corporate rock, the pretensions of advertising and  Michael Jackson  in particular, the song was initially banned by  MTV  (although the Canadian music channel,  MuchMusic  ran it immediately) before being put into heavy rotation and finally given the  MTV Video Music Award for Best Video of the Year  for 1989. After Melvin sued over the use of the Bluenotes name, Young renamed his back-up group ""Ten Men Workin'"" for the balance of the concert tour.   Young also contributed to that year's CSNY reunion  American Dream  (1988) and CSNY played a few benefit concerts. Young, however, refused to book a full tour with CSN and the foursome would not embark upon a nationwide tour until 2000.     [ edit ]   1990s - Return to country-rock roots   Freedom  was a mixture of acoustic and electric rock dealing with the state of the U.S. and the world in 1989, alongside a set of love songs and a version of the standard ""On Broadway."" "" Rockin' in the Free World "", two versions of which bookended the album, again caught the mood. Some say it became a  de facto  anthem during the fall of the  Berlin Wall , a few months after the record's release. However, most Germans don't remember the song being related to the unification, understandably so, since the lyrics are not about political repression. Like  Bruce Springsteen 's "" Born in the U.S.A. "", the anthemic use of this song was based on largely ignoring the verses, which evoke social problems and implicitly criticize American government policies. In mid-1989, record executive  Terry Tolkin  conceived and produced a tribute album to Young's songs called  The Bridge: A Tribute To Neil Young,  released on his  No.6 Records  label. It featured cover versions of 15 of Young's songs by the cream of the up and coming  Alternative Music  and  Grunge music  bands including  Sonic Youth ,  Nick Cave ,  Soul Asylum ,  Dinosaur Jr ,and  The Pixies . By 1990,  grunge music  was beginning to make its first inroads in the charts and many of its prime movers, including  Nirvana 's  Kurt Cobain  and  Pearl Jam 's  Eddie Vedder , cited Young as a major influence.   Using a barn on his  Northern California  ranch as a studio, he rapidly recorded  Ragged Glory  with Crazy Horse, whose guitar riffs and feedback driven sound showed his new admirers that he could still cut it. Young then headed back out on the road with Orange Country country-punk band  Social Distortion  and  alternative rock  elder statesmen  Sonic Youth  as support, much to the consternation of many of his old fans. [ 26 ] [ 27 ]  Yet the influence of Sonic Youth could be clearly heard on the accompanying home video and live album,  Weld , which also included a bonus CD entitled  Arc , a single 35-minute-long collage of  feedback  and guitar noise that Neil included, evidently at the suggestion of Sonic Youth's  Thurston Moore . [ 28 ]   Arc  was later sold separately.   Young's next move was another return to country music.  Harvest Moon  (1992) was the long-awaited sequel to  Harvest  and reunited him with some of the musicians from that session, as well as singers  Linda Ronstadt  and  James Taylor . The title track was a minor hit and the record was reviewed and sold equally well, containing songs such as ""From Hank to  Hendrix "" and ""Unknown Legend"", a tribute to his wife. His resurgent popularity saw him booked on  MTV Unplugged  in 1993. In 1992 he accompanied fellow  Winnipegger   Randy Bachman  on ""Prairie Town,"" a song that recounts their days in the Winnipeg music scene of the 1960s. That year, he contributed music to the  soundtrack  of the  Jonathan Demme  movie  Philadelphia , and his song ""Philadelphia"" was nominated for the  Academy Award for Best Song , losing out to Bruce Springsteen's contribution to the same film. A summer tour covering both Europe and North America with  Booker T. and the MGs  (with whom he played two songs at a 1992  Bob Dylan  tribute concert at  Madison Square Garden ) was widely praised as a triumph. On a few of these dates, the show ended with a rendition of ""Rockin' in the Free World"" played with  Pearl Jam .   Young was back with Crazy Horse for 1994's  Sleeps with Angels , a much darker record. The title track told the story of  Kurt Cobain 's death; Young had reportedly made repeated attempts to contact Cobain prior to this event. [ 29 ]  Cobain had quoted Young's ""It's better to burn out than fade away"" (a line from "" My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue) "") in his alleged  suicide note , causing Young to emphasize the line ""'cause once you're gone you can't come back"" in live performances at the time. Other songs dealt with drive-by shootings (""Driveby""),  environmentalism  (""Piece of Crap"") and Young's own vision of America (the archetypal car metaphor of ""Trans Am""). Young was inspired to make the record after viewing Cobain's performance on  MTV Unplugged . Still admired by the prime movers of grunge, Young eventually performed with Pearl Jam at the MTV Music Awards during what was described as the highlight of a lackluster show. [ 30 ]  Their collaboration led to a joint tour, with the band and producer  Brendan O'Brien  backing Young. The accompanying album,  Mirror Ball  (1995), recorded as live in the studio captured their loose rock sound, and featured the standout track ""I'm the Ocean"". The year of 1995 also featured Young's entry into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .   After composing an abstract, distorted feedback-led guitar instrumental soundtrack to  Jim Jarmusch 's  acid western  film  Dead Man  Young recorded a series of loose jams with Crazy Horse that eventually appeared as the critically denigrated  Broken Arrow . The return to Crazy Horse was prompted by the death of mentor, friend, and longtime  producer   David Briggs  in late 1995. The subsequent tours of Europe and North America in 1996 resulted in both a live album and a tour documentary directed by  Jim Jarmusch . Both releases took the name  Year of the Horse .   In 1997, Young participated in the  H.O.R.D.E. Festival 's sixth annual tour.   In 1998, Young shared the stage with the rock band  Phish  at the annual  Farm Aid  concert, and later offered them an opportunity to headline both nights of the Bridge School Benefit concert. Phish took Young up on his offer to headline the Bridge School Benefit (where Young joined Phish for renditions of ""Helpless"" and ""I Shall Be Released."" [ 31 ]  Phish, however, declined Young's later invitation to be his backing band on a 1999 tour. [ 32 ]   The decade ended with  Looking Forward , another reunion with Crosby, Stills and Nash. The subsequent tour of the United States and Canada with the reformed super quartet was a huge success and brought in earnings of $42.1 million, making it the eighth largest grossing tour of 2000.   Young's next album,  Silver & Gold  (2000), contained a number of understated songs with personal lyrics, which was promoted through a mini-tour of solo acoustic shows. This style was continued in  Are You Passionate?  (2002), an album of love songs dedicated to his wife, Pegi.     [ edit ]   In the aftermath of 9/11   Young's 2001 single "" Let's Roll "", was a tribute to the victims of the  September 11, 2001 attacks , and the passengers and crew on  Flight 93  in particular. At the "" America: A Tribute to Heroes "" concert he performed  John Lennon's  "" Imagine "". In 2002,  Q  magazine  named Neil Young in their list of the ""50 Bands To See Before You Die.""   Young hauled out his concept album  Greendale , about an extended family in a small town called Greendale, and how they are torn apart by a murder, in 2003.  Greendale  was recorded with Crazy Horse members Billy Talbot and Ralph Molina. This tale of the Green family also resulted in a movie called  Greendale , written and directed by Young (again using his ""Bernard Shakey"" pseudonym) and starring a few of his friends, who act out and  lip sync  the songs from the album. The film was indeed thoroughly experimental, from Young's rambling on-stage between-song narratives, to his reading apparent transcriptions of these ramblings in the liner notes. ""When I was writing this I had no idea what I was doing, so I was just as surprised as you are,"" Young said later. Young toured extensively with the  Greendale  material throughout 2003 and 2004, first with a solo, acoustic version in Europe, then with a full-cast stage show in North America,  Japan , and  Australia . While audience reaction was sometimes mixed (drunken requests for ""Southern Man"" being an aesthetic impediment at most Young performances), the live stage version of Greendale was for many critics the most satisfying incarnation of the material, and bootlegs of the shows have been widely traded. The second half of each concert consisted of high-decibel renditions of Young classics such as ""Hey Hey, My My,"" ""Cinnamon Girl,"" ""Powderfinger,"" and  Rockin' in the Free World , as well as rarities such as ""The Losing End,"" ""The Old Country Waltz,"" and ""Danger Bird.""   Young spent the latter portion of 2004 giving a series of intimate acoustic concerts in various cities with his wife, Pegi, who is a trained vocalist and guitar player.     [ edit ]   Recent events          From left,  Emmylou Harris , Neil Young and  Pegi Young  perform in  Neil Young: Heart of Gold , which offered renditions of some of Young's best-known songs.       On  March 31 ,  2005 , Young was admitted to a hospital in New York for treatment for a brain  aneurysm . He was treated successfully by a minimally invasive  neuroradiological  procedure. Prior to undergoing the procedure, he wrote the first eight songs of a new album,  Prairie Wind , in  Nashville , with session musicians that included regular Young sideman  Ben Keith  on lap and  pedal steel guitars . Two days after the procedure, Young was forced to cancel a scheduled appearance on the  Juno Awards  telecast in Winnipeg when the area where the surgeons did his procedure (via the  femoral artery ) suddenly began to bleed. While Young finally was able to return to Winnipeg in 2006 with Crosby, Stills and Nash, his first post-aneurysm performance was on  July 2 ,  2005 , at the close of the  Live 8  concert in  Barrie, Ontario . There, he debuted a new song, a soft hymn called ""When God Made Me.""   On  September 28 ,  2005 ,  Prairie Wind  was released. In an interview given to  Time  magazine , Young revealed that he had planned to keep the news of his aneurysm private until he had the bleeding scare, after which he decided to make news of his condition public. The last two songs on the album were written after his aneurysm procedure, and several of the songs, such as ""Fallin' Off the Face of the Earth,"" seem to be inspired by Young's brush with  mortality , the recent death of his father, who suffered from  senile dementia , and Young's  Manitoba  roots.   In 2006,  Neil Young: Heart of Gold , a film made by  Jonathan Demme , premiered at the  Sundance Film Festival . Filmed over two nights at the  Ryman Auditorium  in  Nashville, Tennessee  during the premiere of  Prairie Wind , it includes both new and old songs as well as behind-the scenes-commentary by Young, his wife Pegi, and members of Young's session band.   In April 2006, Young announced the release of  Living with War , an album of protest songs that included the provocatively-titled "" Let's Impeach the President ."" Recorded using his famous  Les Paul  electric guitar, "" Old Black ,"" along with Chad Cromwell (drums), Rick Rosas (bass), and Tommy Brea (trumpet), the album was intended to be a stinging rebuke of U.S. President  George W. Bush  and the  War in Iraq . The album was recorded in a two week period in April, and was then made available over the internet from 28 April 2006 before being released as a CD on 5 May.  Living With War  was Young's most talked about release for years, creating heated political debate and a return to form with perhaps his most critically-acclaimed album since the early 1990s.  Living With War: In the Beginning , a remixed version with the original album's choral backing vocals removed, was released in December of the same year. Its accompanying DVD featured videos directed by Young of every song on the album, footage of the  Iraq War  and demonstrations in the US, and clips from  Al Gore 's  An Inconvenient Truth .          Neil Young on the CSNY ""Freedom Of Speech Tour '06""       From July through September 2006, Neil Young reunited with his former bandmates from  Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young  for the ""Freedom Of Speech Tour '06"" across North America. Chad Cromwell and Rick Rosas made up the band's rhythm section. The entire  Living with War  album was performed on the tour, in addition to other CSN and Neil Young classics such as "" Ohio "" and "" Rockin' in the Free World ."" An accompanying concert film and live album, called  CSNY Deja Vu , were premiered on January 25, 2008, at the Sundance Movie Festival.   2006 also saw the first release from Young's long awaited  Archives  project, as  Live at the Fillmore East , a selection of songs drawn from a 1970 gig with  Crazy Horse , was released in November of that year. The release was marked as number two in the  Archives Performance Series , leaving room for the still-unreleased 1969  Riverboat  bootleg, which will be number one in the series. In March 2007, another historical live album, marked as the third in the  Performance Series , was released. Titled  Live at Massey Hall 1971 , it featured a solo acoustic set from Toronto's Massey Hall, including material from the upcoming  Harvest  album.   On  August 15 ,  2007 , Young played a new album for 100 people at Reprise Records entitled  Chrome Dreams II .  Chrome Dreams  was an album he scrapped in 1977, and the name of two different bootlegs. The new album includes two long songs that time in at 18:13 (""Ordinary People"") and 14:31 (""No Hidden Path""), respectively. The album consists of three songs written previously and seven new songs, all by Young. The album was released on October 23, 2007, timed to coincide with a seven-week tour that had kicked off in Boise, Idaho, ten days earlier.   On February 11, 2008, Neil Young started the European leg of his tour with a concert in  Antwerp ,  Belgium . On July 17, he was interviewed on  PBS  by  Charlie Rose , where he spoke about many things, including his project to make a hybrid 1959 Lincoln. [ 33 ]  In October, a BBC 4 documentary ""Neil Young - Don't be Denied"" was shown, featuring interviews with Neil and a number of his contemporaries. It also summarizes his biography and motivations. [ 34 ]   The latest album in the Performance Series,  Sugar Mountain - Live At Canterbury House 1968  was released on December 2, 2008. Featuring material from Young's earliest solo performances recorded in Ann Arbor, MI November 9, 1968, the album was released as number zero in the  Performance Series .   The first installment of Young's oft-delayed box set  The Archives Vol. 1 1963-1972  was officially announced in 2008 with a trailer.  [ 35 ]   [ 36 ]  The first set of Archives will feature both DVD and Blu-ray editions which will include 128 audio tracks (43 unreleased and 13 never before heard songs), thousands of images (photos, lyrics, letters and memorabilia), and hours of new, previously released and rare videos. Also included will be a 236 page hardbound book. The Blu-ray edition will have HD picture, pristine audio mastered and presented in 24bit 192 khz., and access to photos, trivia and memorabilia without stopping the music. It is currently scheduled for release in 2009.   A April 07,2009 date has been set for Neil's new album 'A Fork in The Road', which will delay the release of the Archives until later in 2009. A new film by Jonathan Demme of Neil Young in concert (Upper Darby, Pennsylvania 2007) called the Neil Young Trunk Show will premiere at the South by Southwest (SXSW) Film Conference and Festival, on Saturday, March 21,2009 at the Paramount Theatre in Austin, Texas.   Young headlined the 2009  Big Day Out  festival in  New Zealand  and  Australia . Young pushed other current mainstream bands to only secondary headlining, including  Arctic Monkeys  and  The Ting Tings . He is rumored to be headlining the Friday at  Glastonbury Festival  which has attempted to book him for many years. Although not officially confirmed, a number of sources have suggested this. [ 37 ]  He has also been confirmed to play the Primavera Festival, Barcelona in May 2009 and the Isle of Wight Festival [ 38 ]  in the UK, June 2009.   Young currently lives on a 1500-acre (6 km) ranch in  La Honda, California , called Broken Arrow. He also owns property in  Fort Lauderdale, Florida , and on the islands of  Hawaii .     [ edit ]   Influence, importance and inspiration   Neil Young has undeniably been an important artist in the history of American and Canadian popular music and remains a distinct influence upon other recording artists.  Lynyrd Skynyrd s "" Sweet Home Alabama "" was written in response to two of Neil Youngs songs ""Southern Man"" and ""Alabama"". ""Ohio"" which Young recorded with Crosby, Stills and Nash, was a recollection of the tragic events that transpired at Kent State University in May 1970. Young's willingness to be politically outspoken and socially conscious allowed him to influence such important artists such as  Phish ,  Pearl Jam , and  Nirvana . Neil Young is referred to as ""the Godfather of  Grunge "" because of the influence he had on  Kurt Cobain  and  Eddie Vedder  and the entire grunge movement. Kurt Cobain quoted Neil Young in his suicide note, using the line Its better to burn out, than to fade away from Youngs song ""My My, Hey Hey (Out Of The Blue)"". Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam inducted Neil Young into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, citing him as a huge influence. He has also been a big influence on  experimental rock  acts like  Sonic Youth  and  Radiohead . Youngs influence, importance and inspiration within the music scene derive in part from his longevity because of a career spanning more than four decades. His first album was released in 1966 and his latest in 2008.  Bob Dylan 's influence on Young has been so obvious that the former once lambasted: "" Heart of Gold  bothered me every time it came on the radio ... and I'd say, 'Shit, that's me. If it sounds like me it might as well be me. (...) It seemed somebody else had taken my thing and had run away with it, you know, and I never got over it. Maybe tomorrow"" [ 39 ] .   The Australian rock group  Powderfinger  attribute their group name to their love of Young.   Toronto  based band  Constantines  recorded a version of Neil's  Fuckin' Up  in  Winnipeg , [ 40 ] which surfaced at the b-side the their ""Our Age"" 7"" [ 41 ] in November 2008. The members of the  Constantines  have occasionally played shows under the name Horsey Craze [ 42 ] , singing Neil Young songs. In early 2006, they released a vinyl only split-album with The Unintended. The Constantines recorded four Neil Young songs for the LP, while The Unintended performed four Gordon Lightfoot songs.   While in Winnipeg on November 2, 2008 during the Canadian leg of his tour,  Bob Dylan  visited Young's former home in River Heights. The home was where Neil spent some of his teenage years. Dylan was interested in seeing the room where some of Neil's first songs were composed.     [ edit ]   Achievements   Young was inducted into the  Canadian Music Hall of Fame  in 1982. He has been inducted into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  twice: first in 1995 for his solo work, with an induction speech given by  Eddie Vedder , and again in 1997 as a member of Buffalo Springfield.   He has also directed five movies under his pseudonym Bernard Shakey, and released them through his own Shakey Pictures imprint:  Journey Through the Past  (1973),  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979)  Human Highway  (1982) (starring new wave band  Devo ), and  Greendale  (2003) and the documentary,  CSNY Deja Vu  (2008). The bonus  DVDs  included in both versions of  Greendale  and in  Prairie Wind  are also directed by Young under the Bernard Shakey alias, and all of Young's home video and DVD releases have been co-released under the Shakey Pictures imprint.   As one of the original founders of  Farm Aid , he remains an active member of the board of directors. For one weekend each October, in  Mountain View, California , he and his wife host the  Bridge School Concerts , which have been drawing international talent and sell-out crowds for nearly two decades with some of the biggest names in rock having performed at the event including  Bruce Springsteen ,  David Bowie ,  The Who ,  Red Hot Chili Peppers ,  Trent Reznor  of  Nine Inch Nails ,  Pearl Jam ,  Sonic Youth  and Sir  Paul McCartney . The concerts are a benefit for the  Bridge School , which develops and uses advanced technologies to aid in the instruction of children with disabilities. Young's involvement stems at least partially from the fact that both of his sons have  cerebral palsy  and his daughter, like Young himself, has  epilepsy .   Young was nominated for an  Oscar  in 1994 for his song ""Philadelphia"" from the film  Philadelphia  (Bruce Springsteen won the award for his song "" Streets of Philadelphia "" from the same film). In his acceptance speech, Springsteen said that ""the award really deserved to be shared by the other nominee's song."" That same night,  Tom Hanks  accepted the Oscar for Best Actor and gave credit for his inspiration to the song ""Philadelphia"".   He was part owner of  Lionel, LLC , a company that makes toy trains and model railroad accessories. [ 43 ]  In 2008 Lionel emerged from bankruptcy and his shares of the company were wiped out. At this time his status with Lionel is unknown, according to Lionel CEO Jerry Calabrese he is still a consultant for Lionel. He was instrumental in the design of the Lionel Legacy control system for model trains [ 43 ]  and it is believed he will continue to develop the system. Young has been named as co-inventor on seven U.S. Patents related to model trains. [ 44 ]   Young has twice received honorary doctorates. He received an Honorary Doctorate of Music from  Lakehead University  in  Thunder Bay ,  Ontario  in 1992, and an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from  San Francisco State University  in 2006. The latter honour was shared with his wife Pegi for their creation of the Bridge School.   In a ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"" list in the June 1996 issue of  Mojo  magazine , Young was ranked No. 9.   In 2003, Rolling Stone listed Young at #83 in its rankings of ""The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time,"" describing him as a ""restless experimenter...who transform[s] the most obvious music into something revelatory."" [ 45 ]   In 2000, Young was inducted into  Canada's Walk of Fame . [ 46 ]  He ranked No. 39 on  VH1 's 100 Greatest Artist of Hard Rock  that same year.   In 2001, Young was awarded the Spirit of Liberty award from the civil liberties group  People for the American Way .   In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked Neil Young [ 47 ]  #34 on their list of the  100 Greatest Artists of All Time . [ 48 ]   In 2006, Paste Magazine compiled a ""Greatest Living Songwriters"" list; Young was ranked No. 2 behind  Bob Dylan . (While Young and Dylan have occasionally played together in concert, they have never collaborated on a song together, or played on each others' records).   Jason Bond, an  East Carolina University  biologist, discovered a new species of trapdoor spider in 2007 and named it  Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi  after Young, his favorite singer (a previous similar case was the dinousar  Masiakasaurus knopfleri  named after the musician  Mark Knopfler  of  Dire Straits ). [ 49 ]   In 2008, Rolling Stone ranked Young at #37 in its list of ""The 100 Greatest Singers of All-Time. [ 50 ]   In 2009, He was nominated for a Grammy for Best Solo Rock Vocal performance.     [ edit ]   Instruments          Neil Young, 2008 in  Florence       Neil Young is a collector of second-hand guitars, but in recording and performing, he frequently uses just a few instruments. As explained by his longtime guitar technician  Larry Cragg  in the film  Neil Young: Heart of Gold , they include:     1953  Gibson Les Paul Goldtop Nicknamed "" Old Black "", this is Young's primary  electric guitar  and is featured on  Rust Never Sleeps  and most other albums. Old Black got its name from a purely amateur paintjob applied to the originally-gold body of the instrument, sometime before Neil acquired the guitar in the late 1960s. In 1972, a mini- humbucker  pickup from a  Gibson Firebird  guitar was installed into the lead/treble position, replacing a  P-90  as standard on Les Paul guitars from that era. This pickup, severely  microphonic , is considered a crucial component of Neil's sound. A  Bigsby vibrato tailpiece  was installed as early as 1969 on the guitar, and can be heard clearly during the opening of ""Cowgirl in the Sand"" from  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere . This guitar also features a mini-switch that is used to send the signal from the mini-humbucker direct to the amp, without going through the volume or tone controls. A Les Paul Gold Top of the same year as Old Black was assembled by Neil's guitar tech, using same style Firebird pick up in the guitar as well as the same model Bigsby Vib; but, according to Young, was just not the same as the original. Young acquired Old Black from Jim Messina, swapping one of his Gretsches for it in 1969 while Messina was assisting Young on his first solo album. Messina, who played briefly in Buffalo Springfield and produced the band's final album, ""Last Time Around,"" still has the Gretch in his possession.       Martin D-45 His primary  steel-string acoustic guitar ; used to write ""Old Man"" and many other hit songs.   Martin D-28Nicknamed ""Hank"" after its previous owner,  Hank Williams . The guitar came into Young's possession after  Hank Williams, Jr.  had traded it to another owner for some shotguns and it went through a succession of other owners until it was located by Young's longtime friend Grant Boatwright. The guitar was purchased by Young from  Tut Taylor . Young has toured with it for over 30 years. A story about the guitar and inspired song known as ""This Old Guitar"" can be seen about 50 minutes into the film  Neil Young: Heart of Gold . It is Young's primary guitar for the album,  Prairie Wind .   Neil Young can be seen playing a Vagabond Travel Guitar as he sings ""Let's Impeach the President"" on  The Colbert Report  on  Comedy Central .   A 12-string Taylor 855 is used in the first half of the soundtrack and concert film ""Rust Never Sleeps""   1927  Gibson  MastertoneA six-string  banjo , tuned like a guitar. It has been used on many recordings and was played by  James Taylor  on ""Old Man"".   Various vintage  Fender Tweed Deluxe  amplifiers Young's preferred amplifier for electric guitar is the diminutive Fender Deluxe, specifically a Tweed-era model from 1959. Neil purchased his first vintage Deluxe in 1967 for $50 from the drummer of Crazy Horse, Ralph Molina, and has since acquired nearly 450 different examples, all from the same era, but he maintains that it's the original model that sounds superior, and is a crucial component to his trademark sound. The Tweed Deluxe is almost always used in conjunction with a late-1950's Magnatone 280 (similar to the amp used by Lonnie Mack and Buddy Holly). The Magnatone and the Deluxe are paired together in a somewhat unique manner - the external speaker jack from the Deluxe sends the amped signal through a volume potentiometer and directly into the input of the Magnatone. The Magnatone is notable for its true pitch-bending vibrato capabilities, which can be heard as an electric piano amplifier on ""See the Sky About to Rain"". A notable and unique accessory to Young's Deluxe is the Whizzer, a device created specifically for Young, which physically changes the amplifier's settings to pre-set combinations. It has gone through many incarnations.   Gretsch 6120  (Chet Atkins)Before Young bought Old Black, this was his primary electric guitar used during his  Buffalo Springfield  days.   Gretsch White Falcon   Late '50s hollow body that Young purchased near the end of the  Buffalo Springfield  era; in 1969 Young acquired a stereo version of the same vintage guitar from Stills, and this instrument is featured prominently during Young's early '70s period, and can be heard on tracks like ""Ohio,"" ""Southern Man,"" ""Alabama,"" ""L.A.,"" others. It is Neil's primary electric guitar during the  Harvest  era. This particular White Falcon is the stereo 6137, in which the signal from the three bass strings is separated from the signal from the three treble strings. Young typically plays this guitar in this stereo mode, sending the separate signals to two different amps: the Fender Deluxe and typically to either a Fender Tremolux or a low-powered Tweed Fender Twin. The separation of the signals is most prominently heard on the Harvest album song ""Words"".   Neil Young replaced his trademark Les Paul for a Gibson Flying V on the ""Time Fades Away"" tour.   Neil Young played a  Fender Broadcaster  on the Tonight's the Night tour and album.

Young's work is characterized by deeply personal lyrics, distinctive guitar work, and signature falsetto  tenor  singing voice. Although he accompanies himself on several different instrumentsincluding  piano  and  harmonica his claw-hammer  acoustic guitar  style and often idiosyncratic electric guitar soloing are the linchpins of a sometimes ragged, sometimes polished sound. Although Young has experimented widely with differing music styles, including  swing ,  jazz ,  rockabilly ,  blues , and  electronic music  throughout a varied career, his best known work usually falls into either of two distinct styles:  folk -esque  acoustic   rock  ("" Heart of Gold "", ""Harvest Moon"" and "" Old Man "") and  electric -charged  hard rock  (like "" Cinnamon Girl "", "" Rockin' in the Free World "" and "" Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black) ""). In recent years, Young has adopted elements from newer styles like  industrial ,  alternative country  and  grunge . Young's profound influence on the latter caused some to dub him ""the godfather of grunge"".   Young has directed (or co-directed) a number of  films  using the  pseudonym  Bernard Shakey, including  Journey Through the Past  (1973),  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979),  Human Highway  (1982),  Greendale  (2003), and  CSNY Dj Vu  (2008). He is currently working on a documentary about electric car technology, tentatively titled  Linc/Volt .   He is also an outspoken advocate for environmental issues and small farmers, having co-founded in 1985 the  benefit concert   Farm Aid , and in 1986 helped found The Bridge School, [ 2 ]  and its annual supporting  Bridge School Benefit  concerts, together with his wife Pegi (in this, Young's involvement stems at least partially from the fact that both of his sons have  cerebral palsy  and his daughter, like Young himself, has  epilepsy ).   Although Young sings as frequently about U.S. legends and myths ( Pocahontas ,  space stations , and the settlement of the American West) [ 3 ]  as he does about his native country, he remains a Canadian citizen and has never wanted to relinquish his Canadian citizenship. He has lived in the U.S. for ""so long"" and has stated he has ""got just as much right to vote in them (American elections) as anybody else.""

He spent his early years in the small country town of  Omemee , 130  kilometres  (81  mi ) northeast of Toronto.   Young was diagnosed with diabetes as a child [ 5 ]  and a bout of  polio  at the age of 6 left him with a weakened left side; he still walks with a slight limp.   His parents divorced when Young was 12, and he moved with his mother back to the family home of  Winnipeg , Manitoba, where the formative years of his music career began. Neil and his mother Rassy settled into the working class suburb of  Fort Rouge  where the shy, dry-humoured youth enrolled at Earl Grey Junior High School. It was there that he formed his first band  the Jades , and met  Ken Koblun , later to join him in the Squires.   While attending  Kelvin High School  in Winnipeg, he played in several instrumental rock bands. Young's first stable band was called the Squires, who had a local hit called ""The Sultan"". Young dropped out of high school [ 6 ]  and also played in  Fort William , where they recorded a series of demos produced by a local producer named Ray Dee, whom Young called ""the original Briggs."" [ 7 ]  While in Thunder Bay, Young first encountered  Stephen Stills . In the  2006  film  Heart of Gold  Young relates how he used to spend time as a teenager at  Falcon Lake, Manitoba  where he would endlessly plug coins into the jukebox to hear  Ian Tyson 's "" Four Strong Winds "". Neil also formed a friendship with musician  Randy Bachman .   After leaving the Squires, Neil worked folk clubs in Winnipeg, where he first met  Joni Mitchell . [ 8 ]  Here he wrote some of his earliest and most enduring folk songs such as the classic "" Sugar Mountain "", about his lost youth. Mitchell wrote ""The Circle Game"" in response. [ citation needed ]   In 1965 Young toured Canada as a solo artist. In 1966, he joined the  Rick James -fronted  Mynah Birds . The band managed to secure a record deal with the  Motown  label, but as their first album was being recorded, James was arrested for being  AWOL  from the army. [ 9 ]  After the Mynah Birds disbanded, Young and bass player  Bruce Palmer  relocated to  Los Angeles . Young has admitted in an interview that he was in the United States illegally until receiving a green card in 1970. [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Buffalo Springfield   Once they reached Los Angeles, Young and Palmer met up with  Stephen Stills ,  Richie Furay , and  Dewey Martin  to form  Buffalo Springfield . A mixture of folk, country,  psychedelia , and rock lent a hard edge by the twin lead guitars of Stills and Young made Buffalo Springfield a critical success, and their first record  Buffalo Springfield  (1967) sold well after Stills' topical song "" For What It's Worth "" became a hit, aided by Young's melodic harmonics played on electric guitar.   Distrust of their management, as well as the arrest and deportation of Palmer, exacerbated the already strained relations among the group members and led to Buffalo Springfield's demise. A second album,  Buffalo Springfield Again , was released in late 1967, but two of Youngs three contributions were solo tracks recorded apart from the rest of the group.   In many ways, these three songs on  Buffalo Springfield Again  are harbingers of much of Young's later work in that, although they all share deeply personal, almost idiosyncratic lyrics, they also present three very different musical approaches to the arrangement of what is essentially an original folk song. ""Mr Soul"" is the only Young song of the three that all five members of the group perform together. In contrast, "" Broken Arrow "" was confessional folk rock of a kind that would characterize much of the music that emerged from the singer-songwriter movement. Youngs experimental production intersperses each verse with snippets of sound from other sources, including opening the song with a sound bite of Dewey Martin singing ""Mr. Soul"" and closing it with the thumping of a heartbeat. ""Expecting to Fly"" was a lushly produced  ballad  featuring a string arrangement that Young's co-producer for the track,  Jack Nitzsche , would dub ""symphonic pop.""   In May 1968, the band split up for good, but in order to fulfill a contractual obligation, a final album,  Last Time Around , was recorded, primarily from recordings made earlier that year. Young contributed the songs ""On the Way Home"" and ""I Am a Child"", singing lead on the latter. In 1997, the band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame; Young did not appear at the ceremony.     [ edit ]   Solo success & CSNY   After the breakup of Buffalo Springfield, Young signed a solo deal with  Reprise Records , home of his colleague and friend  Joni Mitchell , with whom he shared a manager, Elliot Roberts, who manages Young to this day. Young and Nitzsche immediately began work on Young's first solo record,  Neil Young  (November 1968), which received mixed reviews. In a 1970 interview, [ 11 ]  Young deprecated the album as being ""overdubbed rather than played,"" and the quest for music that expresses the spontaneity of the moment has long been a feature of his career. Nevertheless, the album contains some tunes that remain a staple of his live shows, most notably ""The Loner.""   For his next album, Young recruited three musicians from a band called The Rockets:  Danny Whitten  on guitar,  Billy Talbot  on bass guitar, and  Ralph Molina  on  drums . These three took the name  Crazy Horse  (after  the historical figure of the same name ), and  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere  (May 1969), is credited to ""Neil Young with Crazy Horse."" Recorded in just two weeks, the album opens with one of Young's most familiar songs, ""Cinnamon Girl,"" and is dominated by two more, ""Cowgirl in the Sand"" and ""Down by the River,"" that feature lengthy jams showcasing Young's idiosyncratic guitar soloing accompanied sympathetically by Crazy Horse. Young reportedly wrote all three songs on the same day, while nursing a high fever of 103 F (39.5 C) in bed.   Shortly after the release of  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere , Young reunited with Stephen Stills by joining  Crosby, Stills, & Nash , who had already released one album as a trio. Young was originally offered a position as a sideman, but agreed to join only if he received full membership, and the group - winners of the 1969 ""Best New Artist"" Grammy - was renamed Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. [ 12 ]  The quartet debuted in  Chicago  on  August 16 ,  1969 , and later performed at the famous  Woodstock Festival , during which Young skipped the acoustic set and refused to be filmed during the electric set, even telling the cameramen: ""One of you fuckin' guys comes near me and I'm gonna fuckin' hit you with my guitar"". [ 13 ]  During the making of their first album,  Dj Vu , the musicians frequently argued, particularly Young and Stills, who both fought for control. [ 14 ]   "" Ohio "" was written following the  Kent State massacre  on  May 4 ,  1970 , and was a staple of anti-war rallies in the 1970s. The song was quickly recorded by CSNY and immediately released as a single, even though CSNY's ""Teach Your Children"" was still climbing the singles charts. Many believe that the release of ""Ohio"" as a single cut into the sales of ""Teach Your Children"" and prevented that song from reaching the top ten. In the late 1970s and for much of the 1980s, Young refrained from performing ""Ohio"" live, as he considered the song to be dated. In the wake of the 1989  Tiananmen Square massacre , however, Young revived the song in concert, often dedicating it to the  Chinese  students who were killed in the massacre. Crosby, Stills & Nash, as a trio, also returned the song to their live repertoire around the same time, even though Young had provided the lead vocals on the original recording.   Also that year, Young released his third solo album,  After the Gold Rush  (1970), which featured, among others, a young  Nils Lofgren ,  Stephen Stills , and CSNY bassist Greg Reeves. Young also recorded some tracks with Crazy Horse, but dismissed them early in the sessions. Aided by his newfound fame with CSNY, the album was a commercial breakthrough for Young and contains some of his best known work. Notable tracks include the title track, with dream-like lyrics that run a gamut of subjects from drugs and interpersonal relationships to environmental concerns, as well as Youngs controversial and acerbic condemnation of  racism  in "" Southern Man ,"" which, along with a later song entitled ""Alabama,"" later prompted  Lynyrd Skynyrd  to decry Young by name in the lyrics to "" Sweet Home Alabama ."" Young was one of Skynyrd's biggest influences, and Young was an admirer of Skynyrd's music. The respectful rivalry and friendship between Young and Skynyrd front man  Ronnie Van Zant  would serve as a recurring theme in the  Drive-By Truckers ' 2001  concept album   Southern Rock Opera .   With CSNY splitting up and Crazy Horse having signed their own record deal, Young began the year 1971 with a solo tour entitled ""Journey Through the Past."" Later, he recruited a new group of country-music session musicians, whom he christened  The Stray Gators , to record much of the new material that had been premiered on tour for the album  Harvest  (1972).  Harvest  was a massive hit (especially with the country-music crowd) and ""Heart of Gold"" became a US number one single; incidentally, to this day it remains the only No. 1 hit in his long career.   Another notable song was "" The Needle and the Damage Done ,"" a somber lament on the pain caused by heroin addiction; inspired in part by the heavy heroin use of Crazy Horse member Danny Whitten, who would eventually die of an overdose. [ 15 ]   The album's success, however, caught Young off guard, and his first instinct was to back away from stardom. In the handwritten liner notes to the  Decade  compilation, Young described ""Heart of Gold"" as the song that ""put me in the middle of the road. Traveling there soon became a bore, so I headed for the ditch. A rougher ride but I saw more interesting people there.""   On  September 8 ,  1972 , the Academy Award-nominated actress  Carrie Snodgress , with whom he had been living, gave birth to Neil Young's first child. The boy, Zeke, was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Young fell in love with Snodgress after seeing her in a movie (""Diary of a Mad Housewife"") on television after which Young wrote the song "" A Man Needs a Maid "" from the Harvest album, featuring the lyric ""I fell in love with the actress/she was playing a part that I could understand.""     [ edit ]   The Ditch Trilogy   Although a new tour had been planned to follow up on the success of  Harvest , it became apparent during rehearsals that Danny Whitten could not function due to  drug abuse . On  November 18 , 1972, shortly after he was fired from the tour preparations, Whitten was found dead of an  overdose . Young described the incident to  Rolling Stone s  Cameron Crowe  in 1975:  [ 16 ]  ""[We] were rehearsing with him and he just couldn't cut it. He couldn't remember anything. He was too out of it. Too far gone. I had to tell him to go back to L.A. 'It's not happening, man. You're not together enough.' He just said, 'I've got nowhere else to go, man. How am I gonna tell my friends?' And he split. That night the coroner called me from L.A. and told me he'd ODed. That blew my mind. Fucking blew my mind. I loved Danny. I felt responsible. And from there, I had to go right out on this huge tour of huge arenas. I was very nervous and  insecure.""   The album made in the aftermath of this incident,  Time Fades Away  (1973), has often been described by Young as ""my least favourite record,"" and it is, in fact, one of only two of Youngs early recordings that has yet to be officially re-released on CD (the other being the soundtrack album  Journey Through the Past ). The album was recorded live over a tour where Young struggled with his voice and called  David Crosby  and  Graham Nash  to help perform the music. The tour featured  Linda Ronstadt  as the opening act.  Time Fades Away  occupies a unique position in Youngs discography as the first of three albums known collectively as the "" Ditch Trilogy .""   In the second half of 1973, Young formed The Santa Monica Flyers, with Crazy Horse's rhythm section augmented by Nils Lofgren on guitar. Deeply affected by the drug-induced deaths of Whitten and  roadie   Bruce Berry , Young recorded  Tonight's the Night . The album's dark tone and rawness caused Reprise to delay the release until two years later and only after being pressured by Young to do so. [ 17 ]  It received mixed reviews at the time, but is now regarded as a landmark album, thought by some to be a precursor to  punk rock . In Young's own opinion, it was the closest he ever came to art. [ 18 ]   While his record company delayed the release of  Tonight's the Night,  Young recorded  On the Beach  (1974), which dealt with themes such as the downside of fame and the Californian lifestyle. Like  Time Fades Away  and  Tonight's the Night , it sold poorly but eventually became a critical favourite, presenting some of Young's most original work. In a review of the 2003 re-release on CD of  On the Beach  Derek Svennungsen described the music as ""mesmerizing, harrowing, lucid, and bleary,"" [ 19 ] .     [ edit ]   Return to prominence   After completing  On the Beach , Young reunited with  Harvest  producer Elliot Mazer to record another acoustic album,  Homegrown . Most of the songs were written after Young's breakup with Snodgress, and thus the tone of the album was somewhat dark. Though the album was entirely completed, Young decided to drop the album and release  Tonight's the Night  instead, at the suggestion of  The Band  bassist  Rick Danko . [ 20 ]  Young further explained his move by saying: ""It was a little too personal... it scared me"". [ 21 ]          Neil Young in Austin, Texas on November 9, 1976       Young reformed Crazy Horse with  Frank Sampedro  on guitar as his backup band for  Zuma  (1975). Many of the songs are overtly concerned with failed relationships, and even the epic "" Cortez the Killer ,"" outwardly a retelling of the  Spanish conquest  of  Mexico  from the viewpoint of the  Aztecs , can be seen as an allegory of love lostsomething that didnt save it, however, from being banned in  Franco 's  Spain .   The following year, Young reunited with Stephen Stills for the album  Long May You Run  (1976), credited to  The Stills-Young Band ; the follow-up tour was ended midway through by Young, who sent Stills a  telegram  that read: ""Funny how some things that start spontaneously end that way. Eat a peach, Neil."" [ 22 ]   In 1976, Young performed with  The Band , Joni Mitchell, and other rock musicians in the high profile all-star concert  The Last Waltz . The release of  Martin Scorsese 's movie of the concert was delayed while Scorsese unwillingly re-edited it to obscure the lump of cocaine that was clearly visible hanging from Young's nose during his performance of  ""Helpless."" [ 23 ]  Young later said, ""I'm not proud of that,"" according to one of his biographers.   American Stars 'N Bars  (1977) contained two songs originally recorded for  Homegrown  album, ""Homegrown"" and ""Star of Bethelehem,"" as well as newer material, including the future concert staple "" Like A Hurricane "". Performers included  Linda Ronstadt ,  Emmylou Harris  and Young protg  Nicolette Larson  along with Crazy Horse. Also in 1977, Young released  Decade : a personally selected career summary of material spanning every aspect of his various interests and affiliations, including a handful of unreleased songs.  Comes a Time  (1978) also featured Nicolette Larson and Crazy Horse and became Young's most commercially accessible album in quite some time, marked by a return to his folk roots.   Young next set out on the lengthy ""Rust Never Sleeps"" tour, in which each concert was divided into a solo acoustic set and an electric set with Crazy Horse. Much of the electric set was later seen as a response to punk rock's burgeoning popularity. ""Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)"" compared the changing public perception of  Johnny Rotten  with that of the recently deceased  Elvis Presley , who himself had once been disparaged as a dangerous influence only to later become an  icon . Rotten, meanwhile, returned the favour by playing one of Young's records on a  London  radio show. The accompanying albums  Rust Never Sleeps  (new material, culled from live recordings, but featuring studio overdubs) and  Live Rust  (a mixture of old and new, and a genuine concert recording) captured the two sides of the concerts, with solo acoustic songs on side A, and fierce, uptempo, electric songs on side B. A movie version of the concerts, also called  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979), was directed by Young under the pseudonym Bernard Shakey.   Young was suddenly hip again, and the readers and critics of  Rolling Stone  voted him Artist Of The Year for 1979 (along with The Who), selected  Rust Never Sleeps  as Album Of The Year, and voted him Male Vocalist Of The Year as well.  The Village Voice , meanwhile, honored Young as the Artist of the Decade.     [ edit ]   1980s - Experimental years   The 1980s were a lean time for Young both critically and commercially. After providing the incidental music to a  biopic  of  Hunter S. Thompson  entitled  Where the Buffalo Roam , he recorded  Hawks & Doves  (1980), a folk/country record.  Re-ac-tor  (1981), once again with Crazy Horse, was a faade of distortion and feedback obscuring a relatively weak selection of songs, but his strangest record of the decade came with  Trans  (1982). Recorded partially with  vocoders ,  synthesizers , and other devices that modified instruments and vocals with electronic effects, it is sometimes considered an experiment related to finding a technology that would become a means to communicate for Youngs son (with his wife Pegi), Ben, who has severe  cerebral palsy  and cannot speak. Many fans were baffled by the radical forms of this album and  rockabilly -styled  Everybody's Rockin'  (1983), and record company head  David Geffen  even sued Young for making ""unrepresentative"" musici.e. music that did not sound like Neil Youngthat deliberately lacked commercial appeal. [ 24 ]  Young later stated that he would have preferred to release the songs featuring the  synclavier  and  vocoder  as an EP, and that their inclusion with the Hawaiian-themed rockabilly was a mistake. Also premiered at this time though little seen was an eclectic full-length comedy film  Human Highway  starring, co-directed and co-written by Young.   In 1983, Young worked with British video director  Tim Pope , making two videos - ""Wonderin'"" and ""Cry, Cry, Cry.""   In 1985, he reunited with Crosby, Stills and Nash at  Live Aid  at Philadelphia's  John F. Kennedy Stadium . The two songs that they played, ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"" and "" Daylight Again /Find The Cost of Freedom,"" were the first songs they had played as a quartet in front of a paying audience since 1974.   Old Ways  (1985) saw a return to country music, recorded with a group of friends and session musicians.  Landing on Water  (1986) is entertaining for the blending of synthesizers and other instruments related to the 1980s into Youngs own style, with lyrics that take pot shots at some favourite targets, including CSN in ""Hippie Dream,"" with a chorus that goes: ""But the wooden ships/Were just a hippie dream,"" and David Geffen in ""Drifter,"" with the line: ""Dont try to tell me what I gotta do to fit."" The resumption of his partnership with Crazy Horse on  Life  (1987) fulfilled his contract with Geffen, and Young was finally able to switch labels.   Director Pope again made a series of videos from the album, including ""Touch the Night"" and ""People on the Street"".   Signing with  Warner Brothers  (which distributed Geffen at the time) and returning to Reprise Records, Young produced  This Note's For You  (1988) with a new band, The Bluenotes, whose name rights were owned by musician  Harold Melvin . Young named his band after a cafe called the Blue Note on Main Street in Winnipeg Manitoba, where he had played. The addition of a  brass  section provided a new  jazzier  sound and the title track became his first hit single of the decade. Accompanied by a video which parodied corporate rock, the pretensions of advertising and  Michael Jackson  in particular, the song was initially banned by  MTV  (although the Canadian music channel,  MuchMusic  ran it immediately) before being put into heavy rotation and finally given the  MTV Video Music Award for Best Video of the Year  for 1989. After Melvin sued over the use of the Bluenotes name, Young renamed his back-up group ""Ten Men Workin'"" for the balance of the concert tour.   Young also contributed to that year's CSNY reunion  American Dream  (1988) and CSNY played a few benefit concerts. Young, however, refused to book a full tour with CSN and the foursome would not embark upon a nationwide tour until 2000.     [ edit ]   1990s - Return to country-rock roots   Freedom  was a mixture of acoustic and electric rock dealing with the state of the U.S. and the world in 1989, alongside a set of love songs and a version of the standard ""On Broadway."" "" Rockin' in the Free World "", two versions of which bookended the album, again caught the mood. Some say it became a  de facto  anthem during the fall of the  Berlin Wall , a few months after the record's release. However, most Germans don't remember the song being related to the unification, understandably so, since the lyrics are not about political repression. Like  Bruce Springsteen 's "" Born in the U.S.A. "", the anthemic use of this song was based on largely ignoring the verses, which evoke social problems and implicitly criticize American government policies. In mid-1989, record executive  Terry Tolkin  conceived and produced a tribute album to Young's songs called  The Bridge: A Tribute To Neil Young,  released on his  No.6 Records  label. It featured cover versions of 15 of Young's songs by the cream of the up and coming  Alternative Music  and  Grunge music  bands including  Sonic Youth ,  Nick Cave ,  Soul Asylum ,  Dinosaur Jr ,and  The Pixies . By 1990,  grunge music  was beginning to make its first inroads in the charts and many of its prime movers, including  Nirvana 's  Kurt Cobain  and  Pearl Jam 's  Eddie Vedder , cited Young as a major influence.   Using a barn on his  Northern California  ranch as a studio, he rapidly recorded  Ragged Glory  with Crazy Horse, whose guitar riffs and feedback driven sound showed his new admirers that he could still cut it. Young then headed back out on the road with Orange Country country-punk band  Social Distortion  and  alternative rock  elder statesmen  Sonic Youth  as support, much to the consternation of many of his old fans. [ 25 ] [ 26 ]  Yet the influence of Sonic Youth could be clearly heard on the accompanying home video and live album,  Weld , which also included a bonus CD entitled  Arc , a single 35-minute-long collage of  feedback  and guitar noise that Neil included, evidently at the suggestion of Sonic Youth's  Thurston Moore . [ 27 ]   Arc  was later sold separately.   Young's next move was another return to country music.  Harvest Moon  (1992) was the long-awaited sequel to  Harvest  and reunited him with some of the musicians from that session, as well as singers  Linda Ronstadt  and  James Taylor . The title track was a minor hit and the record was reviewed and sold equally well, containing songs such as ""From Hank to  Hendrix "" and ""Unknown Legend"", a tribute to his wife. His resurgent popularity saw him booked on  MTV Unplugged  in 1993. In 1992 he accompanied fellow  Winnipegger   Randy Bachman  on ""Prairie Town,"" a song that recounts their days in the Winnipeg music scene of the 1960s. That year, he contributed music to the  soundtrack  of the  Jonathan Demme  movie  Philadelphia , and his song ""Philadelphia"" was nominated for the  Academy Award for Best Song , losing out to Bruce Springsteen's contribution to the same film. A summer tour covering both Europe and North America with  Booker T. and the MGs  (with whom he played two songs at a 1992  Bob Dylan  tribute concert at  Madison Square Garden ) was widely praised as a triumph. On a few of these dates, the show ended with a rendition of ""Rockin' in the Free World"" played with  Pearl Jam .   Young was back with Crazy Horse for 1994's  Sleeps with Angels , a much darker record. The title track told the story of  Kurt Cobain 's death; Young had reportedly made repeated attempts to contact Cobain prior to this event. [ 28 ]  Cobain had quoted Young's ""It's better to burn out than fade away"" (a line from "" My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue) "") in his alleged  suicide note , causing Young to emphasize the line ""'cause once you're gone you can't come back"" in live performances at the time. Other songs dealt with drive-by shootings (""Driveby""),  environmentalism  (""Piece of Crap"") and Young's own vision of America (the archetypal car metaphor of ""Trans Am""). Young was inspired to make the record after viewing Cobain's performance on  MTV Unplugged . Still admired by the prime movers of grunge, Young eventually performed with Pearl Jam at the MTV Music Awards during what was described as the highlight of a lackluster show. [ 29 ]  Their collaboration led to a joint tour, with the band and producer  Brendan O'Brien  backing Young. The accompanying album,  Mirror Ball  (1995), recorded as live in the studio captured their loose rock sound, and featured the standout track ""I'm the Ocean"". The year of 1995 also featured Young's entry into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .   After composing an abstract, distorted feedback-led guitar instrumental soundtrack to  Jim Jarmusch 's  acid western  film  Dead Man  Young recorded a series of loose jams with Crazy Horse that eventually appeared as the critically denigrated  Broken Arrow . The return to Crazy Horse was prompted by the death of mentor, friend, and longtime  producer   David Briggs  in late 1995. The subsequent tours of Europe and North America in 1996 resulted in both a live album and a tour documentary directed by  Jim Jarmusch . Both releases took the name  Year of the Horse .   In 1997, Young participated in the  H.O.R.D.E. Festival 's sixth annual tour.   In 1998, Young shared the stage with the rock band  Phish  at the annual  Farm Aid  concert, and later offered them an opportunity to headline both nights of the Bridge School Benefit concert. Phish took Young up on his offer to headline the Bridge School Benefit (where Young joined Phish for renditions of ""Helpless"" and ""I Shall Be Released."" [ 30 ]  Phish, however, declined Young's later invitation to be his backing band on a 1999 tour. [ 31 ]   The decade ended with  Looking Forward , another reunion with Crosby, Stills and Nash. The subsequent tour of the United States and Canada with the reformed super quartet was a huge success and brought in earnings of $42.1 million, making it the eighth largest grossing tour of 2000.   Young's next album,  Silver & Gold  (2000), contained a number of understated songs with personal lyrics, which was promoted through a mini-tour of solo acoustic shows. This style was continued in  Are You Passionate?  (2002), an album of love songs dedicated to his wife, Pegi.     [ edit ]   In the aftermath of 9/11   Young's 2001 single "" Let's Roll "", was a tribute to the victims of the  September 11, 2001 attacks , and the passengers and crew on  Flight 93  in particular. At the "" America: A Tribute to Heroes "" concert he performed  John Lennon's  "" Imagine "". In 2002,  Q  magazine  named Neil Young in their list of the ""50 Bands To See Before You Die.""   Young hauled out his concept album  Greendale , about an extended family in a small town called Greendale, and how they are torn apart by a murder, in 2003.  Greendale  was recorded with Crazy Horse members Billy Talbot and Ralph Molina. This tale of the Green family also resulted in a movie called  Greendale , written and directed by Young (again using his ""Bernard Shakey"" pseudonym) and starring a few of his friends, who act out and  lip sync  the songs from the album. The film was indeed thoroughly experimental, from Young's rambling on-stage between-song narratives, to his reading apparent transcriptions of these ramblings in the liner notes. ""When I was writing this I had no idea what I was doing, so I was just as surprised as you are,"" Young said later. Young toured extensively with the  Greendale  material throughout 2003 and 2004, first with a solo, acoustic version in Europe, then with a full-cast stage show in North America,  Japan , and  Australia . While audience reaction was sometimes mixed (drunken requests for ""Southern Man"" being an aesthetic impediment at most Young performances), the live stage version of Greendale was for many critics the most satisfying incarnation of the material, and bootlegs of the shows have been widely traded. The second half of each concert consisted of high-decibel renditions of Young classics such as ""Hey Hey, My My,"" ""Cinnamon Girl,"" ""Powderfinger,"" and  Rockin' in the Free World , as well as rarities such as ""The Losing End,"" ""The Old Country Waltz,"" and ""Danger Bird.""   Young spent the latter portion of 2004 giving a series of intimate acoustic concerts in various cities with his wife, Pegi, who is a trained vocalist and guitar player.     [ edit ]   Recent events          From left, Emmylou Harris, Neil Young and Pegi Young perform in  Neil Young: Heart of Gold , which offered renditions of some of Young's best-known songs.       On  March 31 ,  2005 , Young was admitted to a hospital in New York for treatment for a brain  aneurysm . He was treated successfully by a minimally invasive  neuroradiological  procedure. Prior to undergoing the procedure, he wrote the first eight songs of a new album,  Prairie Wind , in  Nashville , with session musicians that included regular Young sideman  Ben Keith  on lap and  pedal steel guitars . Two days after the procedure, Young was forced to cancel a scheduled appearance on the  Juno Awards  telecast in Winnipeg when the area where the surgeons did his procedure (via the  femoral artery ) suddenly began to bleed. While Young finally was able to return to Winnipeg in 2006 with Crosby, Stills and Nash, his first post-aneurysm performance was on  July 2 ,  2005 , at the close of the  Live 8  concert in  Barrie, Ontario . There, he debuted a new song, a soft hymn called ""When God Made Me.""   On  September 28 ,  2005 ,  Prairie Wind  was released. In an interview given to  Time  magazine , Young revealed that he had planned to keep the news of his aneurysm private until he had the bleeding scare, after which he decided to make news of his condition public. The last two songs on the album were written after his aneurysm procedure, and several of the songs, such as ""Fallin' Off the Face of the Earth,"" seem to be inspired by Young's brush with  mortality , the recent death of his father, who suffered from  senile dementia , and Young's  Manitoba  roots.   In 2006,  Neil Young: Heart of Gold , a film made by  Jonathan Demme , premiered at the  Sundance Film Festival . Filmed over two nights at the  Ryman Auditorium  in  Nashville, Tennessee  during the premiere of  Prairie Wind , it includes both new and old songs as well as behind-the scenes-commentary by Young, his wife Pegi, and members of Young's session band.   In April 2006, Young announced the release of  Living with War , an album of protest songs that included the provocatively-titled "" Let's Impeach the President ."" Recorded using his famous  Les Paul  electric guitar, "" Old Black ,"" along with Chad Cromwell (drums), Rick Rosas (bass), and Tommy Brea (trumpet), the album was intended to be a stinging rebuke of U.S. President  George W. Bush  and the  War in Iraq . The album was recorded in a two week period in April, and was then made available over the internet from 28 April 2006 before being released as a CD on 5 May.  Living With War  was Young's most talked about release for years, creating heated political debate and a return to form with perhaps his most critically-acclaimed album since the early 1990s.  Living With War: In the Beginning , an remixed version with the original album's choral backing vocals removed, was released in December of the same year. Its accompanying DVD featured videos directed by Young of every song on the album, footage of the  Iraq War  and demonstrations in the US, and clips from  Al Gore 's  An Inconvenient Truth .          Neil Young on the CSNY ""Freedom Of Speech Tour '06""       From July through September of 2006, Neil Young reunited with his former bandmates from  Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young  for the ""Freedom Of Speech Tour '06"" across North America. Chad Cromwell and Rick Rosas made up the band's rhythm section. The entire  Living with War  album was performed on the tour, in addition to other CSN and Neil Young classics such as "" Ohio "" and "" Rockin' in the Free World ."" An accompanying concert film and live album, called  CSNY Deja Vu , were premiered on January 25, 2008, at the Sundance Movie Festival.   2006 also saw the first release from Young's long awaited  Archives  project, as  Live at the Fillmore East , a selection of songs drawn from a 1970 gig with  Crazy Horse , was released in November of that year. The release was marked as number two in the  Archives Performance Series , leaving room for the still-unreleased 1969  Riverboat  bootleg, which will be number one in the series. In March 2007, another historical live album, marked as the third in the  Performance Series , was released. Titled  Live at Massey Hall 1971 , it featured a solo acoustic set from Toronto's Massey Hall, including material from the upcoming  Harvest  album.   On  August 15 ,  2007 , Young played a new album for 100 people at Reprise Records entitled  Chrome Dreams II .  Chrome Dreams  was an album he scrapped in 1977, and the name of two different bootlegs. The new album includes two long songs that time in at 18:13 (""Ordinary People"") and 14:31 (""No Hidden Path""), respectively. The album consists of three songs written previously and seven new songs, all by Young. The album was released on October 23, 2007, timed to coincide with a seven-week tour that had kicked off in Boise, Idaho, ten days earlier.   On February 11, 2008, Neil Young started the European leg of his tour with a concert in  Antwerp ,  Belgium . On July 17, he was interviewed on  PBS  by  Charlie Rose , where he spoke about many things, including his project to make a hybrid 1959 Lincoln. [ 32 ]  In October, a BBC 4 documentary ""Neil Young - Don't be Denied"" was shown, featuring interviews with Neil and a number of his contemporaries. It also summarizes his biography and motivations. [ 33 ]   The latest album in the Performance Series,  Sugar Mountain - Live At Canterbury House 1968  was released on December 2, 2008. Featuring material from Young's earliest solo performances recorded in Ann Arbor, MI November 9, 1968, the album was released as number zero in the  Performance Series .   The first installment of Young's oft-delayed box set  The Archives Vol. 1 1963-1972  was officially announced in 2008 with a trailer.  [ 34 ]   [ 35 ]  The first set of Archives will feature both DVD and Blu-ray editions which will include 128 audio tracks (43 unreleased and 13 never before heard songs), thousands of images (photos, lyrics, letters and memorabilia), and hours of new, previously released and rare videos. Also included will be a 236 page hardbound book. The Blu-ray edition will have HD picture, pristine audio mastered and presented in 24bit 192 khz., and access to photos, trivia and memorabilia without stopping the music. It is currently scheduled for release in 2009.   A Spring 2009 date has been set for Neil's new album 'A Fork in The Road', which will delay the release of the Archives until later in 2009.   Young currently lives on a 1500-acre (6 km) ranch in  La Honda, California , called Broken Arrow. He also owns property in  Fort Lauderdale, Florida , and on the islands of  Hawaii .   Young headlined the 2009  Big Day Out  festival in  New Zealand  and  Australia . Young pushed other current mainstream bands to only secondary headlining, including  Arctic Monkeys  and  The Ting Tings . He will also headline the Friday at  Glastonbury Festival  which has attempted to book him for many years. Although not officially confirmed, a number of sources have suggested this. [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Influence, importance and inspiration   Neil Young has undeniably been an important artist in the history of American and Canadian popular music and remains a distinct influence upon other recording artists.  Lynyrd Skynyrd s "" Sweet Home Alabama "" was written in response to two of Neil Youngs songs ""Southern Man"" and ""Alabama"". ""Ohio"" which Young recorded with Crosby, Stills and Nash, was a recollection of the tragic events that transpired at Kent State University in May 1970. Young's willingness to be politically outspoken and socially conscious allowed him to influence such important artists such as  Phish ,  Pearl Jam , and  Nirvana . Neil Young is referred to as ""the Godfather of  Grunge "" because of the influence he had on  Kurt Cobain  and  Eddie Vedder  and the entire grunge movement. Kurt Cobain quoted Neil Young in his suicide note, using the line Its better to burn out, than to fade away from Youngs song ""My My, Hey Hey (Out Of The Blue)"". Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam inducted Neil Young into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, citing him as a huge influence. He has also been a big influence on  experimental rock  acts like  Sonic Youth  and  Radiohead . Youngs influence, importance and inspiration within the music scene derive in part from his longevity because of a career spanning more than four decades. His first album was released in 1966 and his latest in 2008.  Bob Dylan 's influence on Young has been so obvious that the former once lambasted: "" Heart of Gold  bothered me every time it came on the radio ... and I'd say, 'Shit, that's me. If it sounds like me it might as well be me. (...) It seemed somebody else had taken my thing and had run away with it, you know, and I never got over it. Maybe tomorrow"" [ 37 ] . The Dutch guitar virtuoso  Jan Akkerman  described a typical electric guitar solo by Young as the sound of ""a Belgian  vibrator "" in a 1994 TV documentary, adding that it somehow became more palatable when one saw Young's grimace to accompany it  [ 38 ] .   The Australian rock group  Powderfinger  attribute their group name to their love of Young.   Toronto  based band  Constantines  recorded a version of Neil's  Fuckin' Up  in  Winnipeg , [ 39 ] which surfaced at the b-side the their ""Our Age"" 7"" [ 40 ] in November 2008. The members of the  Constantines  have occasionally played shows under the name Horsey Craze [ 41 ] , singing Neil Young songs. In early 2006, they released a vinyl only split-album with The Unintended. The Constantines recorded four Neil Young songs for the LP, while The Unintended performed four Gordon Lightfoot songs.   While in Winnipeg on November 2, 2008 during the Canadian leg of his tour,  Bob Dylan  visited the former home of Neil Young in River Heights. The home was where Neil spent some of his teenage years. Dylan was interested in seeing the room where some of Neils first songs were composed.     [ edit ]   Achievements   Young was inducted into the  Canadian Music Hall of Fame  in 1982. He has been inducted into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  twice: first in 1995 for his solo work, with an induction speech given by  Eddie Vedder , and again in 1997 as a member of Buffalo Springfield.   He has also directed five movies under his pseudonym Bernard Shakey, and released them through his own Shakey Pictures imprint:  Journey Through the Past  (1973),  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979)  Human Highway  (1982) (starring new wave band  Devo ), and  Greendale  (2003) and the documentary,  CSNY Deja Vu  (2008). The bonus  DVDs  included in both versions of  Greendale  and in  Prairie Wind  are also directed by Young under the Bernard Shakey alias, and all of Young's home video and DVD releases have been co-released under the Shakey Pictures imprint.   As one of the original founders of  Farm Aid , he remains an active member of the board of directors. For one weekend each October, in  Mountain View, California , he and his wife host the  Bridge School Concerts , which have been drawing international talent and sell-out crowds for nearly two decades with some of the biggest names in rock having performed at the event including  Bruce Springsteen ,  David Bowie ,  The Who ,  Red Hot Chili Peppers ,  Trent Reznor  of  Nine Inch Nails ,  Pearl Jam ,  Sonic Youth  and Sir  Paul McCartney . The concerts are a benefit for the  Bridge School , which develops and uses advanced technologies to aid in the instruction of children with disabilities. Young's involvement stems at least partially from the fact that both of his sons have  cerebral palsy  and his daughter, like Young himself, has  epilepsy .   Young was nominated for an  Oscar  in 1994 for his song ""Philadelphia"" from the film  Philadelphia  (Bruce Springsteen won the award for his song "" Streets of Philadelphia "" from the same film). In his acceptance speech, Springsteen said that ""the award really deserved to be shared by the other nominee's song."" That same night,  Tom Hanks  accepted the Oscar for Best Actor and gave credit for his inspiration to the song ""Philadelphia"".   He was part owner of  Lionel, LLC , a company that makes toy trains and model railroad accessories. [ 42 ]  In 2008 Lionel emerged from bankruptcy and his shares of the company were wiped out. At this time his status with Lionel is unknown, according to Lionel CEO Jerry Calabrese he is still a consultant for Lionel. He was instrumental in the design of the Lionel Legacy control system for model trains [ 42 ]  and it is believed he will continue to develop the system. Young has been named as co-inventor on seven U.S. Patents related to model trains. [ 43 ]   Young has twice received honorary doctorates. He received an Honorary Doctorate of Music from  Lakehead University  in  Thunder Bay ,  Ontario  in 1992, and an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from  San Francisco State University  in 2006. The latter honour was shared with his wife Pegi for their creation of the Bridge School.   In a ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"" list in the June 1996 issue of  Mojo  magazine , Young was ranked No. 9.   In 2003, Rolling Stone listed Young at #83 in its rankings of ""The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time,"" describing him as a ""restless experimenter...who transform[s] the most obvious music into something revelatory."" [ 44 ]   In 2000, Young was inducted into  Canada's Walk of Fame . [ 45 ]  He ranked No. 39 on  VH1 's 100 Greatest Artist of Hard Rock  that same year.   In 2001, Young was awarded the Spirit of Liberty award from the civil liberties group  People for the American Way .   In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked Neil Young [ 46 ]  #34 on their list of the  100 Greatest Artists of All Time . [ 47 ]   In 2006, Paste Magazine compiled a ""Greatest Living Songwriters"" list; Young was ranked No. 2 behind  Bob Dylan . (While Young and Dylan have occasionally played together in concert, they have never collaborated on a song together, or played on each others' records).   In 2008, Rolling Stone ranked Young at #37 in its list of ""The 100 Greatest Singers of All-Time. [ 48 ]   Jason Bond, an  East Carolina University  biologist, discovered a new species of trapdoor spider in 2007, and named it  Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi  after Young, his favorite singer. [ 49 ]     [ edit ]   Instruments          Neil Young, 2008 in  Florence       Neil Young is a collector of second-hand guitars, but in recording and performing, he frequently uses just a few instruments. As explained by his longtime guitar technician  Larry Cragg  in the film  Neil Young: Heart of Gold , they include:     1953  Gibson Les Paul Goldtop Nicknamed "" Old Black "", this is Young's primary  electric guitar  and is featured on  Rust Never Sleeps  and most other albums. Old Black got its name from a purely amateur paintjob applied to the originally-gold body of the instrument, sometime before Neil acquired the guitar in the late 1960s. In 1972, a mini- humbucker  pickup from a  Gibson Firebird  guitar was installed into the lead/treble position, replacing a  P-90  as standard on Les Paul guitars from that era. This pickup, severely  microphonic , is considered a crucial component of Neil's sound. A  Bigsby vibrato tailpiece  was installed as early as 1969 on the guitar, and can be heard clearly during the opening of ""Cowgirl in the Sand"" from  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere . This guitar also features a mini-switch that is used to send the signal from the mini-humbucker direct to the amp, without going through the volume or tone controls. A Les Paul Gold Top of the same year as Old Black was assembled by Neil's guitar tech, using same style Firebird pick up in the guitar as well as the same model Bigsby Vib; but, according to Young, was just not the same as the original. Young acquired Old Black from Jim Messina, swapping one of his Gretches for it in 1969 while Messina was assisting Young on his first solo album. Messina, who played briefly in Buffalo Springfield and produced the band's final album, ""Last Time Around,"" still has the Gretch in his possession.       Martin D-45 His primary  steel-string acoustic guitar ; used to write ""Old Man"" and many other hit songs.   Martin D-28Nicknamed ""Hank"" after its previous owner,  Hank Williams . The guitar came into Young's possession after  Hank Williams, Jr.  had traded it to another owner for some shotguns and it went through a succession of other owners until it was located by Young's longtime friend Grant Boatwright. The guitar was purchased by Young from  Tut Taylor . Young has toured with it for over 30 years. A story about the guitar and inspired song known as ""This Old Guitar"" can be seen about 50 minutes into the film  Neil Young: Heart of Gold . It is Young's primary guitar for the album,  Prairie Wind .   Neil Young can be seen playing a Vagabond Travel Guitar as he sings ""Let's Impeach the President"" on  The Colbert Report  on  Comedy Central .   A 12-string Taylor 855 is used in the first half of the soundtrack and concert film ""Rust Never Sleeps""   1927  Gibson  MastertoneA six-string  banjo , tuned like a guitar. It has been used on many recordings and was played by  James Taylor  on ""Old Man"".   Various vintage  Fender Tweed Deluxe  amplifiers Young's preferred amplifier for electric guitar is the diminutive Fender Deluxe, specifically a Tweed-era model from 1959. Neil purchased his first vintage Deluxe in 1967 for $50 from the drummer of Crazy Horse, Ralph Molina, and has since acquired nearly 450 different examples, all from the same era, but he maintains that it's the original model that sounds superior, and is a crucial component to his trademark sound. The Tweed Deluxe is almost always used in conjunction with a late-1950's Magnatone 280 (similar to the amp used by Lonnie Mack and Buddy Holly). The Magnatone and the Deluxe are paired together in a somewhat unique manner - the external speaker jack from the Deluxe sends the amped signal through a volume potentiometr and directly into the input of the Magnatone. The Magnatone is notable for its true pitch-bending vibrato capabilities, which can be heard as an electric piano amplifier on ""See the Sky About to Rain"". A notable and unique accessory to Young's Deluxe is the Whizzer, a device created specifically for Young, which physically changes the amplifier's settings to pre-set combinations. It has gone through many incarnations.   Gretsch 6120  (Chet Atkins)Before Young bought Old Black, this was his primary electric guitar used during his  Buffalo Springfield  days.   Gretsch White Falcon   Late '50s hollow body that Young purchased near the end of the  Buffalo Springfield  era; in 1969 Young acquired a stereo version of the same vintage guitar from Stills, and this instrument is featured prominently during Young's early '70s period, and can be heard on tracks like ""Ohio,"" ""Southern Man,"" ""Alabama,"" ""L.A.,"" others. It is Neil's primary electric guitar during the  Harvest  era. This particular White Falcon is the stereo 6137, in which the signal from the three bass strings is separated from the signal from the three treble strings. Young typically plays this guitar in this stereo mode, sending the separate signals to two different amps: the Fender Deluxe and typcially to either a Fender Tremolux or a low-powered Tweed Fender Twin. The separation of the signals is most prominantly heard on the Harvest album song ""Words"".   Neil Young replaced his trademark Les Paul for a Gibson Flying V on the ""Time Fades Away"" tour.   Neil Young played a  Fender Broadcaster  on the Tonight's the Night tour and album.

Young's work is characterized by deeply personal lyrics, distinctive guitar work, and signature falsetto  tenor  singing voice. Although he accompanies himself on several different instrumentsincluding  piano  and  harmonica his claw-hammer  acoustic guitar  style and often idiosyncratic electric guitar soloing are the linchpins of a sometimes ragged, sometimes polished sound. Although Young has experimented widely with differing music styles, including  swing ,  jazz ,  rockabilly ,  blues , and  electronic music  throughout a varied career, his best known work usually falls into either of two distinct styles:  folk -esque  acoustic   rock  ("" Heart of Gold "", ""Harvest Moon"" and "" Old Man "") and  electric -charged  hard rock  (like "" Cinnamon Girl "", "" Rockin' in the Free World "" and "" Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black) ""). In recent years, Young has adopted elements from newer styles like  industrial ,  alternative country  and  grunge . Young's profound influence on the latter caused some to dub him ""the godfather of grunge"".   Young has directed (or co-directed) a number of  films  using the  pseudonym  Bernard Shakey, including  Journey Through the Past  (1973),  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979),  Human Highway  (1982),  Greendale  (2003), and  CSNY Dj Vu  (2008). He is currently working on a documentary about electric car technology, tentatively titled  Linc/Volt . The project involves a 1959  Lincoln Continental  converted to hybrid technology, which Young plans to drive to  Washington, DC  as an example to lawmakers there. [ 2 ]   He is also an outspoken advocate for environmental issues and small farmers, having co-founded in 1985 the  benefit concert   Farm Aid , and in 1986 helped found The Bridge School, [ 3 ]  and its annual supporting  Bridge School Benefit  concerts, together with his wife Pegi (in this, Young's involvement stems at least partially from the fact that both of his sons have  cerebral palsy  and his daughter, like Young himself, has  epilepsy ).   Although Young sings as frequently about U.S. legends and myths ( Pocahontas ,  space stations , and the settlement of the American West) [ 4 ]  as he does about his native country, he remains a Canadian citizen and has never wanted to relinquish his Canadian citizenship. He has lived in the U.S. for ""so long"" and has stated he has ""got just as much right to vote in them (American elections) as anybody else.""

He spent his early years in the small country town of  Omemee , 130  kilometres  (81  mi ) northeast of Toronto.   Young was diagnosed with diabetes as a child [ 6 ]  and a bout of  polio  at the age of 6 left him with a weakened left side; he still walks with a slight limp.   His parents divorced when Young was 12, and he moved with his mother back to the family home of  Winnipeg , Manitoba, where the formative years of his music career began. Neil and his mother Rassy settled into the working class suburb of  Fort Rouge  where the shy, dry-humoured youth enrolled at Earl Grey Junior High School. It was there that he formed his first band  the Jades , and met  Ken Koblun , later to join him in the Squires.   While attending  Kelvin High School  in Winnipeg, he played in several instrumental rock bands. Young's first stable band was called the Squires, who had a local hit called ""The Sultan"". Young dropped out of high school [ 7 ]  and also played in  Fort William , where they recorded a series of demos produced by a local producer named Ray Dee, whom Young called ""the original Briggs."" [ 8 ]  While in Thunder Bay, Young first encountered  Stephen Stills . In the  2006  film  Heart of Gold  Young relates how he used to spend time as a teenager at  Falcon Lake, Manitoba  where he would endlessly plug coins into the jukebox to hear  Ian Tyson 's "" Four Strong Winds "". Neil also formed a friendship with musician  Randy Bachman .   After leaving the Squires, Neil worked folk clubs in Winnipeg, where he first met  Joni Mitchell . [ 9 ]  Here he wrote some of his earliest and most enduring folk songs such as the classic "" Sugar Mountain "", about his lost youth. Mitchell wrote ""The Circle Game"" in response. [ citation needed ]   In 1965 Young toured Canada as a solo artist. In 1966, he joined the  Rick James -fronted  Mynah Birds . The band managed to secure a record deal with the  Motown  label, but as their first album was being recorded, James was arrested for being  AWOL  from the army. [ 10 ]  After the Mynah Birds disbanded, Young and bass player  Bruce Palmer  relocated to  Los Angeles . Young has admitted in an interview that he was in the United States illegally until receiving a green card in 1970. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Buffalo Springfield   Once they reached Los Angeles, Young and Palmer met up with  Stephen Stills ,  Richie Furay , and  Dewey Martin  to form  Buffalo Springfield . A mixture of folk, country,  psychedelia , and rock lent a hard edge by the twin lead guitars of Stills and Young made Buffalo Springfield a critical success, and their first record  Buffalo Springfield  (1967) sold well after Stills' topical song "" For What It's Worth "" became a hit, aided by Young's melodic harmonics played on electric guitar.   Distrust of their management, as well as the arrest and deportation of Palmer, exacerbated the already strained relations among the group members and led to Buffalo Springfield's demise. A second album,  Buffalo Springfield Again , was released in late 1967, but two of Youngs three contributions were solo tracks recorded apart from the rest of the group.   In many ways, these three songs on  Buffalo Springfield Again  are harbingers of much of Young's later work in that, although they all share deeply personal, almost idiosyncratic lyrics, they also present three very different musical approaches to the arrangement of what is essentially an original folk song. ""Mr Soul"" is the only Young song of the three that all five members of the group perform together. In contrast, "" Broken Arrow "" was confessional folk rock of a kind that would characterize much of the music that emerged from the singer-songwriter movement. Youngs experimental production intersperses each verse with snippets of sound from other sources, including opening the song with a sound bite of Dewey Martin singing ""Mr. Soul"" and closing it with the thumping of a heartbeat. ""Expecting to Fly"" was a lushly produced  ballad  featuring a string arrangement that Young's co-producer for the track,  Jack Nitzsche , would dub ""symphonic pop.""   In May 1968, the band split up for good, but in order to fulfill a contractual obligation, a final album,  Last Time Around , was recorded, primarily from recordings made earlier that year. Young contributed the songs ""On the Way Home"" and ""I Am a Child"", singing lead on the latter. In 1997, the band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame; Young did not appear at the ceremony.     [ edit ]   Solo success & CSNY   After the breakup of Buffalo Springfield, Young signed a solo deal with  Reprise Records , home of his colleague and friend  Joni Mitchell , with whom he shared a manager, Elliot Roberts, who manages Young to this day. Young and Nitzsche immediately began work on Young's first solo record,  Neil Young  (November 1968), which received mixed reviews. In a 1970 interview, [ 12 ]  Young deprecated the album as being ""overdubbed rather than played,"" and the quest for music that expresses the spontaneity of the moment has long been a feature of his career. Nevertheless, the album contains some tunes that remain a staple of his live shows, most notably ""The Loner.""   For his next album, Young recruited three musicians from a band called The Rockets:  Danny Whitten  on guitar,  Billy Talbot  on bass guitar, and  Ralph Molina  on  drums . These three took the name  Crazy Horse  (after  the historical figure of the same name ), and  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere  (May 1969), is credited to ""Neil Young with Crazy Horse."" Recorded in just two weeks, the album opens with one of Young's most familiar songs, ""Cinnamon Girl,"" and is dominated by two more, ""Cowgirl in the Sand"" and ""Down by the River,"" that feature lengthy jams showcasing Young's idiosyncratic guitar soloing accompanied sympathetically by Crazy Horse. Young reportedly wrote all three songs on the same day, while nursing a high fever of 103 F (39.5 C) in bed.   Shortly after the release of  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere , Young reunited with Stephen Stills by joining  Crosby, Stills, & Nash , who had already released one album as a trio. Young was originally offered a position as a sideman, but agreed to join only if he received full membership, and the group - winners of the 1969 ""Best New Artist"" Grammy - was renamed Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. [ 13 ]  The quartet debuted in  Chicago  on  August 16 ,  1969 , and later performed at the famous  Woodstock Festival , during which Young skipped the acoustic set and refused to be filmed during the electric set, even telling the cameramen: ""One of you fuckin' guys comes near me and I'm gonna fuckin' hit you with my guitar"". [ 14 ]  During the making of their first album,  Dj Vu , the musicians frequently argued, particularly Young and Stills, who both fought for control. [ 15 ]   "" Ohio "" was written following the  Kent State massacre  on  May 4 ,  1970 , and was a staple of anti-war rallies in the 1970s. The song was quickly recorded by CSNY and immediately released as a single, even though CSNY's ""Teach Your Children"" was still climbing the singles charts. Many believe that the release of ""Ohio"" as a single cut into the sales of ""Teach Your Children"" and prevented that song from reaching the top ten. In the late 1970s and for much of the 1980s, Young refrained from performing ""Ohio"" live, as he considered the song to be dated. In the wake of the 1989  Tiananmen Square massacre , however, Young revived the song in concert, often dedicating it to the  Chinese  students who were killed in the massacre. Crosby, Stills & Nash, as a trio, also returned the song to their live repertoire around the same time, even though Young had provided the lead vocals on the original recording.   Also that year, Young released his third solo album,  After the Gold Rush  (1970), which featured, among others, a young  Nils Lofgren ,  Stephen Stills , and CSNY bassist Greg Reeves. Young also recorded some tracks with Crazy Horse, but dismissed them early in the sessions. Aided by his newfound fame with CSNY, the album was a commercial breakthrough for Young and contains some of his best known work. Notable tracks include the title track, with dream-like lyrics that run a gamut of subjects from drugs and interpersonal relationships to environmental concerns, as well as Youngs controversial and acerbic condemnation of  racism  in "" Southern Man ,"" which, along with a later song entitled ""Alabama,"" later prompted  Lynyrd Skynyrd  to decry Young by name in the lyrics to "" Sweet Home Alabama ."" Young was one of Skynyrd's biggest influences, and Young was an admirer of Skynyrd's music. The respectful rivalry and friendship between Young and Skynyrd front man  Ronnie Van Zant  would serve as a recurring theme in the  Drive-By Truckers ' 2001  concept album   Southern Rock Opera .   With CSNY splitting up and Crazy Horse having signed their own record deal, Young began the year 1971 with a solo tour entitled ""Journey Through the Past."" Later, he recruited a new group of country-music session musicians, whom he christened  The Stray Gators , to record much of the new material that had been premiered on tour for the album  Harvest  (1972).  Harvest  was a massive hit (especially with the country-music crowd) and ""Heart of Gold"" became a US number one single; incidentally, to this day it remains the only No. 1 hit in his long career.   Another notable song was "" The Needle and the Damage Done ,"" a somber lament on the pain caused by heroin addiction; inspired in part by the heavy heroin use of Crazy Horse member Danny Whitten, who would eventually die of an overdose. [ 16 ]   The album's success, however, caught Young off guard, and his first instinct was to back away from stardom. In the handwritten liner notes to the  Decade  compilation, Young described ""Heart of Gold"" as the song that ""put me in the middle of the road. Traveling there soon became a bore, so I headed for the ditch. A rougher ride but I saw more interesting people there.""   On  September 8 ,  1972 , the Academy Award-nominated actress  Carrie Snodgress , with whom he had been living, gave birth to Neil Young's first child. The boy, Zeke, was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Young fell in love with Snodgress after seeing her in a movie (""Diary of a Mad Housewife"") on television after which Young wrote the song "" A Man Needs a Maid "" from the Harvest album, featuring the lyric ""I fell in love with the actress/she was playing a part that I could understand.""     [ edit ]   The Ditch Trilogy   Although a new tour had been planned to follow up on the success of  Harvest , it became apparent during rehearsals that Danny Whitten could not function due to  drug abuse . On  November 18 , 1972, shortly after he was fired from the tour preparations, Whitten was found dead of an  overdose . Young described the incident to  Rolling Stone s  Cameron Crowe  in 1975:  [ 17 ]  ""[We] were rehearsing with him and he just couldn't cut it. He couldn't remember anything. He was too out of it. Too far gone. I had to tell him to go back to L.A. 'It's not happening, man. You're not together enough.' He just said, 'I've got nowhere else to go, man. How am I gonna tell my friends?' And he split. That night the coroner called me from L.A. and told me he'd ODed. That blew my mind. Fucking blew my mind. I loved Danny. I felt responsible. And from there, I had to go right out on this huge tour of huge arenas. I was very nervous and  insecure.""   The album made in the aftermath of this incident,  Time Fades Away  (1973), has often been described by Young as ""my least favourite record,"" and it is, in fact, one of only two of Youngs early recordings that has yet to be officially re-released on CD (the other being the soundtrack album  Journey Through the Past ). The album was recorded live over a tour where Young struggled with his voice and called  David Crosby  and  Graham Nash  to help perform the music. The tour featured  Linda Ronstadt  as the opening act.  Time Fades Away  occupies a unique position in Youngs discography as the first of three albums known collectively as the "" Ditch Trilogy .""   In the second half of 1973, Young formed The Santa Monica Flyers, with Crazy Horse's rhythm section augmented by Nils Lofgren on guitar. Deeply affected by the drug-induced deaths of Whitten and  roadie   Bruce Berry , Young recorded  Tonight's the Night . The album's dark tone and rawness caused Reprise to delay the release until two years later and only after being pressured by Young to do so. [ 18 ]  It received mixed reviews at the time, but is now regarded as a landmark album. In Young's own opinion, it was the closest he ever came to art. [ 19 ]   While his record company delayed the release of  Tonight's the Night,  Young recorded  On the Beach  (1974), which dealt with themes such as the downside of fame and the Californian lifestyle. Like  Time Fades Away  and  Tonight's the Night , it sold poorly but eventually became a critical favourite, presenting some of Young's most original work. In a review of the 2003 re-release on CD of  On the Beach  Derek Svennungsen described the music as ""mesmerizing, harrowing, lucid, and bleary,"" [ 20 ] .     [ edit ]   Return to prominence   After completing  On the Beach , Young reunited with  Harvest  producer Elliot Mazer to record another acoustic album,  Homegrown . Most of the songs were written after Young's breakup with Snodgress, and thus the tone of the album was somewhat dark. Though the album was entirely completed, Young decided to drop the album and release  Tonight's the Night  instead, at the suggestion of  The Band  bassist  Rick Danko . [ 21 ]  Young further explained his move by saying: ""It was a little too personal... it scared me"". [ 22 ]          Neil Young in Austin, Texas on November 9, 1976       Young reformed Crazy Horse with  Frank Sampedro  on guitar as his backup band for  Zuma  (1975). Many of the songs are overtly concerned with failed relationships, and even the epic "" Cortez the Killer ,"" outwardly a retelling of the  Spanish conquest  of  Mexico  from the viewpoint of the  Aztecs , can be seen as an allegory of love lostsomething that didnt save it, however, from being banned in  Franco 's  Spain .   The following year, Young reunited with Stephen Stills for the album  Long May You Run  (1976), credited to  The Stills-Young Band ; the follow-up tour was ended midway through by Young, who sent Stills a  telegram  that read: ""Funny how some things that start spontaneously end that way. Eat a peach, Neil."" [ 23 ]   In 1976, Young performed with  The Band , Joni Mitchell, and other rock musicians in the high profile all-star concert  The Last Waltz . The release of  Martin Scorsese 's movie of the concert was delayed while Scorsese unwillingly re-edited it to obscure the lump of cocaine that was clearly visible hanging from Young's nose during his performance of  ""Helpless."" [ 24 ]  Young later said, ""I'm not proud of that,"" according to one of his biographers.   American Stars 'N Bars  (1977) contained two songs originally recorded for  Homegrown  album, ""Homegrown"" and ""Star of Bethelehem,"" as well as newer material, including the future concert staple "" Like A Hurricane "". Performers included  Linda Ronstadt ,  Emmylou Harris  and Young protg  Nicolette Larson  along with Crazy Horse. Also in 1977, Young released  Decade : a personally selected career summary of material spanning every aspect of his various interests and affiliations, including a handful of unreleased songs.  Comes a Time  (1978) also featured Nicolette Larson and Crazy Horse and became Young's most commercially accessible album in quite some time, marked by a return to his folk roots.   Young next set out on the lengthy ""Rust Never Sleeps"" tour, in which each concert was divided into a solo acoustic set and an electric set with Crazy Horse. Much of the electric set was later seen as a response to punk rock's burgeoning popularity. ""Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)"" compared the changing public perception of  Johnny Rotten  with that of the recently deceased  Elvis Presley , who himself had once been disparaged as a dangerous influence only to later become an  icon . Rotten, meanwhile, returned the favour by playing one of Young's records on a  London  radio show. The accompanying albums  Rust Never Sleeps  (new material, culled from live recordings, but featuring studio overdubs) and  Live Rust  (a mixture of old and new, and a genuine concert recording) captured the two sides of the concerts, with solo acoustic songs on side A, and fierce, uptempo, electric songs on side B. A movie version of the concerts, also called  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979), was directed by Young under the pseudonym Bernard Shakey.   Young was suddenly hip again, and the readers and critics of  Rolling Stone  voted him Artist Of The Year for 1979 (along with The Who), selected  Rust Never Sleeps  as Album Of The Year, and voted him Male Vocalist Of The Year as well.  The Village Voice , meanwhile, honored Young as the Artist of the Decade.     [ edit ]   1980s - Experimental years   The 1980s were a lean time for Young both critically and commercially. After providing the incidental music to a  biopic  of  Hunter S. Thompson  entitled  Where the Buffalo Roam , he recorded  Hawks & Doves  (1980), a folk/country record.  Re-ac-tor  (1981), once again with Crazy Horse, was a faade of distortion and feedback obscuring a relatively weak selection of songs, but his strangest record of the decade came with  Trans  (1982). Recorded partially with  vocoders ,  synthesizers , and other devices that modified instruments and vocals with electronic effects, it is sometimes considered an experiment related to finding a technology that would become a means to communicate for Youngs son (with his wife Pegi), Ben, who has severe  cerebral palsy  and cannot speak. Many fans were baffled by the radical forms of this album and  rockabilly -styled  Everybody's Rockin'  (1983), and record company head  David Geffen  even sued Young for making ""unrepresentative"" musici.e. music that did not sound like Neil Youngthat deliberately lacked commercial appeal. [ 25 ]  Young later stated that he would have preferred to release the songs featuring the  synclavier  and  vocoder  as an EP, and that their inclusion with the Hawaiian-themed rockabilly was a mistake. Also premiered at this time though little seen was an eclectic full-length comedy film  Human Highway  starring, co-directed and co-written by Young.   In 1983, Young worked with British video director  Tim Pope , making two videos - ""Wonderin'"" and ""Cry, Cry, Cry.""   In 1985, he reunited with Crosby, Stills and Nash at  Live Aid  at Philadelphia's  John F. Kennedy Stadium . The two songs that they played, ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"" and "" Daylight Again /Find The Cost of Freedom,"" were the first songs they had played as a quartet in front of a paying audience since 1974.   Old Ways  (1985) saw a return to country music, recorded with a group of friends and session musicians.  Landing on Water  (1986) is entertaining for the blending of synthesizers and other instruments related to the 1980s into Youngs own style, with lyrics that take pot shots at some favourite targets, including CSN in ""Hippie Dream,"" with a chorus that goes: ""But the wooden ships/Were just a hippie dream,"" and David Geffen in ""Drifter,"" with the line: ""Dont try to tell me what I gotta do to fit."" The resumption of his partnership with Crazy Horse on  Life  (1987) fulfilled his contract with Geffen, and Young was finally able to switch labels.   Director Pope again made a series of videos from the album, including ""Touch the Night"" and ""People on the Street"".   Signing with  Warner Brothers  (which distributed Geffen at the time) and returning to Reprise Records, Young produced  This Note's For You  (1988) with a new band, The Bluenotes, whose name rights were owned by musician  Harold Melvin . Young named his band after a cafe called the Blue Note on Main Street in Winnipeg Manitoba, where he had played. The addition of a  brass  section provided a new  jazzier  sound and the title track became his first hit single of the decade. Accompanied by a video which parodied corporate rock, the pretensions of advertising and  Michael Jackson  in particular, the song was initially banned by  MTV  (although the Canadian music channel,  MuchMusic  ran it immediately) before being put into heavy rotation and finally given the  MTV Video Music Award for Best Video of the Year  for 1989. After Melvin sued over the use of the Bluenotes name, Young renamed his back-up group ""Ten Men Workin'"" for the balance of the concert tour.   Young also contributed to that year's CSNY reunion  American Dream  (1988) and CSNY played a few benefit concerts. Young, however, refused to book a full tour with CSN and the foursome would not embark upon a nationwide tour until 2000.     [ edit ]   1990s - Return to country-rock roots   Freedom  was a mixture of acoustic and electric rock dealing with the state of the U.S. and the world in 1989, alongside a set of love songs and a version of the standard ""On Broadway."" "" Rockin' in the Free World "", two versions of which bookended the album, again caught the mood. Some say it became a  de facto  anthem during the fall of the  Berlin Wall , a few months after the record's release. However, most Germans don't remember the song being related to the unification, understandably so, since the lyrics are not about political repression. Like  Bruce Springsteen 's "" Born in the U.S.A. "", the anthemic use of this song was based on largely ignoring the verses, which evoke social problems and implicitly criticize American government policies. In mid-1989, record executive  Terry Tolkin  conceived and produced a tribute album to Young's songs called  The Bridge: A Tribute To Neil Young,  released on his  No.6 Records  label. It featured cover versions of 15 of Young's songs by the cream of the up and coming  Alternative Music  and  Grunge music  bands including  Sonic Youth ,  Nick Cave ,  Soul Asylum ,  Dinosaur Jr ,and  The Pixies . By 1990,  grunge music  was beginning to make its first inroads in the charts and many of its prime movers, including  Nirvana 's  Kurt Cobain  and  Pearl Jam 's  Eddie Vedder , cited Young as a major influence.   Using a barn on his  Northern California  ranch as a studio, he rapidly recorded  Ragged Glory  with Crazy Horse, whose guitar riffs and feedback driven sound showed his new admirers that he could still cut it. Young then headed back out on the road with Orange Country country-punk band  Social Distortion  and  alternative rock  elder statesmen  Sonic Youth  as support, much to the consternation of many of his old fans. [ 26 ] [ 27 ]  Yet the influence of Sonic Youth could be clearly heard on the accompanying home video and live album,  Weld , which also included a bonus CD entitled  Arc , a single 35-minute-long collage of  feedback  and guitar noise that Neil included, evidently at the suggestion of Sonic Youth's  Thurston Moore . [ 28 ]   Arc  was later sold separately.   Young's next move was another return to country music.  Harvest Moon  (1992) was the long-awaited sequel to  Harvest  and reunited him with some of the musicians from that session, as well as singers  Linda Ronstadt  and  James Taylor . The title track was a minor hit and the record was reviewed and sold equally well, containing songs such as ""From Hank to  Hendrix "" and ""Unknown Legend"", a tribute to his wife. His resurgent popularity saw him booked on  MTV Unplugged  in 1993. In 1992 he accompanied fellow  Winnipegger   Randy Bachman  on ""Prairie Town,"" a song that recounts their days in the Winnipeg music scene of the 1960s. That year, he contributed music to the  soundtrack  of the  Jonathan Demme  movie  Philadelphia , and his song ""Philadelphia"" was nominated for the  Academy Award for Best Song , losing out to Bruce Springsteen's contribution to the same film. A summer tour covering both Europe and North America with  Booker T. and the MGs  (with whom he played two songs at a 1992  Bob Dylan  tribute concert at  Madison Square Garden ) was widely praised as a triumph. On a few of these dates, the show ended with a rendition of ""Rockin' in the Free World"" played with  Pearl Jam .   Young was back with Crazy Horse for 1994's  Sleeps with Angels , a much darker record. The title track told the story of  Kurt Cobain 's death; Young had reportedly made repeated attempts to contact Cobain prior to this event. [ 29 ]  Cobain had quoted Young's ""It's better to burn out than fade away"" (a line from "" My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue) "") in his alleged  suicide note , causing Young to emphasize the line ""'cause once you're gone you can't come back"" in live performances at the time. Other songs dealt with drive-by shootings (""Driveby""),  environmentalism  (""Piece of Crap"") and Young's own vision of America (the archetypal car metaphor of ""Trans Am""). Young was inspired to make the record after viewing Cobain's performance on  MTV Unplugged . Still admired by the prime movers of grunge, Young eventually performed with Pearl Jam at the MTV Music Awards during what was described as the highlight of a lackluster show. [ 30 ]  Their collaboration led to a joint tour, with the band and producer  Brendan O'Brien  backing Young. The accompanying album,  Mirror Ball  (1995), recorded as live in the studio captured their loose rock sound, and featured the standout track ""I'm the Ocean"". The year of 1995 also featured Young's entry into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .   After composing an abstract, distorted feedback-led guitar instrumental soundtrack to  Jim Jarmusch 's  acid western  film  Dead Man  Young recorded a series of loose jams with Crazy Horse that eventually appeared as the critically denigrated  Broken Arrow . The return to Crazy Horse was prompted by the death of mentor, friend, and longtime  producer   David Briggs  in late 1995. The subsequent tours of Europe and North America in 1996 resulted in both a live album and a tour documentary directed by  Jim Jarmusch . Both releases took the name  Year of the Horse .   In 1997, Young participated in the  H.O.R.D.E. Festival 's sixth annual tour.   In 1998, Young shared the stage with the rock band  Phish  at the annual  Farm Aid  concert, and later offered them an opportunity to headline both nights of the Bridge School Benefit concert. Phish took Young up on his offer to headline the Bridge School Benefit (where Young joined Phish for renditions of ""Helpless"" and ""I Shall Be Released."" [ 31 ]  Phish, however, declined Young's later invitation to be his backing band on a 1999 tour. [ 32 ]   The decade ended with  Looking Forward , another reunion with Crosby, Stills and Nash. The subsequent tour of the United States and Canada with the reformed super quartet was a huge success and brought in earnings of $42.1 million, making it the eighth largest grossing tour of 2000.   Young's next album,  Silver & Gold  (2000), contained a number of understated songs with personal lyrics, which was promoted through a mini-tour of solo acoustic shows. This style was continued in  Are You Passionate?  (2002), an album of love songs dedicated to his wife, Pegi.     [ edit ]   In the aftermath of 9/11   Young's 2001 single "" Let's Roll "", was a tribute to the victims of the  September 11, 2001 attacks , and the passengers and crew on  Flight 93  in particular. At the "" America: A Tribute to Heroes "" concert he performed  John Lennon's  "" Imagine "". In 2002,  Q  magazine  named Neil Young in their list of the ""50 Bands To See Before You Die.""   Young hauled out his concept album  Greendale , about an extended family in a small town called Greendale, and how they are torn apart by a murder, in 2003.  Greendale  was recorded with Crazy Horse members Billy Talbot and Ralph Molina. This tale of the Green family also resulted in a movie called  Greendale , written and directed by Young (again using his ""Bernard Shakey"" pseudonym) and starring a few of his friends, who act out and  lip sync  the songs from the album. The film was indeed thoroughly experimental, from Young's rambling on-stage between-song narratives, to his reading apparent transcriptions of these ramblings in the liner notes. ""When I was writing this I had no idea what I was doing, so I was just as surprised as you are,"" Young said later. Young toured extensively with the  Greendale  material throughout 2003 and 2004, first with a solo, acoustic version in Europe, then with a full-cast stage show in North America,  Japan , and  Australia . While audience reaction was sometimes mixed (drunken requests for ""Southern Man"" being an aesthetic impediment at most Young performances), the live stage version of Greendale was for many critics the most satisfying incarnation of the material, and bootlegs of the shows have been widely traded. The second half of each concert consisted of high-decibel renditions of Young classics such as ""Hey Hey, My My,"" ""Cinnamon Girl,"" ""Powderfinger,"" and  Rockin' in the Free World , as well as rarities such as ""The Losing End,"" ""The Old Country Waltz,"" and ""Danger Bird.""   Young spent the latter portion of 2004 giving a series of intimate acoustic concerts in various cities with his wife, Pegi, who is a trained vocalist and guitar player.     [ edit ]   Recent events          From left,  Emmylou Harris , Neil Young and  Pegi Young  perform in  Neil Young: Heart of Gold , which offered renditions of some of Young's best-known songs.       On  March 31 ,  2005 , Young was admitted to a hospital in New York for treatment for a brain  aneurysm . He was treated successfully by a minimally invasive  neuroradiological  procedure. Prior to undergoing the procedure, he wrote the first eight songs of a new album,  Prairie Wind , in  Nashville , with session musicians that included regular Young sideman  Ben Keith  on lap and  pedal steel guitars . Two days after the procedure, Young was forced to cancel a scheduled appearance on the  Juno Awards  telecast in Winnipeg when the area where the surgeons did his procedure (via the  femoral artery ) suddenly began to bleed. While Young finally was able to return to Winnipeg in 2006 with Crosby, Stills and Nash, his first post-aneurysm performance was on  July 2 ,  2005 , at the close of the  Live 8  concert in  Barrie, Ontario . There, he debuted a new song, a soft hymn called ""When God Made Me.""   On  September 28 ,  2005 ,  Prairie Wind  was released. In an interview given to  Time  magazine , Young revealed that he had planned to keep the news of his aneurysm private until he had the bleeding scare, after which he decided to make news of his condition public. The last two songs on the album were written after his aneurysm procedure, and several of the songs, such as ""Fallin' Off the Face of the Earth,"" seem to be inspired by Young's brush with  mortality , the recent death of his father, who suffered from  senile dementia , and Young's  Manitoba  roots.   In 2006,  Neil Young: Heart of Gold , a film made by  Jonathan Demme , premiered at the  Sundance Film Festival . Filmed over two nights at the  Ryman Auditorium  in  Nashville, Tennessee  during the premiere of  Prairie Wind , it includes both new and old songs as well as behind-the scenes-commentary by Young, his wife Pegi, and members of Young's session band.   In April 2006, Young announced the release of  Living with War , an album of protest songs that included the provocatively-titled "" Let's Impeach the President ."" Recorded using his famous  Les Paul  electric guitar, "" Old Black ,"" along with Chad Cromwell (drums), Rick Rosas (bass), and Tommy Brea (trumpet), the album was intended to be a stinging rebuke of U.S. President  George W. Bush  and the  War in Iraq . The album was recorded in a two week period in April, and was then made available over the internet from 28 April 2006 before being released as a CD on 5 May.  Living With War  was Young's most talked about release for years, creating heated political debate and a return to form with perhaps his most critically-acclaimed album since the early 1990s.  Living With War: In the Beginning , a remixed version with the original album's choral backing vocals removed, was released in December of the same year. Its accompanying DVD featured videos directed by Young of every song on the album, footage of the  Iraq War  and demonstrations in the US, and clips from  Al Gore 's  An Inconvenient Truth .          Neil Young on the CSNY ""Freedom Of Speech Tour '06""       From July through September 2006, Neil Young reunited with his former bandmates from  Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young  for the ""Freedom Of Speech Tour '06"" across North America. Chad Cromwell and Rick Rosas made up the band's rhythm section. The entire  Living with War  album was performed on the tour, in addition to other CSN and Neil Young classics such as "" Ohio "" and "" Rockin' in the Free World ."" An accompanying concert film and live album, called  CSNY Deja Vu , were premiered on January 25, 2008, at the Sundance Movie Festival.   2006 also saw the first release from Young's long awaited  Archives  project, as  Live at the Fillmore East , a selection of songs drawn from a 1970 gig with  Crazy Horse , was released in November of that year. The release was marked as number two in the  Archives Performance Series , leaving room for the still-unreleased 1969  Riverboat  bootleg, which will be number one in the series. In March 2007, another historical live album, marked as the third in the  Performance Series , was released. Titled  Live at Massey Hall 1971 , it featured a solo acoustic set from Toronto's Massey Hall, including material from the upcoming  Harvest  album.   On  August 15 ,  2007 , Young played a new album for 100 people at Reprise Records entitled  Chrome Dreams II .  Chrome Dreams  was an album he scrapped in 1977, and the name of two different bootlegs. The new album includes two long songs that time in at 18:13 (""Ordinary People"") and 14:31 (""No Hidden Path""), respectively. The album consists of three songs written previously and seven new songs, all by Young. The album was released on October 23, 2007, timed to coincide with a seven-week tour that had kicked off in Boise, Idaho, ten days earlier.   On February 11, 2008, Neil Young started the European leg of his tour with a concert in  Antwerp ,  Belgium . On July 17, he was interviewed on  PBS  by  Charlie Rose , where he spoke about many things, including his project to make a hybrid 1959 Lincoln. [ 33 ]  In October, a BBC 4 documentary ""Neil Young - Don't be Denied"" was shown, featuring interviews with Neil and a number of his contemporaries. It also summarizes his biography and motivations. [ 34 ]   The latest album in the Performance Series,  Sugar Mountain - Live At Canterbury House 1968  was released on December 2, 2008. Featuring material from Young's earliest solo performances recorded in Ann Arbor, MI November 9, 1968, the album was released as number zero in the  Performance Series .   The first installment of Young's oft-delayed box set  The Archives Vol. 1 1963-1972  was officially announced in 2008 with a trailer.  [ 35 ]   [ 36 ]  The first set of Archives will feature both DVD and Blu-ray editions which will include 128 audio tracks (43 unreleased and 13 never before heard songs), thousands of images (photos, lyrics, letters and memorabilia), and hours of new, previously released and rare videos. Also included will be a 236 page hardbound book. The Blu-ray edition will have HD picture, pristine audio mastered and presented in 24bit 192 khz., and access to photos, trivia and memorabilia without stopping the music. It is currently scheduled for release in 2009.   A April 07,2009 date has been set for Neil's new album 'A Fork in The Road', which will delay the release of the Archives until later in 2009.   Young currently lives on a 1500-acre (6 km) ranch in  La Honda, California , called Broken Arrow. He also owns property in  Fort Lauderdale, Florida , and on the islands of  Hawaii .   Young headlined the 2009  Big Day Out  festival in  New Zealand  and  Australia . Young pushed other current mainstream bands to only secondary headlining, including  Arctic Monkeys  and  The Ting Tings . He will also headline the Friday at  Glastonbury Festival  which has attempted to book him for many years. Although not officially confirmed, a number of sources have suggested this. [ 37 ]  He has also been confirmed to play the Primavera Festival, Barcelona in May 2009.     [ edit ]   Influence, importance and inspiration   Neil Young has undeniably been an important artist in the history of American and Canadian popular music and remains a distinct influence upon other recording artists.  Lynyrd Skynyrd s "" Sweet Home Alabama "" was written in response to two of Neil Youngs songs ""Southern Man"" and ""Alabama"". ""Ohio"" which Young recorded with Crosby, Stills and Nash, was a recollection of the tragic events that transpired at Kent State University in May 1970. Young's willingness to be politically outspoken and socially conscious allowed him to influence such important artists such as  Phish ,  Pearl Jam , and  Nirvana . Neil Young is referred to as ""the Godfather of  Grunge "" because of the influence he had on  Kurt Cobain  and  Eddie Vedder  and the entire grunge movement. Kurt Cobain quoted Neil Young in his suicide note, using the line Its better to burn out, than to fade away from Youngs song ""My My, Hey Hey (Out Of The Blue)"". Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam inducted Neil Young into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, citing him as a huge influence. He has also been a big influence on  experimental rock  acts like  Sonic Youth  and  Radiohead . Youngs influence, importance and inspiration within the music scene derive in part from his longevity because of a career spanning more than four decades. His first album was released in 1966 and his latest in 2008.  Bob Dylan 's influence on Young has been so obvious that the former once lambasted: "" Heart of Gold  bothered me every time it came on the radio ... and I'd say, 'Shit, that's me. If it sounds like me it might as well be me. (...) It seemed somebody else had taken my thing and had run away with it, you know, and I never got over it. Maybe tomorrow"" [ 38 ] . The Dutch guitar virtuoso  Jan Akkerman  described a typical electric guitar solo by Young as the sound of ""a Belgian  vibrator "" in a 1994 TV documentary, adding that it somehow became more palatable when one saw Young's grimace to accompany it  [ 39 ] .   The Australian rock group  Powderfinger  attribute their group name to their love of Young.   Toronto  based band  Constantines  recorded a version of Neil's  Fuckin' Up  in  Winnipeg , [ 40 ] which surfaced at the b-side the their ""Our Age"" 7"" [ 41 ] in November 2008. The members of the  Constantines  have occasionally played shows under the name Horsey Craze [ 42 ] , singing Neil Young songs. In early 2006, they released a vinyl only split-album with The Unintended. The Constantines recorded four Neil Young songs for the LP, while The Unintended performed four Gordon Lightfoot songs.   While in Winnipeg on November 2, 2008 during the Canadian leg of his tour,  Bob Dylan  visited the former home of Neil Young in River Heights. The home was where Neil spent some of his teenage years. Dylan was interested in seeing the room where some of Neils first songs were composed.     [ edit ]   Achievements   Young was inducted into the  Canadian Music Hall of Fame  in 1982. He has been inducted into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  twice: first in 1995 for his solo work, with an induction speech given by  Eddie Vedder , and again in 1997 as a member of Buffalo Springfield.   He has also directed five movies under his pseudonym Bernard Shakey, and released them through his own Shakey Pictures imprint:  Journey Through the Past  (1973),  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979)  Human Highway  (1982) (starring new wave band  Devo ), and  Greendale  (2003) and the documentary,  CSNY Deja Vu  (2008). The bonus  DVDs  included in both versions of  Greendale  and in  Prairie Wind  are also directed by Young under the Bernard Shakey alias, and all of Young's home video and DVD releases have been co-released under the Shakey Pictures imprint.   As one of the original founders of  Farm Aid , he remains an active member of the board of directors. For one weekend each October, in  Mountain View, California , he and his wife host the  Bridge School Concerts , which have been drawing international talent and sell-out crowds for nearly two decades with some of the biggest names in rock having performed at the event including  Bruce Springsteen ,  David Bowie ,  The Who ,  Red Hot Chili Peppers ,  Trent Reznor  of  Nine Inch Nails ,  Pearl Jam ,  Sonic Youth  and Sir  Paul McCartney . The concerts are a benefit for the  Bridge School , which develops and uses advanced technologies to aid in the instruction of children with disabilities. Young's involvement stems at least partially from the fact that both of his sons have  cerebral palsy  and his daughter, like Young himself, has  epilepsy .   Young was nominated for an  Oscar  in 1994 for his song ""Philadelphia"" from the film  Philadelphia  (Bruce Springsteen won the award for his song "" Streets of Philadelphia "" from the same film). In his acceptance speech, Springsteen said that ""the award really deserved to be shared by the other nominee's song."" That same night,  Tom Hanks  accepted the Oscar for Best Actor and gave credit for his inspiration to the song ""Philadelphia"".   He was part owner of  Lionel, LLC , a company that makes toy trains and model railroad accessories. [ 43 ]  In 2008 Lionel emerged from bankruptcy and his shares of the company were wiped out. At this time his status with Lionel is unknown, according to Lionel CEO Jerry Calabrese he is still a consultant for Lionel. He was instrumental in the design of the Lionel Legacy control system for model trains [ 43 ]  and it is believed he will continue to develop the system. Young has been named as co-inventor on seven U.S. Patents related to model trains. [ 44 ]   Young has twice received honorary doctorates. He received an Honorary Doctorate of Music from  Lakehead University  in  Thunder Bay ,  Ontario  in 1992, and an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from  San Francisco State University  in 2006. The latter honour was shared with his wife Pegi for their creation of the Bridge School.   In a ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"" list in the June 1996 issue of  Mojo  magazine , Young was ranked No. 9.   In 2003, Rolling Stone listed Young at #83 in its rankings of ""The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time,"" describing him as a ""restless experimenter...who transform[s] the most obvious music into something revelatory."" [ 45 ]   In 2000, Young was inducted into  Canada's Walk of Fame . [ 46 ]  He ranked No. 39 on  VH1 's 100 Greatest Artist of Hard Rock  that same year.   In 2001, Young was awarded the Spirit of Liberty award from the civil liberties group  People for the American Way .   In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked Neil Young [ 47 ]  #34 on their list of the  100 Greatest Artists of All Time . [ 48 ]   In 2006, Paste Magazine compiled a ""Greatest Living Songwriters"" list; Young was ranked No. 2 behind  Bob Dylan . (While Young and Dylan have occasionally played together in concert, they have never collaborated on a song together, or played on each others' records).   Jason Bond, an  East Carolina University  biologist, discovered a new species of trapdoor spider in 2007 and named it  Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi  after Young, his favorite singer. [ 49 ]   In 2008, Rolling Stone ranked Young at #37 in its list of ""The 100 Greatest Singers of All-Time. [ 50 ]   In 2009, He was nominated for a Grammy for Best Solo Rock Vocal performance.     [ edit ]   Instruments          Neil Young, 2008 in  Florence       Neil Young is a collector of second-hand guitars, but in recording and performing, he frequently uses just a few instruments. As explained by his longtime guitar technician  Larry Cragg  in the film  Neil Young: Heart of Gold , they include:     1953  Gibson Les Paul Goldtop Nicknamed "" Old Black "", this is Young's primary  electric guitar  and is featured on  Rust Never Sleeps  and most other albums. Old Black got its name from a purely amateur paintjob applied to the originally-gold body of the instrument, sometime before Neil acquired the guitar in the late 1960s. In 1972, a mini- humbucker  pickup from a  Gibson Firebird  guitar was installed into the lead/treble position, replacing a  P-90  as standard on Les Paul guitars from that era. This pickup, severely  microphonic , is considered a crucial component of Neil's sound. A  Bigsby vibrato tailpiece  was installed as early as 1969 on the guitar, and can be heard clearly during the opening of ""Cowgirl in the Sand"" from  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere . This guitar also features a mini-switch that is used to send the signal from the mini-humbucker direct to the amp, without going through the volume or tone controls. A Les Paul Gold Top of the same year as Old Black was assembled by Neil's guitar tech, using same style Firebird pick up in the guitar as well as the same model Bigsby Vib; but, according to Young, was just not the same as the original. Young acquired Old Black from Jim Messina, swapping one of his Gretsches for it in 1969 while Messina was assisting Young on his first solo album. Messina, who played briefly in Buffalo Springfield and produced the band's final album, ""Last Time Around,"" still has the Gretch in his possession.       Martin D-45 His primary  steel-string acoustic guitar ; used to write ""Old Man"" and many other hit songs.   Martin D-28Nicknamed ""Hank"" after its previous owner,  Hank Williams . The guitar came into Young's possession after  Hank Williams, Jr.  had traded it to another owner for some shotguns and it went through a succession of other owners until it was located by Young's longtime friend Grant Boatwright. The guitar was purchased by Young from  Tut Taylor . Young has toured with it for over 30 years. A story about the guitar and inspired song known as ""This Old Guitar"" can be seen about 50 minutes into the film  Neil Young: Heart of Gold . It is Young's primary guitar for the album,  Prairie Wind .   Neil Young can be seen playing a Vagabond Travel Guitar as he sings ""Let's Impeach the President"" on  The Colbert Report  on  Comedy Central .   A 12-string Taylor 855 is used in the first half of the soundtrack and concert film ""Rust Never Sleeps""   1927  Gibson  MastertoneA six-string  banjo , tuned like a guitar. It has been used on many recordings and was played by  James Taylor  on ""Old Man"".   Various vintage  Fender Tweed Deluxe  amplifiers Young's preferred amplifier for electric guitar is the diminutive Fender Deluxe, specifically a Tweed-era model from 1959. Neil purchased his first vintage Deluxe in 1967 for $50 from the drummer of Crazy Horse, Ralph Molina, and has since acquired nearly 450 different examples, all from the same era, but he maintains that it's the original model that sounds superior, and is a crucial component to his trademark sound. The Tweed Deluxe is almost always used in conjunction with a late-1950's Magnatone 280 (similar to the amp used by Lonnie Mack and Buddy Holly). The Magnatone and the Deluxe are paired together in a somewhat unique manner - the external speaker jack from the Deluxe sends the amped signal through a volume potentiometer and directly into the input of the Magnatone. The Magnatone is notable for its true pitch-bending vibrato capabilities, which can be heard as an electric piano amplifier on ""See the Sky About to Rain"". A notable and unique accessory to Young's Deluxe is the Whizzer, a device created specifically for Young, which physically changes the amplifier's settings to pre-set combinations. It has gone through many incarnations.   Gretsch 6120  (Chet Atkins)Before Young bought Old Black, this was his primary electric guitar used during his  Buffalo Springfield  days.   Gretsch White Falcon   Late '50s hollow body that Young purchased near the end of the  Buffalo Springfield  era; in 1969 Young acquired a stereo version of the same vintage guitar from Stills, and this instrument is featured prominently during Young's early '70s period, and can be heard on tracks like ""Ohio,"" ""Southern Man,"" ""Alabama,"" ""L.A.,"" others. It is Neil's primary electric guitar during the  Harvest  era. This particular White Falcon is the stereo 6137, in which the signal from the three bass strings is separated from the signal from the three treble strings. Young typically plays this guitar in this stereo mode, sending the separate signals to two different amps: the Fender Deluxe and typically to either a Fender Tremolux or a low-powered Tweed Fender Twin. The separation of the signals is most prominently heard on the Harvest album song ""Words"".   Neil Young replaced his trademark Les Paul for a Gibson Flying V on the ""Time Fades Away"" tour.   Neil Young played a  Fender Broadcaster  on the Tonight's the Night tour and album.

Young's work is characterized by deeply personal lyrics, distinctive guitar work, and signature falsetto  tenor  singing voice. Although he accompanies himself on several different instrumentsincluding  piano  and  harmonica his claw-hammer  acoustic guitar  style and often idiosyncratic electric guitar soloing are the linchpins of a sometimes ragged, sometimes polished sound. Although Young has experimented widely with differing music styles, including  swing ,  jazz ,  rockabilly ,  blues , and  electronic music  throughout a varied career, his best known work usually falls into either of two distinct styles:  folk -esque  acoustic   rock  ("" Heart of Gold "", ""Harvest Moon"" and "" Old Man "") and  electric -charged  hard rock  (like "" Cinnamon Girl "", "" Rockin' in the Free World "" and "" Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black) ""). In recent years, Young has adopted elements from newer styles like  industrial ,  alternative country  and  grunge . Young's profound influence on the latter caused some to dub him ""the godfather of grunge"".   Young has directed (or co-directed) a number of  films  using the  pseudonym  Bernard Shakey, including  Journey Through the Past  (1973),  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979),  Human Highway  (1982),  Greendale  (2003), and  CSNY Dj Vu  (2008). He is currently working on a documentary about electric car technology, tentatively titled  Linc/Volt . The project involves a 1959  Lincoln Continental  converted to hybrid technology, which Young plans to drive to  Washington, DC  as an example to lawmakers there. [ 2 ]   He is also an outspoken advocate for environmental issues and small farmers, having co-founded in 1985 the  benefit concert   Farm Aid , and in 1986 helped found The Bridge School, [ 3 ]  and its annual supporting  Bridge School Benefit  concerts, together with his wife Pegi (in this, Young's involvement stems at least partially from the fact that both of his sons have  cerebral palsy  and his daughter, like Young himself, has  epilepsy ).   Although Young sings as frequently about U.S. legends and myths ( Pocahontas ,  space stations , and the settlement of the American West) [ 4 ]  as he does about his native country, he remains a Canadian citizen and has never wanted to relinquish his Canadian citizenship. He has lived in the U.S. for ""so long"" and has stated he has ""got just as much right to vote in them (American elections) as anybody else.""

He spent his early years in the small country town of  Omemee , 130  kilometres  (81  mi ) northeast of Toronto.   Young was diagnosed with diabetes as a child [ 6 ]  and a bout of  polio  at the age of 6 left him with a weakened left side; he still walks with a slight limp.   His parents divorced when Young was 12, and he moved with his mother back to the family home of  Winnipeg , Manitoba, where the formative years of his music career began. Neil and his mother Rassy settled into the working class suburb of  Fort Rouge  where the shy, dry-humoured youth enrolled at Earl Grey Junior High School. It was there that he formed his first band  the Jades , and met  Ken Koblun , later to join him in the Squires.   While attending  Kelvin High School  in Winnipeg, he played in several instrumental rock bands. Young's first stable band was called the Squires, who had a local hit called ""The Sultan"". Young dropped out of high school [ 7 ]  and also played in  Fort William , where they recorded a series of demos produced by a local producer named Ray Dee, whom Young called ""the original Briggs."" [ 8 ]  While in Thunder Bay, Young first encountered  Stephen Stills . In the  2006  film  Heart of Gold  Young relates how he used to spend time as a teenager at  Falcon Lake, Manitoba  where he would endlessly plug coins into the jukebox to hear  Ian Tyson 's "" Four Strong Winds "". Neil also formed a friendship with musician  Randy Bachman .   After leaving the Squires, Neil worked folk clubs in Winnipeg, where he first met  Joni Mitchell . [ 9 ]  Here he wrote some of his earliest and most enduring folk songs such as the classic "" Sugar Mountain "", about his lost youth. Mitchell wrote ""The Circle Game"" in response. [ citation needed ]   In 1965 Young toured Canada as a solo artist. In 1966, he joined the  Rick James -fronted  Mynah Birds . The band managed to secure a record deal with the  Motown  label, but as their first album was being recorded, James was arrested for being  AWOL  from the army. [ 10 ]  After the Mynah Birds disbanded, Young and bass player  Bruce Palmer  relocated to  Los Angeles . Young has admitted in an interview that he was in the United States illegally until receiving a green card in 1970. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Buffalo Springfield   Once they reached Los Angeles, Young and Palmer met up with  Stephen Stills ,  Richie Furay , and  Dewey Martin  to form  Buffalo Springfield . A mixture of folk, country,  psychedelia , and rock lent a hard edge by the twin lead guitars of Stills and Young made Buffalo Springfield a critical success, and their first record  Buffalo Springfield  (1967) sold well after Stills' topical song "" For What It's Worth "" became a hit, aided by Young's melodic harmonics played on electric guitar.   Distrust of their management, as well as the arrest and deportation of Palmer, exacerbated the already strained relations among the group members and led to Buffalo Springfield's demise. A second album,  Buffalo Springfield Again , was released in late 1967, but two of Youngs three contributions were solo tracks recorded apart from the rest of the group.   In many ways, these three songs on  Buffalo Springfield Again  are harbingers of much of Young's later work in that, although they all share deeply personal, almost idiosyncratic lyrics, they also present three very different musical approaches to the arrangement of what is essentially an original folk song. ""Mr Soul"" is the only Young song of the three that all five members of the group perform together. In contrast, "" Broken Arrow "" was confessional folk rock of a kind that would characterize much of the music that emerged from the singer-songwriter movement. Youngs experimental production intersperses each verse with snippets of sound from other sources, including opening the song with a sound bite of Dewey Martin singing ""Mr. Soul"" and closing it with the thumping of a heartbeat. ""Expecting to Fly"" was a lushly produced  ballad  featuring a string arrangement that Young's co-producer for the track,  Jack Nitzsche , would dub ""symphonic pop.""   In May 1968, the band split up for good, but in order to fulfill a contractual obligation, a final album,  Last Time Around , was recorded, primarily from recordings made earlier that year. Young contributed the songs ""On the Way Home"" and ""I Am a Child"", singing lead on the latter. In 1997, the band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame; Young did not appear at the ceremony.     [ edit ]   Solo success & CSNY   After the breakup of Buffalo Springfield, Young signed a solo deal with  Reprise Records , home of his colleague and friend  Joni Mitchell , with whom he shared a manager, Elliot Roberts, who manages Young to this day. Young and Nitzsche immediately began work on Young's first solo record,  Neil Young  (November 1968), which received mixed reviews. In a 1970 interview, [ 12 ]  Young deprecated the album as being ""overdubbed rather than played,"" and the quest for music that expresses the spontaneity of the moment has long been a feature of his career. Nevertheless, the album contains some tunes that remain a staple of his live shows, most notably ""The Loner.""   For his next album, Young recruited three musicians from a band called The Rockets:  Danny Whitten  on guitar,  Billy Talbot  on bass guitar, and  Ralph Molina  on  drums . These three took the name  Crazy Horse  (after  the historical figure of the same name ), and  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere  (May 1969), is credited to ""Neil Young with Crazy Horse."" Recorded in just two weeks, the album opens with one of Young's most familiar songs, ""Cinnamon Girl,"" and is dominated by two more, ""Cowgirl in the Sand"" and ""Down by the River,"" that feature lengthy jams showcasing Young's idiosyncratic guitar soloing accompanied sympathetically by Crazy Horse. Young reportedly wrote all three songs on the same day, while nursing a high fever of 103 F (39.5 C) in bed.   Shortly after the release of  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere , Young reunited with Stephen Stills by joining  Crosby, Stills, & Nash , who had already released one album as a trio. Young was originally offered a position as a sideman, but agreed to join only if he received full membership, and the group - winners of the 1969 ""Best New Artist"" Grammy - was renamed Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. [ 13 ]  The quartet debuted in  Chicago  on  August 16 ,  1969 , and later performed at the famous  Woodstock Festival , during which Young skipped the acoustic set and refused to be filmed during the electric set, even telling the cameramen: ""One of you fuckin' guys comes near me and I'm gonna fuckin' hit you with my guitar"". [ 14 ]  During the making of their first album,  Dj Vu , the musicians frequently argued, particularly Young and Stills, who both fought for control. [ 15 ]   "" Ohio "" was written following the  Kent State massacre  on  May 4 ,  1970 , and was a staple of anti-war rallies in the 1970s. The song was quickly recorded by CSNY and immediately released as a single, even though CSNY's ""Teach Your Children"" was still climbing the singles charts. Many believe that the release of ""Ohio"" as a single cut into the sales of ""Teach Your Children"" and prevented that song from reaching the top ten. In the late 1970s and for much of the 1980s, Young refrained from performing ""Ohio"" live, as he considered the song to be dated. In the wake of the 1989  Tiananmen Square massacre , however, Young revived the song in concert, often dedicating it to the  Chinese  students who were killed in the massacre. Crosby, Stills & Nash, as a trio, also returned the song to their live repertoire around the same time, even though Young had provided the lead vocals on the original recording.   Also that year, Young released his third solo album,  After the Gold Rush  (1970), which featured, among others, a young  Nils Lofgren ,  Stephen Stills , and CSNY bassist Greg Reeves. Young also recorded some tracks with Crazy Horse, but dismissed them early in the sessions. Aided by his newfound fame with CSNY, the album was a commercial breakthrough for Young and contains some of his best known work. Notable tracks include the title track, with dream-like lyrics that run a gamut of subjects from drugs and interpersonal relationships to environmental concerns, as well as Youngs controversial and acerbic condemnation of  racism  in "" Southern Man ,"" which, along with a later song entitled ""Alabama,"" later prompted  Lynyrd Skynyrd  to decry Young by name in the lyrics to "" Sweet Home Alabama ."" Young was one of Skynyrd's biggest influences, and Young was an admirer of Skynyrd's music. The respectful rivalry and friendship between Young and Skynyrd front man  Ronnie Van Zant  would serve as a recurring theme in the  Drive-By Truckers ' 2001  concept album   Southern Rock Opera .   With CSNY splitting up and Crazy Horse having signed their own record deal, Young began the year 1971 with a solo tour entitled ""Journey Through the Past."" Later, he recruited a new group of country-music session musicians, whom he christened  The Stray Gators , to record much of the new material that had been premiered on tour for the album  Harvest  (1972).  Harvest  was a massive hit (especially with the country-music crowd) and ""Heart of Gold"" became a US number one single; incidentally, to this day it remains the only No. 1 hit in his long career.   Another notable song was "" The Needle and the Damage Done ,"" a somber lament on the pain caused by heroin addiction; inspired in part by the heavy heroin use of Crazy Horse member Danny Whitten, who would eventually die of an overdose. [ 16 ]   The album's success, however, caught Young off guard, and his first instinct was to back away from stardom. In the handwritten liner notes to the  Decade  compilation, Young described ""Heart of Gold"" as the song that ""put me in the middle of the road. Traveling there soon became a bore, so I headed for the ditch. A rougher ride but I saw more interesting people there.""   On  September 8 ,  1972 , the Academy Award-nominated actress  Carrie Snodgress , with whom he had been living, gave birth to Neil Young's first child. The boy, Zeke, was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Young fell in love with Snodgress after seeing her in a movie (""Diary of a Mad Housewife"") on television after which Young wrote the song "" A Man Needs a Maid "" from the Harvest album, featuring the lyric ""I fell in love with the actress/she was playing a part that I could understand.""     [ edit ]   The Ditch Trilogy   Although a new tour had been planned to follow up on the success of  Harvest , it became apparent during rehearsals that Danny Whitten could not function due to  drug abuse . On  November 18 , 1972, shortly after he was fired from the tour preparations, Whitten was found dead of an  overdose . Young described the incident to  Rolling Stone s  Cameron Crowe  in 1975:  [ 17 ]  ""[We] were rehearsing with him and he just couldn't cut it. He couldn't remember anything. He was too out of it. Too far gone. I had to tell him to go back to L.A. 'It's not happening, man. You're not together enough.' He just said, 'I've got nowhere else to go, man. How am I gonna tell my friends?' And he split. That night the coroner called me from L.A. and told me he'd ODed. That blew my mind. Fucking blew my mind. I loved Danny. I felt responsible. And from there, I had to go right out on this huge tour of huge arenas. I was very nervous and  insecure.""   The album made in the aftermath of this incident,  Time Fades Away  (1973), has often been described by Young as ""my least favourite record,"" and it is, in fact, one of only two of Youngs early recordings that has yet to be officially re-released on CD (the other being the soundtrack album  Journey Through the Past ). The album was recorded live over a tour where Young struggled with his voice and called  David Crosby  and  Graham Nash  to help perform the music. The tour featured  Linda Ronstadt  as the opening act.  Time Fades Away  occupies a unique position in Youngs discography as the first of three albums known collectively as the "" Ditch Trilogy .""   In the second half of 1973, Young formed The Santa Monica Flyers, with Crazy Horse's rhythm section augmented by Nils Lofgren on guitar. Deeply affected by the drug-induced deaths of Whitten and  roadie   Bruce Berry , Young recorded  Tonight's the Night . The album's dark tone and rawness caused Reprise to delay the release until two years later and only after being pressured by Young to do so. [ 18 ]  It received mixed reviews at the time, but is now regarded as a landmark album, thought by some to be a precursor to  punk rock . In Young's own opinion, it was the closest he ever came to art. [ 19 ]   While his record company delayed the release of  Tonight's the Night,  Young recorded  On the Beach  (1974), which dealt with themes such as the downside of fame and the Californian lifestyle. Like  Time Fades Away  and  Tonight's the Night , it sold poorly but eventually became a critical favourite, presenting some of Young's most original work. In a review of the 2003 re-release on CD of  On the Beach  Derek Svennungsen described the music as ""mesmerizing, harrowing, lucid, and bleary,"" [ 20 ] .     [ edit ]   Return to prominence   After completing  On the Beach , Young reunited with  Harvest  producer Elliot Mazer to record another acoustic album,  Homegrown . Most of the songs were written after Young's breakup with Snodgress, and thus the tone of the album was somewhat dark. Though the album was entirely completed, Young decided to drop the album and release  Tonight's the Night  instead, at the suggestion of  The Band  bassist  Rick Danko . [ 21 ]  Young further explained his move by saying: ""It was a little too personal... it scared me"". [ 22 ]          Neil Young in Austin, Texas on November 9, 1976       Young reformed Crazy Horse with  Frank Sampedro  on guitar as his backup band for  Zuma  (1975). Many of the songs are overtly concerned with failed relationships, and even the epic "" Cortez the Killer ,"" outwardly a retelling of the  Spanish conquest  of  Mexico  from the viewpoint of the  Aztecs , can be seen as an allegory of love lostsomething that didnt save it, however, from being banned in  Franco 's  Spain .   The following year, Young reunited with Stephen Stills for the album  Long May You Run  (1976), credited to  The Stills-Young Band ; the follow-up tour was ended midway through by Young, who sent Stills a  telegram  that read: ""Funny how some things that start spontaneously end that way. Eat a peach, Neil."" [ 23 ]   In 1976, Young performed with  The Band , Joni Mitchell, and other rock musicians in the high profile all-star concert  The Last Waltz . The release of  Martin Scorsese 's movie of the concert was delayed while Scorsese unwillingly re-edited it to obscure the lump of cocaine that was clearly visible hanging from Young's nose during his performance of  ""Helpless."" [ 24 ]  Young later said, ""I'm not proud of that,"" according to one of his biographers.   American Stars 'N Bars  (1977) contained two songs originally recorded for  Homegrown  album, ""Homegrown"" and ""Star of Bethelehem,"" as well as newer material, including the future concert staple "" Like A Hurricane "". Performers included  Linda Ronstadt ,  Emmylou Harris  and Young protg  Nicolette Larson  along with Crazy Horse. Also in 1977, Young released  Decade : a personally selected career summary of material spanning every aspect of his various interests and affiliations, including a handful of unreleased songs.  Comes a Time  (1978) also featured Nicolette Larson and Crazy Horse and became Young's most commercially accessible album in quite some time, marked by a return to his folk roots.   Young next set out on the lengthy ""Rust Never Sleeps"" tour, in which each concert was divided into a solo acoustic set and an electric set with Crazy Horse. Much of the electric set was later seen as a response to punk rock's burgeoning popularity. ""Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)"" compared the changing public perception of  Johnny Rotten  with that of the recently deceased  Elvis Presley , who himself had once been disparaged as a dangerous influence only to later become an  icon . Rotten, meanwhile, returned the favour by playing one of Young's records on a  London  radio show. The accompanying albums  Rust Never Sleeps  (new material, culled from live recordings, but featuring studio overdubs) and  Live Rust  (a mixture of old and new, and a genuine concert recording) captured the two sides of the concerts, with solo acoustic songs on side A, and fierce, uptempo, electric songs on side B. A movie version of the concerts, also called  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979), was directed by Young under the pseudonym Bernard Shakey.   Young was suddenly hip again, and the readers and critics of  Rolling Stone  voted him Artist Of The Year for 1979 (along with The Who), selected  Rust Never Sleeps  as Album Of The Year, and voted him Male Vocalist Of The Year as well.  The Village Voice , meanwhile, honored Young as the Artist of the Decade.     [ edit ]   1980s - Experimental years   The 1980s were a lean time for Young both critically and commercially. After providing the incidental music to a  biopic  of  Hunter S. Thompson  entitled  Where the Buffalo Roam , he recorded  Hawks & Doves  (1980), a folk/country record.  Re-ac-tor  (1981), once again with Crazy Horse, was a faade of distortion and feedback obscuring a relatively weak selection of songs, but his strangest record of the decade came with  Trans  (1982). Recorded partially with  vocoders ,  synthesizers , and other devices that modified instruments and vocals with electronic effects, it is sometimes considered an experiment related to finding a technology that would become a means to communicate for Youngs son (with his wife Pegi), Ben, who has severe  cerebral palsy  and cannot speak. Many fans were baffled by the radical forms of this album and  rockabilly -styled  Everybody's Rockin'  (1983), and record company head  David Geffen  even sued Young for making ""unrepresentative"" musici.e. music that did not sound like Neil Youngthat deliberately lacked commercial appeal. [ 25 ]  Young later stated that he would have preferred to release the songs featuring the  synclavier  and  vocoder  as an EP, and that their inclusion with the Hawaiian-themed rockabilly was a mistake. Also premiered at this time though little seen was an eclectic full-length comedy film  Human Highway  starring, co-directed and co-written by Young.   In 1983, Young worked with British video director  Tim Pope , making two videos - ""Wonderin'"" and ""Cry, Cry, Cry.""   In 1985, he reunited with Crosby, Stills and Nash at  Live Aid  at Philadelphia's  John F. Kennedy Stadium . The two songs that they played, ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"" and "" Daylight Again /Find The Cost of Freedom,"" were the first songs they had played as a quartet in front of a paying audience since 1974.   Old Ways  (1985) saw a return to country music, recorded with a group of friends and session musicians.  Landing on Water  (1986) is entertaining for the blending of synthesizers and other instruments related to the 1980s into Youngs own style, with lyrics that take pot shots at some favourite targets, including CSN in ""Hippie Dream,"" with a chorus that goes: ""But the wooden ships/Were just a hippie dream,"" and David Geffen in ""Drifter,"" with the line: ""Dont try to tell me what I gotta do to fit."" The resumption of his partnership with Crazy Horse on  Life  (1987) fulfilled his contract with Geffen, and Young was finally able to switch labels.   Director Pope again made a series of videos from the album, including ""Touch the Night"" and ""People on the Street"".   Signing with  Warner Brothers  (which distributed Geffen at the time) and returning to Reprise Records, Young produced  This Note's For You  (1988) with a new band, The Bluenotes, whose name rights were owned by musician  Harold Melvin . Young named his band after a cafe called the Blue Note on Main Street in Winnipeg Manitoba, where he had played. The addition of a  brass  section provided a new  jazzier  sound and the title track became his first hit single of the decade. Accompanied by a video which parodied corporate rock, the pretensions of advertising and  Michael Jackson  in particular, the song was initially banned by  MTV  (although the Canadian music channel,  MuchMusic  ran it immediately) before being put into heavy rotation and finally given the  MTV Video Music Award for Best Video of the Year  for 1989. After Melvin sued over the use of the Bluenotes name, Young renamed his back-up group ""Ten Men Workin'"" for the balance of the concert tour.   Young also contributed to that year's CSNY reunion  American Dream  (1988) and CSNY played a few benefit concerts. Young, however, refused to book a full tour with CSN and the foursome would not embark upon a nationwide tour until 2000.     [ edit ]   1990s - Return to country-rock roots   Freedom  was a mixture of acoustic and electric rock dealing with the state of the U.S. and the world in 1989, alongside a set of love songs and a version of the standard ""On Broadway."" "" Rockin' in the Free World "", two versions of which bookended the album, again caught the mood. Some say it became a  de facto  anthem during the fall of the  Berlin Wall , a few months after the record's release. However, most Germans don't remember the song being related to the unification, understandably so, since the lyrics are not about political repression. Like  Bruce Springsteen 's "" Born in the U.S.A. "", the anthemic use of this song was based on largely ignoring the verses, which evoke social problems and implicitly criticize American government policies. In mid-1989, record executive  Terry Tolkin  conceived and produced a tribute album to Young's songs called  The Bridge: A Tribute To Neil Young,  released on his  No.6 Records  label. It featured cover versions of 15 of Young's songs by the cream of the up and coming  Alternative Music  and  Grunge music  bands including  Sonic Youth ,  Nick Cave ,  Soul Asylum ,  Dinosaur Jr ,and  The Pixies . By 1990,  grunge music  was beginning to make its first inroads in the charts and many of its prime movers, including  Nirvana 's  Kurt Cobain  and  Pearl Jam 's  Eddie Vedder , cited Young as a major influence.   Using a barn on his  Northern California  ranch as a studio, he rapidly recorded  Ragged Glory  with Crazy Horse, whose guitar riffs and feedback driven sound showed his new admirers that he could still cut it. Young then headed back out on the road with Orange Country country-punk band  Social Distortion  and  alternative rock  elder statesmen  Sonic Youth  as support, much to the consternation of many of his old fans. [ 26 ] [ 27 ]  Yet the influence of Sonic Youth could be clearly heard on the accompanying home video and live album,  Weld , which also included a bonus CD entitled  Arc , a single 35-minute-long collage of  feedback  and guitar noise that Neil included, evidently at the suggestion of Sonic Youth's  Thurston Moore . [ 28 ]   Arc  was later sold separately.   Young's next move was another return to country music.  Harvest Moon  (1992) was the long-awaited sequel to  Harvest  and reunited him with some of the musicians from that session, as well as singers  Linda Ronstadt  and  James Taylor . The title track was a minor hit and the record was reviewed and sold equally well, containing songs such as ""From Hank to  Hendrix "" and ""Unknown Legend"", a tribute to his wife. His resurgent popularity saw him booked on  MTV Unplugged  in 1993. In 1992 he accompanied fellow  Winnipegger   Randy Bachman  on ""Prairie Town,"" a song that recounts their days in the Winnipeg music scene of the 1960s. That year, he contributed music to the  soundtrack  of the  Jonathan Demme  movie  Philadelphia , and his song ""Philadelphia"" was nominated for the  Academy Award for Best Song , losing out to Bruce Springsteen's contribution to the same film. A summer tour covering both Europe and North America with  Booker T. and the MGs  (with whom he played two songs at a 1992  Bob Dylan  tribute concert at  Madison Square Garden ) was widely praised as a triumph. On a few of these dates, the show ended with a rendition of ""Rockin' in the Free World"" played with  Pearl Jam .   Young was back with Crazy Horse for 1994's  Sleeps with Angels , a much darker record. The title track told the story of  Kurt Cobain 's death; Young had reportedly made repeated attempts to contact Cobain prior to this event. [ 29 ]  Cobain had quoted Young's ""It's better to burn out than fade away"" (a line from "" My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue) "") in his alleged  suicide note , causing Young to emphasize the line ""'cause once you're gone you can't come back"" in live performances at the time. Other songs dealt with drive-by shootings (""Driveby""),  environmentalism  (""Piece of Crap"") and Young's own vision of America (the archetypal car metaphor of ""Trans Am""). Young was inspired to make the record after viewing Cobain's performance on  MTV Unplugged . Still admired by the prime movers of grunge, Young eventually performed with Pearl Jam at the MTV Music Awards during what was described as the highlight of a lackluster show. [ 30 ]  Their collaboration led to a joint tour, with the band and producer  Brendan O'Brien  backing Young. The accompanying album,  Mirror Ball  (1995), recorded as live in the studio captured their loose rock sound, and featured the standout track ""I'm the Ocean"". The year of 1995 also featured Young's entry into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .   After composing an abstract, distorted feedback-led guitar instrumental soundtrack to  Jim Jarmusch 's  acid western  film  Dead Man  Young recorded a series of loose jams with Crazy Horse that eventually appeared as the critically denigrated  Broken Arrow . The return to Crazy Horse was prompted by the death of mentor, friend, and longtime  producer   David Briggs  in late 1995. The subsequent tours of Europe and North America in 1996 resulted in both a live album and a tour documentary directed by  Jim Jarmusch . Both releases took the name  Year of the Horse .   In 1997, Young participated in the  H.O.R.D.E. Festival 's sixth annual tour.   In 1998, Young shared the stage with the rock band  Phish  at the annual  Farm Aid  concert, and later offered them an opportunity to headline both nights of the Bridge School Benefit concert. Phish took Young up on his offer to headline the Bridge School Benefit (where Young joined Phish for renditions of ""Helpless"" and ""I Shall Be Released."" [ 31 ]  Phish, however, declined Young's later invitation to be his backing band on a 1999 tour. [ 32 ]   The decade ended with  Looking Forward , another reunion with Crosby, Stills and Nash. The subsequent tour of the United States and Canada with the reformed super quartet was a huge success and brought in earnings of $42.1 million, making it the eighth largest grossing tour of 2000.   Young's next album,  Silver & Gold  (2000), contained a number of understated songs with personal lyrics, which was promoted through a mini-tour of solo acoustic shows. This style was continued in  Are You Passionate?  (2002), an album of love songs dedicated to his wife, Pegi.     [ edit ]   In the aftermath of 9/11   Young's 2001 single "" Let's Roll "", was a tribute to the victims of the  September 11, 2001 attacks , and the passengers and crew on  Flight 93  in particular. At the "" America: A Tribute to Heroes "" concert he performed  John Lennon's  "" Imagine "". In 2002,  Q  magazine  named Neil Young in their list of the ""50 Bands To See Before You Die.""   Young hauled out his concept album  Greendale , about an extended family in a small town called Greendale, and how they are torn apart by a murder, in 2003.  Greendale  was recorded with Crazy Horse members Billy Talbot and Ralph Molina. This tale of the Green family also resulted in a movie called  Greendale , written and directed by Young (again using his ""Bernard Shakey"" pseudonym) and starring a few of his friends, who act out and  lip sync  the songs from the album. The film was indeed thoroughly experimental, from Young's rambling on-stage between-song narratives, to his reading apparent transcriptions of these ramblings in the liner notes. ""When I was writing this I had no idea what I was doing, so I was just as surprised as you are,"" Young said later. Young toured extensively with the  Greendale  material throughout 2003 and 2004, first with a solo, acoustic version in Europe, then with a full-cast stage show in North America,  Japan , and  Australia . While audience reaction was sometimes mixed (drunken requests for ""Southern Man"" being an aesthetic impediment at most Young performances), the live stage version of Greendale was for many critics the most satisfying incarnation of the material, and bootlegs of the shows have been widely traded. The second half of each concert consisted of high-decibel renditions of Young classics such as ""Hey Hey, My My,"" ""Cinnamon Girl,"" ""Powderfinger,"" and  Rockin' in the Free World , as well as rarities such as ""The Losing End,"" ""The Old Country Waltz,"" and ""Danger Bird.""   Young spent the latter portion of 2004 giving a series of intimate acoustic concerts in various cities with his wife, Pegi, who is a trained vocalist and guitar player.     [ edit ]   Recent events          From left, Emmylou Harris, Neil Young and Pegi Young perform in  Neil Young: Heart of Gold , which offered renditions of some of Young's best-known songs.       On  March 31 ,  2005 , Young was admitted to a hospital in New York for treatment for a brain  aneurysm . He was treated successfully by a minimally invasive  neuroradiological  procedure. Prior to undergoing the procedure, he wrote the first eight songs of a new album,  Prairie Wind , in  Nashville , with session musicians that included regular Young sideman  Ben Keith  on lap and  pedal steel guitars . Two days after the procedure, Young was forced to cancel a scheduled appearance on the  Juno Awards  telecast in Winnipeg when the area where the surgeons did his procedure (via the  femoral artery ) suddenly began to bleed. While Young finally was able to return to Winnipeg in 2006 with Crosby, Stills and Nash, his first post-aneurysm performance was on  July 2 ,  2005 , at the close of the  Live 8  concert in  Barrie, Ontario . There, he debuted a new song, a soft hymn called ""When God Made Me.""   On  September 28 ,  2005 ,  Prairie Wind  was released. In an interview given to  Time  magazine , Young revealed that he had planned to keep the news of his aneurysm private until he had the bleeding scare, after which he decided to make news of his condition public. The last two songs on the album were written after his aneurysm procedure, and several of the songs, such as ""Fallin' Off the Face of the Earth,"" seem to be inspired by Young's brush with  mortality , the recent death of his father, who suffered from  senile dementia , and Young's  Manitoba  roots.   In 2006,  Neil Young: Heart of Gold , a film made by  Jonathan Demme , premiered at the  Sundance Film Festival . Filmed over two nights at the  Ryman Auditorium  in  Nashville, Tennessee  during the premiere of  Prairie Wind , it includes both new and old songs as well as behind-the scenes-commentary by Young, his wife Pegi, and members of Young's session band.   In April 2006, Young announced the release of  Living with War , an album of protest songs that included the provocatively-titled "" Let's Impeach the President ."" Recorded using his famous  Les Paul  electric guitar, "" Old Black ,"" along with Chad Cromwell (drums), Rick Rosas (bass), and Tommy Brea (trumpet), the album was intended to be a stinging rebuke of U.S. President  George W. Bush  and the  War in Iraq . The album was recorded in a two week period in April, and was then made available over the internet from 28 April 2006 before being released as a CD on 5 May.  Living With War  was Young's most talked about release for years, creating heated political debate and a return to form with perhaps his most critically-acclaimed album since the early 1990s.  Living With War: In the Beginning , a remixed version with the original album's choral backing vocals removed, was released in December of the same year. Its accompanying DVD featured videos directed by Young of every song on the album, footage of the  Iraq War  and demonstrations in the US, and clips from  Al Gore 's  An Inconvenient Truth .          Neil Young on the CSNY ""Freedom Of Speech Tour '06""       From July through September 2006, Neil Young reunited with his former bandmates from  Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young  for the ""Freedom Of Speech Tour '06"" across North America. Chad Cromwell and Rick Rosas made up the band's rhythm section. The entire  Living with War  album was performed on the tour, in addition to other CSN and Neil Young classics such as "" Ohio "" and "" Rockin' in the Free World ."" An accompanying concert film and live album, called  CSNY Deja Vu , were premiered on January 25, 2008, at the Sundance Movie Festival.   2006 also saw the first release from Young's long awaited  Archives  project, as  Live at the Fillmore East , a selection of songs drawn from a 1970 gig with  Crazy Horse , was released in November of that year. The release was marked as number two in the  Archives Performance Series , leaving room for the still-unreleased 1969  Riverboat  bootleg, which will be number one in the series. In March 2007, another historical live album, marked as the third in the  Performance Series , was released. Titled  Live at Massey Hall 1971 , it featured a solo acoustic set from Toronto's Massey Hall, including material from the upcoming  Harvest  album.   On  August 15 ,  2007 , Young played a new album for 100 people at Reprise Records entitled  Chrome Dreams II .  Chrome Dreams  was an album he scrapped in 1977, and the name of two different bootlegs. The new album includes two long songs that time in at 18:13 (""Ordinary People"") and 14:31 (""No Hidden Path""), respectively. The album consists of three songs written previously and seven new songs, all by Young. The album was released on October 23, 2007, timed to coincide with a seven-week tour that had kicked off in Boise, Idaho, ten days earlier.   On February 11, 2008, Neil Young started the European leg of his tour with a concert in  Antwerp ,  Belgium . On July 17, he was interviewed on  PBS  by  Charlie Rose , where he spoke about many things, including his project to make a hybrid 1959 Lincoln. [ 33 ]  In October, a BBC 4 documentary ""Neil Young - Don't be Denied"" was shown, featuring interviews with Neil and a number of his contemporaries. It also summarizes his biography and motivations. [ 34 ]   The latest album in the Performance Series,  Sugar Mountain - Live At Canterbury House 1968  was released on December 2, 2008. Featuring material from Young's earliest solo performances recorded in Ann Arbor, MI November 9, 1968, the album was released as number zero in the  Performance Series .   The first installment of Young's oft-delayed box set  The Archives Vol. 1 1963-1972  was officially announced in 2008 with a trailer.  [ 35 ]   [ 36 ]  The first set of Archives will feature both DVD and Blu-ray editions which will include 128 audio tracks (43 unreleased and 13 never before heard songs), thousands of images (photos, lyrics, letters and memorabilia), and hours of new, previously released and rare videos. Also included will be a 236 page hardbound book. The Blu-ray edition will have HD picture, pristine audio mastered and presented in 24bit 192 khz., and access to photos, trivia and memorabilia without stopping the music. It is currently scheduled for release in 2009.   A Spring 2009 date has been set for Neil's new album 'A Fork in The Road', which will delay the release of the Archives until later in 2009.   Young currently lives on a 1500-acre (6 km) ranch in  La Honda, California , called Broken Arrow. He also owns property in  Fort Lauderdale, Florida , and on the islands of  Hawaii .   Young headlined the 2009  Big Day Out  festival in  New Zealand  and  Australia . Young pushed other current mainstream bands to only secondary headlining, including  Arctic Monkeys  and  The Ting Tings . He will also headline the Friday at  Glastonbury Festival  which has attempted to book him for many years. Although not officially confirmed, a number of sources have suggested this. [ 37 ]     [ edit ]   Influence, importance and inspiration   Neil Young has undeniably been an important artist in the history of American and Canadian popular music and remains a distinct influence upon other recording artists.  Lynyrd Skynyrd s "" Sweet Home Alabama "" was written in response to two of Neil Youngs songs ""Southern Man"" and ""Alabama"". ""Ohio"" which Young recorded with Crosby, Stills and Nash, was a recollection of the tragic events that transpired at Kent State University in May 1970. Young's willingness to be politically outspoken and socially conscious allowed him to influence such important artists such as  Phish ,  Pearl Jam , and  Nirvana . Neil Young is referred to as ""the Godfather of  Grunge "" because of the influence he had on  Kurt Cobain  and  Eddie Vedder  and the entire grunge movement. Kurt Cobain quoted Neil Young in his suicide note, using the line Its better to burn out, than to fade away from Youngs song ""My My, Hey Hey (Out Of The Blue)"". Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam inducted Neil Young into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, citing him as a huge influence. He has also been a big influence on  experimental rock  acts like  Sonic Youth  and  Radiohead . Youngs influence, importance and inspiration within the music scene derive in part from his longevity because of a career spanning more than four decades. His first album was released in 1966 and his latest in 2008.  Bob Dylan 's influence on Young has been so obvious that the former once lambasted: "" Heart of Gold  bothered me every time it came on the radio ... and I'd say, 'Shit, that's me. If it sounds like me it might as well be me. (...) It seemed somebody else had taken my thing and had run away with it, you know, and I never got over it. Maybe tomorrow"" [ 38 ] . The Dutch guitar virtuoso  Jan Akkerman  described a typical electric guitar solo by Young as the sound of ""a Belgian  vibrator "" in a 1994 TV documentary, adding that it somehow became more palatable when one saw Young's grimace to accompany it  [ 39 ] .   The Australian rock group  Powderfinger  attribute their group name to their love of Young.   Toronto  based band  Constantines  recorded a version of Neil's  Fuckin' Up  in  Winnipeg , [ 40 ] which surfaced at the b-side the their ""Our Age"" 7"" [ 41 ] in November 2008. The members of the  Constantines  have occasionally played shows under the name Horsey Craze [ 42 ] , singing Neil Young songs. In early 2006, they released a vinyl only split-album with The Unintended. The Constantines recorded four Neil Young songs for the LP, while The Unintended performed four Gordon Lightfoot songs.   While in Winnipeg on November 2, 2008 during the Canadian leg of his tour,  Bob Dylan  visited the former home of Neil Young in River Heights. The home was where Neil spent some of his teenage years. Dylan was interested in seeing the room where some of Neils first songs were composed.     [ edit ]   Achievements   Young was inducted into the  Canadian Music Hall of Fame  in 1982. He has been inducted into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  twice: first in 1995 for his solo work, with an induction speech given by  Eddie Vedder , and again in 1997 as a member of Buffalo Springfield.   He has also directed five movies under his pseudonym Bernard Shakey, and released them through his own Shakey Pictures imprint:  Journey Through the Past  (1973),  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979)  Human Highway  (1982) (starring new wave band  Devo ), and  Greendale  (2003) and the documentary,  CSNY Deja Vu  (2008). The bonus  DVDs  included in both versions of  Greendale  and in  Prairie Wind  are also directed by Young under the Bernard Shakey alias, and all of Young's home video and DVD releases have been co-released under the Shakey Pictures imprint.   As one of the original founders of  Farm Aid , he remains an active member of the board of directors. For one weekend each October, in  Mountain View, California , he and his wife host the  Bridge School Concerts , which have been drawing international talent and sell-out crowds for nearly two decades with some of the biggest names in rock having performed at the event including  Bruce Springsteen ,  David Bowie ,  The Who ,  Red Hot Chili Peppers ,  Trent Reznor  of  Nine Inch Nails ,  Pearl Jam ,  Sonic Youth  and Sir  Paul McCartney . The concerts are a benefit for the  Bridge School , which develops and uses advanced technologies to aid in the instruction of children with disabilities. Young's involvement stems at least partially from the fact that both of his sons have  cerebral palsy  and his daughter, like Young himself, has  epilepsy .   Young was nominated for an  Oscar  in 1994 for his song ""Philadelphia"" from the film  Philadelphia  (Bruce Springsteen won the award for his song "" Streets of Philadelphia "" from the same film). In his acceptance speech, Springsteen said that ""the award really deserved to be shared by the other nominee's song."" That same night,  Tom Hanks  accepted the Oscar for Best Actor and gave credit for his inspiration to the song ""Philadelphia"".   He was part owner of  Lionel, LLC , a company that makes toy trains and model railroad accessories. [ 43 ]  In 2008 Lionel emerged from bankruptcy and his shares of the company were wiped out. At this time his status with Lionel is unknown, according to Lionel CEO Jerry Calabrese he is still a consultant for Lionel. He was instrumental in the design of the Lionel Legacy control system for model trains [ 43 ]  and it is believed he will continue to develop the system. Young has been named as co-inventor on seven U.S. Patents related to model trains. [ 44 ]   Young has twice received honorary doctorates. He received an Honorary Doctorate of Music from  Lakehead University  in  Thunder Bay ,  Ontario  in 1992, and an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from  San Francisco State University  in 2006. The latter honour was shared with his wife Pegi for their creation of the Bridge School.   In a ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"" list in the June 1996 issue of  Mojo  magazine , Young was ranked No. 9.   In 2003, Rolling Stone listed Young at #83 in its rankings of ""The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time,"" describing him as a ""restless experimenter...who transform[s] the most obvious music into something revelatory."" [ 45 ]   In 2000, Young was inducted into  Canada's Walk of Fame . [ 46 ]  He ranked No. 39 on  VH1 's 100 Greatest Artist of Hard Rock  that same year.   In 2001, Young was awarded the Spirit of Liberty award from the civil liberties group  People for the American Way .   In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked Neil Young [ 47 ]  #34 on their list of the  100 Greatest Artists of All Time . [ 48 ]   In 2006, Paste Magazine compiled a ""Greatest Living Songwriters"" list; Young was ranked No. 2 behind  Bob Dylan . (While Young and Dylan have occasionally played together in concert, they have never collaborated on a song together, or played on each others' records).   In 2008, Rolling Stone ranked Young at #37 in its list of ""The 100 Greatest Singers of All-Time. [ 49 ]   Jason Bond, an  East Carolina University  biologist, discovered a new species of trapdoor spider in 2007, and named it  Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi  after Young, his favorite singer. [ 50 ]     [ edit ]   Instruments          Neil Young, 2008 in  Florence       Neil Young is a collector of second-hand guitars, but in recording and performing, he frequently uses just a few instruments. As explained by his longtime guitar technician  Larry Cragg  in the film  Neil Young: Heart of Gold , they include:     1953  Gibson Les Paul Goldtop Nicknamed "" Old Black "", this is Young's primary  electric guitar  and is featured on  Rust Never Sleeps  and most other albums. Old Black got its name from a purely amateur paintjob applied to the originally-gold body of the instrument, sometime before Neil acquired the guitar in the late 1960s. In 1972, a mini- humbucker  pickup from a  Gibson Firebird  guitar was installed into the lead/treble position, replacing a  P-90  as standard on Les Paul guitars from that era. This pickup, severely  microphonic , is considered a crucial component of Neil's sound. A  Bigsby vibrato tailpiece  was installed as early as 1969 on the guitar, and can be heard clearly during the opening of ""Cowgirl in the Sand"" from  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere . This guitar also features a mini-switch that is used to send the signal from the mini-humbucker direct to the amp, without going through the volume or tone controls. A Les Paul Gold Top of the same year as Old Black was assembled by Neil's guitar tech, using same style Firebird pick up in the guitar as well as the same model Bigsby Vib; but, according to Young, was just not the same as the original. Young acquired Old Black from Jim Messina, swapping one of his Gretches for it in 1969 while Messina was assisting Young on his first solo album. Messina, who played briefly in Buffalo Springfield and produced the band's final album, ""Last Time Around,"" still has the Gretch in his possession.       Martin D-45 His primary  steel-string acoustic guitar ; used to write ""Old Man"" and many other hit songs.   Martin D-28Nicknamed ""Hank"" after its previous owner,  Hank Williams . The guitar came into Young's possession after  Hank Williams, Jr.  had traded it to another owner for some shotguns and it went through a succession of other owners until it was located by Young's longtime friend Grant Boatwright. The guitar was purchased by Young from  Tut Taylor . Young has toured with it for over 30 years. A story about the guitar and inspired song known as ""This Old Guitar"" can be seen about 50 minutes into the film  Neil Young: Heart of Gold . It is Young's primary guitar for the album,  Prairie Wind .   Neil Young can be seen playing a Vagabond Travel Guitar as he sings ""Let's Impeach the President"" on  The Colbert Report  on  Comedy Central .   A 12-string Taylor 855 is used in the first half of the soundtrack and concert film ""Rust Never Sleeps""   1927  Gibson  MastertoneA six-string  banjo , tuned like a guitar. It has been used on many recordings and was played by  James Taylor  on ""Old Man"".   Various vintage  Fender Tweed Deluxe  amplifiers Young's preferred amplifier for electric guitar is the diminutive Fender Deluxe, specifically a Tweed-era model from 1959. Neil purchased his first vintage Deluxe in 1967 for $50 from the drummer of Crazy Horse, Ralph Molina, and has since acquired nearly 450 different examples, all from the same era, but he maintains that it's the original model that sounds superior, and is a crucial component to his trademark sound. The Tweed Deluxe is almost always used in conjunction with a late-1950's Magnatone 280 (similar to the amp used by Lonnie Mack and Buddy Holly). The Magnatone and the Deluxe are paired together in a somewhat unique manner - the external speaker jack from the Deluxe sends the amped signal through a volume potentiometr and directly into the input of the Magnatone. The Magnatone is notable for its true pitch-bending vibrato capabilities, which can be heard as an electric piano amplifier on ""See the Sky About to Rain"". A notable and unique accessory to Young's Deluxe is the Whizzer, a device created specifically for Young, which physically changes the amplifier's settings to pre-set combinations. It has gone through many incarnations.   Gretsch 6120  (Chet Atkins)Before Young bought Old Black, this was his primary electric guitar used during his  Buffalo Springfield  days.   Gretsch White Falcon   Late '50s hollow body that Young purchased near the end of the  Buffalo Springfield  era; in 1969 Young acquired a stereo version of the same vintage guitar from Stills, and this instrument is featured prominently during Young's early '70s period, and can be heard on tracks like ""Ohio,"" ""Southern Man,"" ""Alabama,"" ""L.A.,"" others. It is Neil's primary electric guitar during the  Harvest  era. This particular White Falcon is the stereo 6137, in which the signal from the three bass strings is separated from the signal from the three treble strings. Young typically plays this guitar in this stereo mode, sending the separate signals to two different amps: the Fender Deluxe and typcially to either a Fender Tremolux or a low-powered Tweed Fender Twin. The separation of the signals is most prominantly heard on the Harvest album song ""Words"".   Neil Young replaced his trademark Les Paul for a Gibson Flying V on the ""Time Fades Away"" tour.   Neil Young played a  Fender Broadcaster  on the Tonight's the Night tour and album.

It was subsequently performed live, with elaborate theatrical effects, and made into  a film .   Following in the footsteps of their previous albums,  The Wall  is a  concept album   specifically, it deals largely with the theme of  isolation  from one's peers. The concept was largely inspired by the band's  1977  tour promoting the album  Animals , with regards to an incident where  Roger Waters ' frustration with the audience reached a point where Waters spat in the face of a fan who was attempting to climb on stage; this, in turn, led him to lament that such a wall exists. With its significantly darker theme,  The Wall  featured a notably harsher and more theatrical sound than their previous releases.   The Wall  is a  rock opera  that centres on the character ""Pink"". Largely based on Waters' personal life, Pink struggles in life from an early age, having lost his father in war ("" Another Brick in the Wall  (Part 1)""), abused by teachers ("" The Happiest Days of Our Lives ""), nurtured by an overprotective mother ("" Mother ""), and deserted by his wife later on ("" Don't Leave Me Now "")  all of which factored into Pink's mental isolation from society, figuratively referred to as ""The Wall"".   In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine listed  The Wall  as #87 in  Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time .           Contents       1   Recording history   2   Concept and storyline   3   Film version   4   Reception   5   Post-split   6   Track listing   7   Singles   8   Charts     8.1   Album   8.2   Singles       9   Awards   10   Personnel   11   References   12   External links               [ edit ]   Recording history   In 1977, Pink Floyd were promoting  Animals  with their  In The Flesh  tour. On the final night of the tour in  Montreal, Canada , Waters spat in the face of a fan who was trying to climb over the netting between the audience and the stage, and get up with the band. The incident later helped inspire Waters to develop the idea of  The Wall . [ 1 ]  The album was recorded at four studios over eight months, owing to English tax laws and to benefit from the cheaper recording costs in the South of France. Tensions between Waters and the band were increasing significantly, largely due to his dominance over the rest of the band. During the recording, Waters dismissed  Richard Wright , and told him to leave immediately after  The Wall  was finished, arguing that Wright was not contributing much, in part owing to a  cocaine  addiction. [ citation needed ]  Waters claimed that  David Gilmour  and  Nick Mason  had supported his decision to fire Wright, but in 2000, Gilmour stated that he and Mason were against Wright's dismissal. [ citation needed ]  In his book  Inside Out ,  Nick Mason  claims that Wright was fired because Columbia Records had offered Waters a substantial bonus to finish the album in time for a 1979 release. Since Wright refused to return early from his summer holiday, Waters wanted to dismiss Wright. [ 2 ]  However, he returned for their live performances as a paid musician.   For "" Another Brick in the Wall  (Part II)"", Pink Floyd needed to record a school  choir , so they approached music teacher Alun Renshaw of  Islington Green School , around the corner from their  Britannia Row Studios . The chorus was  overdubbed  twelve times to give the impression that the choir was larger. The choir were not allowed to hear the rest of the song after singing the chorus. Though the school received a lump sum payment of   1000, there was no contractual arrangement for royalties. Under 1996  UK  copyright law, they became eligible, and after choir members were tracked down by royalties agent Peter Rowan of  RBL Music , through the website  Friends Reunited , they sued. Music industry professionals estimated that each student would be owed around 500. [ 3 ]   Originally released on  Columbia Records  in the U.S. and  Harvest Records  in the UK,  The Wall  was then re-released as a  digitally remastered   CD  in 1994 in the UK on  EMI . In 1997, Columbia Records issued an updated remaster in the United States, Canada, Australia, South America and Japan. For  The Wall' s 20th Anniversary in April 2000,  Capitol Records  in the U.S. and EMI in Canada, Australia, South America and Japan re-released the 1997 remaster with the artwork from the EMI Europe remaster.  The Wall  was the first Pink Floyd album since 1967's  The Piper at the Gates of Dawn  whose cover was not done by  Storm Thorgerson  and  Hipgnosis . Instead,  Gerald Scarfe  designed the cover and gatefold sleeve. David Gilmour recalls Storm Thorgerson falling out with Roger Waters over issues such as the credit for the  Animals  sleeve design. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Concept and storyline                       ""Isn't this where...we came in?""                     The last second of  Outside the Wall  and the first second of  In the Flesh?                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       The album's overriding themes are the causes and implications of self-imposed isolation, symbolized by the metaphorical  wall  of the title. The album's songs create a very loose storyline sketching events in the life of the protagonist, Pink. Pink loses his father as a child (Waters's own father was killed in  Anzio  during  World War II ), is smothered by his overprotective mother, and is oppressed at school by tyrannical, abusive teachers, each of these traumas becoming ""another brick in the wall"". As an adult Pink becomes a rock star, but his relationships are marred by infidelity and outbursts of violence. As his marriage crumbles, Pink finishes building the wall and completes his isolation from human contact.   Pink's mindset deteriorates behind his freshly completed wall, with his personal crisis culminating during an onstage performance. Hallucinating, Pink believes that he is a fascist dictator, and his concerts are like  Neo-Nazi  rallies where he sets his men on fans he considers unworthy, only to have his conscience rebel at this and put himself on trial, his inner judge ordering him to ""tear down the wall"" in order to open himself to the outside world, and apologizing to his closest friends who are hurt most by his self-isolation. At this point the album's end runs into its beginning with the closing words ""Isn't this where...""; the first song on the album, "" In the Flesh? "", begins with the words ""...we came in?""  with a continuation of the melody of the last song, "" Outside the Wall ""  hinting at the cyclical nature of Waters's theme.   The LP's sleeve art and custom picture labels by  Gerald Scarfe  tied in with the album's concept. Side one had a quarter of the wall erected and a sketch of the teacher. Side two saw half of the wall erected and a sketch of the wife. Side three had three-quarters of the wall erected and a sketch of the character of Pink, while side four had the wall completely erected and a sketch of the prosecutor. Bob Ezrin played a major part in taking Waters's demo material and clarifying the storyline by writing a script, which even called for additional songs to complete the plot. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Film version       Main article:  Pink Floyd The Wall (film)       A  film  version of  The Wall  was released in 1982 entitled  Pink Floyd The Wall , directed by  Alan Parker  and starring  Bob Geldof . The screenplay was written by Roger Waters. The film features music from the original album, much of which was re-recorded by the band with additional orchestration, some with minor lyrical and musical changes.   Originally the film was intended to be intercut with concert footage and a few of the live shows were actually filmed, but subsequently not used in the film at all. Footage from these concerts has appeared on different websites from time to time and on  YouTube . However, an official release of this footage by Pink Floyd has not been authorized other than what was used in the documentary  Behind the Wall .     [ edit ]   Reception   Immensely successful upon release,  The Wall  quickly jumped to #1 on the  Billboard 200  in the U.S in its fourth week (it debuted at #53) and #3 in the  U.K. . Its worldwide sales are estimated at 15 million copies (30 million units), and in the U.S. it has achieved 23 times platinum (for sales of 11.5 million double-disc sets [ 5 ] ; statistics mistakenly identifying  The Wall  as the best selling multiple-disc album of all-time in the U.S. and third best-selling album by any artist in the U.S. do not take into account that double albums count as two platinum sales), and is their second best-selling album in the U.S. after  The Dark Side of the Moon . It was among the most popular albums of the early 1980s, to the extent that film director  Alan Parker  created  a film based on it . The album had a string of hit singles, with "" Another Brick in the Wall Part 2 "" being their only song to hit #1 on the Billboard.   In addition to its commercial success, critical reception of  The Wall  was, and remains, mostly positive.  Carlo Twist  of  Blender  gave it 5 stars out of a possible 5, stating that, ""For all its pomp and lofty ambition, theres a streak of almost punk-rock venom within, not to mention some of the bands best humping, thumping heavy rock."" [ 6 ]   Stephen Thomas Erlewine  of  AllMusic Guide  was slightly more critical, but nevertheless said that, ""its seamless surface, blending melodic fragments and sound effects, makes the musical shortcomings and questionable lyrics easy to ignore."" [ 7 ]   Kurt Loder  of  Rolling Stone  remarked, "" The Wall  is the most startling rhetorical achievement in the group's singular, thirteen-year career."" [ 8 ]  That same magazine later ranked  The Wall  at #87 on its list of  The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time . [ 9 ]   The Wall  would also be included in the book  1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die .     [ edit ]   Post-split   After Waters left Pink Floyd in 1985, a legal battle ensued over the rights to the name ""Pink Floyd"" and its material. In the end, Waters retained the right to use  The Wall  and its material, as his name has been most closely associated with the album. This meant the sole ownership of all  The Wall  tracks except for the three Gilmour co-wrote the music for ("" Young Lust "", "" Comfortably Numb "" and "" Run Like Hell "") and images relating to  The Wall  on the later 19871990 and 1994 tours by the three-man Pink Floyd required payments to Waters.   Waters staged a  concert performance  of  The Wall  at  Potsdamer Platz  in  Berlin  on 21 July 1990 both to commemorate the fall of the  Berlin Wall  and as a fundraising effort for the World War Memorial Fund for Disaster Relief. This performance featured guest artists including  Bryan Adams ,  Cyndi Lauper  and  Van Morrison . This performance also differed from previous shows in that some songs from the original album and Pink Floyd concert version were omitted, others were slightly modified, and one Waters solo song, "" The Tide Is Turning "" was substituted for ""Outside The Wall"" as the concluding song.

Young's work is characterized by deeply personal lyrics, distinctive guitar work, and signature falsetto  tenor  singing voice. Although he accompanies himself on several different instrumentsincluding  piano  and  harmonica his claw-hammer  acoustic guitar  style and often idiosyncratic electric guitar soloing are the linchpins of a sometimes ragged, sometimes polished sound. Although Young has experimented widely with differing music styles, including  swing ,  jazz ,  rockabilly ,  blues , and  electronic music  throughout a varied career, his best known work usually falls into either of two distinct styles:  folk -esque  acoustic   rock  ("" Heart of Gold "", ""Harvest Moon"" and "" Old Man "") and  electric -charged  hard rock  (like "" Cinnamon Girl "", "" Rockin' in the Free World "" and "" Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black) ""). In recent years, Young has adopted elements from newer styles like  industrial ,  alternative country  and  grunge . Young's profound influence on the latter caused some to dub him ""the godfather of grunge"".   Young has directed (or co-directed) a number of  films  using the  pseudonym  Bernard Shakey, including  Journey Through the Past  (1973),  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979),  Human Highway  (1982),  Greendale  (2003), and  CSNY Dj Vu  (2008). He is currently working on a documentary about electric car technology, tentatively titled  Linc/Volt .   He is also an outspoken advocate for environmental issues and small farmers, having co-founded in 1985 the  benefit concert   Farm Aid , and in 1986 helped found The Bridge School, [ 2 ]  and its annual supporting  Bridge School Benefit  concerts, together with his wife Pegi (in this, Young's involvement stems at least partially from the fact that both of his sons have  cerebral palsy  and his daughter, like Young himself, has  epilepsy ).   Although Young sings as frequently about U.S. legends and myths ( Pocahontas ,  space stations , and the settlement of the American West) [ 3 ]  as he does about his native country, he remains a Canadian citizen and has never wanted to relinquish his Canadian citizenship. He has lived in the U.S. for ""so long"" and has stated he has ""got just as much right to vote in them (American elections) as anybody else.""

He spent his early years in the small country town of  Omemee , 130  kilometres  (81  mi ) northeast of Toronto.   Young was diagnosed with diabetes as a child [ 5 ]  and a bout of  polio  at the age of 6 left him with a weakened left side; he still walks with a slight limp.   His parents divorced when Young was 12, and he moved with his mother back to the family home of  Winnipeg , Manitoba, where the formative years of his music career began. Neil and his mother Rassy settled into the working class suburb of  Fort Rouge  where the shy, dry-humoured youth enrolled at Earl Grey Junior High School. It was there that he formed his first band  the Jades , and met  Ken Koblun , later to join him in the Squires.   While attending  Kelvin High School  in Winnipeg, he played in several instrumental rock bands. Young's first stable band was called the Squires, who had a local hit called ""The Sultan"". Young dropped out of high school [ 6 ]  and also played in  Fort William , where they recorded a series of demos produced by a local producer named Ray Dee, whom Young called ""the original Briggs."" [ 7 ]  While in Thunder Bay, Young first encountered  Stephen Stills . In the  2006  film  Heart of Gold  Young relates how he used to spend time as a teenager at  Falcon Lake, Manitoba  where he would endlessly plug coins into the jukebox to hear  Ian Tyson 's "" Four Strong Winds "". Neil also formed a friendship with musician  Randy Bachman .   After leaving the Squires, Neil worked folk clubs in Winnipeg, where he first met  Joni Mitchell . [ 8 ]  Here he wrote some of his earliest and most enduring folk songs such as the classic "" Sugar Mountain "", about his lost youth. Mitchell wrote ""The Circle Game"" in response. [ citation needed ]   In 1965 Young toured Canada as a solo artist. In 1966, he joined the  Rick James -fronted  Mynah Birds . The band managed to secure a record deal with the  Motown  label, but as their first album was being recorded, James was arrested for being  AWOL  from the army. [ 9 ]  After the Mynah Birds disbanded, Young and bass player  Bruce Palmer  relocated to  Los Angeles . Young has admitted in an interview that he was in the United States illegally until receiving a green card in 1970. [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Buffalo Springfield   Once they reached Los Angeles, Young and Palmer met up with  Stephen Stills ,  Richie Furay , and  Dewey Martin  to form  Buffalo Springfield . A mixture of folk, country,  psychedelia , and rock lent a hard edge by the twin lead guitars of Stills and Young made Buffalo Springfield a critical success, and their first record  Buffalo Springfield  (1967) sold well after Stills' topical song "" For What It's Worth "" became a hit, aided by Young's melodic harmonics played on electric guitar.   Distrust of their management, as well as the arrest and deportation of Palmer, exacerbated the already strained relations among the group members and led to Buffalo Springfield's demise. A second album,  Buffalo Springfield Again , was released in late 1967, but two of Youngs three contributions were solo tracks recorded apart from the rest of the group.   In many ways, these three songs on  Buffalo Springfield Again  are harbingers of much of Young's later work in that, although they all share deeply personal, almost idiosyncratic lyrics, they also present three very different musical approaches to the arrangement of what is essentially an original folk song. ""Mr Soul"" is the only Young song of the three that all five members of the group perform together. In contrast, "" Broken Arrow "" was confessional folk rock of a kind that would characterize much of the music that emerged from the singer-songwriter movement. Youngs experimental production intersperses each verse with snippets of sound from other sources, including opening the song with a sound bite of Dewey Martin singing ""Mr. Soul"" and closing it with the thumping of a heartbeat. ""Expecting to Fly"" was a lushly produced  ballad  featuring a string arrangement that Young's co-producer for the track,  Jack Nitzsche , would dub ""symphonic pop.""   In May 1968, the band split up for good, but in order to fulfill a contractual obligation, a final album,  Last Time Around , was recorded, primarily from recordings made earlier that year. Young contributed the songs ""On the Way Home"" and ""I Am a Child"", singing lead on the latter. In 1997, the band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame; Young did not appear at the ceremony.     [ edit ]   Solo success & CSNY   After the breakup of Buffalo Springfield, Young signed a solo deal with  Reprise Records , home of his colleague and friend  Joni Mitchell , with whom he shared a manager, Elliot Roberts, who manages Young to this day. Young and Nitzsche immediately began work on Young's first solo record,  Neil Young  (November 1968), which received mixed reviews. In a 1970 interview, [ 11 ]  Young deprecated the album as being ""overdubbed rather than played,"" and the quest for music that expresses the spontaneity of the moment has long been a feature of his career. Nevertheless, the album contains some tunes that remain a staple of his live shows, most notably ""The Loner.""   For his next album, Young recruited three musicians from a band called The Rockets:  Danny Whitten  on guitar,  Billy Talbot  on bass guitar, and  Ralph Molina  on  drums . These three took the name  Crazy Horse  (after  the historical figure of the same name ), and  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere  (May 1969), is credited to ""Neil Young with Crazy Horse."" Recorded in just two weeks, the album opens with one of Young's most familiar songs, ""Cinnamon Girl,"" and is dominated by two more, ""Cowgirl in the Sand"" and ""Down by the River,"" that feature lengthy jams showcasing Young's idiosyncratic guitar soloing accompanied sympathetically by Crazy Horse. Young reportedly wrote all three songs on the same day, while nursing a high fever of 103 F (39.5 C) in bed.   Shortly after the release of  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere , Young reunited with Stephen Stills by joining  Crosby, Stills, & Nash , who had already released one album as a trio. Young was originally offered a position as a sideman, but agreed to join only if he received full membership, and the group - winners of the 1969 ""Best New Artist"" Grammy - was renamed Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. [ 12 ]  The quartet debuted in  Chicago  on  August 16 ,  1969 , and later performed at the famous  Woodstock Festival , during which Young skipped the acoustic set and refused to be filmed during the electric set, even telling the cameramen: ""One of you fuckin' guys comes near me and I'm gonna fuckin' hit you with my guitar"". [ 13 ]  During the making of their first album,  Dj Vu , the musicians frequently argued, particularly Young and Stills, who both fought for control. [ 14 ]   "" Ohio "" was written following the  Kent State massacre  on  May 4 ,  1970 , and was a staple of anti-war rallies in the 1970s. The song was quickly recorded by CSNY and immediately released as a single, even though CSNY's ""Teach Your Children"" was still climbing the singles charts. Many believe that the release of ""Ohio"" as a single cut into the sales of ""Teach Your Children"" and prevented that song from reaching the top ten. In the late 1970s and for much of the 1980s, Young refrained from performing ""Ohio"" live, as he considered the song to be dated. In the wake of the 1989  Tiananmen Square massacre , however, Young revived the song in concert, often dedicating it to the  Chinese  students who were killed in the massacre. Crosby, Stills & Nash, as a trio, also returned the song to their live repertoire around the same time, even though Young had provided the lead vocals on the original recording.   Also that year, Young released his third solo album,  After the Gold Rush  (1970), which featured, among others, a young  Nils Lofgren ,  Stephen Stills , and CSNY bassist Greg Reeves. Young also recorded some tracks with Crazy Horse, but dismissed them early in the sessions. Aided by his newfound fame with CSNY, the album was a commercial breakthrough for Young and contains some of his best known work. Notable tracks include the title track, with dream-like lyrics that run a gamut of subjects from drugs and interpersonal relationships to environmental concerns, as well as Youngs controversial and acerbic condemnation of  racism  in "" Southern Man ,"" which, along with a later song entitled ""Alabama,"" later prompted  Lynyrd Skynyrd  to decry Young by name in the lyrics to "" Sweet Home Alabama ."" Young was one of Skynyrd's biggest influences, and Young was an admirer of Skynyrd's music. The respectful rivalry and friendship between Young and Skynyrd front man  Ronnie Van Zant  would serve as a recurring theme in the  Drive-By Truckers ' 2001  concept album   Southern Rock Opera .   With CSNY splitting up and Crazy Horse having signed their own record deal, Young began the year 1971 with a solo tour entitled ""Journey Through the Past."" Later, he recruited a new group of country-music session musicians, whom he christened  The Stray Gators , to record much of the new material that had been premiered on tour for the album  Harvest  (1972).  Harvest  was a massive hit (especially with the country-music crowd) and ""Heart of Gold"" became a US number one single; incidentally, to this day it remains the only No. 1 hit in his long career.   Another notable song was "" The Needle and the Damage Done ,"" a somber lament on the pain caused by heroin addiction; inspired in part by the heavy heroin use of Crazy Horse member Danny Whitten, who would eventually die of an overdose. [ 15 ]   The album's success, however, caught Young off guard, and his first instinct was to back away from stardom. In the handwritten liner notes to the  Decade  compilation, Young described ""Heart of Gold"" as the song that ""put me in the middle of the road. Traveling there soon became a bore, so I headed for the ditch. A rougher ride but I saw more interesting people there.""   On  September 8 ,  1972 , the Academy Award-nominated actress  Carrie Snodgress , with whom he had been living, gave birth to Neil Young's first child. The boy, Zeke, was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Young fell in love with Snodgress after seeing her in a movie (""Diary of a Mad Housewife"") on television after which Young wrote the song "" A Man Needs a Maid "" from the Harvest album, featuring the lyric ""I fell in love with the actress/she was playing a part that I could understand.""     [ edit ]   The Ditch Trilogy   Although a new tour had been planned to follow up on the success of  Harvest , it became apparent during rehearsals that Danny Whitten could not function due to  drug abuse . On  November 18 , 1972, shortly after he was fired from the tour preparations, Whitten was found dead of an  overdose . Young described the incident to  Rolling Stone s  Cameron Crowe  in 1975:  [ 16 ]  ""[We] were rehearsing with him and he just couldn't cut it. He couldn't remember anything. He was too out of it. Too far gone. I had to tell him to go back to L.A. 'It's not happening, man. You're not together enough.' He just said, 'I've got nowhere else to go, man. How am I gonna tell my friends?' And he split. That night the coroner called me from L.A. and told me he'd ODed. That blew my mind. Fucking blew my mind. I loved Danny. I felt responsible. And from there, I had to go right out on this huge tour of huge arenas. I was very nervous and  insecure.""   The album made in the aftermath of this incident,  Time Fades Away  (1973), has often been described by Young as ""my least favourite record,"" and it is, in fact, one of only two of Youngs early recordings that has yet to be officially re-released on CD (the other being the soundtrack album  Journey Through the Past ). The album was recorded live over a tour where Young struggled with his voice and called  David Crosby  and  Graham Nash  to help perform the music. The tour featured  Linda Ronstadt  as the opening act.  Time Fades Away  occupies a unique position in Youngs discography as the first of three albums known collectively as the "" Ditch Trilogy .""   In the second half of 1973, Young formed The Santa Monica Flyers, with Crazy Horse's rhythm section augmented by Nils Lofgren on guitar. Deeply affected by the drug-induced deaths of Whitten and  roadie   Bruce Berry , Young recorded  Tonight's the Night . The album's dark tone and rawness caused Reprise to delay the release until two years later and only after being pressured by Young to do so. [ 17 ]  It received mixed reviews at the time, but is now regarded as a landmark album, thought by some to be a precursor to  punk rock . In Young's own opinion, it was the closest he ever came to art. [ 18 ]   While his record company delayed the release of  Tonight's the Night,  Young recorded  On the Beach  (1974), which dealt with themes such as the downside of fame and the Californian lifestyle. Like  Time Fades Away  and  Tonight's the Night , it sold poorly but eventually became a critical favourite, presenting some of Young's most original work. In a review of the 2003 re-release on CD of  On the Beach  Derek Svennungsen described the music as ""mesmerizing, harrowing, lucid, and bleary,"" [ 19 ] .     [ edit ]   Return to prominence   After completing  On the Beach , Young reunited with  Harvest  producer Elliot Mazer to record another acoustic album,  Homegrown . Most of the songs were written after Young's breakup with Snodgress, and thus the tone of the album was somewhat dark. Though the album was entirely completed, Young decided to drop the album and release  Tonight's the Night  instead, at the suggestion of  The Band  bassist  Rick Danko . [ 20 ]  Young further explained his move by saying: ""It was a little too personal... it scared me"". [ 21 ]          Neil Young in Austin, Texas on November 9, 1976       Young reformed Crazy Horse with  Frank Sampedro  on guitar as his backup band for  Zuma  (1975). Many of the songs are overtly concerned with failed relationships, and even the epic "" Cortez the Killer ,"" outwardly a retelling of the  Spanish conquest  of  Mexico  from the viewpoint of the  Aztecs , can be seen as an allegory of love lostsomething that didnt save it, however, from being banned in  Franco 's  Spain .   The following year, Young reunited with Stephen Stills for the album  Long May You Run  (1976), credited to  The Stills-Young Band ; the follow-up tour was ended midway through by Young, who sent Stills a  telegram  that read: ""Funny how some things that start spontaneously end that way. Eat a peach, Neil."" [ 22 ]   In 1976, Young performed with  The Band , Joni Mitchell, and other rock musicians in the high profile all-star concert  The Last Waltz . The release of  Martin Scorsese 's movie of the concert was delayed while Scorsese unwillingly re-edited it to obscure the lump of cocaine that was clearly visible hanging from Young's nose during his performance of  ""Helpless."" [ 23 ]  Young later said, ""I'm not proud of that,"" according to one of his biographers.   American Stars 'N Bars  (1977) contained two songs originally recorded for  Homegrown  album, ""Homegrown"" and ""Star of Bethelehem,"" as well as newer material, including the future concert staple "" Like A Hurricane "". Performers included  Linda Ronstadt ,  Emmylou Harris  and Young protg  Nicolette Larson  along with Crazy Horse. Also in 1977, Young released  Decade : a personally selected career summary of material spanning every aspect of his various interests and affiliations, including a handful of unreleased songs.  Comes a Time  (1978) also featured Nicolette Larson and Crazy Horse and became Young's most commercially accessible album in quite some time, marked by a return to his folk roots.   Young next set out on the lengthy ""Rust Never Sleeps"" tour, in which each concert was divided into a solo acoustic set and an electric set with Crazy Horse. Much of the electric set was later seen as a response to punk rock's burgeoning popularity. ""Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)"" compared the changing public perception of  Johnny Rotten  with that of the recently deceased  Elvis Presley , who himself had once been disparaged as a dangerous influence only to later become an  icon . Rotten, meanwhile, returned the favour by playing one of Young's records on a  London  radio show. The accompanying albums  Rust Never Sleeps  (new material, culled from live recordings, but featuring studio overdubs) and  Live Rust  (a mixture of old and new, and a genuine concert recording) captured the two sides of the concerts, with solo acoustic songs on side A, and fierce, uptempo, electric songs on side B. A movie version of the concerts, also called  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979), was directed by Young under the pseudonym Bernard Shakey.   Young was suddenly hip again, and the readers and critics of  Rolling Stone  voted him Artist Of The Year for 1979 (along with The Who), selected  Rust Never Sleeps  as Album Of The Year, and voted him Male Vocalist Of The Year as well.  The Village Voice , meanwhile, honored Young as the Artist of the Decade.     [ edit ]   1980s - Experimental years   The 1980s were a lean time for Young both critically and commercially. After providing the incidental music to a  biopic  of  Hunter S. Thompson  entitled  Where the Buffalo Roam , he recorded  Hawks & Doves  (1980), a folk/country record.  Re-ac-tor  (1981), once again with Crazy Horse, was a faade of distortion and feedback obscuring a relatively weak selection of songs, but his strangest record of the decade came with  Trans  (1982). Recorded partially with  vocoders ,  synthesizers , and other devices that modified instruments and vocals with electronic effects, it is sometimes considered an experiment related to finding a technology that would become a means to communicate for Youngs son (with his wife Pegi), Ben, who has severe  cerebral palsy  and cannot speak. Many fans were baffled by the radical forms of this album and  rockabilly -styled  Everybody's Rockin'  (1983), and record company head  David Geffen  even sued Young for making ""unrepresentative"" musici.e. music that did not sound like Neil Youngthat deliberately lacked commercial appeal. [ 24 ]  Young later stated that he would have preferred to release the songs featuring the  synclavier  and  vocoder  as an EP, and that their inclusion with the Hawaiian-themed rockabilly was a mistake. Also premiered at this time though little seen was an eclectic full-length comedy film  Human Highway  starring, co-directed and co-written by Young.   In 1983, Young worked with British video director  Tim Pope , making two videos - ""Wonderin'"" and ""Cry, Cry, Cry.""   In 1985, he reunited with Crosby, Stills and Nash at  Live Aid  at Philadelphia's  John F. Kennedy Stadium . The two songs that they played, ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"" and "" Daylight Again /Find The Cost of Freedom,"" were the first songs they had played as a quartet in front of a paying audience since 1974.   Old Ways  (1985) saw a return to country music, recorded with a group of friends and session musicians.  Landing on Water  (1986) is entertaining for the blending of synthesizers and other instruments related to the 1980s into Youngs own style, with lyrics that take pot shots at some favourite targets, including CSN in ""Hippie Dream,"" with a chorus that goes: ""But the wooden ships/Were just a hippie dream,"" and David Geffen in ""Drifter,"" with the line: ""Dont try to tell me what I gotta do to fit."" The resumption of his partnership with Crazy Horse on  Life  (1987) fulfilled his contract with Geffen, and Young was finally able to switch labels.   Director Pope again made a series of videos from the album, including ""Touch the Night"" and ""People on the Street"".   Signing with  Warner Brothers  (which distributed Geffen at the time) and returning to Reprise Records, Young produced  This Note's For You  (1988) with a new band, The Bluenotes, whose name rights were owned by musician  Harold Melvin . Young named his band after a cafe called the Blue Note on Main Street in Winnipeg Manitoba, where he had played. The addition of a  brass  section provided a new  jazzier  sound and the title track became his first hit single of the decade. Accompanied by a video which parodied corporate rock, the pretensions of advertising and  Michael Jackson  in particular, the song was initially banned by  MTV  (although the Canadian music channel,  MuchMusic  ran it immediately) before being put into heavy rotation and finally given the  MTV Video Music Award for Best Video of the Year  for 1989. After Melvin sued over the use of the Bluenotes name, Young renamed his back-up group ""Ten Men Workin'"" for the balance of the concert tour.   Young also contributed to that year's CSNY reunion  American Dream  (1988) and CSNY played a few benefit concerts. Young, however, refused to book a full tour with CSN and the foursome would not embark upon a nationwide tour until 2000.     [ edit ]   1990s - Return to country-rock roots   Freedom  was a mixture of acoustic and electric rock dealing with the state of the U.S. and the world in 1989, alongside a set of love songs and a version of the standard ""On Broadway."" "" Rockin' in the Free World "", two versions of which bookended the album, again caught the mood. Some say it became a  de facto  anthem during the fall of the  Berlin Wall , a few months after the record's release. However, most Germans don't remember the song being related to the unification, understandably so, since the lyrics are not about political repression. Like  Bruce Springsteen 's "" Born in the U.S.A. "", the anthemic use of this song was based on largely ignoring the verses, which evoke social problems and implicitly criticize American government policies. In mid-1989, record executive  Terry Tolkin  conceived and produced a tribute album to Young's songs called  The Bridge: A Tribute To Neil Young,  released on his  No.6 Records  label. It featured cover versions of 15 of Young's songs by the cream of the up and coming  Alternative Music  and  Grunge music  bands including  Sonic Youth ,  Nick Cave ,  Soul Asylum ,  Dinosaur Jr ,and  The Pixies . By 1990,  grunge music  was beginning to make its first inroads in the charts and many of its prime movers, including  Nirvana 's  Kurt Cobain  and  Pearl Jam 's  Eddie Vedder , cited Young as a major influence.   Using a barn on his  Northern California  ranch as a studio, he rapidly recorded  Ragged Glory  with Crazy Horse, whose guitar riffs and feedback driven sound showed his new admirers that he could still cut it. Young then headed back out on the road with Orange Country country-punk band  Social Distortion  and  alternative rock  elder statesmen  Sonic Youth  as support, much to the consternation of many of his old fans. [ 25 ] [ 26 ]  Yet the influence of Sonic Youth could be clearly heard on the accompanying home video and live album,  Weld , which also included a bonus CD entitled  Arc , a single 35-minute-long collage of  feedback  and guitar noise that Neil included, evidently at the suggestion of Sonic Youth's  Thurston Moore . [ 27 ]   Arc  was later sold separately.   Young's next move was another return to country music.  Harvest Moon  (1992) was the long-awaited sequel to  Harvest  and reunited him with some of the musicians from that session, as well as singers  Linda Ronstadt  and  James Taylor . The title track was a minor hit and the record was reviewed and sold equally well, containing songs such as ""From Hank to  Hendrix "" and ""Unknown Legend"", a tribute to his wife. His resurgent popularity saw him booked on  MTV Unplugged  in 1993. In 1992 he accompanied fellow  Winnipegger   Randy Bachman  on ""Prairie Town,"" a song that recounts their days in the Winnipeg music scene of the 1960s. That year, he contributed music to the  soundtrack  of the  Jonathan Demme  movie  Philadelphia , and his song ""Philadelphia"" was nominated for the  Academy Award for Best Song , losing out to Bruce Springsteen's contribution to the same film. A summer tour covering both Europe and North America with  Booker T. and the MGs  (with whom he played two songs at a 1992  Bob Dylan  tribute concert at  Madison Square Garden ) was widely praised as a triumph. On a few of these dates, the show ended with a rendition of ""Rockin' in the Free World"" played with  Pearl Jam .   Young was back with Crazy Horse for 1994's  Sleeps with Angels , a much darker record. The title track told the story of  Kurt Cobain 's death; Young had reportedly made repeated attempts to contact Cobain prior to this event. [ 28 ]  Cobain had quoted Young's ""It's better to burn out than fade away"" (a line from "" My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue) "") in his alleged  suicide note , causing Young to emphasize the line ""'cause once you're gone you can't come back"" in live performances at the time. Other songs dealt with drive-by shootings (""Driveby""),  environmentalism  (""Piece of Crap"") and Young's own vision of America (the archetypal car metaphor of ""Trans Am""). Young was inspired to make the record after viewing Cobain's performance on  MTV Unplugged . Still admired by the prime movers of grunge, Young eventually performed with Pearl Jam at the MTV Music Awards during what was described as the highlight of a lackluster show. [ 29 ]  Their collaboration led to a joint tour, with the band and producer  Brendan O'Brien  backing Young. The accompanying album,  Mirror Ball  (1995), recorded as live in the studio captured their loose rock sound, and featured the standout track ""I'm the Ocean"". The year of 1995 also featured Young's entry into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .   After composing an abstract, distorted feedback-led guitar instrumental soundtrack to  Jim Jarmusch 's  acid western  film  Dead Man  Young recorded a series of loose jams with Crazy Horse that eventually appeared as the critically denigrated  Broken Arrow . The return to Crazy Horse was prompted by the death of mentor, friend, and longtime  producer   David Briggs  in late 1995. The subsequent tours of Europe and North America in 1996 resulted in both a live album and a tour documentary directed by  Jim Jarmusch . Both releases took the name  Year of the Horse .   In 1997, Young participated in the  H.O.R.D.E. Festival 's sixth annual tour.   In 1998, Young shared the stage with the rock band  Phish  at the annual  Farm Aid  concert, and later offered them an opportunity to headline both nights of the Bridge School Benefit concert. Phish took Young up on his offer to headline the Bridge School Benefit (where Young joined Phish for renditions of ""Helpless"" and ""I Shall Be Released."" [ 30 ]  Phish, however, declined Young's later invitation to be his backing band on a 1999 tour. [ 31 ]   The decade ended with  Looking Forward , another reunion with Crosby, Stills and Nash. The subsequent tour of the United States and Canada with the reformed super quartet was a huge success and brought in earnings of $42.1 million, making it the eighth largest grossing tour of 2000.   Young's next album,  Silver & Gold  (2000), contained a number of understated songs with personal lyrics, which was promoted through a mini-tour of solo acoustic shows. This style was continued in  Are You Passionate?  (2002), an album of love songs dedicated to his wife, Pegi.     [ edit ]   In the aftermath of 9/11   Young's 2001 single "" Let's Roll "", was a tribute to the victims of the  September 11, 2001 attacks , and the passengers and crew on  Flight 93  in particular. At the "" America: A Tribute to Heroes "" concert he performed  John Lennon's  "" Imagine "". In 2002,  Q  magazine  named Neil Young in their list of the ""50 Bands To See Before You Die.""   Young hauled out his concept album  Greendale , about an extended family in a small town called Greendale, and how they are torn apart by a murder, in 2003.  Greendale  was recorded with Crazy Horse members Billy Talbot and Ralph Molina. This tale of the Green family also resulted in a movie called  Greendale , written and directed by Young (again using his ""Bernard Shakey"" pseudonym) and starring a few of his friends, who act out and  lip sync  the songs from the album. The film was indeed thoroughly experimental, from Young's rambling on-stage between-song narratives, to his reading apparent transcriptions of these ramblings in the liner notes. ""When I was writing this I had no idea what I was doing, so I was just as surprised as you are,"" Young said later. Young toured extensively with the  Greendale  material throughout 2003 and 2004, first with a solo, acoustic version in Europe, then with a full-cast stage show in North America,  Japan , and  Australia . While audience reaction was sometimes mixed (drunken requests for ""Southern Man"" being an aesthetic impediment at most Young performances), the live stage version of Greendale was for many critics the most satisfying incarnation of the material, and bootlegs of the shows have been widely traded. The second half of each concert consisted of high-decibel renditions of Young classics such as ""Hey Hey, My My,"" ""Cinnamon Girl,"" ""Powderfinger,"" and  Rockin' in the Free World , as well as rarities such as ""The Losing End,"" ""The Old Country Waltz,"" and ""Danger Bird.""   Young spent the latter portion of 2004 giving a series of intimate acoustic concerts in various cities with his wife, Pegi, who is a trained vocalist and guitar player.     [ edit ]   Recent events          From left, Emmylou Harris, Neil Young and Pegi Young perform in  Neil Young: Heart of Gold , which offered renditions of some of Young's best-known songs.       On  March 31 ,  2005 , Young was admitted to a hospital in New York for treatment for a brain  aneurysm . He was treated successfully by a minimally invasive  neuroradiological  procedure. Prior to undergoing the procedure, he wrote the first eight songs of a new album,  Prairie Wind , in  Nashville , with session musicians that included regular Young sideman  Ben Keith  on lap and  pedal steel guitars . Two days after the procedure, Young was forced to cancel a scheduled appearance on the  Juno Awards  telecast in Winnipeg when the area where the surgeons did his procedure (via the  femoral artery ) suddenly began to bleed. While Young finally was able to return to Winnipeg in 2006 with Crosby, Stills and Nash, his first post-aneurysm performance was on  July 2 ,  2005 , at the close of the  Live 8  concert in  Barrie, Ontario . There, he debuted a new song, a soft hymn called ""When God Made Me.""   On  September 28 ,  2005 ,  Prairie Wind  was released. In an interview given to  Time  magazine , Young revealed that he had planned to keep the news of his aneurysm private until he had the bleeding scare, after which he decided to make news of his condition public. The last two songs on the album were written after his aneurysm procedure, and several of the songs, such as ""Fallin' Off the Face of the Earth,"" seem to be inspired by Young's brush with  mortality , the recent death of his father, who suffered from  senile dementia , and Young's  Manitoba  roots.   In 2006,  Neil Young: Heart of Gold , a film made by  Jonathan Demme , premiered at the  Sundance Film Festival . Filmed over two nights at the  Ryman Auditorium  in  Nashville, Tennessee  during the premiere of  Prairie Wind , it includes both new and old songs as well as behind-the scenes-commentary by Young, his wife Pegi, and members of Young's session band.   In April 2006, Young announced the release of  Living with War , an album of protest songs that included the provocatively-titled "" Let's Impeach the President ."" Recorded using his famous  Les Paul  electric guitar, "" Old Black ,"" along with Chad Cromwell (drums), Rick Rosas (bass), and Tommy Brea (trumpet), the album was intended to be a stinging rebuke of U.S. President  George W. Bush  and the  War in Iraq . The album was recorded in a two week period in April, and was then made available over the internet from 28 April 2006 before being released as a CD on 5 May.  Living With War  was Young's most talked about release for years, creating heated political debate and a return to form with perhaps his most critically-acclaimed album since the early 1990s.  Living With War: In the Beginning , an remixed version with the original album's choral backing vocals removed, was released in December of the same year. Its accompanying DVD featured videos directed by Young of every song on the album, footage of the  Iraq War  and demonstrations in the US, and clips from  Al Gore 's  An Inconvenient Truth .          Neil Young on the CSNY ""Freedom Of Speech Tour '06""       From July through September of 2006, Neil Young reunited with his former bandmates from  Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young  for the ""Freedom Of Speech Tour '06"" across North America. Chad Cromwell and Rick Rosas made up the band's rhythm section. The entire  Living with War  album was performed on the tour, in addition to other CSN and Neil Young classics such as "" Ohio "" and "" Rockin' in the Free World ."" An accompanying concert film and live album, called  CSNY Deja Vu , were premiered on January 25, 2008, at the Sundance Movie Festival.   2006 also saw the first release from Young's long awaited  Archives  project, as  Live at the Fillmore East , a selection of songs drawn from a 1970 gig with  Crazy Horse , was released in November of that year. The release was marked as number two in the  Archives Performance Series , leaving room for the still-unreleased 1969  Riverboat  bootleg, which will be number one in the series. In March 2007, another historical live album, marked as the third in the  Performance Series , was released. Titled  Live at Massey Hall 1971 , it featured a solo acoustic set from Toronto's Massey Hall, including material from the upcoming  Harvest  album.   On  August 15 ,  2007 , Young played a new album for 100 people at Reprise Records entitled  Chrome Dreams II .  Chrome Dreams  was an album he scrapped in 1977, and the name of two different bootlegs. The new album includes two long songs that time in at 18:13 (""Ordinary People"") and 14:31 (""No Hidden Path""), respectively. The album consists of three songs written previously and seven new songs, all by Young. The album was released on October 23, 2007, timed to coincide with a seven-week tour that had kicked off in Boise, Idaho, ten days earlier.   On February 11, 2008, Neil Young started the European leg of his tour with a concert in  Antwerp ,  Belgium . On July 17, he was interviewed on  PBS  by  Charlie Rose , where he spoke about many things, including his project to make a hybrid 1959 Lincoln. [ 32 ]  In October, a BBC 4 documentary ""Neil Young - Don't be Denied"" was shown, featuring interviews with Neil and a number of his contemporaries. It also summarizes his biography and motivations. [ 33 ]   The latest album in the Performance Series,  Sugar Mountain - Live At Canterbury House 1968  was released on December 2, 2008. Featuring material from Young's earliest solo performances recorded in Ann Arbor, MI November 9, 1968, the album was released as number zero in the  Performance Series .   The first installment of Young's oft-delayed box set  The Archives Vol. 1 1963-1972  was officially announced in 2008 with a trailer.  [ 34 ]   [ 35 ]  The first set of Archives will feature both DVD and Blu-ray editions which will include 128 audio tracks (43 unreleased and 13 never before heard songs), thousands of images (photos, lyrics, letters and memorabilia), and hours of new, previously released and rare videos. Also included will be a 236 page hardbound book. The Blu-ray edition will have HD picture, pristine audio mastered and presented in 24bit 192 khz., and access to photos, trivia and memorabilia without stopping the music. It is currently scheduled for release in 2009.   A Spring 2009 date has been set for Neil's new album 'A Fork in The Road', which will delay the release of the Archives until later in 2009.   Young currently lives on a 1500-acre (6 km) ranch in  La Honda, California , called Broken Arrow. He also owns property in  Fort Lauderdale, Florida , and on the islands of  Hawaii .   Young headlined the 2009  Big Day Out  festival in  New Zealand  and  Australia . Young pushed other current mainstream bands to only secondary headlining, including  Arctic Monkeys  and  The Ting Tings . He will also headline the Friday at  Glastonbury Festival  which has attempted to book him for many years. Although not officially confirmed, a number of sources have suggested this. [ 36 ]     [ edit ]   Influence, importance and inspiration   Neil Young has undeniably been an important artist in the history of American and Canadian popular music and remains a distinct influence upon other recording artists.  Lynyrd Skynyrd s "" Sweet Home Alabama "" was written in response to two of Neil Youngs songs ""Southern Man"" and ""Alabama"". ""Ohio"" which Young recorded with Crosby, Stills and Nash, was a recollection of the tragic events that transpired at Kent State University in May 1970. Young's willingness to be politically outspoken and socially conscious allowed him to influence such important artists such as  Phish ,  Pearl Jam , and  Nirvana . Neil Young is referred to as ""the Godfather of  Grunge "" because of the influence he had on  Kurt Cobain  and  Eddie Vedder  and the entire grunge movement. Kurt Cobain quoted Neil Young in his suicide note, using the line Its better to burn out, than to fade away from Youngs song ""My My, Hey Hey (Out Of The Blue)"". Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam inducted Neil Young into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, citing him as a huge influence. He has also been a big influence on  experimental rock  acts like  Sonic Youth  and  Radiohead . Youngs influence, importance and inspiration within the music scene derive in part from his longevity because of a career spanning more than four decades. His first album was released in 1966 and his latest in 2008.  Bob Dylan 's influence on Young has been so obvious that the former once lambasted: "" Heart of Gold  bothered me every time it came on the radio ... and I'd say, 'Shit, that's me. If it sounds like me it might as well be me. (...) It seemed somebody else had taken my thing and had run away with it, you know, and I never got over it. Maybe tomorrow"" [ 37 ] . The Dutch guitar virtuoso  Jan Akkerman  described a typical electric guitar solo by Young as the sound of ""a Belgian  vibrator "" in a 1994 TV documentary, adding that it somehow became more palatable when one saw Young's grimace to accompany it  [ 38 ] .   The Australian rock group  Powderfinger  attribute their group name to their love of Young.   Toronto  based band  Constantines  recorded a version of Neil's  Fuckin' Up  in  Winnipeg , [ 39 ] which surfaced at the b-side the their ""Our Age"" 7"" [ 40 ] in November 2008. The members of the  Constantines  have occasionally played shows under the name Horsey Craze [ 41 ] , singing Neil Young songs. In early 2006, they released a vinyl only split-album with The Unintended. The Constantines recorded four Neil Young songs for the LP, while The Unintended performed four Gordon Lightfoot songs.   While in Winnipeg on November 2, 2008 during the Canadian leg of his tour,  Bob Dylan  visited the former home of Neil Young in River Heights. The home was where Neil spent some of his teenage years. Dylan was interested in seeing the room where some of Neils first songs were composed.     [ edit ]   Achievements   Young was inducted into the  Canadian Music Hall of Fame  in 1982. He has been inducted into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  twice: first in 1995 for his solo work, with an induction speech given by  Eddie Vedder , and again in 1997 as a member of Buffalo Springfield.   He has also directed five movies under his pseudonym Bernard Shakey, and released them through his own Shakey Pictures imprint:  Journey Through the Past  (1973),  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979)  Human Highway  (1982) (starring new wave band  Devo ), and  Greendale  (2003) and the documentary,  CSNY Deja Vu  (2008). The bonus  DVDs  included in both versions of  Greendale  and in  Prairie Wind  are also directed by Young under the Bernard Shakey alias, and all of Young's home video and DVD releases have been co-released under the Shakey Pictures imprint.   As one of the original founders of  Farm Aid , he remains an active member of the board of directors. For one weekend each October, in  Mountain View, California , he and his wife host the  Bridge School Concerts , which have been drawing international talent and sell-out crowds for nearly two decades with some of the biggest names in rock having performed at the event including  Bruce Springsteen ,  David Bowie ,  The Who ,  Red Hot Chili Peppers ,  Trent Reznor  of  Nine Inch Nails ,  Pearl Jam ,  Sonic Youth  and Sir  Paul McCartney . The concerts are a benefit for the  Bridge School , which develops and uses advanced technologies to aid in the instruction of children with disabilities. Young's involvement stems at least partially from the fact that both of his sons have  cerebral palsy  and his daughter, like Young himself, has  epilepsy .   Young was nominated for an  Oscar  in 1994 for his song ""Philadelphia"" from the film  Philadelphia  (Bruce Springsteen won the award for his song "" Streets of Philadelphia "" from the same film). In his acceptance speech, Springsteen said that ""the award really deserved to be shared by the other nominee's song."" That same night,  Tom Hanks  accepted the Oscar for Best Actor and gave credit for his inspiration to the song ""Philadelphia"".   He was part owner of  Lionel, LLC , a company that makes toy trains and model railroad accessories. [ 42 ]  In 2008 Lionel emerged from bankruptcy and his shares of the company were wiped out. At this time his status with Lionel is unknown, according to Lionel CEO Jerry Calabrese he is still a consultant for Lionel. He was instrumental in the design of the Lionel Legacy control system for model trains [ 42 ]  and it is believed he will continue to develop the system. Young has been named as co-inventor on seven U.S. Patents related to model trains. [ 43 ]   Young has twice received honorary doctorates. He received an Honorary Doctorate of Music from  Lakehead University  in  Thunder Bay ,  Ontario  in 1992, and an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from  San Francisco State University  in 2006. The latter honour was shared with his wife Pegi for their creation of the Bridge School.   In a ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"" list in the June 1996 issue of  Mojo  magazine , Young was ranked No. 9.   In 2003, Rolling Stone listed Young at #83 in its rankings of ""The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time,"" describing him as a ""restless experimenter...who transform[s] the most obvious music into something revelatory."" [ 44 ]   In 2000, Young was inducted into  Canada's Walk of Fame . [ 45 ]  He ranked No. 39 on  VH1 's 100 Greatest Artist of Hard Rock  that same year.   In 2001, Young was awarded the Spirit of Liberty award from the civil liberties group  People for the American Way .   In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked Neil Young [ 46 ]  #34 on their list of the  100 Greatest Artists of All Time . [ 47 ]   In 2006, Paste Magazine compiled a ""Greatest Living Songwriters"" list; Young was ranked No. 2 behind  Bob Dylan . (While Young and Dylan have occasionally played together in concert, they have never collaborated on a song together, or played on each others' records).   In 2008, Rolling Stone ranked Young at #37 in its list of ""The 100 Greatest Singers of All-Time. [ 48 ]   Jason Bond, an  East Carolina University  biologist, discovered a new species of trapdoor spider in 2007, and named it  Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi  after Young, his favorite singer. [ 49 ]     [ edit ]   Instruments          Neil Young, 2008 in  Florence       Neil Young is a collector of second-hand guitars, but in recording and performing, he frequently uses just a few instruments. As explained by his longtime guitar technician  Larry Cragg  in the film  Neil Young: Heart of Gold , they include:     1953  Gibson Les Paul Goldtop Nicknamed "" Old Black "", this is Young's primary  electric guitar  and is featured on  Rust Never Sleeps  and most other albums. Old Black got its name from a purely amateur paintjob applied to the originally-gold body of the instrument, sometime before Neil acquired the guitar in the late 1960s. In 1972, a mini- humbucker  pickup from a  Gibson Firebird  guitar was installed into the lead/treble position, replacing a  P-90  as standard on Les Paul guitars from that era. This pickup, severely  microphonic , is considered a crucial component of Neil's sound. A  Bigsby vibrato tailpiece  was installed as early as 1969 on the guitar, and can be heard clearly during the opening of ""Cowgirl in the Sand"" from  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere . This guitar also features a mini-switch that is used to send the signal from the mini-humbucker direct to the amp, without going through the volume or tone controls. A Les Paul Gold Top of the same year as Old Black was assembled by Neil's guitar tech, using same style Firebird pick up in the guitar as well as the same model Bigsby Vib; but, according to Young, was just not the same as the original. Young acquired Old Black from Jim Messina, swapping one of his Gretches for it in 1969 while Messina was assisting Young on his first solo album. Messina, who played briefly in Buffalo Springfield and produced the band's final album, ""Last Time Around,"" still has the Gretch in his possession.       Martin D-45 His primary  steel-string acoustic guitar ; used to write ""Old Man"" and many other hit songs.   Martin D-28Nicknamed ""Hank"" after its previous owner,  Hank Williams . The guitar came into Young's possession after  Hank Williams, Jr.  had traded it to another owner for some shotguns and it went through a succession of other owners until it was located by Young's longtime friend Grant Boatwright. The guitar was purchased by Young from  Tut Taylor . Young has toured with it for over 30 years. A story about the guitar and inspired song known as ""This Old Guitar"" can be seen about 50 minutes into the film  Neil Young: Heart of Gold . It is Young's primary guitar for the album,  Prairie Wind .   Neil Young can be seen playing a Vagabond Travel Guitar as he sings ""Let's Impeach the President"" on  The Colbert Report  on  Comedy Central .   A 12-string Taylor 855 is used in the first half of the soundtrack and concert film ""Rust Never Sleeps""   1927  Gibson  MastertoneA six-string  banjo , tuned like a guitar. It has been used on many recordings and was played by  James Taylor  on ""Old Man"".   Various vintage  Fender Tweed Deluxe  amplifiers Young's preferred amplifier for electric guitar is the diminutive Fender Deluxe, specifically a Tweed-era model from 1959. Neil purchased his first vintage Deluxe in 1967 for $50 from the drummer of Crazy Horse, Ralph Molina, and has since acquired nearly 450 different examples, all from the same era, but he maintains that it's the original model that sounds superior, and is a crucial component to his trademark sound. The Tweed Deluxe is almost always used in conjunction with a late-1950's Magnatone 280 (similar to the amp used by Lonnie Mack and Buddy Holly). The Magnatone and the Deluxe are paired together in a somewhat unique manner - the external speaker jack from the Deluxe sends the amped signal through a volume potentiometr and directly into the input of the Magnatone. The Magnatone is notable for its true pitch-bending vibrato capabilities, which can be heard as an electric piano amplifier on ""See the Sky About to Rain"". A notable and unique accessory to Young's Deluxe is the Whizzer, a device created specifically for Young, which physically changes the amplifier's settings to pre-set combinations. It has gone through many incarnations.   Gretsch 6120  (Chet Atkins)Before Young bought Old Black, this was his primary electric guitar used during his  Buffalo Springfield  days.   Gretsch White Falcon   Late '50s hollow body that Young purchased near the end of the  Buffalo Springfield  era; in 1969 Young acquired a stereo version of the same vintage guitar from Stills, and this instrument is featured prominently during Young's early '70s period, and can be heard on tracks like ""Ohio,"" ""Southern Man,"" ""Alabama,"" ""L.A.,"" others. It is Neil's primary electric guitar during the  Harvest  era. This particular White Falcon is the stereo 6137, in which the signal from the three bass strings is separated from the signal from the three treble strings. Young typically plays this guitar in this stereo mode, sending the separate signals to two different amps: the Fender Deluxe and typcially to either a Fender Tremolux or a low-powered Tweed Fender Twin. The separation of the signals is most prominantly heard on the Harvest album song ""Words"".   Neil Young replaced his trademark Les Paul for a Gibson Flying V on the ""Time Fades Away"" tour.   Neil Young played a  Fender Broadcaster  on the Tonight's the Night tour and album.

Although he accompanies himself on several different instrumentsincluding  piano  and  harmonica his claw-hammer  acoustic guitar  style and often idiosyncratic electric guitar soloing are the linchpins of a sometimes ragged, sometimes polished sound. Although Young has experimented widely with differing music styles, including  swing ,  jazz ,  rockabilly ,  blues , and  electronic music  throughout a varied career, his best known work usually falls into either of two distinct styles:  folk -esque  acoustic   rock  ("" Heart of Gold "", ""Harvest Moon"" and "" Old Man "") and  electric -charged  hard rock  (like "" Cinnamon Girl "", "" Rockin' in the Free World "" and "" Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black) ""). In recent years, Young has adopted elements from newer styles like  industrial ,  alternative country  and  grunge . Young's profound influence on the latter caused some to dub him ""the godfather of grunge"".   Young has directed (or co-directed) a number of  films  using the  pseudonym  Bernard Shakey, including  Journey Through the Past  (1973),  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979),  Human Highway  (1982),  Greendale  (2003), and  CSNY Dj Vu  (2008). He is currently working on a documentary about electric car technology, tentatively titled  Linc/Volt . The project involves a 1959  Lincoln Continental  converted to hybrid technology, which Young plans to drive to  Washington, DC  as an example to lawmakers there. [ 2 ]   He is also an outspoken advocate for environmental issues and small farmers, having co-founded in 1985 the  benefit concert   Farm Aid , and in 1986 helped found The Bridge School, [ 3 ]  and its annual supporting  Bridge School Benefit  concerts, together with his wife Pegi (in this, Young's involvement stems at least partially from the fact that both of his sons have  cerebral palsy  and his daughter, like Young himself, has  epilepsy ).   Although Young sings as frequently about U.S. legends and myths ( Pocahontas ,  space stations , and the settlement of the American West) [ 4 ]  as he does about his native country, he remains a Canadian citizen and has never wanted to relinquish his Canadian citizenship. He has lived in the U.S. for ""so long"" and has stated he has ""got just as much right to vote in them (American elections) as anybody else.""

He spent his early years in the small country town of  Omemee , 130  kilometres  (81  mi ) northeast of Toronto.   Young was diagnosed with diabetes as a child [ 6 ]  and a bout of  polio  at the age of 6 left him with a weakened left side; he still walks with a slight limp.   His parents divorced when Young was 12, and he moved with his mother back to the family home of  Winnipeg , Manitoba, where the formative years of his music career began. Neil and his mother Rassy settled into the working class suburb of  Fort Rouge  where the shy, dry-humoured youth enrolled at Earl Grey Junior High School. It was there that he formed his first band  the Jades , and met  Ken Koblun , later to join him in the Squires.   While attending  Kelvin High School  in Winnipeg, he played in several instrumental rock bands. Young's first stable band was called the Squires, who had a local hit called ""The Sultan"". Young dropped out of high school [ 7 ]  and also played in  Fort William , where they recorded a series of demos produced by a local producer named Ray Dee, whom Young called ""the original Briggs."" [ 8 ]  While in Thunder Bay, Young first encountered  Stephen Stills . In the  2006  film  Heart of Gold  Young relates how he used to spend time as a teenager at  Falcon Lake, Manitoba  where he would endlessly plug coins into the jukebox to hear  Ian Tyson 's "" Four Strong Winds "". Neil also formed a friendship with musician  Randy Bachman .   After leaving the Squires, Neil worked folk clubs in Winnipeg, where he first met  Joni Mitchell . [ 9 ]  Here he wrote some of his earliest and most enduring folk songs such as the classic "" Sugar Mountain "", about his lost youth. Mitchell wrote ""The Circle Game"" in response. [ citation needed ]   In 1965 Young toured Canada as a solo artist. In 1966, he joined the  Rick James -fronted  Mynah Birds . The band managed to secure a record deal with the  Motown  label, but as their first album was being recorded, James was arrested for being  AWOL  from the army. [ 10 ]  After the Mynah Birds disbanded, Young and bass player  Bruce Palmer  relocated to  Los Angeles . Young has admitted in an interview that he was in the United States illegally until receiving a green card in 1970. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Buffalo Springfield   Once they reached Los Angeles, Young and Palmer met up with  Stephen Stills ,  Richie Furay , and  Dewey Martin  to form  Buffalo Springfield . A mixture of folk, country,  psychedelia , and rock lent a hard edge by the twin lead guitars of Stills and Young made Buffalo Springfield a critical success, and their first record  Buffalo Springfield  (1967) sold well after Stills' topical song "" For What It's Worth "" became a hit, aided by Young's melodic harmonics played on electric guitar.   Distrust of their management, as well as the arrest and deportation of Palmer, exacerbated the already strained relations among the group members and led to Buffalo Springfield's demise. A second album,  Buffalo Springfield Again , was released in late 1967, but two of Youngs three contributions were solo tracks recorded apart from the rest of the group.   In many ways, these three songs on  Buffalo Springfield Again  are harbingers of much of Young's later work in that, although they all share deeply personal, almost idiosyncratic lyrics, they also present three very different musical approaches to the arrangement of what is essentially an original folk song. ""Mr Soul"" is the only Young song of the three that all five members of the group perform together. In contrast, "" Broken Arrow "" was confessional folk rock of a kind that would characterize much of the music that emerged from the singer-songwriter movement. Youngs experimental production intersperses each verse with snippets of sound from other sources, including opening the song with a sound bite of Dewey Martin singing ""Mr. Soul"" and closing it with the thumping of a heartbeat. ""Expecting to Fly"" was a lushly produced  ballad  featuring a string arrangement that Young's co-producer for the track,  Jack Nitzsche , would dub ""symphonic pop.""   In May 1968, the band split up for good, but in order to fulfill a contractual obligation, a final album,  Last Time Around , was recorded, primarily from recordings made earlier that year. Young contributed the songs ""On the Way Home"" and ""I Am a Child"", singing lead on the latter. In 1997, the band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame; Young did not appear at the ceremony.     [ edit ]   Solo success & CSNY   After the breakup of Buffalo Springfield, Young signed a solo deal with  Reprise Records , home of his colleague and friend  Joni Mitchell , with whom he shared a manager, Elliot Roberts, who manages Young to this day. Young and Nitzsche immediately began work on Young's first solo record,  Neil Young  (November 1968), which received mixed reviews. In a 1970 interview, [ 12 ]  Young deprecated the album as being ""overdubbed rather than played,"" and the quest for music that expresses the spontaneity of the moment has long been a feature of his career. Nevertheless, the album contains some tunes that remain a staple of his live shows, most notably ""The Loner.""   For his next album, Young recruited three musicians from a band called The Rockets:  Danny Whitten  on guitar,  Billy Talbot  on bass guitar, and  Ralph Molina  on  drums . These three took the name  Crazy Horse  (after  the historical figure of the same name ), and  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere  (May 1969), is credited to ""Neil Young with Crazy Horse."" Recorded in just two weeks, the album opens with one of Young's most familiar songs, ""Cinnamon Girl,"" and is dominated by two more, ""Cowgirl in the Sand"" and ""Down by the River,"" that feature lengthy jams showcasing Young's idiosyncratic guitar soloing accompanied sympathetically by Crazy Horse. Young reportedly wrote all three songs on the same day, while nursing a high fever of 103 F (39.5 C) in bed.   Shortly after the release of  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere , Young reunited with Stephen Stills by joining  Crosby, Stills, & Nash , who had already released one album as a trio. Young was originally offered a position as a sideman, but agreed to join only if he received full membership, and the group - winners of the 1969 ""Best New Artist"" Grammy - was renamed Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. [ 13 ]  The quartet debuted in  Chicago  on  August 16 ,  1969 , and later performed at the famous  Woodstock Festival , during which Young skipped the acoustic set and refused to be filmed during the electric set, even telling the cameramen: ""One of you fuckin' guys comes near me and I'm gonna fuckin' hit you with my guitar"". [ 14 ]  During the making of their first album,  Dj Vu , the musicians frequently argued, particularly Young and Stills, who both fought for control. [ 15 ]   "" Ohio "" was written following the  Kent State massacre  on  May 4 ,  1970 , and was a staple of anti-war rallies in the 1970s. The song was quickly recorded by CSNY and immediately released as a single, even though CSNY's ""Teach Your Children"" was still climbing the singles charts. Many believe that the release of ""Ohio"" as a single cut into the sales of ""Teach Your Children"" and prevented that song from reaching the top ten. In the late 1970s and for much of the 1980s, Young refrained from performing ""Ohio"" live, as he considered the song to be dated. In the wake of the 1989  Tiananmen Square massacre , however, Young revived the song in concert, often dedicating it to the  Chinese  students who were killed in the massacre. Crosby, Stills & Nash, as a trio, also returned the song to their live repertoire around the same time, even though Young had provided the lead vocals on the original recording.   Also that year, Young released his third solo album,  After the Gold Rush  (1970), which featured, among others, a young  Nils Lofgren ,  Stephen Stills , and CSNY bassist Greg Reeves. Young also recorded some tracks with Crazy Horse, but dismissed them early in the sessions. Aided by his newfound fame with CSNY, the album was a commercial breakthrough for Young and contains some of his best known work. Notable tracks include the title track, with dream-like lyrics that run a gamut of subjects from drugs and interpersonal relationships to environmental concerns, as well as Youngs controversial and acerbic condemnation of  racism  in "" Southern Man ,"" which, along with a later song entitled ""Alabama,"" later prompted  Lynyrd Skynyrd  to decry Young by name in the lyrics to "" Sweet Home Alabama ."" Young was one of Skynyrd's biggest influences, and Young was an admirer of Skynyrd's music. The respectful rivalry and friendship between Young and Skynyrd front man  Ronnie Van Zant  would serve as a recurring theme in the  Drive-By Truckers ' 2001  concept album   Southern Rock Opera .   With CSNY splitting up and Crazy Horse having signed their own record deal, Young began the year 1971 with a solo tour entitled ""Journey Through the Past."" Later, he recruited a new group of country-music session musicians, whom he christened  The Stray Gators , to record much of the new material that had been premiered on tour for the album  Harvest  (1972).  Harvest  was a massive hit (especially with the country-music crowd) and ""Heart of Gold"" became a US number one single; incidentally, to this day it remains the only No. 1 hit in his long career.   Another notable song was "" The Needle and the Damage Done ,"" a somber lament on the pain caused by heroin addiction; inspired in part by the heavy heroin use of Crazy Horse member Danny Whitten, who would eventually die of an overdose. [ 16 ]   The album's success, however, caught Young off guard, and his first instinct was to back away from stardom. In the handwritten liner notes to the  Decade  compilation, Young described ""Heart of Gold"" as the song that ""put me in the middle of the road. Traveling there soon became a bore, so I headed for the ditch. A rougher ride but I saw more interesting people there.""   On  September 8 ,  1972 , the Academy Award-nominated actress  Carrie Snodgress , with whom he had been living, gave birth to Neil Young's first child. The boy, Zeke, was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Young fell in love with Snodgress after seeing her in a movie (""Diary of a Mad Housewife"") on television after which Young wrote the song "" A Man Needs a Maid "" from the Harvest album, featuring the lyric ""I fell in love with the actress/she was playing a part that I could understand.""     [ edit ]   The Ditch Trilogy   Although a new tour had been planned to follow up on the success of  Harvest , it became apparent during rehearsals that Danny Whitten could not function due to  drug abuse . On  November 18 , 1972, shortly after he was fired from the tour preparations, Whitten was found dead of an  overdose . Young described the incident to  Rolling Stone s  Cameron Crowe  in 1975:  [ 17 ]  ""[We] were rehearsing with him and he just couldn't cut it. He couldn't remember anything. He was too out of it. Too far gone. I had to tell him to go back to L.A. 'It's not happening, man. You're not together enough.' He just said, 'I've got nowhere else to go, man. How am I gonna tell my friends?' And he split. That night the coroner called me from L.A. and told me he'd ODed. That blew my mind. Fucking blew my mind. I loved Danny. I felt responsible. And from there, I had to go right out on this huge tour of huge arenas. I was very nervous and  insecure.""   The album made in the aftermath of this incident,  Time Fades Away  (1973), has often been described by Young as ""my least favourite record,"" and it is, in fact, one of only two of Youngs early recordings that has yet to be officially re-released on CD (the other being the soundtrack album  Journey Through the Past ). The album was recorded live over a tour where Young struggled with his voice and called  David Crosby  and  Graham Nash  to help perform the music. The tour featured  Linda Ronstadt  as the opening act.  Time Fades Away  occupies a unique position in Youngs discography as the first of three albums known collectively as the "" Ditch Trilogy .""   In the second half of 1973, Young formed The Santa Monica Flyers, with Crazy Horse's rhythm section augmented by Nils Lofgren on guitar. Deeply affected by the drug-induced deaths of Whitten and  roadie   Bruce Berry , Young recorded  Tonight's the Night . The album's dark tone and rawness caused Reprise to delay the release until two years later and only after being pressured by Young to do so. [ 18 ]  It received mixed reviews at the time, but is now regarded as a landmark album. In Young's own opinion, it was the closest he ever came to art. [ 19 ]   While his record company delayed the release of  Tonight's the Night,  Young recorded  On the Beach  (1974), which dealt with themes such as the downside of fame and the Californian lifestyle. Like  Time Fades Away  and  Tonight's the Night , it sold poorly but eventually became a critical favourite, presenting some of Young's most original work. In a review of the 2003 re-release on CD of  On the Beach  Derek Svennungsen described the music as ""mesmerizing, harrowing, lucid, and bleary,"" [ 20 ] .     [ edit ]   Return to prominence   After completing  On the Beach , Young reunited with  Harvest  producer Elliot Mazer to record another acoustic album,  Homegrown . Most of the songs were written after Young's breakup with Snodgress, and thus the tone of the album was somewhat dark. Though the album was entirely completed, Young decided to drop the album and release  Tonight's the Night  instead, at the suggestion of  The Band  bassist  Rick Danko . [ 21 ]  Young further explained his move by saying: ""It was a little too personal... it scared me"". [ 22 ]          Neil Young in Austin, Texas on November 9, 1976       Young reformed Crazy Horse with  Frank Sampedro  on guitar as his backup band for  Zuma  (1975). Many of the songs are overtly concerned with failed relationships, and even the epic "" Cortez the Killer ,"" outwardly a retelling of the  Spanish conquest  of  Mexico  from the viewpoint of the  Aztecs , can be seen as an allegory of love lostsomething that didnt save it, however, from being banned in  Franco 's  Spain .   The following year, Young reunited with Stephen Stills for the album  Long May You Run  (1976), credited to  The Stills-Young Band ; the follow-up tour was ended midway through by Young, who sent Stills a  telegram  that read: ""Funny how some things that start spontaneously end that way. Eat a peach, Neil."" [ 23 ]   In 1976, Young performed with  The Band , Joni Mitchell, and other rock musicians in the high profile all-star concert  The Last Waltz . The release of  Martin Scorsese 's movie of the concert was delayed while Scorsese unwillingly re-edited it to obscure the lump of cocaine that was clearly visible hanging from Young's nose during his performance of  ""Helpless."" [ 24 ]  Young later said, ""I'm not proud of that,"" according to one of his biographers.   American Stars 'N Bars  (1977) contained two songs originally recorded for  Homegrown  album, ""Homegrown"" and ""Star of Bethelehem,"" as well as newer material, including the future concert staple "" Like A Hurricane "". Performers included  Linda Ronstadt ,  Emmylou Harris  and Young protg  Nicolette Larson  along with Crazy Horse. Also in 1977, Young released  Decade : a personally selected career summary of material spanning every aspect of his various interests and affiliations, including a handful of unreleased songs.  Comes a Time  (1978) also featured Nicolette Larson and Crazy Horse and became Young's most commercially accessible album in quite some time, marked by a return to his folk roots.   Young next set out on the lengthy ""Rust Never Sleeps"" tour, in which each concert was divided into a solo acoustic set and an electric set with Crazy Horse. Much of the electric set was later seen as a response to punk rock's burgeoning popularity. ""Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)"" compared the changing public perception of  Johnny Rotten  with that of the recently deceased  Elvis Presley , who himself had once been disparaged as a dangerous influence only to later become an  icon . Rotten, meanwhile, returned the favour by playing one of Young's records on a  London  radio show. The accompanying albums  Rust Never Sleeps  (new material, culled from live recordings, but featuring studio overdubs) and  Live Rust  (a mixture of old and new, and a genuine concert recording) captured the two sides of the concerts, with solo acoustic songs on side A, and fierce, uptempo, electric songs on side B. A movie version of the concerts, also called  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979), was directed by Young under the pseudonym Bernard Shakey.   Young was suddenly hip again, and the readers and critics of  Rolling Stone  voted him Artist Of The Year for 1979 (along with The Who), selected  Rust Never Sleeps  as Album Of The Year, and voted him Male Vocalist Of The Year as well.  The Village Voice , meanwhile, honored Young as the Artist of the Decade.     [ edit ]   1980s - Experimental years   The 1980s were a lean time for Young both critically and commercially. After providing the incidental music to a  biopic  of  Hunter S. Thompson  entitled  Where the Buffalo Roam , he recorded  Hawks & Doves  (1980), a folk/country record.  Re-ac-tor  (1981), once again with Crazy Horse, was a faade of distortion and feedback obscuring a relatively weak selection of songs, but his strangest record of the decade came with  Trans  (1982). Recorded partially with  vocoders ,  synthesizers , and other devices that modified instruments and vocals with electronic effects, it is sometimes considered an experiment related to finding a technology that would become a means to communicate for Youngs son (with his wife Pegi), Ben, who has severe  cerebral palsy  and cannot speak. Many fans were baffled by the radical forms of this album and  rockabilly -styled  Everybody's Rockin'  (1983), and record company head  David Geffen  even sued Young for making ""unrepresentative"" musici.e. music that did not sound like Neil Youngthat deliberately lacked commercial appeal. [ 25 ]  Young later stated that he would have preferred to release the songs featuring the  synclavier  and  vocoder  as an EP, and that their inclusion with the Hawaiian-themed rockabilly was a mistake. Also premiered at this time though little seen was an eclectic full-length comedy film  Human Highway  starring, co-directed and co-written by Young.   In 1983, Young worked with British video director  Tim Pope , making two videos - ""Wonderin'"" and ""Cry, Cry, Cry.""   In 1985, he reunited with Crosby, Stills and Nash at  Live Aid  at Philadelphia's  John F. Kennedy Stadium . The two songs that they played, ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"" and "" Daylight Again /Find The Cost of Freedom,"" were the first songs they had played as a quartet in front of a paying audience since 1974.   Old Ways  (1985) saw a return to country music, recorded with a group of friends and session musicians.  Landing on Water  (1986) is entertaining for the blending of synthesizers and other instruments related to the 1980s into Youngs own style, with lyrics that take pot shots at some favourite targets, including CSN in ""Hippie Dream,"" with a chorus that goes: ""But the wooden ships/Were just a hippie dream,"" and David Geffen in ""Drifter,"" with the line: ""Dont try to tell me what I gotta do to fit."" The resumption of his partnership with Crazy Horse on  Life  (1987) fulfilled his contract with Geffen, and Young was finally able to switch labels.   Director Pope again made a series of videos from the album, including ""Touch the Night"" and ""People on the Street"".   Signing with  Warner Brothers  (which distributed Geffen at the time) and returning to Reprise Records, Young produced  This Note's For You  (1988) with a new band, The Bluenotes, whose name rights were owned by musician  Harold Melvin . Young named his band after a cafe called the Blue Note on Main Street in Winnipeg Manitoba, where he had played. The addition of a  brass  section provided a new  jazzier  sound and the title track became his first hit single of the decade. Accompanied by a video which parodied corporate rock, the pretensions of advertising and  Michael Jackson  in particular, the song was initially banned by  MTV  (although the Canadian music channel,  MuchMusic  ran it immediately) before being put into heavy rotation and finally given the  MTV Video Music Award for Best Video of the Year  for 1989. After Melvin sued over the use of the Bluenotes name, Young renamed his back-up group ""Ten Men Workin'"" for the balance of the concert tour.   Young also contributed to that year's CSNY reunion  American Dream  (1988) and CSNY played a few benefit concerts. Young, however, refused to book a full tour with CSN and the foursome would not embark upon a nationwide tour until 2000.     [ edit ]   1990s - Return to country-rock roots   Freedom  was a mixture of acoustic and electric rock dealing with the state of the U.S. and the world in 1989, alongside a set of love songs and a version of the standard ""On Broadway."" "" Rockin' in the Free World "", two versions of which bookended the album, again caught the mood. Some say it became a  de facto  anthem during the fall of the  Berlin Wall , a few months after the record's release. However, most Germans don't remember the song being related to the unification, understandably so, since the lyrics are not about political repression. Like  Bruce Springsteen 's "" Born in the U.S.A. "", the anthemic use of this song was based on largely ignoring the verses, which evoke social problems and implicitly criticize American government policies. In mid-1989, record executive  Terry Tolkin  conceived and produced a tribute album to Young's songs called  The Bridge: A Tribute To Neil Young,  released on his  No.6 Records  label. It featured cover versions of 15 of Young's songs by the cream of the up and coming  Alternative Music  and  Grunge music  bands including  Sonic Youth ,  Nick Cave ,  Soul Asylum ,  Dinosaur Jr ,and  The Pixies . By 1990,  grunge music  was beginning to make its first inroads in the charts and many of its prime movers, including  Nirvana 's  Kurt Cobain  and  Pearl Jam 's  Eddie Vedder , cited Young as a major influence.   Using a barn on his  Northern California  ranch as a studio, he rapidly recorded  Ragged Glory  with Crazy Horse, whose guitar riffs and feedback driven sound showed his new admirers that he could still cut it. Young then headed back out on the road with Orange Country country-punk band  Social Distortion  and  alternative rock  elder statesmen  Sonic Youth  as support, much to the consternation of many of his old fans. [ 26 ] [ 27 ]  Yet the influence of Sonic Youth could be clearly heard on the accompanying home video and live album,  Weld , which also included a bonus CD entitled  Arc , a single 35-minute-long collage of  feedback  and guitar noise that Neil included, evidently at the suggestion of Sonic Youth's  Thurston Moore . [ 28 ]   Arc  was later sold separately.   Young's next move was another return to country music.  Harvest Moon  (1992) was the long-awaited sequel to  Harvest  and reunited him with some of the musicians from that session, as well as singers  Linda Ronstadt  and  James Taylor . The title track was a minor hit and the record was reviewed and sold equally well, containing songs such as ""From Hank to  Hendrix "" and ""Unknown Legend"", a tribute to his wife. His resurgent popularity saw him booked on  MTV Unplugged  in 1993. In 1992 he accompanied fellow  Winnipegger   Randy Bachman  on ""Prairie Town,"" a song that recounts their days in the Winnipeg music scene of the 1960s. That year, he contributed music to the  soundtrack  of the  Jonathan Demme  movie  Philadelphia , and his song ""Philadelphia"" was nominated for the  Academy Award for Best Song , losing out to Bruce Springsteen's contribution to the same film. A summer tour covering both Europe and North America with  Booker T. and the MGs  (with whom he played two songs at a 1992  Bob Dylan  tribute concert at  Madison Square Garden ) was widely praised as a triumph. On a few of these dates, the show ended with a rendition of ""Rockin' in the Free World"" played with  Pearl Jam .   Young was back with Crazy Horse for 1994's  Sleeps with Angels , a much darker record. The title track told the story of  Kurt Cobain 's death; Young had reportedly made repeated attempts to contact Cobain prior to this event. [ 29 ]  Cobain had quoted Young's ""It's better to burn out than fade away"" (a line from "" My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue) "") in his alleged  suicide note , causing Young to emphasize the line ""'cause once you're gone you can't come back"" in live performances at the time. Other songs dealt with drive-by shootings (""Driveby""),  environmentalism  (""Piece of Crap"") and Young's own vision of America (the archetypal car metaphor of ""Trans Am""). Young was inspired to make the record after viewing Cobain's performance on  MTV Unplugged . Still admired by the prime movers of grunge, Young eventually performed with Pearl Jam at the MTV Music Awards during what was described as the highlight of a lackluster show. [ 30 ]  Their collaboration led to a joint tour, with the band and producer  Brendan O'Brien  backing Young. The accompanying album,  Mirror Ball  (1995), recorded as live in the studio captured their loose rock sound, and featured the standout track ""I'm the Ocean"". The year of 1995 also featured Young's entry into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .   After composing an abstract, distorted feedback-led guitar instrumental soundtrack to  Jim Jarmusch 's  acid western  film  Dead Man  Young recorded a series of loose jams with Crazy Horse that eventually appeared as the critically denigrated  Broken Arrow . The return to Crazy Horse was prompted by the death of mentor, friend, and longtime  producer   David Briggs  in late 1995. The subsequent tours of Europe and North America in 1996 resulted in both a live album and a tour documentary directed by  Jim Jarmusch . Both releases took the name  Year of the Horse .   In 1997, Young participated in the  H.O.R.D.E. Festival 's sixth annual tour.   In 1998, Young shared the stage with the rock band  Phish  at the annual  Farm Aid  concert, and later offered them an opportunity to headline both nights of the Bridge School Benefit concert. Phish took Young up on his offer to headline the Bridge School Benefit (where Young joined Phish for renditions of ""Helpless"" and ""I Shall Be Released."" [ 31 ]  Phish, however, declined Young's later invitation to be his backing band on a 1999 tour. [ 32 ]   The decade ended with  Looking Forward , another reunion with Crosby, Stills and Nash. The subsequent tour of the United States and Canada with the reformed super quartet was a huge success and brought in earnings of $42.1 million, making it the eighth largest grossing tour of 2000.   Young's next album,  Silver & Gold  (2000), contained a number of understated songs with personal lyrics, which was promoted through a mini-tour of solo acoustic shows. This style was continued in  Are You Passionate?  (2002), an album of love songs dedicated to his wife, Pegi.     [ edit ]   In the aftermath of 9/11   Young's 2001 single "" Let's Roll "", was a tribute to the victims of the  September 11, 2001 attacks , and the passengers and crew on  Flight 93  in particular. At the "" America: A Tribute to Heroes "" concert he performed  John Lennon's  "" Imagine "". In 2002,  Q  magazine  named Neil Young in their list of the ""50 Bands To See Before You Die.""   Young hauled out his concept album  Greendale , about an extended family in a small town called Greendale, and how they are torn apart by a murder, in 2003.  Greendale  was recorded with Crazy Horse members Billy Talbot and Ralph Molina. This tale of the Green family also resulted in a movie called  Greendale , written and directed by Young (again using his ""Bernard Shakey"" pseudonym) and starring a few of his friends, who act out and  lip sync  the songs from the album. The film was indeed thoroughly experimental, from Young's rambling on-stage between-song narratives, to his reading apparent transcriptions of these ramblings in the liner notes. ""When I was writing this I had no idea what I was doing, so I was just as surprised as you are,"" Young said later. Young toured extensively with the  Greendale  material throughout 2003 and 2004, first with a solo, acoustic version in Europe, then with a full-cast stage show in North America,  Japan , and  Australia . While audience reaction was sometimes mixed (drunken requests for ""Southern Man"" being an aesthetic impediment at most Young performances), the live stage version of Greendale was for many critics the most satisfying incarnation of the material, and bootlegs of the shows have been widely traded. The second half of each concert consisted of high-decibel renditions of Young classics such as ""Hey Hey, My My,"" ""Cinnamon Girl,"" ""Powderfinger,"" and  Rockin' in the Free World , as well as rarities such as ""The Losing End,"" ""The Old Country Waltz,"" and ""Danger Bird.""   Young spent the latter portion of 2004 giving a series of intimate acoustic concerts in various cities with his wife, Pegi, who is a trained vocalist and guitar player.     [ edit ]   Recent events          From left,  Emmylou Harris , Neil Young and  Pegi Young  perform in  Neil Young: Heart of Gold , which offered renditions of some of Young's best-known songs.       On  March 31 ,  2005 , Young was admitted to a hospital in New York for treatment for a brain  aneurysm . He was treated successfully by a minimally invasive  neuroradiological  procedure. Prior to undergoing the procedure, he wrote the first eight songs of a new album,  Prairie Wind , in  Nashville , with session musicians that included regular Young sideman  Ben Keith  on lap and  pedal steel guitars . Two days after the procedure, Young was forced to cancel a scheduled appearance on the  Juno Awards  telecast in Winnipeg when the area where the surgeons did his procedure (via the  femoral artery ) suddenly began to bleed. While Young finally was able to return to Winnipeg in 2006 with Crosby, Stills and Nash, his first post-aneurysm performance was on  July 2 ,  2005 , at the close of the  Live 8  concert in  Barrie, Ontario . There, he debuted a new song, a soft hymn called ""When God Made Me.""   On  September 28 ,  2005 ,  Prairie Wind  was released. In an interview given to  Time  magazine , Young revealed that he had planned to keep the news of his aneurysm private until he had the bleeding scare, after which he decided to make news of his condition public. The last two songs on the album were written after his aneurysm procedure, and several of the songs, such as ""Fallin' Off the Face of the Earth,"" seem to be inspired by Young's brush with  mortality , the recent death of his father, who suffered from  senile dementia , and Young's  Manitoba  roots.   In 2006,  Neil Young: Heart of Gold , a film made by  Jonathan Demme , premiered at the  Sundance Film Festival . Filmed over two nights at the  Ryman Auditorium  in  Nashville, Tennessee  during the premiere of  Prairie Wind , it includes both new and old songs as well as behind-the scenes-commentary by Young, his wife Pegi, and members of Young's session band.   In April 2006, Young announced the release of  Living with War , an album of protest songs that included the provocatively-titled "" Let's Impeach the President ."" Recorded using his famous  Les Paul  electric guitar, "" Old Black ,"" along with Chad Cromwell (drums), Rick Rosas (bass), and Tommy Brea (trumpet), the album was intended to be a stinging rebuke of U.S. President  George W. Bush  and the  War in Iraq . The album was recorded in a two week period in April, and was then made available over the internet from 28 April 2006 before being released as a CD on 5 May.  Living With War  was Young's most talked about release for years, creating heated political debate and a return to form with perhaps his most critically-acclaimed album since the early 1990s.  Living With War: In the Beginning , a remixed version with the original album's choral backing vocals removed, was released in December of the same year. Its accompanying DVD featured videos directed by Young of every song on the album, footage of the  Iraq War  and demonstrations in the US, and clips from  Al Gore 's  An Inconvenient Truth .          Neil Young on the CSNY ""Freedom Of Speech Tour '06""       From July through September 2006, Neil Young reunited with his former bandmates from  Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young  for the ""Freedom Of Speech Tour '06"" across North America. Chad Cromwell and Rick Rosas made up the band's rhythm section. The entire  Living with War  album was performed on the tour, in addition to other CSN and Neil Young classics such as "" Ohio "" and "" Rockin' in the Free World ."" An accompanying concert film and live album, called  CSNY Deja Vu , were premiered on January 25, 2008, at the Sundance Movie Festival.   2006 also saw the first release from Young's long awaited  Archives  project, as  Live at the Fillmore East , a selection of songs drawn from a 1970 gig with  Crazy Horse , was released in November of that year. The release was marked as number two in the  Archives Performance Series , leaving room for the still-unreleased 1969  Riverboat  bootleg, which will be number one in the series. In March 2007, another historical live album, marked as the third in the  Performance Series , was released. Titled  Live at Massey Hall 1971 , it featured a solo acoustic set from Toronto's Massey Hall, including material from the upcoming  Harvest  album.   On  August 15 ,  2007 , Young played a new album for 100 people at Reprise Records entitled  Chrome Dreams II .  Chrome Dreams  was an album he scrapped in 1977, and the name of two different bootlegs. The new album includes two long songs that time in at 18:13 (""Ordinary People"") and 14:31 (""No Hidden Path""), respectively. The album consists of three songs written previously and seven new songs, all by Young. The album was released on October 23, 2007, timed to coincide with a seven-week tour that had kicked off in Boise, Idaho, ten days earlier.   On February 11, 2008, Neil Young started the European leg of his tour with a concert in  Antwerp ,  Belgium . On July 17, he was interviewed on  PBS  by  Charlie Rose , where he spoke about many things, including his project to make a hybrid 1959 Lincoln. [ 33 ]  In October, a BBC 4 documentary ""Neil Young - Don't be Denied"" was shown, featuring interviews with Neil and a number of his contemporaries. It also summarizes his biography and motivations. [ 34 ]   The latest album in the Performance Series,  Sugar Mountain - Live At Canterbury House 1968  was released on December 2, 2008. Featuring material from Young's earliest solo performances recorded in Ann Arbor, MI November 9, 1968, the album was released as number zero in the  Performance Series .   The first installment of Young's oft-delayed box set  The Archives Vol. 1 1963-1972  was officially announced in 2008 with a trailer.  [ 35 ]   [ 36 ]  The first set of Archives will feature both DVD and Blu-ray editions which will include 128 audio tracks (43 unreleased and 13 never before heard songs), thousands of images (photos, lyrics, letters and memorabilia), and hours of new, previously released and rare videos. Also included will be a 236 page hardbound book. The Blu-ray edition will have HD picture, pristine audio mastered and presented in 24bit 192 khz., and access to photos, trivia and memorabilia without stopping the music. It is currently scheduled for release in 2009.   A April 07,2009 date has been set for Neil's new album 'A Fork in The Road', which will delay the release of the Archives until later in 2009. A new film by Jonathan Demme of Neil Young in concert (Upper Darby, Pennsylvania 2007) called the Neil Young Trunk Show will premiere at the South by Southwest (SXSW) Film Conference and Festival, on Saturday, March 21,2009 at the Paramount Theatre in Austin, Texas.   Young headlined the 2009  Big Day Out  festival in  New Zealand  and  Australia . Young pushed other current mainstream bands to only secondary headlining, including  Arctic Monkeys  and  The Ting Tings . He is rumored to be headlining the Friday at  Glastonbury Festival  which has attempted to book him for many years. Although not officially confirmed, a number of sources have suggested this. [ 37 ]  He has also been confirmed to play the Primavera Festival, Barcelona in May 2009 and the Isle of Wight Festival [ 38 ]  in the UK, June 2009.   Young currently lives on a 1500-acre (6 km) ranch in  La Honda, California , called Broken Arrow. He also owns property in  Fort Lauderdale, Florida , and on the islands of  Hawaii .     [ edit ]   Influence, importance and inspiration   Neil Young has undeniably been an important artist in the history of American and Canadian popular music and remains a distinct influence upon other recording artists.  Lynyrd Skynyrd s "" Sweet Home Alabama "" was written in response to two of Neil Youngs songs ""Southern Man"" and ""Alabama"". ""Ohio"" which Young recorded with Crosby, Stills and Nash, was a recollection of the tragic events that transpired at Kent State University in May 1970. Young's willingness to be politically outspoken and socially conscious allowed him to influence such important artists such as  Phish ,  Pearl Jam , and  Nirvana . Neil Young is referred to as ""the Godfather of  Grunge "" because of the influence he had on  Kurt Cobain  and  Eddie Vedder  and the entire grunge movement. Kurt Cobain quoted Neil Young in his suicide note, using the line Its better to burn out, than to fade away from Youngs song ""My My, Hey Hey (Out Of The Blue)"". Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam inducted Neil Young into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, citing him as a huge influence. He has also been a big influence on  experimental rock  acts like  Sonic Youth  and  Radiohead . Youngs influence, importance and inspiration within the music scene derive in part from his longevity because of a career spanning more than four decades. His first album was released in 1966 and his latest in 2008.  Bob Dylan 's influence on Young has been so obvious that the former once lambasted: "" Heart of Gold  bothered me every time it came on the radio ... and I'd say, 'Shit, that's me. If it sounds like me it might as well be me. (...) It seemed somebody else had taken my thing and had run away with it, you know, and I never got over it. Maybe tomorrow"" [ 39 ] .   The Australian rock group  Powderfinger  attribute their group name to their love of Young.   Toronto  based band  Constantines  recorded a version of Neil's  Fuckin' Up  in  Winnipeg , [ 40 ] which surfaced at the b-side the their ""Our Age"" 7"" [ 41 ] in November 2008. The members of the  Constantines  have occasionally played shows under the name Horsey Craze [ 42 ] , singing Neil Young songs. In early 2006, they released a vinyl only split-album with The Unintended. The Constantines recorded four Neil Young songs for the LP, while The Unintended performed four Gordon Lightfoot songs.   While in Winnipeg on November 2, 2008 during the Canadian leg of his tour,  Bob Dylan  visited Young's former home in River Heights. The home was where Neil spent some of his teenage years. Dylan was interested in seeing the room where some of Neil's first songs were composed.     [ edit ]   Achievements   Young was inducted into the  Canadian Music Hall of Fame  in 1982. He has been inducted into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  twice: first in 1995 for his solo work, with an induction speech given by  Eddie Vedder , and again in 1997 as a member of Buffalo Springfield.   He has also directed five movies under his pseudonym Bernard Shakey, and released them through his own Shakey Pictures imprint:  Journey Through the Past  (1973),  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979)  Human Highway  (1982) (starring new wave band  Devo ), and  Greendale  (2003) and the documentary,  CSNY Deja Vu  (2008). The bonus  DVDs  included in both versions of  Greendale  and in  Prairie Wind  are also directed by Young under the Bernard Shakey alias, and all of Young's home video and DVD releases have been co-released under the Shakey Pictures imprint.   As one of the original founders of  Farm Aid , he remains an active member of the board of directors. For one weekend each October, in  Mountain View, California , he and his wife host the  Bridge School Concerts , which have been drawing international talent and sell-out crowds for nearly two decades with some of the biggest names in rock having performed at the event including  Bruce Springsteen ,  David Bowie ,  The Who ,  Red Hot Chili Peppers ,  Trent Reznor  of  Nine Inch Nails ,  Pearl Jam ,  Sonic Youth  and Sir  Paul McCartney . The concerts are a benefit for the  Bridge School , which develops and uses advanced technologies to aid in the instruction of children with disabilities. Young's involvement stems at least partially from the fact that both of his sons have  cerebral palsy  and his daughter, like Young himself, has  epilepsy .   Young was nominated for an  Oscar  in 1994 for his song ""Philadelphia"" from the film  Philadelphia  (Bruce Springsteen won the award for his song "" Streets of Philadelphia "" from the same film). In his acceptance speech, Springsteen said that ""the award really deserved to be shared by the other nominee's song."" That same night,  Tom Hanks  accepted the Oscar for Best Actor and gave credit for his inspiration to the song ""Philadelphia"".   He was part owner of  Lionel, LLC , a company that makes toy trains and model railroad accessories. [ 43 ]  In 2008 Lionel emerged from bankruptcy and his shares of the company were wiped out. At this time his status with Lionel is unknown, according to Lionel CEO Jerry Calabrese he is still a consultant for Lionel. He was instrumental in the design of the Lionel Legacy control system for model trains [ 43 ]  and it is believed he will continue to develop the system. Young has been named as co-inventor on seven U.S. Patents related to model trains. [ 44 ]   Young has twice received honorary doctorates. He received an Honorary Doctorate of Music from  Lakehead University  in  Thunder Bay ,  Ontario  in 1992, and an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from  San Francisco State University  in 2006. The latter honour was shared with his wife Pegi for their creation of the Bridge School.   In a ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"" list in the June 1996 issue of  Mojo  magazine , Young was ranked No. 9.   In 2003, Rolling Stone listed Young at #83 in its rankings of ""The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time,"" describing him as a ""restless experimenter...who transform[s] the most obvious music into something revelatory."" [ 45 ]   In 2000, Young was inducted into  Canada's Walk of Fame . [ 46 ]  He ranked No. 39 on  VH1 's 100 Greatest Artist of Hard Rock  that same year.   In 2001, Young was awarded the Spirit of Liberty award from the civil liberties group  People for the American Way .   In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked Neil Young [ 47 ]  #34 on their list of the  100 Greatest Artists of All Time . [ 48 ]   In 2006, Paste Magazine compiled a ""Greatest Living Songwriters"" list; Young was ranked No. 2 behind  Bob Dylan . (While Young and Dylan have occasionally played together in concert, they have never collaborated on a song together, or played on each others' records).   Jason Bond, an  East Carolina University  biologist, discovered a new species of trapdoor spider in 2007 and named it  Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi  after Young, his favorite singer (a previous similar case was the dinousar  Masiakasaurus knopfleri  named after the musician  Mark Knopfler  of  Dire Straits ). [ 49 ]   In 2008, Rolling Stone ranked Young at #37 in its list of ""The 100 Greatest Singers of All-Time. [ 50 ]   In 2009, He was nominated for a Grammy for Best Solo Rock Vocal performance.     [ edit ]   Instruments          Neil Young, 2008 in  Florence       Neil Young is a collector of second-hand guitars, but in recording and performing, he frequently uses just a few instruments. As explained by his longtime guitar technician  Larry Cragg  in the film  Neil Young: Heart of Gold , they include:     1953  Gibson Les Paul Goldtop Nicknamed "" Old Black "", this is Young's primary  electric guitar  and is featured on  Rust Never Sleeps  and most other albums. Old Black got its name from a purely amateur paintjob applied to the originally-gold body of the instrument, sometime before Neil acquired the guitar in the late 1960s. In 1972, a mini- humbucker  pickup from a  Gibson Firebird  guitar was installed into the lead/treble position, replacing a  P-90  as standard on Les Paul guitars from that era. This pickup, severely  microphonic , is considered a crucial component of Neil's sound. A  Bigsby vibrato tailpiece  was installed as early as 1969 on the guitar, and can be heard clearly during the opening of ""Cowgirl in the Sand"" from  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere . This guitar also features a mini-switch that is used to send the signal from the mini-humbucker direct to the amp, without going through the volume or tone controls. A Les Paul Gold Top of the same year as Old Black was assembled by Neil's guitar tech, using same style Firebird pick up in the guitar as well as the same model Bigsby Vib; but, according to Young, was just not the same as the original. Young acquired Old Black from Jim Messina, swapping one of his Gretsches for it in 1969 while Messina was assisting Young on his first solo album. Messina, who played briefly in Buffalo Springfield and produced the band's final album, ""Last Time Around,"" still has the Gretch in his possession.       Martin D-45 His primary  steel-string acoustic guitar ; used to write ""Old Man"" and many other hit songs.   Martin D-28Nicknamed ""Hank"" after its previous owner,  Hank Williams . The guitar came into Young's possession after  Hank Williams, Jr.  had traded it to another owner for some shotguns and it went through a succession of other owners until it was located by Young's longtime friend Grant Boatwright. The guitar was purchased by Young from  Tut Taylor . Young has toured with it for over 30 years. A story about the guitar and inspired song known as ""This Old Guitar"" can be seen about 50 minutes into the film  Neil Young: Heart of Gold . It is Young's primary guitar for the album,  Prairie Wind .   Neil Young can be seen playing a Vagabond Travel Guitar as he sings ""Let's Impeach the President"" on  The Colbert Report  on  Comedy Central .   A 12-string Taylor 855 is used in the first half of the soundtrack and concert film ""Rust Never Sleeps""   1927  Gibson  MastertoneA six-string  banjo , tuned like a guitar. It has been used on many recordings and was played by  James Taylor  on ""Old Man"".   Various vintage  Fender Tweed Deluxe  amplifiers Young's preferred amplifier for electric guitar is the diminutive Fender Deluxe, specifically a Tweed-era model from 1959. Neil purchased his first vintage Deluxe in 1967 for $50 from the drummer of Crazy Horse, Ralph Molina, and has since acquired nearly 450 different examples, all from the same era, but he maintains that it's the original model that sounds superior, and is a crucial component to his trademark sound. The Tweed Deluxe is almost always used in conjunction with a late-1950's Magnatone 280 (similar to the amp used by Lonnie Mack and Buddy Holly). The Magnatone and the Deluxe are paired together in a somewhat unique manner - the external speaker jack from the Deluxe sends the amped signal through a volume potentiometer and directly into the input of the Magnatone. The Magnatone is notable for its true pitch-bending vibrato capabilities, which can be heard as an electric piano amplifier on ""See the Sky About to Rain"". A notable and unique accessory to Young's Deluxe is the Whizzer, a device created specifically for Young, which physically changes the amplifier's settings to pre-set combinations. It has gone through many incarnations.   Gretsch 6120  (Chet Atkins)Before Young bought Old Black, this was his primary electric guitar used during his  Buffalo Springfield  days.   Gretsch White Falcon   Late '50s hollow body that Young purchased near the end of the  Buffalo Springfield  era; in 1969 Young acquired a stereo version of the same vintage guitar from Stills, and this instrument is featured prominently during Young's early '70s period, and can be heard on tracks like ""Ohio,"" ""Southern Man,"" ""Alabama,"" ""L.A.,"" others. It is Neil's primary electric guitar during the  Harvest  era. This particular White Falcon is the stereo 6137, in which the signal from the three bass strings is separated from the signal from the three treble strings. Young typically plays this guitar in this stereo mode, sending the separate signals to two different amps: the Fender Deluxe and typically to either a Fender Tremolux or a low-powered Tweed Fender Twin. The separation of the signals is most prominently heard on the Harvest album song ""Words"".   Neil Young replaced his trademark Les Paul for a Gibson Flying V on the ""Time Fades Away"" tour.   Neil Young played a  Fender Broadcaster  on the Tonight's the Night tour and album.

Young's work is characterized by deeply personal lyrics, distinctive guitar work, and signature falsetto  tenor  singing voice. Although he accompanies himself on several different instrumentsincluding  piano  and  harmonica his claw-hammer  acoustic guitar  style and often idiosyncratic electric guitar soloing are the linchpins of a sometimes ragged, sometimes polished sound. Although Young has experimented widely with differing music styles, including  swing ,  jazz ,  rockabilly ,  blues , and  electronic music  throughout a varied career, his best known work usually falls into either of two distinct styles:  folk -esque  acoustic   rock  ("" Heart of Gold "", ""Harvest Moon"" and "" Old Man "") and  electric -charged  hard rock  (like "" Cinnamon Girl "", "" Rockin' in the Free World "" and "" Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black) ""). In recent years, Young has adopted elements from newer styles like  industrial ,  alternative country  and  grunge . Young's profound influence on the latter caused some to dub him ""the godfather of grunge"".   Young has directed (or co-directed) a number of  films  using the  pseudonym  Bernard Shakey, including  Journey Through the Past  (1973),  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979),  Human Highway  (1982),  Greendale  (2003), and  CSNY Dj Vu  (2008). He is currently working on a documentary about electric car technology, tentatively titled  Linc/Volt . The project involves a 1959  Lincoln Continental  converted to hybrid technology, which Young plans to drive to  Washington, DC  as an example to lawmakers there. [ 2 ]   He is also an outspoken advocate for environmental issues and small farmers, having co-founded in 1985 the  benefit concert   Farm Aid , and in 1986 helped found The Bridge School, [ 3 ]  and its annual supporting  Bridge School Benefit  concerts, together with his wife Pegi (in this, Young's involvement stems at least partially from the fact that both of his sons have  cerebral palsy  and his daughter, like Young himself, has  epilepsy ).   Although Young sings as frequently about U.S. legends and myths ( Pocahontas ,  space stations , and the settlement of the American West) [ 4 ]  as he does about his native country, he remains a Canadian citizen and has never wanted to relinquish his Canadian citizenship. He has lived in the U.S. for ""so long"" and has stated he has ""got just as much right to vote in them (American elections) as anybody else.""

He spent his early years in the small country town of  Omemee , 130  kilometres  (81  mi ) northeast of Toronto.   Young was diagnosed with diabetes as a child [ 6 ]  and a bout of  polio  at the age of 6 left him with a weakened left side; he still walks with a slight limp.   His parents divorced when Young was 12, and he moved with his mother back to the family home of  Winnipeg , Manitoba, where the formative years of his music career began. Neil and his mother Rassy settled into the working class suburb of  Fort Rouge  where the shy, dry-humoured youth enrolled at Earl Grey Junior High School. It was there that he formed his first band  the Jades , and met  Ken Koblun , later to join him in the Squires.   While attending  Kelvin High School  in Winnipeg, he played in several instrumental rock bands. Young's first stable band was called the Squires, who had a local hit called ""The Sultan"". Young dropped out of high school [ 7 ]  and also played in  Fort William , where they recorded a series of demos produced by a local producer named Ray Dee, whom Young called ""the original Briggs."" [ 8 ]  While in Thunder Bay, Young first encountered  Stephen Stills . In the  2006  film  Heart of Gold  Young relates how he used to spend time as a teenager at  Falcon Lake, Manitoba  where he would endlessly plug coins into the jukebox to hear  Ian Tyson 's "" Four Strong Winds "". Neil also formed a friendship with musician  Randy Bachman .   After leaving the Squires, Neil worked folk clubs in Winnipeg, where he first met  Joni Mitchell . [ 9 ]  Here he wrote some of his earliest and most enduring folk songs such as the classic "" Sugar Mountain "", about his lost youth. Mitchell wrote ""The Circle Game"" in response. [ citation needed ]   In 1965 Young toured Canada as a solo artist. In 1966, he joined the  Rick James -fronted  Mynah Birds . The band managed to secure a record deal with the  Motown  label, but as their first album was being recorded, James was arrested for being  AWOL  from the army. [ 10 ]  After the Mynah Birds disbanded, Young and bass player  Bruce Palmer  relocated to  Los Angeles . Young has admitted in an interview that he was in the United States illegally until receiving a green card in 1970. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Buffalo Springfield   Once they reached Los Angeles, Young and Palmer met up with  Stephen Stills ,  Richie Furay , and  Dewey Martin  to form  Buffalo Springfield . A mixture of folk, country,  psychedelia , and rock lent a hard edge by the twin lead guitars of Stills and Young made Buffalo Springfield a critical success, and their first record  Buffalo Springfield  (1967) sold well after Stills' topical song "" For What It's Worth "" became a hit, aided by Young's melodic harmonics played on electric guitar.   Distrust of their management, as well as the arrest and deportation of Palmer, exacerbated the already strained relations among the group members and led to Buffalo Springfield's demise. A second album,  Buffalo Springfield Again , was released in late 1967, but two of Youngs three contributions were solo tracks recorded apart from the rest of the group.   In many ways, these three songs on  Buffalo Springfield Again  are harbingers of much of Young's later work in that, although they all share deeply personal, almost idiosyncratic lyrics, they also present three very different musical approaches to the arrangement of what is essentially an original folk song. ""Mr Soul"" is the only Young song of the three that all five members of the group perform together. In contrast, "" Broken Arrow "" was confessional folk rock of a kind that would characterize much of the music that emerged from the singer-songwriter movement. Youngs experimental production intersperses each verse with snippets of sound from other sources, including opening the song with a sound bite of Dewey Martin singing ""Mr. Soul"" and closing it with the thumping of a heartbeat. ""Expecting to Fly"" was a lushly produced  ballad  featuring a string arrangement that Young's co-producer for the track,  Jack Nitzsche , would dub ""symphonic pop.""   In May 1968, the band split up for good, but in order to fulfill a contractual obligation, a final album,  Last Time Around , was recorded, primarily from recordings made earlier that year. Young contributed the songs ""On the Way Home"" and ""I Am a Child"", singing lead on the latter. In 1997, the band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame; Young did not appear at the ceremony.     [ edit ]   Solo success & CSNY   After the breakup of Buffalo Springfield, Young signed a solo deal with  Reprise Records , home of his colleague and friend  Joni Mitchell , with whom he shared a manager, Elliot Roberts, who manages Young to this day. Young and Nitzsche immediately began work on Young's first solo record,  Neil Young  (November 1968), which received mixed reviews. In a 1970 interview, [ 12 ]  Young deprecated the album as being ""overdubbed rather than played,"" and the quest for music that expresses the spontaneity of the moment has long been a feature of his career. Nevertheless, the album contains some tunes that remain a staple of his live shows, most notably ""The Loner.""   For his next album, Young recruited three musicians from a band called The Rockets:  Danny Whitten  on guitar,  Billy Talbot  on bass guitar, and  Ralph Molina  on  drums . These three took the name  Crazy Horse  (after  the historical figure of the same name ), and  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere  (May 1969), is credited to ""Neil Young with Crazy Horse."" Recorded in just two weeks, the album opens with one of Young's most familiar songs, ""Cinnamon Girl,"" and is dominated by two more, ""Cowgirl in the Sand"" and ""Down by the River,"" that feature lengthy jams showcasing Young's idiosyncratic guitar soloing accompanied sympathetically by Crazy Horse. Young reportedly wrote all three songs on the same day, while nursing a high fever of 103 F (39.5 C) in bed.   Shortly after the release of  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere , Young reunited with Stephen Stills by joining  Crosby, Stills, & Nash , who had already released one album as a trio. Young was originally offered a position as a sideman, but agreed to join only if he received full membership, and the group - winners of the 1969 ""Best New Artist"" Grammy - was renamed Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. [ 13 ]  The quartet debuted in  Chicago  on  August 16 ,  1969 , and later performed at the famous  Woodstock Festival , during which Young skipped the acoustic set and refused to be filmed during the electric set, even telling the cameramen: ""One of you fuckin' guys comes near me and I'm gonna fuckin' hit you with my guitar"". [ 14 ]  During the making of their first album,  Dj Vu , the musicians frequently argued, particularly Young and Stills, who both fought for control. [ 15 ]   "" Ohio "" was written following the  Kent State massacre  on  May 4 ,  1970 , and was a staple of anti-war rallies in the 1970s. The song was quickly recorded by CSNY and immediately released as a single, even though CSNY's ""Teach Your Children"" was still climbing the singles charts. Many believe that the release of ""Ohio"" as a single cut into the sales of ""Teach Your Children"" and prevented that song from reaching the top ten. In the late 1970s and for much of the 1980s, Young refrained from performing ""Ohio"" live, as he considered the song to be dated. In the wake of the 1989  Tiananmen Square massacre , however, Young revived the song in concert, often dedicating it to the  Chinese  students who were killed in the massacre. Crosby, Stills & Nash, as a trio, also returned the song to their live repertoire around the same time, even though Young had provided the lead vocals on the original recording.   Also that year, Young released his third solo album,  After the Gold Rush  (1970), which featured, among others, a young  Nils Lofgren ,  Stephen Stills , and CSNY bassist Greg Reeves. Young also recorded some tracks with Crazy Horse, but dismissed them early in the sessions. Aided by his newfound fame with CSNY, the album was a commercial breakthrough for Young and contains some of his best known work. Notable tracks include the title track, with dream-like lyrics that run a gamut of subjects from drugs and interpersonal relationships to environmental concerns, as well as Youngs controversial and acerbic condemnation of  racism  in "" Southern Man ,"" which, along with a later song entitled ""Alabama,"" later prompted  Lynyrd Skynyrd  to decry Young by name in the lyrics to "" Sweet Home Alabama ."" Young was one of Skynyrd's biggest influences, and Young was an admirer of Skynyrd's music. The respectful rivalry and friendship between Young and Skynyrd front man  Ronnie Van Zant  would serve as a recurring theme in the  Drive-By Truckers ' 2001  concept album   Southern Rock Opera .   With CSNY splitting up and Crazy Horse having signed their own record deal, Young began the year 1971 with a solo tour entitled ""Journey Through the Past."" Later, he recruited a new group of country-music session musicians, whom he christened  The Stray Gators , to record much of the new material that had been premiered on tour for the album  Harvest  (1972).  Harvest  was a massive hit (especially with the country-music crowd) and ""Heart of Gold"" became a US number one single; incidentally, to this day it remains the only No. 1 hit in his long career.   Another notable song was "" The Needle and the Damage Done ,"" a somber lament on the pain caused by heroin addiction; inspired in part by the heavy heroin use of Crazy Horse member Danny Whitten, who would eventually die of an overdose. [ 16 ]   The album's success, however, caught Young off guard, and his first instinct was to back away from stardom. In the handwritten liner notes to the  Decade  compilation, Young described ""Heart of Gold"" as the song that ""put me in the middle of the road. Traveling there soon became a bore, so I headed for the ditch. A rougher ride but I saw more interesting people there.""   On  September 8 ,  1972 , the Academy Award-nominated actress  Carrie Snodgress , with whom he had been living, gave birth to Neil Young's first child. The boy, Zeke, was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Young fell in love with Snodgress after seeing her in a movie (""Diary of a Mad Housewife"") on television after which Young wrote the song "" A Man Needs a Maid "" from the Harvest album, featuring the lyric ""I fell in love with the actress/she was playing a part that I could understand.""     [ edit ]   The Ditch Trilogy   Although a new tour had been planned to follow up on the success of  Harvest , it became apparent during rehearsals that Danny Whitten could not function due to  drug abuse . On  November 18 , 1972, shortly after he was fired from the tour preparations, Whitten was found dead of an  overdose . Young described the incident to  Rolling Stone s  Cameron Crowe  in 1975:  [ 17 ]  ""[We] were rehearsing with him and he just couldn't cut it. He couldn't remember anything. He was too out of it. Too far gone. I had to tell him to go back to L.A. 'It's not happening, man. You're not together enough.' He just said, 'I've got nowhere else to go, man. How am I gonna tell my friends?' And he split. That night the coroner called me from L.A. and told me he'd ODed. That blew my mind. Fucking blew my mind. I loved Danny. I felt responsible. And from there, I had to go right out on this huge tour of huge arenas. I was very nervous and  insecure.""   The album made in the aftermath of this incident,  Time Fades Away  (1973), has often been described by Young as ""my least favourite record,"" and it is, in fact, one of only two of Youngs early recordings that has yet to be officially re-released on CD (the other being the soundtrack album  Journey Through the Past ). The album was recorded live over a tour where Young struggled with his voice and called  David Crosby  and  Graham Nash  to help perform the music. The tour featured  Linda Ronstadt  as the opening act.  Time Fades Away  occupies a unique position in Youngs discography as the first of three albums known collectively as the "" Ditch Trilogy .""   In the second half of 1973, Young formed The Santa Monica Flyers, with Crazy Horse's rhythm section augmented by Nils Lofgren on guitar. Deeply affected by the drug-induced deaths of Whitten and  roadie   Bruce Berry , Young recorded  Tonight's the Night . The album's dark tone and rawness caused Reprise to delay the release until two years later and only after being pressured by Young to do so. [ 18 ]  It received mixed reviews at the time, but is now regarded as a landmark album, thought by some to be a precursor to  punk rock . In Young's own opinion, it was the closest he ever came to art. [ 19 ]   While his record company delayed the release of  Tonight's the Night,  Young recorded  On the Beach  (1974), which dealt with themes such as the downside of fame and the Californian lifestyle. Like  Time Fades Away  and  Tonight's the Night , it sold poorly but eventually became a critical favourite, presenting some of Young's most original work. In a review of the 2003 re-release on CD of  On the Beach  Derek Svennungsen described the music as ""mesmerizing, harrowing, lucid, and bleary,"" [ 20 ] .     [ edit ]   Return to prominence   After completing  On the Beach , Young reunited with  Harvest  producer Elliot Mazer to record another acoustic album,  Homegrown . Most of the songs were written after Young's breakup with Snodgress, and thus the tone of the album was somewhat dark. Though the album was entirely completed, Young decided to drop the album and release  Tonight's the Night  instead, at the suggestion of  The Band  bassist  Rick Danko . [ 21 ]  Young further explained his move by saying: ""It was a little too personal... it scared me"". [ 22 ]          Neil Young in Austin, Texas on November 9, 1976       Young reformed Crazy Horse with  Frank Sampedro  on guitar as his backup band for  Zuma  (1975). Many of the songs are overtly concerned with failed relationships, and even the epic "" Cortez the Killer ,"" outwardly a retelling of the  Spanish conquest  of  Mexico  from the viewpoint of the  Aztecs , can be seen as an allegory of love lostsomething that didnt save it, however, from being banned in  Franco 's  Spain .   The following year, Young reunited with Stephen Stills for the album  Long May You Run  (1976), credited to  The Stills-Young Band ; the follow-up tour was ended midway through by Young, who sent Stills a  telegram  that read: ""Funny how some things that start spontaneously end that way. Eat a peach, Neil."" [ 23 ]   In 1976, Young performed with  The Band , Joni Mitchell, and other rock musicians in the high profile all-star concert  The Last Waltz . The release of  Martin Scorsese 's movie of the concert was delayed while Scorsese unwillingly re-edited it to obscure the lump of cocaine that was clearly visible hanging from Young's nose during his performance of  ""Helpless."" [ 24 ]  Young later said, ""I'm not proud of that,"" according to one of his biographers.   American Stars 'N Bars  (1977) contained two songs originally recorded for  Homegrown  album, ""Homegrown"" and ""Star of Bethelehem,"" as well as newer material, including the future concert staple "" Like A Hurricane "". Performers included  Linda Ronstadt ,  Emmylou Harris  and Young protg  Nicolette Larson  along with Crazy Horse. Also in 1977, Young released  Decade : a personally selected career summary of material spanning every aspect of his various interests and affiliations, including a handful of unreleased songs.  Comes a Time  (1978) also featured Nicolette Larson and Crazy Horse and became Young's most commercially accessible album in quite some time, marked by a return to his folk roots.   Young next set out on the lengthy ""Rust Never Sleeps"" tour, in which each concert was divided into a solo acoustic set and an electric set with Crazy Horse. Much of the electric set was later seen as a response to punk rock's burgeoning popularity. ""Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)"" compared the changing public perception of  Johnny Rotten  with that of the recently deceased  Elvis Presley , who himself had once been disparaged as a dangerous influence only to later become an  icon . Rotten, meanwhile, returned the favour by playing one of Young's records on a  London  radio show. The accompanying albums  Rust Never Sleeps  (new material, culled from live recordings, but featuring studio overdubs) and  Live Rust  (a mixture of old and new, and a genuine concert recording) captured the two sides of the concerts, with solo acoustic songs on side A, and fierce, uptempo, electric songs on side B. A movie version of the concerts, also called  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979), was directed by Young under the pseudonym Bernard Shakey.   Young was suddenly hip again, and the readers and critics of  Rolling Stone  voted him Artist Of The Year for 1979 (along with The Who), selected  Rust Never Sleeps  as Album Of The Year, and voted him Male Vocalist Of The Year as well.  The Village Voice , meanwhile, honored Young as the Artist of the Decade.     [ edit ]   1980s - Experimental years   The 1980s were a lean time for Young both critically and commercially. After providing the incidental music to a  biopic  of  Hunter S. Thompson  entitled  Where the Buffalo Roam , he recorded  Hawks & Doves  (1980), a folk/country record.  Re-ac-tor  (1981), once again with Crazy Horse, was a faade of distortion and feedback obscuring a relatively weak selection of songs, but his strangest record of the decade came with  Trans  (1982). Recorded partially with  vocoders ,  synthesizers , and other devices that modified instruments and vocals with electronic effects, it is sometimes considered an experiment related to finding a technology that would become a means to communicate for Youngs son (with his wife Pegi), Ben, who has severe  cerebral palsy  and cannot speak. Many fans were baffled by the radical forms of this album and  rockabilly -styled  Everybody's Rockin'  (1983), and record company head  David Geffen  even sued Young for making ""unrepresentative"" musici.e. music that did not sound like Neil Youngthat deliberately lacked commercial appeal. [ 25 ]  Young later stated that he would have preferred to release the songs featuring the  synclavier  and  vocoder  as an EP, and that their inclusion with the Hawaiian-themed rockabilly was a mistake. Also premiered at this time though little seen was an eclectic full-length comedy film  Human Highway  starring, co-directed and co-written by Young.   In 1983, Young worked with British video director  Tim Pope , making two videos - ""Wonderin'"" and ""Cry, Cry, Cry.""   In 1985, he reunited with Crosby, Stills and Nash at  Live Aid  at Philadelphia's  John F. Kennedy Stadium . The two songs that they played, ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"" and "" Daylight Again /Find The Cost of Freedom,"" were the first songs they had played as a quartet in front of a paying audience since 1974.   Old Ways  (1985) saw a return to country music, recorded with a group of friends and session musicians.  Landing on Water  (1986) is entertaining for the blending of synthesizers and other instruments related to the 1980s into Youngs own style, with lyrics that take pot shots at some favourite targets, including CSN in ""Hippie Dream,"" with a chorus that goes: ""But the wooden ships/Were just a hippie dream,"" and David Geffen in ""Drifter,"" with the line: ""Dont try to tell me what I gotta do to fit."" The resumption of his partnership with Crazy Horse on  Life  (1987) fulfilled his contract with Geffen, and Young was finally able to switch labels.   Director Pope again made a series of videos from the album, including ""Touch the Night"" and ""People on the Street"".   Signing with  Warner Brothers  (which distributed Geffen at the time) and returning to Reprise Records, Young produced  This Note's For You  (1988) with a new band, The Bluenotes, whose name rights were owned by musician  Harold Melvin . Young named his band after a cafe called the Blue Note on Main Street in Winnipeg Manitoba, where he had played. The addition of a  brass  section provided a new  jazzier  sound and the title track became his first hit single of the decade. Accompanied by a video which parodied corporate rock, the pretensions of advertising and  Michael Jackson  in particular, the song was initially banned by  MTV  (although the Canadian music channel,  MuchMusic  ran it immediately) before being put into heavy rotation and finally given the  MTV Video Music Award for Best Video of the Year  for 1989. After Melvin sued over the use of the Bluenotes name, Young renamed his back-up group ""Ten Men Workin'"" for the balance of the concert tour.   Young also contributed to that year's CSNY reunion  American Dream  (1988) and CSNY played a few benefit concerts. Young, however, refused to book a full tour with CSN and the foursome would not embark upon a nationwide tour until 2000.     [ edit ]   1990s - Return to country-rock roots   Freedom  was a mixture of acoustic and electric rock dealing with the state of the U.S. and the world in 1989, alongside a set of love songs and a version of the standard ""On Broadway."" "" Rockin' in the Free World "", two versions of which bookended the album, again caught the mood. Some say it became a  de facto  anthem during the fall of the  Berlin Wall , a few months after the record's release. However, most Germans don't remember the song being related to the unification, understandably so, since the lyrics are not about political repression. Like  Bruce Springsteen 's "" Born in the U.S.A. "", the anthemic use of this song was based on largely ignoring the verses, which evoke social problems and implicitly criticize American government policies. In mid-1989, record executive  Terry Tolkin  conceived and produced a tribute album to Young's songs called  The Bridge: A Tribute To Neil Young,  released on his  No.6 Records  label. It featured cover versions of 15 of Young's songs by the cream of the up and coming  Alternative Music  and  Grunge music  bands including  Sonic Youth ,  Nick Cave ,  Soul Asylum ,  Dinosaur Jr ,and  The Pixies . By 1990,  grunge music  was beginning to make its first inroads in the charts and many of its prime movers, including  Nirvana 's  Kurt Cobain  and  Pearl Jam 's  Eddie Vedder , cited Young as a major influence.   Using a barn on his  Northern California  ranch as a studio, he rapidly recorded  Ragged Glory  with Crazy Horse, whose guitar riffs and feedback driven sound showed his new admirers that he could still cut it. Young then headed back out on the road with Orange Country country-punk band  Social Distortion  and  alternative rock  elder statesmen  Sonic Youth  as support, much to the consternation of many of his old fans. [ 26 ] [ 27 ]  Yet the influence of Sonic Youth could be clearly heard on the accompanying home video and live album,  Weld , which also included a bonus CD entitled  Arc , a single 35-minute-long collage of  feedback  and guitar noise that Neil included, evidently at the suggestion of Sonic Youth's  Thurston Moore . [ 28 ]   Arc  was later sold separately.   Young's next move was another return to country music.  Harvest Moon  (1992) was the long-awaited sequel to  Harvest  and reunited him with some of the musicians from that session, as well as singers  Linda Ronstadt  and  James Taylor . The title track was a minor hit and the record was reviewed and sold equally well, containing songs such as ""From Hank to  Hendrix "" and ""Unknown Legend"", a tribute to his wife. His resurgent popularity saw him booked on  MTV Unplugged  in 1993. In 1992 he accompanied fellow  Winnipegger   Randy Bachman  on ""Prairie Town,"" a song that recounts their days in the Winnipeg music scene of the 1960s. That year, he contributed music to the  soundtrack  of the  Jonathan Demme  movie  Philadelphia , and his song ""Philadelphia"" was nominated for the  Academy Award for Best Song , losing out to Bruce Springsteen's contribution to the same film. A summer tour covering both Europe and North America with  Booker T. and the MGs  (with whom he played two songs at a 1992  Bob Dylan  tribute concert at  Madison Square Garden ) was widely praised as a triumph. On a few of these dates, the show ended with a rendition of ""Rockin' in the Free World"" played with  Pearl Jam .   Young was back with Crazy Horse for 1994's  Sleeps with Angels , a much darker record. The title track told the story of  Kurt Cobain 's death; Young had reportedly made repeated attempts to contact Cobain prior to this event. [ 29 ]  Cobain had quoted Young's ""It's better to burn out than fade away"" (a line from "" My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue) "") in his alleged  suicide note , causing Young to emphasize the line ""'cause once you're gone you can't come back"" in live performances at the time. Other songs dealt with drive-by shootings (""Driveby""),  environmentalism  (""Piece of Crap"") and Young's own vision of America (the archetypal car metaphor of ""Trans Am""). Young was inspired to make the record after viewing Cobain's performance on  MTV Unplugged . Still admired by the prime movers of grunge, Young eventually performed with Pearl Jam at the MTV Music Awards during what was described as the highlight of a lackluster show. [ 30 ]  Their collaboration led to a joint tour, with the band and producer  Brendan O'Brien  backing Young. The accompanying album,  Mirror Ball  (1995), recorded as live in the studio captured their loose rock sound, and featured the standout track ""I'm the Ocean"". The year of 1995 also featured Young's entry into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .   After composing an abstract, distorted feedback-led guitar instrumental soundtrack to  Jim Jarmusch 's  acid western  film  Dead Man  Young recorded a series of loose jams with Crazy Horse that eventually appeared as the critically denigrated  Broken Arrow . The return to Crazy Horse was prompted by the death of mentor, friend, and longtime  producer   David Briggs  in late 1995. The subsequent tours of Europe and North America in 1996 resulted in both a live album and a tour documentary directed by  Jim Jarmusch . Both releases took the name  Year of the Horse .   In 1997, Young participated in the  H.O.R.D.E. Festival 's sixth annual tour.   In 1998, Young shared the stage with the rock band  Phish  at the annual  Farm Aid  concert, and later offered them an opportunity to headline both nights of the Bridge School Benefit concert. Phish took Young up on his offer to headline the Bridge School Benefit (where Young joined Phish for renditions of ""Helpless"" and ""I Shall Be Released."" [ 31 ]  Phish, however, declined Young's later invitation to be his backing band on a 1999 tour. [ 32 ]   The decade ended with  Looking Forward , another reunion with Crosby, Stills and Nash. The subsequent tour of the United States and Canada with the reformed super quartet was a huge success and brought in earnings of $42.1 million, making it the eighth largest grossing tour of 2000.   Young's next album,  Silver & Gold  (2000), contained a number of understated songs with personal lyrics, which was promoted through a mini-tour of solo acoustic shows. This style was continued in  Are You Passionate?  (2002), an album of love songs dedicated to his wife, Pegi.     [ edit ]   In the aftermath of 9/11   Young's 2001 single "" Let's Roll "", was a tribute to the victims of the  September 11, 2001 attacks , and the passengers and crew on  Flight 93  in particular. At the "" America: A Tribute to Heroes "" concert he performed  John Lennon's  "" Imagine "". In 2002,  Q  magazine  named Neil Young in their list of the ""50 Bands To See Before You Die.""   Young hauled out his concept album  Greendale , about an extended family in a small town called Greendale, and how they are torn apart by a murder, in 2003.  Greendale  was recorded with Crazy Horse members Billy Talbot and Ralph Molina. This tale of the Green family also resulted in a movie called  Greendale , written and directed by Young (again using his ""Bernard Shakey"" pseudonym) and starring a few of his friends, who act out and  lip sync  the songs from the album. The film was indeed thoroughly experimental, from Young's rambling on-stage between-song narratives, to his reading apparent transcriptions of these ramblings in the liner notes. ""When I was writing this I had no idea what I was doing, so I was just as surprised as you are,"" Young said later. Young toured extensively with the  Greendale  material throughout 2003 and 2004, first with a solo, acoustic version in Europe, then with a full-cast stage show in North America,  Japan , and  Australia . While audience reaction was sometimes mixed (drunken requests for ""Southern Man"" being an aesthetic impediment at most Young performances), the live stage version of Greendale was for many critics the most satisfying incarnation of the material, and bootlegs of the shows have been widely traded. The second half of each concert consisted of high-decibel renditions of Young classics such as ""Hey Hey, My My,"" ""Cinnamon Girl,"" ""Powderfinger,"" and  Rockin' in the Free World , as well as rarities such as ""The Losing End,"" ""The Old Country Waltz,"" and ""Danger Bird.""   Young spent the latter portion of 2004 giving a series of intimate acoustic concerts in various cities with his wife, Pegi, who is a trained vocalist and guitar player.     [ edit ]   Recent events          From left, Emmylou Harris, Neil Young and Pegi Young perform in  Neil Young: Heart of Gold , which offered renditions of some of Young's best-known songs.       On  March 31 ,  2005 , Young was admitted to a hospital in New York for treatment for a brain  aneurysm . He was treated successfully by a minimally invasive  neuroradiological  procedure. Prior to undergoing the procedure, he wrote the first eight songs of a new album,  Prairie Wind , in  Nashville , with session musicians that included regular Young sideman  Ben Keith  on lap and  pedal steel guitars . Two days after the procedure, Young was forced to cancel a scheduled appearance on the  Juno Awards  telecast in Winnipeg when the area where the surgeons did his procedure (via the  femoral artery ) suddenly began to bleed. While Young finally was able to return to Winnipeg in 2006 with Crosby, Stills and Nash, his first post-aneurysm performance was on  July 2 ,  2005 , at the close of the  Live 8  concert in  Barrie, Ontario . There, he debuted a new song, a soft hymn called ""When God Made Me.""   On  September 28 ,  2005 ,  Prairie Wind  was released. In an interview given to  Time  magazine , Young revealed that he had planned to keep the news of his aneurysm private until he had the bleeding scare, after which he decided to make news of his condition public. The last two songs on the album were written after his aneurysm procedure, and several of the songs, such as ""Fallin' Off the Face of the Earth,"" seem to be inspired by Young's brush with  mortality , the recent death of his father, who suffered from  senile dementia , and Young's  Manitoba  roots.   In 2006,  Neil Young: Heart of Gold , a film made by  Jonathan Demme , premiered at the  Sundance Film Festival . Filmed over two nights at the  Ryman Auditorium  in  Nashville, Tennessee  during the premiere of  Prairie Wind , it includes both new and old songs as well as behind-the scenes-commentary by Young, his wife Pegi, and members of Young's session band.   In April 2006, Young announced the release of  Living with War , an album of protest songs that included the provocatively-titled "" Let's Impeach the President ."" Recorded using his famous  Les Paul  electric guitar, "" Old Black ,"" along with Chad Cromwell (drums), Rick Rosas (bass), and Tommy Brea (trumpet), the album was intended to be a stinging rebuke of U.S. President  George W. Bush  and the  War in Iraq . The album was recorded in a two week period in April, and was then made available over the internet from 28 April 2006 before being released as a CD on 5 May.  Living With War  was Young's most talked about release for years, creating heated political debate and a return to form with perhaps his most critically-acclaimed album since the early 1990s.  Living With War: In the Beginning , a remixed version with the original album's choral backing vocals removed, was released in December of the same year. Its accompanying DVD featured videos directed by Young of every song on the album, footage of the  Iraq War  and demonstrations in the US, and clips from  Al Gore 's  An Inconvenient Truth .          Neil Young on the CSNY ""Freedom Of Speech Tour '06""       From July through September 2006, Neil Young reunited with his former bandmates from  Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young  for the ""Freedom Of Speech Tour '06"" across North America. Chad Cromwell and Rick Rosas made up the band's rhythm section. The entire  Living with War  album was performed on the tour, in addition to other CSN and Neil Young classics such as "" Ohio "" and "" Rockin' in the Free World ."" An accompanying concert film and live album, called  CSNY Deja Vu , were premiered on January 25, 2008, at the Sundance Movie Festival.   2006 also saw the first release from Young's long awaited  Archives  project, as  Live at the Fillmore East , a selection of songs drawn from a 1970 gig with  Crazy Horse , was released in November of that year. The release was marked as number two in the  Archives Performance Series , leaving room for the still-unreleased 1969  Riverboat  bootleg, which will be number one in the series. In March 2007, another historical live album, marked as the third in the  Performance Series , was released. Titled  Live at Massey Hall 1971 , it featured a solo acoustic set from Toronto's Massey Hall, including material from the upcoming  Harvest  album.   On  August 15 ,  2007 , Young played a new album for 100 people at Reprise Records entitled  Chrome Dreams II .  Chrome Dreams  was an album he scrapped in 1977, and the name of two different bootlegs. The new album includes two long songs that time in at 18:13 (""Ordinary People"") and 14:31 (""No Hidden Path""), respectively. The album consists of three songs written previously and seven new songs, all by Young. The album was released on October 23, 2007, timed to coincide with a seven-week tour that had kicked off in Boise, Idaho, ten days earlier.   On February 11, 2008, Neil Young started the European leg of his tour with a concert in  Antwerp ,  Belgium . On July 17, he was interviewed on  PBS  by  Charlie Rose , where he spoke about many things, including his project to make a hybrid 1959 Lincoln. [ 33 ]  In October, a BBC 4 documentary ""Neil Young - Don't be Denied"" was shown, featuring interviews with Neil and a number of his contemporaries. It also summarizes his biography and motivations. [ 34 ]   The latest album in the Performance Series,  Sugar Mountain - Live At Canterbury House 1968  was released on December 2, 2008. Featuring material from Young's earliest solo performances recorded in Ann Arbor, MI November 9, 1968, the album was released as number zero in the  Performance Series .   The first installment of Young's oft-delayed box set  The Archives Vol. 1 1963-1972  was officially announced in 2008 with a trailer.  [ 35 ]   [ 36 ]  The first set of Archives will feature both DVD and Blu-ray editions which will include 128 audio tracks (43 unreleased and 13 never before heard songs), thousands of images (photos, lyrics, letters and memorabilia), and hours of new, previously released and rare videos. Also included will be a 236 page hardbound book. The Blu-ray edition will have HD picture, pristine audio mastered and presented in 24bit 192 khz., and access to photos, trivia and memorabilia without stopping the music. It is currently scheduled for release in 2009.   A Spring 2009 date has been set for Neil's new album 'A Fork in The Road', which will delay the release of the Archives until later in 2009.   Young currently lives on a 1500-acre (6 km) ranch in  La Honda, California , called Broken Arrow. He also owns property in  Fort Lauderdale, Florida , and on the islands of  Hawaii .   Young headlined the 2009  Big Day Out  festival in  New Zealand  and  Australia . Young pushed other current mainstream bands to only secondary headlining, including  Arctic Monkeys  and  The Ting Tings . He will also headline the Friday at  Glastonbury Festival  which has attempted to book him for many years. Although not officially confirmed, a number of sources have suggested this. [ 37 ]     [ edit ]   Influence, importance and inspiration   Neil Young has undeniably been an important artist in the history of American and Canadian popular music and remains a distinct influence upon other recording artists.  Lynyrd Skynyrd s "" Sweet Home Alabama "" was written in response to two of Neil Youngs songs ""Southern Man"" and ""Alabama"". ""Ohio"" which Young recorded with Crosby, Stills and Nash, was a recollection of the tragic events that transpired at Kent State University in May 1970. Young's willingness to be politically outspoken and socially conscious allowed him to influence such important artists such as  Phish ,  Pearl Jam , and  Nirvana . Neil Young is referred to as ""the Godfather of  Grunge "" because of the influence he had on  Kurt Cobain  and  Eddie Vedder  and the entire grunge movement. Kurt Cobain quoted Neil Young in his suicide note, using the line Its better to burn out, than to fade away from Youngs song ""My My, Hey Hey (Out Of The Blue)"". Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam inducted Neil Young into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, citing him as a huge influence. He has also been a big influence on  experimental rock  acts like  Sonic Youth  and  Radiohead . Youngs influence, importance and inspiration within the music scene derive in part from his longevity because of a career spanning more than four decades. His first album was released in 1966 and his latest in 2008.  Bob Dylan 's influence on Young has been so obvious that the former once lambasted: "" Heart of Gold  bothered me every time it came on the radio ... and I'd say, 'Shit, that's me. If it sounds like me it might as well be me. (...) It seemed somebody else had taken my thing and had run away with it, you know, and I never got over it. Maybe tomorrow"" [ 38 ] . The Dutch guitar virtuoso  Jan Akkerman  described a typical electric guitar solo by Young as the sound of ""a Belgian  vibrator "" in a 1994 TV documentary, adding that it somehow became more palatable when one saw Young's grimace to accompany it  [ 39 ] .   The Australian rock group  Powderfinger  attribute their group name to their love of Young.   Toronto  based band  Constantines  recorded a version of Neil's  Fuckin' Up  in  Winnipeg , [ 40 ] which surfaced at the b-side the their ""Our Age"" 7"" [ 41 ] in November 2008. The members of the  Constantines  have occasionally played shows under the name Horsey Craze [ 42 ] , singing Neil Young songs. In early 2006, they released a vinyl only split-album with The Unintended. The Constantines recorded four Neil Young songs for the LP, while The Unintended performed four Gordon Lightfoot songs.   While in Winnipeg on November 2, 2008 during the Canadian leg of his tour,  Bob Dylan  visited the former home of Neil Young in River Heights. The home was where Neil spent some of his teenage years. Dylan was interested in seeing the room where some of Neils first songs were composed.     [ edit ]   Achievements   Young was inducted into the  Canadian Music Hall of Fame  in 1982. He has been inducted into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  twice: first in 1995 for his solo work, with an induction speech given by  Eddie Vedder , and again in 1997 as a member of Buffalo Springfield.   He has also directed five movies under his pseudonym Bernard Shakey, and released them through his own Shakey Pictures imprint:  Journey Through the Past  (1973),  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979)  Human Highway  (1982) (starring new wave band  Devo ), and  Greendale  (2003) and the documentary,  CSNY Deja Vu  (2008). The bonus  DVDs  included in both versions of  Greendale  and in  Prairie Wind  are also directed by Young under the Bernard Shakey alias, and all of Young's home video and DVD releases have been co-released under the Shakey Pictures imprint.   As one of the original founders of  Farm Aid , he remains an active member of the board of directors. For one weekend each October, in  Mountain View, California , he and his wife host the  Bridge School Concerts , which have been drawing international talent and sell-out crowds for nearly two decades with some of the biggest names in rock having performed at the event including  Bruce Springsteen ,  David Bowie ,  The Who ,  Red Hot Chili Peppers ,  Trent Reznor  of  Nine Inch Nails ,  Pearl Jam ,  Sonic Youth  and Sir  Paul McCartney . The concerts are a benefit for the  Bridge School , which develops and uses advanced technologies to aid in the instruction of children with disabilities. Young's involvement stems at least partially from the fact that both of his sons have  cerebral palsy  and his daughter, like Young himself, has  epilepsy .   Young was nominated for an  Oscar  in 1994 for his song ""Philadelphia"" from the film  Philadelphia  (Bruce Springsteen won the award for his song "" Streets of Philadelphia "" from the same film). In his acceptance speech, Springsteen said that ""the award really deserved to be shared by the other nominee's song."" That same night,  Tom Hanks  accepted the Oscar for Best Actor and gave credit for his inspiration to the song ""Philadelphia"".   He was part owner of  Lionel, LLC , a company that makes toy trains and model railroad accessories. [ 43 ]  In 2008 Lionel emerged from bankruptcy and his shares of the company were wiped out. At this time his status with Lionel is unknown, according to Lionel CEO Jerry Calabrese he is still a consultant for Lionel. He was instrumental in the design of the Lionel Legacy control system for model trains [ 43 ]  and it is believed he will continue to develop the system. Young has been named as co-inventor on seven U.S. Patents related to model trains. [ 44 ]   Young has twice received honorary doctorates. He received an Honorary Doctorate of Music from  Lakehead University  in  Thunder Bay ,  Ontario  in 1992, and an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from  San Francisco State University  in 2006. The latter honour was shared with his wife Pegi for their creation of the Bridge School.   In a ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"" list in the June 1996 issue of  Mojo  magazine , Young was ranked No. 9.   In 2003, Rolling Stone listed Young at #83 in its rankings of ""The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time,"" describing him as a ""restless experimenter...who transform[s] the most obvious music into something revelatory."" [ 45 ]   In 2000, Young was inducted into  Canada's Walk of Fame . [ 46 ]  He ranked No. 39 on  VH1 's 100 Greatest Artist of Hard Rock  that same year.   In 2001, Young was awarded the Spirit of Liberty award from the civil liberties group  People for the American Way .   In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked Neil Young [ 47 ]  #34 on their list of the  100 Greatest Artists of All Time . [ 48 ]   In 2006, Paste Magazine compiled a ""Greatest Living Songwriters"" list; Young was ranked No. 2 behind  Bob Dylan . (While Young and Dylan have occasionally played together in concert, they have never collaborated on a song together, or played on each others' records).   In 2008, Rolling Stone ranked Young at #37 in its list of ""The 100 Greatest Singers of All-Time. [ 49 ]   Jason Bond, an  East Carolina University  biologist, discovered a new species of trapdoor spider in 2007, and named it  Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi  after Young, his favorite singer. [ 50 ]     [ edit ]   Instruments          Neil Young, 2008 in  Florence       Neil Young is a collector of second-hand guitars, but in recording and performing, he frequently uses just a few instruments. As explained by his longtime guitar technician  Larry Cragg  in the film  Neil Young: Heart of Gold , they include:     1953  Gibson Les Paul Goldtop Nicknamed "" Old Black "", this is Young's primary  electric guitar  and is featured on  Rust Never Sleeps  and most other albums. Old Black got its name from a purely amateur paintjob applied to the originally-gold body of the instrument, sometime before Neil acquired the guitar in the late 1960s. In 1972, a mini- humbucker  pickup from a  Gibson Firebird  guitar was installed into the lead/treble position, replacing a  P-90  as standard on Les Paul guitars from that era. This pickup, severely  microphonic , is considered a crucial component of Neil's sound. A  Bigsby vibrato tailpiece  was installed as early as 1969 on the guitar, and can be heard clearly during the opening of ""Cowgirl in the Sand"" from  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere . This guitar also features a mini-switch that is used to send the signal from the mini-humbucker direct to the amp, without going through the volume or tone controls. A Les Paul Gold Top of the same year as Old Black was assembled by Neil's guitar tech, using same style Firebird pick up in the guitar as well as the same model Bigsby Vib; but, according to Young, was just not the same as the original. Young acquired Old Black from Jim Messina, swapping one of his Gretches for it in 1969 while Messina was assisting Young on his first solo album. Messina, who played briefly in Buffalo Springfield and produced the band's final album, ""Last Time Around,"" still has the Gretch in his possession.       Martin D-45 His primary  steel-string acoustic guitar ; used to write ""Old Man"" and many other hit songs.   Martin D-28Nicknamed ""Hank"" after its previous owner,  Hank Williams . The guitar came into Young's possession after  Hank Williams, Jr.  had traded it to another owner for some shotguns and it went through a succession of other owners until it was located by Young's longtime friend Grant Boatwright. The guitar was purchased by Young from  Tut Taylor . Young has toured with it for over 30 years. A story about the guitar and inspired song known as ""This Old Guitar"" can be seen about 50 minutes into the film  Neil Young: Heart of Gold . It is Young's primary guitar for the album,  Prairie Wind .   Neil Young can be seen playing a Vagabond Travel Guitar as he sings ""Let's Impeach the President"" on  The Colbert Report  on  Comedy Central .   A 12-string Taylor 855 is used in the first half of the soundtrack and concert film ""Rust Never Sleeps""   1927  Gibson  MastertoneA six-string  banjo , tuned like a guitar. It has been used on many recordings and was played by  James Taylor  on ""Old Man"".   Various vintage  Fender Tweed Deluxe  amplifiers Young's preferred amplifier for electric guitar is the diminutive Fender Deluxe, specifically a Tweed-era model from 1959. Neil purchased his first vintage Deluxe in 1967 for $50 from the drummer of Crazy Horse, Ralph Molina, and has since acquired nearly 450 different examples, all from the same era, but he maintains that it's the original model that sounds superior, and is a crucial component to his trademark sound. The Tweed Deluxe is almost always used in conjunction with a late-1950's Magnatone 280 (similar to the amp used by Lonnie Mack and Buddy Holly). The Magnatone and the Deluxe are paired together in a somewhat unique manner - the external speaker jack from the Deluxe sends the amped signal through a volume potentiometr and directly into the input of the Magnatone. The Magnatone is notable for its true pitch-bending vibrato capabilities, which can be heard as an electric piano amplifier on ""See the Sky About to Rain"". A notable and unique accessory to Young's Deluxe is the Whizzer, a device created specifically for Young, which physically changes the amplifier's settings to pre-set combinations. It has gone through many incarnations.   Gretsch 6120  (Chet Atkins)Before Young bought Old Black, this was his primary electric guitar used during his  Buffalo Springfield  days.   Gretsch White Falcon   Late '50s hollow body that Young purchased near the end of the  Buffalo Springfield  era; in 1969 Young acquired a stereo version of the same vintage guitar from Stills, and this instrument is featured prominently during Young's early '70s period, and can be heard on tracks like ""Ohio,"" ""Southern Man,"" ""Alabama,"" ""L.A.,"" others. It is Neil's primary electric guitar during the  Harvest  era. This particular White Falcon is the stereo 6137, in which the signal from the three bass strings is separated from the signal from the three treble strings. Young typically plays this guitar in this stereo mode, sending the separate signals to two different amps: the Fender Deluxe and typcially to either a Fender Tremolux or a low-powered Tweed Fender Twin. The separation of the signals is most prominantly heard on the Harvest album song ""Words"".   Neil Young replaced his trademark Les Paul for a Gibson Flying V on the ""Time Fades Away"" tour.   Neil Young played a  Fender Broadcaster  on the Tonight's the Night tour and album.

Young's work is characterized by deeply personal lyrics, distinctive guitar work, and signature falsetto  tenor  singing voice. Although he accompanies himself on several different instrumentsincluding  piano  and  harmonica his claw-hammer  acoustic guitar  style and often idiosyncratic electric guitar soloing are the linchpins of a sometimes ragged, sometimes polished sound. Although Young has experimented widely with differing music styles, including  swing ,  jazz ,  rockabilly ,  blues , and  electronic music  throughout a varied career, his best known work usually falls into either of two distinct styles:  folk -esque  acoustic   rock  ("" Heart of Gold "", ""Harvest Moon"" and "" Old Man "") and  electric -charged  hard rock  (like "" Cinnamon Girl "", "" Rockin' in the Free World "" and "" Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black) ""). In recent years, Young has adopted elements from newer styles like  industrial ,  alternative country  and  grunge . Young's profound influence on the latter caused some to dub him ""the godfather of grunge"".   Young has directed (or co-directed) a number of  films  using the  pseudonym  Bernard Shakey, including  Journey Through the Past  (1973),  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979),  Human Highway  (1982),  Greendale  (2003), and  CSNY Dj Vu  (2008). He is currently working on a documentary about electric car technology, tentatively titled  Linc/Volt . The project involves a 1959  Lincoln Continental  converted to hybrid technology, which Young plans to drive to  Washington, DC  as an example to lawmakers there. [ 2 ]   He is also an outspoken advocate for environmental issues and small farmers, having co-founded in 1985 the  benefit concert   Farm Aid , and in 1986 helped found The Bridge School, [ 3 ]  and its annual supporting  Bridge School Benefit  concerts, together with his wife Pegi (in this, Young's involvement stems at least partially from the fact that both of his sons have  cerebral palsy  and his daughter, like Young himself, has  epilepsy ).   Although Young sings as frequently about U.S. legends and myths ( Pocahontas ,  space stations , and the settlement of the American West) [ 4 ]  as he does about his native country, he remains a Canadian citizen and has never wanted to relinquish his Canadian citizenship. He has lived in the U.S. for ""so long"" and has stated he has ""got just as much right to vote in them (American elections) as anybody else.""

He spent his early years in the small country town of  Omemee , 130  kilometres  (81  mi ) northeast of Toronto.   Young was diagnosed with diabetes as a child [ 6 ]  and a bout of  polio  at the age of 6 left him with a weakened left side; he still walks with a slight limp.   His parents divorced when Young was 12, and he moved with his mother back to the family home of  Winnipeg , Manitoba, where the formative years of his music career began. Neil and his mother Rassy settled into the working class suburb of  Fort Rouge  where the shy, dry-humoured youth enrolled at Earl Grey Junior High School. It was there that he formed his first band  the Jades , and met  Ken Koblun , later to join him in the Squires.   While attending  Kelvin High School  in Winnipeg, he played in several instrumental rock bands. Young's first stable band was called the Squires, who had a local hit called ""The Sultan"". Young dropped out of high school [ 7 ]  and also played in  Fort William , where they recorded a series of demos produced by a local producer named Ray Dee, whom Young called ""the original Briggs."" [ 8 ]  While in Thunder Bay, Young first encountered  Stephen Stills . In the  2006  film  Heart of Gold  Young relates how he used to spend time as a teenager at  Falcon Lake, Manitoba  where he would endlessly plug coins into the jukebox to hear  Ian Tyson 's "" Four Strong Winds "". Neil also formed a friendship with musician  Randy Bachman .   After leaving the Squires, Neil worked folk clubs in Winnipeg, where he first met  Joni Mitchell . [ 9 ]  Here he wrote some of his earliest and most enduring folk songs such as the classic "" Sugar Mountain "", about his lost youth. Mitchell wrote ""The Circle Game"" in response. [ citation needed ]   In 1965 Young toured Canada as a solo artist. In 1966, he joined the  Rick James -fronted  Mynah Birds . The band managed to secure a record deal with the  Motown  label, but as their first album was being recorded, James was arrested for being  AWOL  from the army. [ 10 ]  After the Mynah Birds disbanded, Young and bass player  Bruce Palmer  relocated to  Los Angeles . Young has admitted in an interview that he was in the United States illegally until receiving a green card in 1970. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Buffalo Springfield   Once they reached Los Angeles, Young and Palmer met up with  Stephen Stills ,  Richie Furay , and  Dewey Martin  to form  Buffalo Springfield . A mixture of folk, country,  psychedelia , and rock lent a hard edge by the twin lead guitars of Stills and Young made Buffalo Springfield a critical success, and their first record  Buffalo Springfield  (1967) sold well after Stills' topical song "" For What It's Worth "" became a hit, aided by Young's melodic harmonics played on electric guitar.   Distrust of their management, as well as the arrest and deportation of Palmer, exacerbated the already strained relations among the group members and led to Buffalo Springfield's demise. A second album,  Buffalo Springfield Again , was released in late 1967, but two of Youngs three contributions were solo tracks recorded apart from the rest of the group.   In many ways, these three songs on  Buffalo Springfield Again  are harbingers of much of Young's later work in that, although they all share deeply personal, almost idiosyncratic lyrics, they also present three very different musical approaches to the arrangement of what is essentially an original folk song. ""Mr Soul"" is the only Young song of the three that all five members of the group perform together. In contrast, "" Broken Arrow "" was confessional folk rock of a kind that would characterize much of the music that emerged from the singer-songwriter movement. Youngs experimental production intersperses each verse with snippets of sound from other sources, including opening the song with a sound bite of Dewey Martin singing ""Mr. Soul"" and closing it with the thumping of a heartbeat. ""Expecting to Fly"" was a lushly produced  ballad  featuring a string arrangement that Young's co-producer for the track,  Jack Nitzsche , would dub ""symphonic pop.""   In May 1968, the band split up for good, but in order to fulfill a contractual obligation, a final album,  Last Time Around , was recorded, primarily from recordings made earlier that year. Young contributed the songs ""On the Way Home"" and ""I Am a Child"", singing lead on the latter. In 1997, the band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame; Young did not appear at the ceremony.     [ edit ]   Solo success & CSNY   After the breakup of Buffalo Springfield, Young signed a solo deal with  Reprise Records , home of his colleague and friend  Joni Mitchell , with whom he shared a manager, Elliot Roberts, who manages Young to this day. Young and Nitzsche immediately began work on Young's first solo record,  Neil Young  (November 1968), which received mixed reviews. In a 1970 interview, [ 12 ]  Young deprecated the album as being ""overdubbed rather than played,"" and the quest for music that expresses the spontaneity of the moment has long been a feature of his career. Nevertheless, the album contains some tunes that remain a staple of his live shows, most notably ""The Loner.""   For his next album, Young recruited three musicians from a band called The Rockets:  Danny Whitten  on guitar,  Billy Talbot  on bass guitar, and  Ralph Molina  on  drums . These three took the name  Crazy Horse  (after  the historical figure of the same name ), and  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere  (May 1969), is credited to ""Neil Young with Crazy Horse."" Recorded in just two weeks, the album opens with one of Young's most familiar songs, ""Cinnamon Girl,"" and is dominated by two more, ""Cowgirl in the Sand"" and ""Down by the River,"" that feature lengthy jams showcasing Young's idiosyncratic guitar soloing accompanied sympathetically by Crazy Horse. Young reportedly wrote all three songs on the same day, while nursing a high fever of 103 F (39.5 C) in bed.   Shortly after the release of  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere , Young reunited with Stephen Stills by joining  Crosby, Stills, & Nash , who had already released one album as a trio. Young was originally offered a position as a sideman, but agreed to join only if he received full membership, and the group - winners of the 1969 ""Best New Artist"" Grammy - was renamed Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. [ 13 ]  The quartet debuted in  Chicago  on  August 16 ,  1969 , and later performed at the famous  Woodstock Festival , during which Young skipped the acoustic set and refused to be filmed during the electric set, even telling the cameramen: ""One of you fuckin' guys comes near me and I'm gonna fuckin' hit you with my guitar"". [ 14 ]  During the making of their first album,  Dj Vu , the musicians frequently argued, particularly Young and Stills, who both fought for control. [ 15 ]   "" Ohio "" was written following the  Kent State massacre  on  May 4 ,  1970 , and was a staple of anti-war rallies in the 1970s. The song was quickly recorded by CSNY and immediately released as a single, even though CSNY's ""Teach Your Children"" was still climbing the singles charts. Many believe that the release of ""Ohio"" as a single cut into the sales of ""Teach Your Children"" and prevented that song from reaching the top ten. In the late 1970s and for much of the 1980s, Young refrained from performing ""Ohio"" live, as he considered the song to be dated. In the wake of the 1989  Tiananmen Square massacre , however, Young revived the song in concert, often dedicating it to the  Chinese  students who were killed in the massacre. Crosby, Stills & Nash, as a trio, also returned the song to their live repertoire around the same time, even though Young had provided the lead vocals on the original recording.   Also that year, Young released his third solo album,  After the Gold Rush  (1970), which featured, among others, a young  Nils Lofgren ,  Stephen Stills , and CSNY bassist Greg Reeves. Young also recorded some tracks with Crazy Horse, but dismissed them early in the sessions. Aided by his newfound fame with CSNY, the album was a commercial breakthrough for Young and contains some of his best known work. Notable tracks include the title track, with dream-like lyrics that run a gamut of subjects from drugs and interpersonal relationships to environmental concerns, as well as Youngs controversial and acerbic condemnation of  racism  in "" Southern Man ,"" which, along with a later song entitled ""Alabama,"" later prompted  Lynyrd Skynyrd  to decry Young by name in the lyrics to "" Sweet Home Alabama ."" Young was one of Skynyrd's biggest influences, and Young was an admirer of Skynyrd's music. The respectful rivalry and friendship between Young and Skynyrd front man  Ronnie Van Zant  would serve as a recurring theme in the  Drive-By Truckers ' 2001  concept album   Southern Rock Opera .   With CSNY splitting up and Crazy Horse having signed their own record deal, Young began the year 1971 with a solo tour entitled ""Journey Through the Past."" Later, he recruited a new group of country-music session musicians, whom he christened  The Stray Gators , to record much of the new material that had been premiered on tour for the album  Harvest  (1972).  Harvest  was a massive hit (especially with the country-music crowd) and ""Heart of Gold"" became a US number one single; incidentally, to this day it remains the only No. 1 hit in his long career.   Another notable song was "" The Needle and the Damage Done ,"" a somber lament on the pain caused by heroin addiction; inspired in part by the heavy heroin use of Crazy Horse member Danny Whitten, who would eventually die of an overdose. [ 16 ]   The album's success, however, caught Young off guard, and his first instinct was to back away from stardom. In the handwritten liner notes to the  Decade  compilation, Young described ""Heart of Gold"" as the song that ""put me in the middle of the road. Traveling there soon became a bore, so I headed for the ditch. A rougher ride but I saw more interesting people there.""   On  September 8 ,  1972 , the Academy Award-nominated actress  Carrie Snodgress , with whom he had been living, gave birth to Neil Young's first child. The boy, Zeke, was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Young fell in love with Snodgress after seeing her in a movie (""Diary of a Mad Housewife"") on television after which Young wrote the song "" A Man Needs a Maid "" from the Harvest album, featuring the lyric ""I fell in love with the actress/she was playing a part that I could understand.""     [ edit ]   The Ditch Trilogy   Although a new tour had been planned to follow up on the success of  Harvest , it became apparent during rehearsals that Danny Whitten could not function due to  drug abuse . On  November 18 , 1972, shortly after he was fired from the tour preparations, Whitten was found dead of an  overdose . Young described the incident to  Rolling Stone s  Cameron Crowe  in 1975:  [ 17 ]  ""[We] were rehearsing with him and he just couldn't cut it. He couldn't remember anything. He was too out of it. Too far gone. I had to tell him to go back to L.A. 'It's not happening, man. You're not together enough.' He just said, 'I've got nowhere else to go, man. How am I gonna tell my friends?' And he split. That night the coroner called me from L.A. and told me he'd ODed. That blew my mind. Fucking blew my mind. I loved Danny. I felt responsible. And from there, I had to go right out on this huge tour of huge arenas. I was very nervous and  insecure.""   The album made in the aftermath of this incident,  Time Fades Away  (1973), has often been described by Young as ""my least favourite record,"" and it is, in fact, one of only two of Youngs early recordings that has yet to be officially re-released on CD (the other being the soundtrack album  Journey Through the Past ). The album was recorded live over a tour where Young struggled with his voice and called  David Crosby  and  Graham Nash  to help perform the music. The tour featured  Linda Ronstadt  as the opening act.  Time Fades Away  occupies a unique position in Youngs discography as the first of three albums known collectively as the "" Ditch Trilogy .""   In the second half of 1973, Young formed The Santa Monica Flyers, with Crazy Horse's rhythm section augmented by Nils Lofgren on guitar. Deeply affected by the drug-induced deaths of Whitten and  roadie   Bruce Berry , Young recorded  Tonight's the Night . The album's dark tone and rawness caused Reprise to delay the release until two years later and only after being pressured by Young to do so. [ 18 ]  It received mixed reviews at the time, but is now regarded as a landmark album. In Young's own opinion, it was the closest he ever came to art. [ 19 ]   While his record company delayed the release of  Tonight's the Night,  Young recorded  On the Beach  (1974), which dealt with themes such as the downside of fame and the Californian lifestyle. Like  Time Fades Away  and  Tonight's the Night , it sold poorly but eventually became a critical favourite, presenting some of Young's most original work. In a review of the 2003 re-release on CD of  On the Beach  Derek Svennungsen described the music as ""mesmerizing, harrowing, lucid, and bleary,"" [ 20 ] .     [ edit ]   Return to prominence   After completing  On the Beach , Young reunited with  Harvest  producer Elliot Mazer to record another acoustic album,  Homegrown . Most of the songs were written after Young's breakup with Snodgress, and thus the tone of the album was somewhat dark. Though the album was entirely completed, Young decided to drop the album and release  Tonight's the Night  instead, at the suggestion of  The Band  bassist  Rick Danko . [ 21 ]  Young further explained his move by saying: ""It was a little too personal... it scared me"". [ 22 ]          Neil Young in Austin, Texas on November 9, 1976       Young reformed Crazy Horse with  Frank Sampedro  on guitar as his backup band for  Zuma  (1975). Many of the songs are overtly concerned with failed relationships, and even the epic "" Cortez the Killer ,"" outwardly a retelling of the  Spanish conquest  of  Mexico  from the viewpoint of the  Aztecs , can be seen as an allegory of love lostsomething that didnt save it, however, from being banned in  Franco 's  Spain .   The following year, Young reunited with Stephen Stills for the album  Long May You Run  (1976), credited to  The Stills-Young Band ; the follow-up tour was ended midway through by Young, who sent Stills a  telegram  that read: ""Funny how some things that start spontaneously end that way. Eat a peach, Neil."" [ 23 ]   In 1976, Young performed with  The Band , Joni Mitchell, and other rock musicians in the high profile all-star concert  The Last Waltz . The release of  Martin Scorsese 's movie of the concert was delayed while Scorsese unwillingly re-edited it to obscure the lump of cocaine that was clearly visible hanging from Young's nose during his performance of  ""Helpless."" [ 24 ]  Young later said, ""I'm not proud of that,"" according to one of his biographers.   American Stars 'N Bars  (1977) contained two songs originally recorded for  Homegrown  album, ""Homegrown"" and ""Star of Bethelehem,"" as well as newer material, including the future concert staple "" Like A Hurricane "". Performers included  Linda Ronstadt ,  Emmylou Harris  and Young protg  Nicolette Larson  along with Crazy Horse. Also in 1977, Young released  Decade : a personally selected career summary of material spanning every aspect of his various interests and affiliations, including a handful of unreleased songs.  Comes a Time  (1978) also featured Nicolette Larson and Crazy Horse and became Young's most commercially accessible album in quite some time, marked by a return to his folk roots.   Young next set out on the lengthy ""Rust Never Sleeps"" tour, in which each concert was divided into a solo acoustic set and an electric set with Crazy Horse. Much of the electric set was later seen as a response to punk rock's burgeoning popularity. ""Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)"" compared the changing public perception of  Johnny Rotten  with that of the recently deceased  Elvis Presley , who himself had once been disparaged as a dangerous influence only to later become an  icon . Rotten, meanwhile, returned the favour by playing one of Young's records on a  London  radio show. The accompanying albums  Rust Never Sleeps  (new material, culled from live recordings, but featuring studio overdubs) and  Live Rust  (a mixture of old and new, and a genuine concert recording) captured the two sides of the concerts, with solo acoustic songs on side A, and fierce, uptempo, electric songs on side B. A movie version of the concerts, also called  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979), was directed by Young under the pseudonym Bernard Shakey.   Young was suddenly hip again, and the readers and critics of  Rolling Stone  voted him Artist Of The Year for 1979 (along with The Who), selected  Rust Never Sleeps  as Album Of The Year, and voted him Male Vocalist Of The Year as well.  The Village Voice , meanwhile, honored Young as the Artist of the Decade.     [ edit ]   1980s - Experimental years   The 1980s were a lean time for Young both critically and commercially. After providing the incidental music to a  biopic  of  Hunter S. Thompson  entitled  Where the Buffalo Roam , he recorded  Hawks & Doves  (1980), a folk/country record.  Re-ac-tor  (1981), once again with Crazy Horse, was a faade of distortion and feedback obscuring a relatively weak selection of songs, but his strangest record of the decade came with  Trans  (1982). Recorded partially with  vocoders ,  synthesizers , and other devices that modified instruments and vocals with electronic effects, it is sometimes considered an experiment related to finding a technology that would become a means to communicate for Youngs son (with his wife Pegi), Ben, who has severe  cerebral palsy  and cannot speak. Many fans were baffled by the radical forms of this album and  rockabilly -styled  Everybody's Rockin'  (1983), and record company head  David Geffen  even sued Young for making ""unrepresentative"" musici.e. music that did not sound like Neil Youngthat deliberately lacked commercial appeal. [ 25 ]  Young later stated that he would have preferred to release the songs featuring the  synclavier  and  vocoder  as an EP, and that their inclusion with the Hawaiian-themed rockabilly was a mistake. Also premiered at this time though little seen was an eclectic full-length comedy film  Human Highway  starring, co-directed and co-written by Young.   In 1983, Young worked with British video director  Tim Pope , making two videos - ""Wonderin'"" and ""Cry, Cry, Cry.""   In 1985, he reunited with Crosby, Stills and Nash at  Live Aid  at Philadelphia's  John F. Kennedy Stadium . The two songs that they played, ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"" and "" Daylight Again /Find The Cost of Freedom,"" were the first songs they had played as a quartet in front of a paying audience since 1974.   Old Ways  (1985) saw a return to country music, recorded with a group of friends and session musicians.  Landing on Water  (1986) is entertaining for the blending of synthesizers and other instruments related to the 1980s into Youngs own style, with lyrics that take pot shots at some favourite targets, including CSN in ""Hippie Dream,"" with a chorus that goes: ""But the wooden ships/Were just a hippie dream,"" and David Geffen in ""Drifter,"" with the line: ""Dont try to tell me what I gotta do to fit."" The resumption of his partnership with Crazy Horse on  Life  (1987) fulfilled his contract with Geffen, and Young was finally able to switch labels.   Director Pope again made a series of videos from the album, including ""Touch the Night"" and ""People on the Street"".   Signing with  Warner Brothers  (which distributed Geffen at the time) and returning to Reprise Records, Young produced  This Note's For You  (1988) with a new band, The Bluenotes, whose name rights were owned by musician  Harold Melvin . Young named his band after a cafe called the Blue Note on Main Street in Winnipeg Manitoba, where he had played. The addition of a  brass  section provided a new  jazzier  sound and the title track became his first hit single of the decade. Accompanied by a video which parodied corporate rock, the pretensions of advertising and  Michael Jackson  in particular, the song was initially banned by  MTV  (although the Canadian music channel,  MuchMusic  ran it immediately) before being put into heavy rotation and finally given the  MTV Video Music Award for Best Video of the Year  for 1989. After Melvin sued over the use of the Bluenotes name, Young renamed his back-up group ""Ten Men Workin'"" for the balance of the concert tour.   Young also contributed to that year's CSNY reunion  American Dream  (1988) and CSNY played a few benefit concerts. Young, however, refused to book a full tour with CSN and the foursome would not embark upon a nationwide tour until 2000.     [ edit ]   1990s - Return to country-rock roots   Freedom  was a mixture of acoustic and electric rock dealing with the state of the U.S. and the world in 1989, alongside a set of love songs and a version of the standard ""On Broadway."" "" Rockin' in the Free World "", two versions of which bookended the album, again caught the mood. Some say it became a  de facto  anthem during the fall of the  Berlin Wall , a few months after the record's release. However, most Germans don't remember the song being related to the unification, understandably so, since the lyrics are not about political repression. Like  Bruce Springsteen 's "" Born in the U.S.A. "", the anthemic use of this song was based on largely ignoring the verses, which evoke social problems and implicitly criticize American government policies. In mid-1989, record executive  Terry Tolkin  conceived and produced a tribute album to Young's songs called  The Bridge: A Tribute To Neil Young,  released on his  No.6 Records  label. It featured cover versions of 15 of Young's songs by the cream of the up and coming  Alternative Music  and  Grunge music  bands including  Sonic Youth ,  Nick Cave ,  Soul Asylum ,  Dinosaur Jr ,and  The Pixies . By 1990,  grunge music  was beginning to make its first inroads in the charts and many of its prime movers, including  Nirvana 's  Kurt Cobain  and  Pearl Jam 's  Eddie Vedder , cited Young as a major influence.   Using a barn on his  Northern California  ranch as a studio, he rapidly recorded  Ragged Glory  with Crazy Horse, whose guitar riffs and feedback driven sound showed his new admirers that he could still cut it. Young then headed back out on the road with Orange Country country-punk band  Social Distortion  and  alternative rock  elder statesmen  Sonic Youth  as support, much to the consternation of many of his old fans. [ 26 ] [ 27 ]  Yet the influence of Sonic Youth could be clearly heard on the accompanying home video and live album,  Weld , which also included a bonus CD entitled  Arc , a single 35-minute-long collage of  feedback  and guitar noise that Neil included, evidently at the suggestion of Sonic Youth's  Thurston Moore . [ 28 ]   Arc  was later sold separately.   Young's next move was another return to country music.  Harvest Moon  (1992) was the long-awaited sequel to  Harvest  and reunited him with some of the musicians from that session, as well as singers  Linda Ronstadt  and  James Taylor . The title track was a minor hit and the record was reviewed and sold equally well, containing songs such as ""From Hank to  Hendrix "" and ""Unknown Legend"", a tribute to his wife. His resurgent popularity saw him booked on  MTV Unplugged  in 1993. In 1992 he accompanied fellow  Winnipegger   Randy Bachman  on ""Prairie Town,"" a song that recounts their days in the Winnipeg music scene of the 1960s. That year, he contributed music to the  soundtrack  of the  Jonathan Demme  movie  Philadelphia , and his song ""Philadelphia"" was nominated for the  Academy Award for Best Song , losing out to Bruce Springsteen's contribution to the same film. A summer tour covering both Europe and North America with  Booker T. and the MGs  (with whom he played two songs at a 1992  Bob Dylan  tribute concert at  Madison Square Garden ) was widely praised as a triumph. On a few of these dates, the show ended with a rendition of ""Rockin' in the Free World"" played with  Pearl Jam .   Young was back with Crazy Horse for 1994's  Sleeps with Angels , a much darker record. The title track told the story of  Kurt Cobain 's death; Young had reportedly made repeated attempts to contact Cobain prior to this event. [ 29 ]  Cobain had quoted Young's ""It's better to burn out than fade away"" (a line from "" My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue) "") in his alleged  suicide note , causing Young to emphasize the line ""'cause once you're gone you can't come back"" in live performances at the time. Other songs dealt with drive-by shootings (""Driveby""),  environmentalism  (""Piece of Crap"") and Young's own vision of America (the archetypal car metaphor of ""Trans Am""). Young was inspired to make the record after viewing Cobain's performance on  MTV Unplugged . Still admired by the prime movers of grunge, Young eventually performed with Pearl Jam at the MTV Music Awards during what was described as the highlight of a lackluster show. [ 30 ]  Their collaboration led to a joint tour, with the band and producer  Brendan O'Brien  backing Young. The accompanying album,  Mirror Ball  (1995), recorded as live in the studio captured their loose rock sound, and featured the standout track ""I'm the Ocean"". The year of 1995 also featured Young's entry into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .   After composing an abstract, distorted feedback-led guitar instrumental soundtrack to  Jim Jarmusch 's  acid western  film  Dead Man  Young recorded a series of loose jams with Crazy Horse that eventually appeared as the critically denigrated  Broken Arrow . The return to Crazy Horse was prompted by the death of mentor, friend, and longtime  producer   David Briggs  in late 1995. The subsequent tours of Europe and North America in 1996 resulted in both a live album and a tour documentary directed by  Jim Jarmusch . Both releases took the name  Year of the Horse .   In 1997, Young participated in the  H.O.R.D.E. Festival 's sixth annual tour.   In 1998, Young shared the stage with the rock band  Phish  at the annual  Farm Aid  concert, and later offered them an opportunity to headline both nights of the Bridge School Benefit concert. Phish took Young up on his offer to headline the Bridge School Benefit (where Young joined Phish for renditions of ""Helpless"" and ""I Shall Be Released."" [ 31 ]  Phish, however, declined Young's later invitation to be his backing band on a 1999 tour. [ 32 ]   The decade ended with  Looking Forward , another reunion with Crosby, Stills and Nash. The subsequent tour of the United States and Canada with the reformed super quartet was a huge success and brought in earnings of $42.1 million, making it the eighth largest grossing tour of 2000.   Young's next album,  Silver & Gold  (2000), contained a number of understated songs with personal lyrics, which was promoted through a mini-tour of solo acoustic shows. This style was continued in  Are You Passionate?  (2002), an album of love songs dedicated to his wife, Pegi.     [ edit ]   In the aftermath of 9/11   Young's 2001 single "" Let's Roll "", was a tribute to the victims of the  September 11, 2001 attacks , and the passengers and crew on  Flight 93  in particular. At the "" America: A Tribute to Heroes "" concert he performed  John Lennon's  "" Imagine "". In 2002,  Q  magazine  named Neil Young in their list of the ""50 Bands To See Before You Die.""   Young hauled out his concept album  Greendale , about an extended family in a small town called Greendale, and how they are torn apart by a murder, in 2003.  Greendale  was recorded with Crazy Horse members Billy Talbot and Ralph Molina. This tale of the Green family also resulted in a movie called  Greendale , written and directed by Young (again using his ""Bernard Shakey"" pseudonym) and starring a few of his friends, who act out and  lip sync  the songs from the album. The film was indeed thoroughly experimental, from Young's rambling on-stage between-song narratives, to his reading apparent transcriptions of these ramblings in the liner notes. ""When I was writing this I had no idea what I was doing, so I was just as surprised as you are,"" Young said later. Young toured extensively with the  Greendale  material throughout 2003 and 2004, first with a solo, acoustic version in Europe, then with a full-cast stage show in North America,  Japan , and  Australia . While audience reaction was sometimes mixed (drunken requests for ""Southern Man"" being an aesthetic impediment at most Young performances), the live stage version of Greendale was for many critics the most satisfying incarnation of the material, and bootlegs of the shows have been widely traded. The second half of each concert consisted of high-decibel renditions of Young classics such as ""Hey Hey, My My,"" ""Cinnamon Girl,"" ""Powderfinger,"" and  Rockin' in the Free World , as well as rarities such as ""The Losing End,"" ""The Old Country Waltz,"" and ""Danger Bird.""   Young spent the latter portion of 2004 giving a series of intimate acoustic concerts in various cities with his wife, Pegi, who is a trained vocalist and guitar player.     [ edit ]   Recent events          From left,  Emmylou Harris , Neil Young and  Pegi Young  perform in  Neil Young: Heart of Gold , which offered renditions of some of Young's best-known songs.       On  March 31 ,  2005 , Young was admitted to a hospital in New York for treatment for a brain  aneurysm . He was treated successfully by a minimally invasive  neuroradiological  procedure. Prior to undergoing the procedure, he wrote the first eight songs of a new album,  Prairie Wind , in  Nashville , with session musicians that included regular Young sideman  Ben Keith  on lap and  pedal steel guitars . Two days after the procedure, Young was forced to cancel a scheduled appearance on the  Juno Awards  telecast in Winnipeg when the area where the surgeons did his procedure (via the  femoral artery ) suddenly began to bleed. While Young finally was able to return to Winnipeg in 2006 with Crosby, Stills and Nash, his first post-aneurysm performance was on  July 2 ,  2005 , at the close of the  Live 8  concert in  Barrie, Ontario . There, he debuted a new song, a soft hymn called ""When God Made Me.""   On  September 28 ,  2005 ,  Prairie Wind  was released. In an interview given to  Time  magazine , Young revealed that he had planned to keep the news of his aneurysm private until he had the bleeding scare, after which he decided to make news of his condition public. The last two songs on the album were written after his aneurysm procedure, and several of the songs, such as ""Fallin' Off the Face of the Earth,"" seem to be inspired by Young's brush with  mortality , the recent death of his father, who suffered from  senile dementia , and Young's  Manitoba  roots.   In 2006,  Neil Young: Heart of Gold , a film made by  Jonathan Demme , premiered at the  Sundance Film Festival . Filmed over two nights at the  Ryman Auditorium  in  Nashville, Tennessee  during the premiere of  Prairie Wind , it includes both new and old songs as well as behind-the scenes-commentary by Young, his wife Pegi, and members of Young's session band.   In April 2006, Young announced the release of  Living with War , an album of protest songs that included the provocatively-titled "" Let's Impeach the President ."" Recorded using his famous  Les Paul  electric guitar, "" Old Black ,"" along with Chad Cromwell (drums), Rick Rosas (bass), and Tommy Brea (trumpet), the album was intended to be a stinging rebuke of U.S. President  George W. Bush  and the  War in Iraq . The album was recorded in a two week period in April, and was then made available over the internet from 28 April 2006 before being released as a CD on 5 May.  Living With War  was Young's most talked about release for years, creating heated political debate and a return to form with perhaps his most critically-acclaimed album since the early 1990s.  Living With War: In the Beginning , a remixed version with the original album's choral backing vocals removed, was released in December of the same year. Its accompanying DVD featured videos directed by Young of every song on the album, footage of the  Iraq War  and demonstrations in the US, and clips from  Al Gore 's  An Inconvenient Truth .          Neil Young on the CSNY ""Freedom Of Speech Tour '06""       From July through September 2006, Neil Young reunited with his former bandmates from  Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young  for the ""Freedom Of Speech Tour '06"" across North America. Chad Cromwell and Rick Rosas made up the band's rhythm section. The entire  Living with War  album was performed on the tour, in addition to other CSN and Neil Young classics such as "" Ohio "" and "" Rockin' in the Free World ."" An accompanying concert film and live album, called  CSNY Deja Vu , were premiered on January 25, 2008, at the Sundance Movie Festival.   2006 also saw the first release from Young's long awaited  Archives  project, as  Live at the Fillmore East , a selection of songs drawn from a 1970 gig with  Crazy Horse , was released in November of that year. The release was marked as number two in the  Archives Performance Series , leaving room for the still-unreleased 1969  Riverboat  bootleg, which will be number one in the series. In March 2007, another historical live album, marked as the third in the  Performance Series , was released. Titled  Live at Massey Hall 1971 , it featured a solo acoustic set from Toronto's Massey Hall, including material from the upcoming  Harvest  album.   On  August 15 ,  2007 , Young played a new album for 100 people at Reprise Records entitled  Chrome Dreams II .  Chrome Dreams  was an album he scrapped in 1977, and the name of two different bootlegs. The new album includes two long songs that time in at 18:13 (""Ordinary People"") and 14:31 (""No Hidden Path""), respectively. The album consists of three songs written previously and seven new songs, all by Young. The album was released on October 23, 2007, timed to coincide with a seven-week tour that had kicked off in Boise, Idaho, ten days earlier.   On February 11, 2008, Neil Young started the European leg of his tour with a concert in  Antwerp ,  Belgium . On July 17, he was interviewed on  PBS  by  Charlie Rose , where he spoke about many things, including his project to make a hybrid 1959 Lincoln. [ 33 ]  In October, a BBC 4 documentary ""Neil Young - Don't be Denied"" was shown, featuring interviews with Neil and a number of his contemporaries. It also summarizes his biography and motivations. [ 34 ]   The latest album in the Performance Series,  Sugar Mountain - Live At Canterbury House 1968  was released on December 2, 2008. Featuring material from Young's earliest solo performances recorded in Ann Arbor, MI November 9, 1968, the album was released as number zero in the  Performance Series .   The first installment of Young's oft-delayed box set  The Archives Vol. 1 1963-1972  was officially announced in 2008 with a trailer.  [ 35 ]   [ 36 ]  The first set of Archives will feature both DVD and Blu-ray editions which will include 128 audio tracks (43 unreleased and 13 never before heard songs), thousands of images (photos, lyrics, letters and memorabilia), and hours of new, previously released and rare videos. Also included will be a 236 page hardbound book. The Blu-ray edition will have HD picture, pristine audio mastered and presented in 24bit 192 khz., and access to photos, trivia and memorabilia without stopping the music. It is currently scheduled for release in 2009.   A April 07,2009 date has been set for Neil's new album 'A Fork in The Road', which will delay the release of the Archives until later in 2009. A new film by Jonathan Demme of Neil Young in concert (Upper Darby, Pennsylvania 2007) called the Neil Young Trunk Show will premiere at the South by Southwest (SXSW) Film Conference and Festival, on Saturday, March 21,2009 at the Paramount Theatre in Austin, Texas.   Young headlined the 2009  Big Day Out  festival in  New Zealand  and  Australia . Young pushed other current mainstream bands to only secondary headlining, including  Arctic Monkeys  and  The Ting Tings . He is rumored to be headlining the Friday at  Glastonbury Festival  which has attempted to book him for many years. Although not officially confirmed, a number of sources have suggested this. [ 37 ]  He has also been confirmed to play the Primavera Festival, Barcelona in May 2009 and the Isle of Wight Festival [ 38 ]  in the UK, June 2009.   Young currently lives on a 1500-acre (6 km) ranch in  La Honda, California , called Broken Arrow. He also owns property in  Fort Lauderdale, Florida , and on the islands of  Hawaii .     [ edit ]   Influence, importance and inspiration   Neil Young has undeniably been an important artist in the history of American and Canadian popular music and remains a distinct influence upon other recording artists.  Lynyrd Skynyrd s "" Sweet Home Alabama "" was written in response to two of Neil Youngs songs ""Southern Man"" and ""Alabama"". ""Ohio"" which Young recorded with Crosby, Stills and Nash, was a recollection of the tragic events that transpired at Kent State University in May 1970. Young's willingness to be politically outspoken and socially conscious allowed him to influence such important artists such as  Phish ,  Pearl Jam , and  Nirvana . Neil Young is referred to as ""the Godfather of  Grunge "" because of the influence he had on  Kurt Cobain  and  Eddie Vedder  and the entire grunge movement. Kurt Cobain quoted Neil Young in his suicide note, using the line Its better to burn out, than to fade away from Youngs song ""My My, Hey Hey (Out Of The Blue)"". Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam inducted Neil Young into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, citing him as a huge influence. He has also been a big influence on  experimental rock  acts like  Sonic Youth  and  Radiohead . Youngs influence, importance and inspiration within the music scene derive in part from his longevity because of a career spanning more than four decades. His first album was released in 1966 and his latest in 2008.  Bob Dylan 's influence on Young has been so obvious that the former once lambasted: "" Heart of Gold  bothered me every time it came on the radio ... and I'd say, 'Shit, that's me. If it sounds like me it might as well be me. (...) It seemed somebody else had taken my thing and had run away with it, you know, and I never got over it. Maybe tomorrow"" [ 39 ] .   The Australian rock group  Powderfinger  attribute their group name to their love of Young.   Toronto  based band  Constantines  recorded a version of Neil's  Fuckin' Up  in  Winnipeg , [ 40 ] which surfaced at the b-side the their ""Our Age"" 7"" [ 41 ] in November 2008. The members of the  Constantines  have occasionally played shows under the name Horsey Craze [ 42 ] , singing Neil Young songs. In early 2006, they released a vinyl only split-album with The Unintended. The Constantines recorded four Neil Young songs for the LP, while The Unintended performed four Gordon Lightfoot songs.   While in Winnipeg on November 2, 2008 during the Canadian leg of his tour,  Bob Dylan  visited Young's former home in River Heights. The home was where Neil spent some of his teenage years. Dylan was interested in seeing the room where some of Neil's first songs were composed.     [ edit ]   Achievements   Young was inducted into the  Canadian Music Hall of Fame  in 1982. He has been inducted into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  twice: first in 1995 for his solo work, with an induction speech given by  Eddie Vedder , and again in 1997 as a member of Buffalo Springfield.   He has also directed five movies under his pseudonym Bernard Shakey, and released them through his own Shakey Pictures imprint:  Journey Through the Past  (1973),  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979)  Human Highway  (1982) (starring new wave band  Devo ), and  Greendale  (2003) and the documentary,  CSNY Deja Vu  (2008). The bonus  DVDs  included in both versions of  Greendale  and in  Prairie Wind  are also directed by Young under the Bernard Shakey alias, and all of Young's home video and DVD releases have been co-released under the Shakey Pictures imprint.   As one of the original founders of  Farm Aid , he remains an active member of the board of directors. For one weekend each October, in  Mountain View, California , he and his wife host the  Bridge School Concerts , which have been drawing international talent and sell-out crowds for nearly two decades with some of the biggest names in rock having performed at the event including  Bruce Springsteen ,  David Bowie ,  The Who ,  Red Hot Chili Peppers ,  Trent Reznor  of  Nine Inch Nails ,  Pearl Jam ,  Sonic Youth  and Sir  Paul McCartney . The concerts are a benefit for the  Bridge School , which develops and uses advanced technologies to aid in the instruction of children with disabilities. Young's involvement stems at least partially from the fact that both of his sons have  cerebral palsy  and his daughter, like Young himself, has  epilepsy .   Young was nominated for an  Oscar  in 1994 for his song ""Philadelphia"" from the film  Philadelphia  (Bruce Springsteen won the award for his song "" Streets of Philadelphia "" from the same film). In his acceptance speech, Springsteen said that ""the award really deserved to be shared by the other nominee's song."" That same night,  Tom Hanks  accepted the Oscar for Best Actor and gave credit for his inspiration to the song ""Philadelphia"".   He was part owner of  Lionel, LLC , a company that makes toy trains and model railroad accessories. [ 43 ]  In 2008 Lionel emerged from bankruptcy and his shares of the company were wiped out. At this time his status with Lionel is unknown, according to Lionel CEO Jerry Calabrese he is still a consultant for Lionel. He was instrumental in the design of the Lionel Legacy control system for model trains [ 43 ]  and it is believed he will continue to develop the system. Young has been named as co-inventor on seven U.S. Patents related to model trains. [ 44 ]   Young has twice received honorary doctorates. He received an Honorary Doctorate of Music from  Lakehead University  in  Thunder Bay ,  Ontario  in 1992, and an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from  San Francisco State University  in 2006. The latter honour was shared with his wife Pegi for their creation of the Bridge School.   In a ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"" list in the June 1996 issue of  Mojo  magazine , Young was ranked No. 9.   In 2003, Rolling Stone listed Young at #83 in its rankings of ""The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time,"" describing him as a ""restless experimenter...who transform[s] the most obvious music into something revelatory."" [ 45 ]   In 2000, Young was inducted into  Canada's Walk of Fame . [ 46 ]  He ranked No. 39 on  VH1 's 100 Greatest Artist of Hard Rock  that same year.   In 2001, Young was awarded the Spirit of Liberty award from the civil liberties group  People for the American Way .   In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked Neil Young [ 47 ]  #34 on their list of the  100 Greatest Artists of All Time . [ 48 ]   In 2006, Paste Magazine compiled a ""Greatest Living Songwriters"" list; Young was ranked No. 2 behind  Bob Dylan . (While Young and Dylan have occasionally played together in concert, they have never collaborated on a song together, or played on each others' records).   Jason Bond, an  East Carolina University  biologist, discovered a new species of trapdoor spider in 2007 and named it  Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi  after Young, his favorite singer (a previous similar case was the dinousar  Masiakasaurus knopfleri  named after the musician  Mark Knopfler  of  Dire Straits ). [ 49 ]   In 2008, Rolling Stone ranked Young at #37 in its list of ""The 100 Greatest Singers of All-Time. [ 50 ]   In 2009, He was nominated for a Grammy for Best Solo Rock Vocal performance.     [ edit ]   Instruments          Neil Young, 2008 in  Florence       Neil Young is a collector of second-hand guitars, but in recording and performing, he frequently uses just a few instruments. As explained by his longtime guitar technician  Larry Cragg  in the film  Neil Young: Heart of Gold , they include:     1953  Gibson Les Paul Goldtop Nicknamed "" Old Black "", this is Young's primary  electric guitar  and is featured on  Rust Never Sleeps  and most other albums. Old Black got its name from a purely amateur paintjob applied to the originally-gold body of the instrument, sometime before Neil acquired the guitar in the late 1960s. In 1972, a mini- humbucker  pickup from a  Gibson Firebird  guitar was installed into the lead/treble position, replacing a  P-90  as standard on Les Paul guitars from that era. This pickup, severely  microphonic , is considered a crucial component of Neil's sound. A  Bigsby vibrato tailpiece  was installed as early as 1969 on the guitar, and can be heard clearly during the opening of ""Cowgirl in the Sand"" from  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere . This guitar also features a mini-switch that is used to send the signal from the mini-humbucker direct to the amp, without going through the volume or tone controls. A Les Paul Gold Top of the same year as Old Black was assembled by Neil's guitar tech, using same style Firebird pick up in the guitar as well as the same model Bigsby Vib; but, according to Young, was just not the same as the original. Young acquired Old Black from Jim Messina, swapping one of his Gretsches for it in 1969 while Messina was assisting Young on his first solo album. Messina, who played briefly in Buffalo Springfield and produced the band's final album, ""Last Time Around,"" still has the Gretch in his possession.       Martin D-45 His primary  steel-string acoustic guitar ; used to write ""Old Man"" and many other hit songs.   Martin D-28Nicknamed ""Hank"" after its previous owner,  Hank Williams . The guitar came into Young's possession after  Hank Williams, Jr.  had traded it to another owner for some shotguns and it went through a succession of other owners until it was located by Young's longtime friend Grant Boatwright. The guitar was purchased by Young from  Tut Taylor . Young has toured with it for over 30 years. A story about the guitar and inspired song known as ""This Old Guitar"" can be seen about 50 minutes into the film  Neil Young: Heart of Gold . It is Young's primary guitar for the album,  Prairie Wind .   Neil Young can be seen playing a Vagabond Travel Guitar as he sings ""Let's Impeach the President"" on  The Colbert Report  on  Comedy Central .   A 12-string Taylor 855 is used in the first half of the soundtrack and concert film ""Rust Never Sleeps""   1927  Gibson  MastertoneA six-string  banjo , tuned like a guitar. It has been used on many recordings and was played by  James Taylor  on ""Old Man"".   Various vintage  Fender Tweed Deluxe  amplifiers Young's preferred amplifier for electric guitar is the diminutive Fender Deluxe, specifically a Tweed-era model from 1959. Neil purchased his first vintage Deluxe in 1967 for $50 from the drummer of Crazy Horse, Ralph Molina, and has since acquired nearly 450 different examples, all from the same era, but he maintains that it's the original model that sounds superior, and is a crucial component to his trademark sound. The Tweed Deluxe is almost always used in conjunction with a late-1950's Magnatone 280 (similar to the amp used by Lonnie Mack and Buddy Holly). The Magnatone and the Deluxe are paired together in a somewhat unique manner - the external speaker jack from the Deluxe sends the amped signal through a volume potentiometer and directly into the input of the Magnatone. The Magnatone is notable for its true pitch-bending vibrato capabilities, which can be heard as an electric piano amplifier on ""See the Sky About to Rain"". A notable and unique accessory to Young's Deluxe is the Whizzer, a device created specifically for Young, which physically changes the amplifier's settings to pre-set combinations. It has gone through many incarnations.   Gretsch 6120  (Chet Atkins)Before Young bought Old Black, this was his primary electric guitar used during his  Buffalo Springfield  days.   Gretsch White Falcon   Late '50s hollow body that Young purchased near the end of the  Buffalo Springfield  era; in 1969 Young acquired a stereo version of the same vintage guitar from Stills, and this instrument is featured prominently during Young's early '70s period, and can be heard on tracks like ""Ohio,"" ""Southern Man,"" ""Alabama,"" ""L.A.,"" others. It is Neil's primary electric guitar during the  Harvest  era. This particular White Falcon is the stereo 6137, in which the signal from the three bass strings is separated from the signal from the three treble strings. Young typically plays this guitar in this stereo mode, sending the separate signals to two different amps: the Fender Deluxe and typically to either a Fender Tremolux or a low-powered Tweed Fender Twin. The separation of the signals is most prominently heard on the Harvest album song ""Words"".   Neil Young replaced his trademark Les Paul for a Gibson Flying V on the ""Time Fades Away"" tour.   Neil Young played a  Fender Broadcaster  on the Tonight's the Night tour and album.

Young's work is characterized by deeply personal lyrics, distinctive guitar work, and signature falsetto  tenor  singing voice. Although he accompanies himself on several different instrumentsincluding  piano  and  harmonica his claw-hammer  acoustic guitar  style and often idiosyncratic electric guitar soloing are the linchpins of a sometimes ragged, sometimes polished sound. Although Young has experimented widely with differing music styles, including  swing ,  jazz ,  rockabilly ,  blues , and  electronic music  throughout a varied career, his best known work usually falls into either of two distinct styles:  folk -esque  acoustic   rock  ("" Heart of Gold "", ""Harvest Moon"" and "" Old Man "") and  electric -charged  hard rock  (like "" Cinnamon Girl "", "" Rockin' in the Free World "" and "" Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black) ""). In recent years, Young has adopted elements from newer styles like  industrial ,  alternative country  and  grunge . Young's profound influence on the latter caused some to dub him ""the godfather of grunge"".   Young has directed (or co-directed) a number of  films  using the  pseudonym  Bernard Shakey, including  Journey Through the Past  (1973),  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979),  Human Highway  (1982),  Greendale  (2003), and  CSNY Dj Vu  (2008). He is currently working on a documentary about electric car technology, tentatively titled  Linc/Volt . The project involves a 1959  Lincoln Continental  converted to hybrid technology, which Young plans to drive to  Washington, DC  as an example to lawmakers there. [ 2 ]   He is also an outspoken advocate for environmental issues and small farmers, having co-founded in 1985 the  benefit concert   Farm Aid , and in 1986 helped found The Bridge School, [ 3 ]  and its annual supporting  Bridge School Benefit  concerts, together with his wife Pegi (in this, Young's involvement stems at least partially from the fact that both of his sons have  cerebral palsy  and his daughter, like Young himself, has  epilepsy ).   Although Young sings as frequently about U.S. legends and myths ( Pocahontas ,  space stations , and the settlement of the American West) [ 4 ]  as he does about his native country, he remains a Canadian citizen and has never wanted to relinquish his Canadian citizenship. He has lived in the U.S. for ""so long"" and has stated he has ""got just as much right to vote in them (American elections) as anybody else.""

He spent his early years in the small country town of  Omemee , 130  kilometres  (81  mi ) northeast of Toronto.   Young was diagnosed with diabetes as a child [ 6 ]  and a bout of  polio  at the age of 6 left him with a weakened left side; he still walks with a slight limp.   His parents divorced when Young was 12, and he moved with his mother back to the family home of  Winnipeg , Manitoba, where the formative years of his music career began. Neil and his mother Rassy settled into the working class suburb of  Fort Rouge  where the shy, dry-humoured youth enrolled at Earl Grey Junior High School. It was there that he formed his first band  the Jades , and met  Ken Koblun , later to join him in the Squires.   While attending  Kelvin High School  in Winnipeg, he played in several instrumental rock bands. Young's first stable band was called the Squires, who had a local hit called ""The Sultan"". Young dropped out of high school [ 7 ]  and also played in  Fort William , where they recorded a series of demos produced by a local producer named Ray Dee, whom Young called ""the original Briggs."" [ 8 ]  While in Thunder Bay, Young first encountered  Stephen Stills . In the  2006  film  Heart of Gold  Young relates how he used to spend time as a teenager at  Falcon Lake, Manitoba  where he would endlessly plug coins into the jukebox to hear  Ian Tyson 's "" Four Strong Winds "". Neil also formed a friendship with musician  Randy Bachman .   After leaving the Squires, Neil worked folk clubs in Winnipeg, where he first met  Joni Mitchell . [ 9 ]  Here he wrote some of his earliest and most enduring folk songs such as the classic "" Sugar Mountain "", about his lost youth. Mitchell wrote ""The Circle Game"" in response. [ citation needed ]   In 1965 Young toured Canada as a solo artist. In 1966, he joined the  Rick James -fronted  Mynah Birds . The band managed to secure a record deal with the  Motown  label, but as their first album was being recorded, James was arrested for being  AWOL  from the army. [ 10 ]  After the Mynah Birds disbanded, Young and bass player  Bruce Palmer  relocated to  Los Angeles . Young has admitted in an interview that he was in the United States illegally until receiving a green card in 1970. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Buffalo Springfield   Once they reached Los Angeles, Young and Palmer met up with  Stephen Stills ,  Richie Furay , and  Dewey Martin  to form  Buffalo Springfield . A mixture of folk, country,  psychedelia , and rock lent a hard edge by the twin lead guitars of Stills and Young made Buffalo Springfield a critical success, and their first record  Buffalo Springfield  (1967) sold well after Stills' topical song "" For What It's Worth "" became a hit, aided by Young's melodic harmonics played on electric guitar.   Distrust of their management, as well as the arrest and deportation of Palmer, exacerbated the already strained relations among the group members and led to Buffalo Springfield's demise. A second album,  Buffalo Springfield Again , was released in late 1967, but two of Youngs three contributions were solo tracks recorded apart from the rest of the group.   In many ways, these three songs on  Buffalo Springfield Again  are harbingers of much of Young's later work in that, although they all share deeply personal, almost idiosyncratic lyrics, they also present three very different musical approaches to the arrangement of what is essentially an original folk song. ""Mr Soul"" is the only Young song of the three that all five members of the group perform together. In contrast, "" Broken Arrow "" was confessional folk rock of a kind that would characterize much of the music that emerged from the singer-songwriter movement. Youngs experimental production intersperses each verse with snippets of sound from other sources, including opening the song with a sound bite of Dewey Martin singing ""Mr. Soul"" and closing it with the thumping of a heartbeat. ""Expecting to Fly"" was a lushly produced  ballad  featuring a string arrangement that Young's co-producer for the track,  Jack Nitzsche , would dub ""symphonic pop.""   In May 1968, the band split up for good, but in order to fulfill a contractual obligation, a final album,  Last Time Around , was recorded, primarily from recordings made earlier that year. Young contributed the songs ""On the Way Home"" and ""I Am a Child"", singing lead on the latter. In 1997, the band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame; Young did not appear at the ceremony.     [ edit ]   Solo success & CSNY   After the breakup of Buffalo Springfield, Young signed a solo deal with  Reprise Records , home of his colleague and friend  Joni Mitchell , with whom he shared a manager, Elliot Roberts, who manages Young to this day. Young and Nitzsche immediately began work on Young's first solo record,  Neil Young  (November 1968), which received mixed reviews. In a 1970 interview, [ 12 ]  Young deprecated the album as being ""overdubbed rather than played,"" and the quest for music that expresses the spontaneity of the moment has long been a feature of his career. Nevertheless, the album contains some tunes that remain a staple of his live shows, most notably ""The Loner.""   For his next album, Young recruited three musicians from a band called The Rockets:  Danny Whitten  on guitar,  Billy Talbot  on bass guitar, and  Ralph Molina  on  drums . These three took the name  Crazy Horse  (after  the historical figure of the same name ), and  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere  (May 1969), is credited to ""Neil Young with Crazy Horse."" Recorded in just two weeks, the album opens with one of Young's most familiar songs, ""Cinnamon Girl,"" and is dominated by two more, ""Cowgirl in the Sand"" and ""Down by the River,"" that feature lengthy jams showcasing Young's idiosyncratic guitar soloing accompanied sympathetically by Crazy Horse. Young reportedly wrote all three songs on the same day, while nursing a high fever of 103 F (39.5 C) in bed.   Shortly after the release of  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere , Young reunited with Stephen Stills by joining  Crosby, Stills, & Nash , who had already released one album as a trio. Young was originally offered a position as a sideman, but agreed to join only if he received full membership, and the group - winners of the 1969 ""Best New Artist"" Grammy - was renamed Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. [ 13 ]  The quartet debuted in  Chicago  on  August 16 ,  1969 , and later performed at the famous  Woodstock Festival , during which Young skipped the acoustic set and refused to be filmed during the electric set, even telling the cameramen: ""One of you fuckin' guys comes near me and I'm gonna fuckin' hit you with my guitar"". [ 14 ]  During the making of their first album,  Dj Vu , the musicians frequently argued, particularly Young and Stills, who both fought for control. [ 15 ]   "" Ohio "" was written following the  Kent State massacre  on  May 4 ,  1970 , and was a staple of anti-war rallies in the 1970s. The song was quickly recorded by CSNY and immediately released as a single, even though CSNY's ""Teach Your Children"" was still climbing the singles charts. Many believe that the release of ""Ohio"" as a single cut into the sales of ""Teach Your Children"" and prevented that song from reaching the top ten. In the late 1970s and for much of the 1980s, Young refrained from performing ""Ohio"" live, as he considered the song to be dated. In the wake of the 1989  Tiananmen Square massacre , however, Young revived the song in concert, often dedicating it to the  Chinese  students who were killed in the massacre. Crosby, Stills & Nash, as a trio, also returned the song to their live repertoire around the same time, even though Young had provided the lead vocals on the original recording.   Also that year, Young released his third solo album,  After the Gold Rush  (1970), which featured, among others, a young  Nils Lofgren ,  Stephen Stills , and CSNY bassist Greg Reeves. Young also recorded some tracks with Crazy Horse, but dismissed them early in the sessions. Aided by his newfound fame with CSNY, the album was a commercial breakthrough for Young and contains some of his best known work. Notable tracks include the title track, with dream-like lyrics that run a gamut of subjects from drugs and interpersonal relationships to environmental concerns, as well as Youngs controversial and acerbic condemnation of  racism  in "" Southern Man ,"" which, along with a later song entitled ""Alabama,"" later prompted  Lynyrd Skynyrd  to decry Young by name in the lyrics to "" Sweet Home Alabama ."" Young was one of Skynyrd's biggest influences, and Young was an admirer of Skynyrd's music. The respectful rivalry and friendship between Young and Skynyrd front man  Ronnie Van Zant  would serve as a recurring theme in the  Drive-By Truckers ' 2001  concept album   Southern Rock Opera .   With CSNY splitting up and Crazy Horse having signed their own record deal, Young began the year 1971 with a solo tour entitled ""Journey Through the Past."" Later, he recruited a new group of country-music session musicians, whom he christened  The Stray Gators , to record much of the new material that had been premiered on tour for the album  Harvest  (1972).  Harvest  was a massive hit (especially with the country-music crowd) and ""Heart of Gold"" became a US number one single; incidentally, to this day it remains the only No. 1 hit in his long career.   Another notable song was "" The Needle and the Damage Done ,"" a somber lament on the pain caused by heroin addiction; inspired in part by the heavy heroin use of Crazy Horse member Danny Whitten, who would eventually die of an overdose. [ 16 ]   The album's success, however, caught Young off guard, and his first instinct was to back away from stardom. In the handwritten liner notes to the  Decade  compilation, Young described ""Heart of Gold"" as the song that ""put me in the middle of the road. Traveling there soon became a bore, so I headed for the ditch. A rougher ride but I saw more interesting people there.""   On  September 8 ,  1972 , the Academy Award-nominated actress  Carrie Snodgress , with whom he had been living, gave birth to Neil Young's first child. The boy, Zeke, was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Young fell in love with Snodgress after seeing her in a movie (""Diary of a Mad Housewife"") on television after which Young wrote the song "" A Man Needs a Maid "" from the Harvest album, featuring the lyric ""I fell in love with the actress/she was playing a part that I could understand.""     [ edit ]   The Ditch Trilogy   Although a new tour had been planned to follow up on the success of  Harvest , it became apparent during rehearsals that Danny Whitten could not function due to  drug abuse . On  November 18 , 1972, shortly after he was fired from the tour preparations, Whitten was found dead of an  overdose . Young described the incident to  Rolling Stone s  Cameron Crowe  in 1975:  [ 17 ]  ""[We] were rehearsing with him and he just couldn't cut it. He couldn't remember anything. He was too out of it. Too far gone. I had to tell him to go back to L.A. 'It's not happening, man. You're not together enough.' He just said, 'I've got nowhere else to go, man. How am I gonna tell my friends?' And he split. That night the coroner called me from L.A. and told me he'd ODed. That blew my mind. Fucking blew my mind. I loved Danny. I felt responsible. And from there, I had to go right out on this huge tour of huge arenas. I was very nervous and  insecure.""   The album made in the aftermath of this incident,  Time Fades Away  (1973), has often been described by Young as ""my least favourite record,"" and it is, in fact, one of only two of Youngs early recordings that has yet to be officially re-released on CD (the other being the soundtrack album  Journey Through the Past ). The album was recorded live over a tour where Young struggled with his voice and called  David Crosby  and  Graham Nash  to help perform the music. The tour featured  Linda Ronstadt  as the opening act.  Time Fades Away  occupies a unique position in Youngs discography as the first of three albums known collectively as the "" Ditch Trilogy .""   In the second half of 1973, Young formed The Santa Monica Flyers, with Crazy Horse's rhythm section augmented by Nils Lofgren on guitar. Deeply affected by the drug-induced deaths of Whitten and  roadie   Bruce Berry , Young recorded  Tonight's the Night . The album's dark tone and rawness caused Reprise to delay the release until two years later and only after being pressured by Young to do so. [ 18 ]  It received mixed reviews at the time, but is now regarded as a landmark album, thought by some to be a precursor to  punk rock . In Young's own opinion, it was the closest he ever came to art. [ 19 ]   While his record company delayed the release of  Tonight's the Night,  Young recorded  On the Beach  (1974), which dealt with themes such as the downside of fame and the Californian lifestyle. Like  Time Fades Away  and  Tonight's the Night , it sold poorly but eventually became a critical favourite, presenting some of Young's most original work. In a review of the 2003 re-release on CD of  On the Beach  Derek Svennungsen described the music as ""mesmerizing, harrowing, lucid, and bleary,"" [ 20 ] .     [ edit ]   Return to prominence   After completing  On the Beach , Young reunited with  Harvest  producer Elliot Mazer to record another acoustic album,  Homegrown . Most of the songs were written after Young's breakup with Snodgress, and thus the tone of the album was somewhat dark. Though the album was entirely completed, Young decided to drop the album and release  Tonight's the Night  instead, at the suggestion of  The Band  bassist  Rick Danko . [ 21 ]  Young further explained his move by saying: ""It was a little too personal... it scared me"". [ 22 ]          Neil Young in Austin, Texas on November 9, 1976       Young reformed Crazy Horse with  Frank Sampedro  on guitar as his backup band for  Zuma  (1975). Many of the songs are overtly concerned with failed relationships, and even the epic "" Cortez the Killer ,"" outwardly a retelling of the  Spanish conquest  of  Mexico  from the viewpoint of the  Aztecs , can be seen as an allegory of love lostsomething that didnt save it, however, from being banned in  Franco 's  Spain .   The following year, Young reunited with Stephen Stills for the album  Long May You Run  (1976), credited to  The Stills-Young Band ; the follow-up tour was ended midway through by Young, who sent Stills a  telegram  that read: ""Funny how some things that start spontaneously end that way. Eat a peach, Neil."" [ 23 ]   In 1976, Young performed with  The Band , Joni Mitchell, and other rock musicians in the high profile all-star concert  The Last Waltz . The release of  Martin Scorsese 's movie of the concert was delayed while Scorsese unwillingly re-edited it to obscure the lump of cocaine that was clearly visible hanging from Young's nose during his performance of  ""Helpless."" [ 24 ]  Young later said, ""I'm not proud of that,"" according to one of his biographers.   American Stars 'N Bars  (1977) contained two songs originally recorded for  Homegrown  album, ""Homegrown"" and ""Star of Bethelehem,"" as well as newer material, including the future concert staple "" Like A Hurricane "". Performers included  Linda Ronstadt ,  Emmylou Harris  and Young protg  Nicolette Larson  along with Crazy Horse. Also in 1977, Young released  Decade : a personally selected career summary of material spanning every aspect of his various interests and affiliations, including a handful of unreleased songs.  Comes a Time  (1978) also featured Nicolette Larson and Crazy Horse and became Young's most commercially accessible album in quite some time, marked by a return to his folk roots.   Young next set out on the lengthy ""Rust Never Sleeps"" tour, in which each concert was divided into a solo acoustic set and an electric set with Crazy Horse. Much of the electric set was later seen as a response to punk rock's burgeoning popularity. ""Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)"" compared the changing public perception of  Johnny Rotten  with that of the recently deceased  Elvis Presley , who himself had once been disparaged as a dangerous influence only to later become an  icon . Rotten, meanwhile, returned the favour by playing one of Young's records on a  London  radio show. The accompanying albums  Rust Never Sleeps  (new material, culled from live recordings, but featuring studio overdubs) and  Live Rust  (a mixture of old and new, and a genuine concert recording) captured the two sides of the concerts, with solo acoustic songs on side A, and fierce, uptempo, electric songs on side B. A movie version of the concerts, also called  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979), was directed by Young under the pseudonym Bernard Shakey.   Young was suddenly hip again, and the readers and critics of  Rolling Stone  voted him Artist Of The Year for 1979 (along with The Who), selected  Rust Never Sleeps  as Album Of The Year, and voted him Male Vocalist Of The Year as well.  The Village Voice , meanwhile, honored Young as the Artist of the Decade.     [ edit ]   1980s - Experimental years   The 1980s were a lean time for Young both critically and commercially. After providing the incidental music to a  biopic  of  Hunter S. Thompson  entitled  Where the Buffalo Roam , he recorded  Hawks & Doves  (1980), a folk/country record.  Re-ac-tor  (1981), once again with Crazy Horse, was a faade of distortion and feedback obscuring a relatively weak selection of songs, but his strangest record of the decade came with  Trans  (1982). Recorded partially with  vocoders ,  synthesizers , and other devices that modified instruments and vocals with electronic effects, it is sometimes considered an experiment related to finding a technology that would become a means to communicate for Youngs son (with his wife Pegi), Ben, who has severe  cerebral palsy  and cannot speak. Many fans were baffled by the radical forms of this album and  rockabilly -styled  Everybody's Rockin'  (1983), and record company head  David Geffen  even sued Young for making ""unrepresentative"" musici.e. music that did not sound like Neil Youngthat deliberately lacked commercial appeal. [ 25 ]  Young later stated that he would have preferred to release the songs featuring the  synclavier  and  vocoder  as an EP, and that their inclusion with the Hawaiian-themed rockabilly was a mistake. Also premiered at this time though little seen was an eclectic full-length comedy film  Human Highway  starring, co-directed and co-written by Young.   In 1983, Young worked with British video director  Tim Pope , making two videos - ""Wonderin'"" and ""Cry, Cry, Cry.""   In 1985, he reunited with Crosby, Stills and Nash at  Live Aid  at Philadelphia's  John F. Kennedy Stadium . The two songs that they played, ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"" and "" Daylight Again /Find The Cost of Freedom,"" were the first songs they had played as a quartet in front of a paying audience since 1974.   Old Ways  (1985) saw a return to country music, recorded with a group of friends and session musicians.  Landing on Water  (1986) is entertaining for the blending of synthesizers and other instruments related to the 1980s into Youngs own style, with lyrics that take pot shots at some favourite targets, including CSN in ""Hippie Dream,"" with a chorus that goes: ""But the wooden ships/Were just a hippie dream,"" and David Geffen in ""Drifter,"" with the line: ""Dont try to tell me what I gotta do to fit."" The resumption of his partnership with Crazy Horse on  Life  (1987) fulfilled his contract with Geffen, and Young was finally able to switch labels.   Director Pope again made a series of videos from the album, including ""Touch the Night"" and ""People on the Street"".   Signing with  Warner Brothers  (which distributed Geffen at the time) and returning to Reprise Records, Young produced  This Note's For You  (1988) with a new band, The Bluenotes, whose name rights were owned by musician  Harold Melvin . Young named his band after a cafe called the Blue Note on Main Street in Winnipeg Manitoba, where he had played. The addition of a  brass  section provided a new  jazzier  sound and the title track became his first hit single of the decade. Accompanied by a video which parodied corporate rock, the pretensions of advertising and  Michael Jackson  in particular, the song was initially banned by  MTV  (although the Canadian music channel,  MuchMusic  ran it immediately) before being put into heavy rotation and finally given the  MTV Video Music Award for Best Video of the Year  for 1989. After Melvin sued over the use of the Bluenotes name, Young renamed his back-up group ""Ten Men Workin'"" for the balance of the concert tour.   Young also contributed to that year's CSNY reunion  American Dream  (1988) and CSNY played a few benefit concerts. Young, however, refused to book a full tour with CSN and the foursome would not embark upon a nationwide tour until 2000.     [ edit ]   1990s - Return to country-rock roots   Freedom  was a mixture of acoustic and electric rock dealing with the state of the U.S. and the world in 1989, alongside a set of love songs and a version of the standard ""On Broadway."" "" Rockin' in the Free World "", two versions of which bookended the album, again caught the mood. Some say it became a  de facto  anthem during the fall of the  Berlin Wall , a few months after the record's release. However, most Germans don't remember the song being related to the unification, understandably so, since the lyrics are not about political repression. Like  Bruce Springsteen 's "" Born in the U.S.A. "", the anthemic use of this song was based on largely ignoring the verses, which evoke social problems and implicitly criticize American government policies. In mid-1989, record executive  Terry Tolkin  conceived and produced a tribute album to Young's songs called  The Bridge: A Tribute To Neil Young,  released on his  No.6 Records  label. It featured cover versions of 15 of Young's songs by the cream of the up and coming  Alternative Music  and  Grunge music  bands including  Sonic Youth ,  Nick Cave ,  Soul Asylum ,  Dinosaur Jr ,and  The Pixies . By 1990,  grunge music  was beginning to make its first inroads in the charts and many of its prime movers, including  Nirvana 's  Kurt Cobain  and  Pearl Jam 's  Eddie Vedder , cited Young as a major influence.   Using a barn on his  Northern California  ranch as a studio, he rapidly recorded  Ragged Glory  with Crazy Horse, whose guitar riffs and feedback driven sound showed his new admirers that he could still cut it. Young then headed back out on the road with Orange Country country-punk band  Social Distortion  and  alternative rock  elder statesmen  Sonic Youth  as support, much to the consternation of many of his old fans. [ 26 ] [ 27 ]  Yet the influence of Sonic Youth could be clearly heard on the accompanying home video and live album,  Weld , which also included a bonus CD entitled  Arc , a single 35-minute-long collage of  feedback  and guitar noise that Neil included, evidently at the suggestion of Sonic Youth's  Thurston Moore . [ 28 ]   Arc  was later sold separately.   Young's next move was another return to country music.  Harvest Moon  (1992) was the long-awaited sequel to  Harvest  and reunited him with some of the musicians from that session, as well as singers  Linda Ronstadt  and  James Taylor . The title track was a minor hit and the record was reviewed and sold equally well, containing songs such as ""From Hank to  Hendrix "" and ""Unknown Legend"", a tribute to his wife. His resurgent popularity saw him booked on  MTV Unplugged  in 1993. In 1992 he accompanied fellow  Winnipegger   Randy Bachman  on ""Prairie Town,"" a song that recounts their days in the Winnipeg music scene of the 1960s. That year, he contributed music to the  soundtrack  of the  Jonathan Demme  movie  Philadelphia , and his song ""Philadelphia"" was nominated for the  Academy Award for Best Song , losing out to Bruce Springsteen's contribution to the same film. A summer tour covering both Europe and North America with  Booker T. and the MGs  (with whom he played two songs at a 1992  Bob Dylan  tribute concert at  Madison Square Garden ) was widely praised as a triumph. On a few of these dates, the show ended with a rendition of ""Rockin' in the Free World"" played with  Pearl Jam .   Young was back with Crazy Horse for 1994's  Sleeps with Angels , a much darker record. The title track told the story of  Kurt Cobain 's death; Young had reportedly made repeated attempts to contact Cobain prior to this event. [ 29 ]  Cobain had quoted Young's ""It's better to burn out than fade away"" (a line from "" My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue) "") in his alleged  suicide note , causing Young to emphasize the line ""'cause once you're gone you can't come back"" in live performances at the time. Other songs dealt with drive-by shootings (""Driveby""),  environmentalism  (""Piece of Crap"") and Young's own vision of America (the archetypal car metaphor of ""Trans Am""). Young was inspired to make the record after viewing Cobain's performance on  MTV Unplugged . Still admired by the prime movers of grunge, Young eventually performed with Pearl Jam at the MTV Music Awards during what was described as the highlight of a lackluster show. [ 30 ]  Their collaboration led to a joint tour, with the band and producer  Brendan O'Brien  backing Young. The accompanying album,  Mirror Ball  (1995), recorded as live in the studio captured their loose rock sound, and featured the standout track ""I'm the Ocean"". The year of 1995 also featured Young's entry into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .   After composing an abstract, distorted feedback-led guitar instrumental soundtrack to  Jim Jarmusch 's  acid western  film  Dead Man  Young recorded a series of loose jams with Crazy Horse that eventually appeared as the critically denigrated  Broken Arrow . The return to Crazy Horse was prompted by the death of mentor, friend, and longtime  producer   David Briggs  in late 1995. The subsequent tours of Europe and North America in 1996 resulted in both a live album and a tour documentary directed by  Jim Jarmusch . Both releases took the name  Year of the Horse .   In 1997, Young participated in the  H.O.R.D.E. Festival 's sixth annual tour.   In 1998, Young shared the stage with the rock band  Phish  at the annual  Farm Aid  concert, and later offered them an opportunity to headline both nights of the Bridge School Benefit concert. Phish took Young up on his offer to headline the Bridge School Benefit (where Young joined Phish for renditions of ""Helpless"" and ""I Shall Be Released."" [ 31 ]  Phish, however, declined Young's later invitation to be his backing band on a 1999 tour. [ 32 ]   The decade ended with  Looking Forward , another reunion with Crosby, Stills and Nash. The subsequent tour of the United States and Canada with the reformed super quartet was a huge success and brought in earnings of $42.1 million, making it the eighth largest grossing tour of 2000.   Young's next album,  Silver & Gold  (2000), contained a number of understated songs with personal lyrics, which was promoted through a mini-tour of solo acoustic shows. This style was continued in  Are You Passionate?  (2002), an album of love songs dedicated to his wife, Pegi.     [ edit ]   In the aftermath of 9/11   Young's 2001 single "" Let's Roll "", was a tribute to the victims of the  September 11, 2001 attacks , and the passengers and crew on  Flight 93  in particular. At the "" America: A Tribute to Heroes "" concert he performed  John Lennon's  "" Imagine "". In 2002,  Q  magazine  named Neil Young in their list of the ""50 Bands To See Before You Die.""   Young hauled out his concept album  Greendale , about an extended family in a small town called Greendale, and how they are torn apart by a murder, in 2003.  Greendale  was recorded with Crazy Horse members Billy Talbot and Ralph Molina. This tale of the Green family also resulted in a movie called  Greendale , written and directed by Young (again using his ""Bernard Shakey"" pseudonym) and starring a few of his friends, who act out and  lip sync  the songs from the album. The film was indeed thoroughly experimental, from Young's rambling on-stage between-song narratives, to his reading apparent transcriptions of these ramblings in the liner notes. ""When I was writing this I had no idea what I was doing, so I was just as surprised as you are,"" Young said later. Young toured extensively with the  Greendale  material throughout 2003 and 2004, first with a solo, acoustic version in Europe, then with a full-cast stage show in North America,  Japan , and  Australia . While audience reaction was sometimes mixed (drunken requests for ""Southern Man"" being an aesthetic impediment at most Young performances), the live stage version of Greendale was for many critics the most satisfying incarnation of the material, and bootlegs of the shows have been widely traded. The second half of each concert consisted of high-decibel renditions of Young classics such as ""Hey Hey, My My,"" ""Cinnamon Girl,"" ""Powderfinger,"" and  Rockin' in the Free World , as well as rarities such as ""The Losing End,"" ""The Old Country Waltz,"" and ""Danger Bird.""   Young spent the latter portion of 2004 giving a series of intimate acoustic concerts in various cities with his wife, Pegi, who is a trained vocalist and guitar player.     [ edit ]   Recent events          From left, Emmylou Harris, Neil Young and Pegi Young perform in  Neil Young: Heart of Gold , which offered renditions of some of Young's best-known songs.       On  March 31 ,  2005 , Young was admitted to a hospital in New York for treatment for a brain  aneurysm . He was treated successfully by a minimally invasive  neuroradiological  procedure. Prior to undergoing the procedure, he wrote the first eight songs of a new album,  Prairie Wind , in  Nashville , with session musicians that included regular Young sideman  Ben Keith  on lap and  pedal steel guitars . Two days after the procedure, Young was forced to cancel a scheduled appearance on the  Juno Awards  telecast in Winnipeg when the area where the surgeons did his procedure (via the  femoral artery ) suddenly began to bleed. While Young finally was able to return to Winnipeg in 2006 with Crosby, Stills and Nash, his first post-aneurysm performance was on  July 2 ,  2005 , at the close of the  Live 8  concert in  Barrie, Ontario . There, he debuted a new song, a soft hymn called ""When God Made Me.""   On  September 28 ,  2005 ,  Prairie Wind  was released. In an interview given to  Time  magazine , Young revealed that he had planned to keep the news of his aneurysm private until he had the bleeding scare, after which he decided to make news of his condition public. The last two songs on the album were written after his aneurysm procedure, and several of the songs, such as ""Fallin' Off the Face of the Earth,"" seem to be inspired by Young's brush with  mortality , the recent death of his father, who suffered from  senile dementia , and Young's  Manitoba  roots.   In 2006,  Neil Young: Heart of Gold , a film made by  Jonathan Demme , premiered at the  Sundance Film Festival . Filmed over two nights at the  Ryman Auditorium  in  Nashville, Tennessee  during the premiere of  Prairie Wind , it includes both new and old songs as well as behind-the scenes-commentary by Young, his wife Pegi, and members of Young's session band.   In April 2006, Young announced the release of  Living with War , an album of protest songs that included the provocatively-titled "" Let's Impeach the President ."" Recorded using his famous  Les Paul  electric guitar, "" Old Black ,"" along with Chad Cromwell (drums), Rick Rosas (bass), and Tommy Brea (trumpet), the album was intended to be a stinging rebuke of U.S. President  George W. Bush  and the  War in Iraq . The album was recorded in a two week period in April, and was then made available over the internet from 28 April 2006 before being released as a CD on 5 May.  Living With War  was Young's most talked about release for years, creating heated political debate and a return to form with perhaps his most critically-acclaimed album since the early 1990s.  Living With War: In the Beginning , a remixed version with the original album's choral backing vocals removed, was released in December of the same year. Its accompanying DVD featured videos directed by Young of every song on the album, footage of the  Iraq War  and demonstrations in the US, and clips from  Al Gore 's  An Inconvenient Truth .          Neil Young on the CSNY ""Freedom Of Speech Tour '06""       From July through September of 2006, Neil Young reunited with his former bandmates from  Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young  for the ""Freedom Of Speech Tour '06"" across North America. Chad Cromwell and Rick Rosas made up the band's rhythm section. The entire  Living with War  album was performed on the tour, in addition to other CSN and Neil Young classics such as "" Ohio "" and "" Rockin' in the Free World ."" An accompanying concert film and live album, called  CSNY Deja Vu , were premiered on January 25, 2008, at the Sundance Movie Festival.   2006 also saw the first release from Young's long awaited  Archives  project, as  Live at the Fillmore East , a selection of songs drawn from a 1970 gig with  Crazy Horse , was released in November of that year. The release was marked as number two in the  Archives Performance Series , leaving room for the still-unreleased 1969  Riverboat  bootleg, which will be number one in the series. In March 2007, another historical live album, marked as the third in the  Performance Series , was released. Titled  Live at Massey Hall 1971 , it featured a solo acoustic set from Toronto's Massey Hall, including material from the upcoming  Harvest  album.   On  August 15 ,  2007 , Young played a new album for 100 people at Reprise Records entitled  Chrome Dreams II .  Chrome Dreams  was an album he scrapped in 1977, and the name of two different bootlegs. The new album includes two long songs that time in at 18:13 (""Ordinary People"") and 14:31 (""No Hidden Path""), respectively. The album consists of three songs written previously and seven new songs, all by Young. The album was released on October 23, 2007, timed to coincide with a seven-week tour that had kicked off in Boise, Idaho, ten days earlier.   On February 11, 2008, Neil Young started the European leg of his tour with a concert in  Antwerp ,  Belgium . On July 17, he was interviewed on  PBS  by  Charlie Rose , where he spoke about many things, including his project to make a hybrid 1959 Lincoln. [ 33 ]  In October, a BBC 4 documentary ""Neil Young - Don't be Denied"" was shown, featuring interviews with Neil and a number of his contemporaries. It also summarizes his biography and motivations. [ 34 ]   The latest album in the Performance Series,  Sugar Mountain - Live At Canterbury House 1968  was released on December 2, 2008. Featuring material from Young's earliest solo performances recorded in Ann Arbor, MI November 9, 1968, the album was released as number zero in the  Performance Series .   The first installment of Young's oft-delayed box set  The Archives Vol. 1 1963-1972  was officially announced in 2008 with a trailer.  [ 35 ]   [ 36 ]  The first set of Archives will feature both DVD and Blu-ray editions which will include 128 audio tracks (43 unreleased and 13 never before heard songs), thousands of images (photos, lyrics, letters and memorabilia), and hours of new, previously released and rare videos. Also included will be a 236 page hardbound book. The Blu-ray edition will have HD picture, pristine audio mastered and presented in 24bit 192 khz., and access to photos, trivia and memorabilia without stopping the music. It is currently scheduled for release in 2009.   A Spring 2009 date has been set for Neil's new album 'A Fork in The Road', which will delay the release of the Archives until later in 2009.   Young currently lives on a 1500-acre (6 km) ranch in  La Honda, California , called Broken Arrow. He also owns property in  Fort Lauderdale, Florida , and on the islands of  Hawaii .   Young headlined the 2009  Big Day Out  festival in  New Zealand  and  Australia . Young pushed other current mainstream bands to only secondary headlining, including  Arctic Monkeys  and  The Ting Tings . He will also headline the Friday at  Glastonbury Festival  which has attempted to book him for many years. Although not officially confirmed, a number of sources have suggested this. [ 37 ]     [ edit ]   Influence, importance and inspiration   Neil Young has undeniably been an important artist in the history of American and Canadian popular music and remains a distinct influence upon other recording artists.  Lynyrd Skynyrd s "" Sweet Home Alabama "" was written in response to two of Neil Youngs songs ""Southern Man"" and ""Alabama"". ""Ohio"" which Young recorded with Crosby, Stills and Nash, was a recollection of the tragic events that transpired at Kent State University in May 1970. Young's willingness to be politically outspoken and socially conscious allowed him to influence such important artists such as  Phish ,  Pearl Jam , and  Nirvana . Neil Young is referred to as ""the Godfather of  Grunge "" because of the influence he had on  Kurt Cobain  and  Eddie Vedder  and the entire grunge movement. Kurt Cobain quoted Neil Young in his suicide note, using the line Its better to burn out, than to fade away from Youngs song ""My My, Hey Hey (Out Of The Blue)"". Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam inducted Neil Young into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, citing him as a huge influence. He has also been a big influence on  experimental rock  acts like  Sonic Youth  and  Radiohead . Youngs influence, importance and inspiration within the music scene derive in part from his longevity because of a career spanning more than four decades. His first album was released in 1966 and his latest in 2008.  Bob Dylan 's influence on Young has been so obvious that the former once lambasted: "" Heart of Gold  bothered me every time it came on the radio ... and I'd say, 'Shit, that's me. If it sounds like me it might as well be me. (...) It seemed somebody else had taken my thing and had run away with it, you know, and I never got over it. Maybe tomorrow"" [ 38 ] . The Dutch guitar virtuoso  Jan Akkerman  described a typical electric guitar solo by Young as the sound of ""a Belgian  vibrator "" in a 1994 TV documentary, adding that it somehow became more palatable when one saw Young's grimace to accompany it  [ 39 ] .   The Australian rock group  Powderfinger  attribute their group name to their love of Young.   Toronto  based band  Constantines  recorded a version of Neil's  Fuckin' Up  in  Winnipeg , [ 40 ] which surfaced at the b-side the their ""Our Age"" 7"" [ 41 ] in November 2008. The members of the  Constantines  have occasionally played shows under the name Horsey Craze [ 42 ] , singing Neil Young songs. In early 2006, they released a vinyl only split-album with The Unintended. The Constantines recorded four Neil Young songs for the LP, while The Unintended performed four Gordon Lightfoot songs.   While in Winnipeg on November 2, 2008 during the Canadian leg of his tour,  Bob Dylan  visited the former home of Neil Young in River Heights. The home was where Neil spent some of his teenage years. Dylan was interested in seeing the room where some of Neils first songs were composed.     [ edit ]   Achievements   Young was inducted into the  Canadian Music Hall of Fame  in 1982. He has been inducted into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  twice: first in 1995 for his solo work, with an induction speech given by  Eddie Vedder , and again in 1997 as a member of Buffalo Springfield.   He has also directed five movies under his pseudonym Bernard Shakey, and released them through his own Shakey Pictures imprint:  Journey Through the Past  (1973),  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979)  Human Highway  (1982) (starring new wave band  Devo ), and  Greendale  (2003) and the documentary,  CSNY Deja Vu  (2008). The bonus  DVDs  included in both versions of  Greendale  and in  Prairie Wind  are also directed by Young under the Bernard Shakey alias, and all of Young's home video and DVD releases have been co-released under the Shakey Pictures imprint.   As one of the original founders of  Farm Aid , he remains an active member of the board of directors. For one weekend each October, in  Mountain View, California , he and his wife host the  Bridge School Concerts , which have been drawing international talent and sell-out crowds for nearly two decades with some of the biggest names in rock having performed at the event including  Bruce Springsteen ,  David Bowie ,  The Who ,  Red Hot Chili Peppers ,  Trent Reznor  of  Nine Inch Nails ,  Pearl Jam ,  Sonic Youth  and Sir  Paul McCartney . The concerts are a benefit for the  Bridge School , which develops and uses advanced technologies to aid in the instruction of children with disabilities. Young's involvement stems at least partially from the fact that both of his sons have  cerebral palsy  and his daughter, like Young himself, has  epilepsy .   Young was nominated for an  Oscar  in 1994 for his song ""Philadelphia"" from the film  Philadelphia  (Bruce Springsteen won the award for his song "" Streets of Philadelphia "" from the same film). In his acceptance speech, Springsteen said that ""the award really deserved to be shared by the other nominee's song."" That same night,  Tom Hanks  accepted the Oscar for Best Actor and gave credit for his inspiration to the song ""Philadelphia"".   He was part owner of  Lionel, LLC , a company that makes toy trains and model railroad accessories. [ 43 ]  In 2008 Lionel emerged from bankruptcy and his shares of the company were wiped out. At this time his status with Lionel is unknown, according to Lionel CEO Jerry Calabrese he is still a consultant for Lionel. He was instrumental in the design of the Lionel Legacy control system for model trains [ 43 ]  and it is believed he will continue to develop the system. Young has been named as co-inventor on seven U.S. Patents related to model trains. [ 44 ]   Young has twice received honorary doctorates. He received an Honorary Doctorate of Music from  Lakehead University  in  Thunder Bay ,  Ontario  in 1992, and an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from  San Francisco State University  in 2006. The latter honour was shared with his wife Pegi for their creation of the Bridge School.   In a ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"" list in the June 1996 issue of  Mojo  magazine , Young was ranked No. 9.   In 2003, Rolling Stone listed Young at #83 in its rankings of ""The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time,"" describing him as a ""restless experimenter...who transform[s] the most obvious music into something revelatory."" [ 45 ]   In 2000, Young was inducted into  Canada's Walk of Fame . [ 46 ]  He ranked No. 39 on  VH1 's 100 Greatest Artist of Hard Rock  that same year.   In 2001, Young was awarded the Spirit of Liberty award from the civil liberties group  People for the American Way .   In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked Neil Young [ 47 ]  #34 on their list of the  100 Greatest Artists of All Time . [ 48 ]   In 2006, Paste Magazine compiled a ""Greatest Living Songwriters"" list; Young was ranked No. 2 behind  Bob Dylan . (While Young and Dylan have occasionally played together in concert, they have never collaborated on a song together, or played on each others' records).   In 2008, Rolling Stone ranked Young at #37 in its list of ""The 100 Greatest Singers of All-Time. [ 49 ]   Jason Bond, an  East Carolina University  biologist, discovered a new species of trapdoor spider in 2007, and named it  Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi  after Young, his favorite singer. [ 50 ]     [ edit ]   Instruments          Neil Young, 2008 in  Florence       Neil Young is a collector of second-hand guitars, but in recording and performing, he frequently uses just a few instruments. As explained by his longtime guitar technician  Larry Cragg  in the film  Neil Young: Heart of Gold , they include:     1953  Gibson Les Paul Goldtop Nicknamed "" Old Black "", this is Young's primary  electric guitar  and is featured on  Rust Never Sleeps  and most other albums. Old Black got its name from a purely amateur paintjob applied to the originally-gold body of the instrument, sometime before Neil acquired the guitar in the late 1960s. In 1972, a mini- humbucker  pickup from a  Gibson Firebird  guitar was installed into the lead/treble position, replacing a  P-90  as standard on Les Paul guitars from that era. This pickup, severely  microphonic , is considered a crucial component of Neil's sound. A  Bigsby vibrato tailpiece  was installed as early as 1969 on the guitar, and can be heard clearly during the opening of ""Cowgirl in the Sand"" from  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere . This guitar also features a mini-switch that is used to send the signal from the mini-humbucker direct to the amp, without going through the volume or tone controls. A Les Paul Gold Top of the same year as Old Black was assembled by Neil's guitar tech, using same style Firebird pick up in the guitar as well as the same model Bigsby Vib; but, according to Young, was just not the same as the original. Young acquired Old Black from Jim Messina, swapping one of his Gretches for it in 1969 while Messina was assisting Young on his first solo album. Messina, who played briefly in Buffalo Springfield and produced the band's final album, ""Last Time Around,"" still has the Gretch in his possession.       Martin D-45 His primary  steel-string acoustic guitar ; used to write ""Old Man"" and many other hit songs.   Martin D-28Nicknamed ""Hank"" after its previous owner,  Hank Williams . The guitar came into Young's possession after  Hank Williams, Jr.  had traded it to another owner for some shotguns and it went through a succession of other owners until it was located by Young's longtime friend Grant Boatwright. The guitar was purchased by Young from  Tut Taylor . Young has toured with it for over 30 years. A story about the guitar and inspired song known as ""This Old Guitar"" can be seen about 50 minutes into the film  Neil Young: Heart of Gold . It is Young's primary guitar for the album,  Prairie Wind .   Neil Young can be seen playing a Vagabond Travel Guitar as he sings ""Let's Impeach the President"" on  The Colbert Report  on  Comedy Central .   A 12-string Taylor 855 is used in the first half of the soundtrack and concert film ""Rust Never Sleeps""   1927  Gibson  MastertoneA six-string  banjo , tuned like a guitar. It has been used on many recordings and was played by  James Taylor  on ""Old Man"".   Various vintage  Fender Tweed Deluxe  amplifiers Young's preferred amplifier for electric guitar is the diminutive Fender Deluxe, specifically a Tweed-era model from 1959. Neil purchased his first vintage Deluxe in 1967 for $50 from the drummer of Crazy Horse, Ralph Molina, and has since acquired nearly 450 different examples, all from the same era, but he maintains that it's the original model that sounds superior, and is a crucial component to his trademark sound. The Tweed Deluxe is almost always used in conjunction with a late-1950's Magnatone 280 (similar to the amp used by Lonnie Mack and Buddy Holly). The Magnatone and the Deluxe are paired together in a somewhat unique manner - the external speaker jack from the Deluxe sends the amped signal through a volume potentiometr and directly into the input of the Magnatone. The Magnatone is notable for its true pitch-bending vibrato capabilities, which can be heard as an electric piano amplifier on ""See the Sky About to Rain"". A notable and unique accessory to Young's Deluxe is the Whizzer, a device created specifically for Young, which physically changes the amplifier's settings to pre-set combinations. It has gone through many incarnations.   Gretsch 6120  (Chet Atkins)Before Young bought Old Black, this was his primary electric guitar used during his  Buffalo Springfield  days.   Gretsch White Falcon   Late '50s hollow body that Young purchased near the end of the  Buffalo Springfield  era; in 1969 Young acquired a stereo version of the same vintage guitar from Stills, and this instrument is featured prominently during Young's early '70s period, and can be heard on tracks like ""Ohio,"" ""Southern Man,"" ""Alabama,"" ""L.A.,"" others. It is Neil's primary electric guitar during the  Harvest  era. This particular White Falcon is the stereo 6137, in which the signal from the three bass strings is separated from the signal from the three treble strings. Young typically plays this guitar in this stereo mode, sending the separate signals to two different amps: the Fender Deluxe and typcially to either a Fender Tremolux or a low-powered Tweed Fender Twin. The separation of the signals is most prominantly heard on the Harvest album song ""Words"".   Neil Young replaced his trademark Les Paul for a Gibson Flying V on the ""Time Fades Away"" tour.   Neil Young played a  Fender Broadcaster  on the Tonight's the Night tour and album.

It was subsequently performed live, with elaborate theatrical effects, and made into  a film .   Following in the footsteps of their previous albums,  The Wall  is a  concept album   specifically, it deals largely with the theme of  isolation  from one's peers. The concept was largely inspired by the band's  1977  tour promoting the album  Animals , with regards to an incident where  Roger Waters ' frustration with the audience reached a point where Waters spat in the face of a fan who was attempting to climb on stage; this, in turn, led him to lament that such a wall exists. With its significantly darker theme,  The Wall  featured a notably harsher and more theatrical sound than their previous releases.   The Wall  is a  rock opera  that centres on the character ""Pink"". Largely based on Waters' personal life, Pink struggles in life from an early age, having lost his father in war ("" Another Brick in the Wall  (Part 1)""), abused by teachers ("" The Happiest Days of Our Lives ""), nurtured by an overprotective mother ("" Mother ""), and deserted by his wife later on ("" Don't Leave Me Now "")  all of which factored into Pink's mental isolation from society, figuratively referred to as ""The Wall"".   In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine listed  The Wall  as #87 in  Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time .           Contents       1   Recording history   2   Concept and storyline   3   Film version   4   Reception   5   Post-split   6   Track listing   7   Singles   8   Charts     8.1   Album   8.2   Singles       9   Awards   10   Personnel   11   References   12   External links               [ edit ]   Recording history   In 1977, Pink Floyd were promoting  Animals  with their  In The Flesh  tour. There are two different accounts of what happened at the show in  Montreal, Canada  that inspired Waters to write ""The Wall"". The first is from The Wall Live booklet where Waters states that a fan was trying to climb the netting between the audience and the band. The second is from Nick Mason's book ""Inside Out"". He states that a fan was yelling at Roger for them to play ""Careful with that Axe, Eugene"". In the end of both accounts Waters spits in the face of the fan.  [ 1 ]  The album was recorded at four studios over eight months, owing to English tax laws and to benefit from the cheaper recording costs in the South of France. Tensions between Waters and the band were increasing significantly, largely due to his dominance over the rest of the band. During the recording, Waters dismissed  Richard Wright , and told him to leave immediately after  The Wall  was finished, arguing that Wright was not contributing much, in part owing to a  cocaine  addiction. [ citation needed ]  Waters claimed that  David Gilmour  and  Nick Mason  had supported his decision to fire Wright, but in 2000, Gilmour stated that he and Mason were against Wright's dismissal. [ citation needed ]  In his book  Inside Out ,  Nick Mason  claims that Wright was fired because Columbia Records had offered Waters a substantial bonus to finish the album in time for a 1979 release. Since Wright refused to return early from his summer holiday, Waters wanted to dismiss Wright. [ 2 ]  However, he returned for their live performances as a paid musician.   For "" Another Brick in the Wall  (Part II)"", Pink Floyd needed to record a school  choir , so they approached music teacher Alun Renshaw of  Islington Green School , around the corner from their  Britannia Row Studios . The chorus was  overdubbed  twelve times to give the impression that the choir was larger. The choir were not allowed to hear the rest of the song after singing the chorus. Though the school received a lump sum payment of   1000, there was no contractual arrangement for royalties. Under 1996  UK  copyright law, they became eligible, and after choir members were tracked down by royalties agent Peter Rowan of  RBL Music , through the website  Friends Reunited , they claimed the money. [ 3 ]  Music industry professionals estimated that each student would be owed around 500. [ 4 ]   Originally released on  Columbia Records  in the U.S. and  Harvest Records  in the UK,  The Wall  was then re-released as a  digitally remastered   CD  in 1994 in the UK on  EMI . In 1997, Columbia Records issued an updated remaster in the United States, Canada, Australia, South America and Japan. For  The Wall' s 20th Anniversary in April 2000,  Capitol Records  in the U.S. and EMI in Canada, Australia, South America and Japan re-released the 1997 remaster with the artwork from the EMI Europe remaster.  The Wall  was the first Pink Floyd album since 1967's  The Piper at the Gates of Dawn  whose cover was not done by  Storm Thorgerson  and  Hipgnosis . Instead,  Gerald Scarfe  designed the cover and gatefold sleeve. David Gilmour recalls Storm Thorgerson falling out with Roger Waters over issues such as the credit for the  Animals  sleeve design. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Concept and storyline                       ""Isn't this where...we came in?""                     The last second of  Outside the Wall  and the first second of  In the Flesh?                     Problems listening to this file? See  media help .       The album's overriding themes are the causes and implications of self-imposed isolation, symbolized by the metaphorical  wall  of the title. The album's songs create a very loose storyline sketching events in the life of the protagonist, Pink. Pink loses his father as a child (Waters's own father was killed in  Anzio  during  World War II ), is smothered by his overprotective mother, and is oppressed at school by tyrannical, abusive teachers, each of these traumas becoming ""another brick in the wall"". As an adult Pink becomes a rock star, but his relationships are marred by infidelity and outbursts of violence. As his marriage crumbles, Pink finishes building the wall and completes his isolation from human contact.   Pink's mindset deteriorates behind his freshly completed wall, with his personal crisis culminating during an onstage performance. Hallucinating, Pink believes that he is a fascist dictator, and his concerts are like  Neo-Nazi  rallies where he sets his men on fans he considers unworthy, only to have his conscience rebel at this and put himself on trial, his inner judge ordering him to ""tear down the wall"" in order to open himself to the outside world, and apologizing to his closest friends who are hurt most by his self-isolation. At this point the album's end runs into its beginning with the closing words ""Isn't this where...""; the first song on the album, "" In the Flesh? "", begins with the words ""...we came in?""  with a continuation of the melody of the last song, "" Outside the Wall ""  hinting at the cyclical nature of Waters's theme.   The LP's sleeve art and custom picture labels by  Gerald Scarfe  tied in with the album's concept. Side one had a quarter of the wall erected and a sketch of the teacher. Side two saw half of the wall erected and a sketch of the wife. Side three had three-quarters of the wall erected and a sketch of the character of Pink, while side four had the wall completely erected and a sketch of the prosecutor. Bob Ezrin played a major part in taking Waters's demo material and clarifying the storyline by writing a script, which even called for additional songs to complete the plot. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Film version       Main article:  Pink Floyd The Wall (film)       A film version of  The Wall  was released in 1982 entitled  Pink Floyd The Wall , directed by  Alan Parker  and starring  Bob Geldof . The screenplay was written by Roger Waters. The film features music from the original album, much of which was re-recorded by the band with additional orchestration, some with minor lyrical and musical changes.   Originally the film was intended to be intercut with concert footage and a few of the live shows were actually filmed, but subsequently not used in the film at all. Footage from these concerts has appeared on different websites from time to time and on  YouTube . However, an official release of this footage by Pink Floyd has not been authorized other than what was used in the documentary  Behind the Wall .     [ edit ]   Reception   Immensely successful upon release,  The Wall  quickly jumped to #1 on the  Billboard 200  in the U.S in its fourth week (it debuted at #53) and #3 in the  U.K. . Its worldwide sales are estimated at 15 million copies (30 million units), and in the U.S. it has achieved 23 times platinum (for sales of 11.5 million double-disc sets [ 6 ] ; statistics mistakenly identifying  The Wall  as the best selling multiple-disc album of all-time in the U.S. and third best-selling album by any artist in the U.S. do not take into account that double albums count as two platinum sales), and is their second best-selling album in the U.S. after  The Dark Side of the Moon . It was among the most popular albums of the early 1980s, to the extent that film director  Alan Parker  created  a film based on it . The album had a string of hit singles, with "" Another Brick in the Wall Part 2 "" being their only song to hit #1 on the Billboard.   In addition to its commercial success, critical reception of  The Wall  was, and remains, mostly positive.  Carlo Twist  of  Blender  gave it 5 stars out of a possible 5, stating that, ""For all its pomp and lofty ambition, theres a streak of almost punk-rock venom within, not to mention some of the bands best humping, thumping heavy rock."" [ 7 ]   Stephen Thomas Erlewine  of  AllMusic Guide  was slightly more critical, but nevertheless said that, ""its seamless surface, blending melodic fragments and sound effects, makes the musical shortcomings and questionable lyrics easy to ignore."" [ 8 ]   Kurt Loder  of  Rolling Stone  remarked, "" The Wall  is the most startling rhetorical achievement in the group's singular, thirteen-year career."" [ 9 ]  That same magazine later ranked  The Wall  at #87 on its list of  The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time . [ 10 ]   The Wall  would also be included in the book  1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die .     [ edit ]   Post-split   After Waters left Pink Floyd in 1985, a legal battle ensued over the rights to the name ""Pink Floyd"" and its material. In the end, Waters retained the right to use  The Wall , and its material and imagery (save for three songs which Gilmour co-wrote: "" Young Lust "", "" Comfortably Numb "" and "" Run Like Hell ""), as his name has been most closely associated with the album. This meant that the three remaining members' 19871990 and 1994 tours under the name Pink Floyd required payments to Waters. [ citation needed ]   Waters staged a  concert performance  of  The Wall  at  Potsdamer Platz  in  Berlin  on 21 July 1990 both to commemorate the fall of the  Berlin Wall  and as a fundraising effort for the World War Memorial Fund for Disaster Relief. This performance featured guest artists including  Bryan Adams ,  Cyndi Lauper  and  Van Morrison . This performance also differed from previous shows in that some songs from the original album and Pink Floyd concert version were omitted, others were slightly modified, and one Waters solo song, "" The Tide Is Turning "" was substituted for ""Outside The Wall"" as the concluding song.

In a career that extends back to his mid-Sixties roots as a coffeehouse folkie in his native Canada, this principled and unpredictable maverick has pursued an often winding course across the rock and roll landscape. Hes been a cult hero, a chart-topping rock star, and all things in-between, remaining true to his restless muse all the while. At various times, Young has delved into folk, country, garage-rock and grunge. His biggest album,  Harvest  (1972) , apotheosized the laid-back singer/songwriter genre he helped invent. By contrast,  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979), Youngs second-best seller, was a loud, brawling masterpiece whose title track, an homage to Johnny Rotten of the  Sex Pistols , contained the oft-quoted line Better to burn out than it is to rust.     Several of his more modest-selling titles - for example,  Tonights the Night ,  Comes a Time  and  Trans  - contain some of his most trenchant performances. It is typical of Young that he followed his most polished and popular album,  Harvest , with one of his most raw and uncommercial,  Time Fades Away . While hes avoided sticking to one style for very long, the unifying factors throughout Youngs peripatetic musical journey have been his unmistakable voice, his raw and expressive guitar playing, and his consummate songwriting skill.     In the early 1960s the Canadian-born Young performed as a self-accompanied folksinger on the Toronto scene. As a budding rock and roller, he hooked up with such groups as the Squires and the Mynah Birds; the latter was briefly signed to Motown and also included budding funk-rocker Rick James.  Buffalo Springfield  came together in 1966, inaugurating a collaboration between Young and Stephen Stills that has been intermittently revived down the decades. As a member of  Buffalo Springfield , Young contributed lead guitar and a raft of bittersweet folk-rock originals that included Mr. Soul, Broken Arrow and Expecting to Fly.     Youngs solo career took flight in 1969 with  Neil Young , an album of pretty, brooding songs that included The Loner. This singer/songwriter debut was one of the first solo albums by a rock and roll figure, and it quietly presaged a major direction that music would take in the Seventies. In the more than 30 years since that albums appearance, Young has recorded and toured tirelessly, releasing 35 albums. In addition to his prolific solo output, Young has undertaken occasional liaisons with  Crosby, Stills and Nash  (1970s  Dj vu , 1988s  American Dream , 1999s  Looking Forward ) and with Stephen Stills (1976s  Long May You Run , credited to the Stills-Young Band).     More lasting has been Youngs association with Crazy Horse, his steadiest backup band since 1969. Crazy Horse first turned up on  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere , Youngs second album, which contained the lengthy, jam-filled Down by the River and Cowgirl in the Sand and one of Youngs most memorable songs, Cinnamon Girl. The group provided a solid, rocking base for Youngs songs and solos, and theyve played with him on albums ranging from  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere   and  After the Gold Rush  (1970) to  Ragged Glory  (1990) and  Broken Arrow  (1996). The mellower, more acoustic and folk-flavored side of Neil Young has surfaced on numerous albums, notably  Harvest  (1972) and its sequel,  Harvest Moon  (1993). He has also made detours into country music (1985s  Old Ways ) and big-band blues (1988s  This Notes for You ). The one entity that Neil Young has come back to again and again, however, is Crazy Horse.     The original Crazy Horse included guitarist Danny Whitten, bass player Billy Talbot and drummer Ralph Molina. Whitten died of a heroin overdose in 1972, and his loss inspired much of the material on Youngs tempestuous and biographical  Tonights the Night . Its release was delayed until 1975 out of fear it was too raw for the market Young had courted so successfully with  Harvest  (1972) and its #1 hit, Heart of Gold. Frank Sampedro joined Crazy Horse on guitar in 1976, making his debut on Youngs  Zuma  album. Young has termed his association with Crazy Horse the essence of my musical life. This is the core, the smoldering thing I come back to over and over again....If I had never done anything else, the Crazy Horse stuff would just stand on its own.     Over the years, Young has made his mark as an incorrigible artist with a distinctive, unvarnished style on electric guitar. His long, feedback-filled solos owe a debt to  Jimi Hendrix , in spirit if not strictly in style. Young attributes his uncompromising approach to his early taste of success. The mass popularity he attained with Heart of Gold, a #1 hit in 1972, caused him to balk. This song put me in the middle of the road, he wrote in the liner notes to his retrospective  Decade  anthology. Traveling there soon became a bore so I headed for the ditch. A rougher ride, but I saw more interesting people there.     Nonetheless, one of his most successful albums,  Rust Never Sleeps , was also one of his most uncompromising. Released in 1979,  Rust Never Sleeps  became an instant favorite of fans and critics. Mixing acoustic and electric numbers, it was largely inspired by the punk-rock insurgency  especially its anthemic title track, Rust Never Sleeps (Hey Hey, My My [Into the Black]).  Rust Never Sleeps  was followed by a concert video and double live album,  Live Rust . At this point, Young was at a peak of popularity rivaling that of the early Seventies, when he was on top with  After the Gold Rush  and  Harvest . Displaying no interest in repeating a formula, however, he followed  Rust  with the quiet, acoustic  Hawks & Doves  (1980) and the squalling, electric  Re-ac-tor  (1981).     Youngs ride became particularly bumpy during the Eighties, following his move from Reprise to Geffen Records. He veered somewhat recklessly from style to style, moving from computerized music made with sequencers and samplers (Trans) to backward-looking neo-rockabilly for the Reagan era ( Everybodys Rockin ) to a return to roots on the countrified  Old Ways . In 1985, Young performed at the Live Aid fundraising extravaganza and then became one of the organizers and participants in Farm Aid, a yearly concert and consciousness-raising event. Young and his wife, Pegi, also founded San Franciscos Bridge School, a learning center for handicapped children with communication disabilities.     After his checkered tenure at Geffen Records, during which Young was actually sued by the label for allegedly releasing non-commercial records, Young returned to the Reprise label. Like a man unshackled, Neil Young released the buoyant, bluesy and horn-stoked  This Notes for You , which found him backed by the ten-man Bluenotes. The title track mocked corporate sponsorship and MTV. Ironically, though it had been banned by the music channel upon its release in 1988, This Notes for You won MTVs Best Video award a year later.     Youngs career became more clearly focused, though no less given to willful shifts in style, mood and volume, with the release of  Freedom  1989. Considered a return to form and his most vital work since  Rust Never Sleeps , it included acoustic and electric versions of Rockin in the Free World. From there, Young entered the Nineties full of fire and drive. He kicked off the decade with  Ragged Glory , which reunited him with Crazy Horse, and collaborated with alternative-rock heroes Pearl Jam on 1995s  Mirror Ball . He also nodded to his most popular album, 1972s Harvest, by releasing a sequel,  Harvest Moon , in 1992. Songs like From Hank to Hendrix and the title track assessed a generations coming of age and paid tribute to the enduring verities of friends, family and unconditional love. In the Nineties, Youngs studio releases were often followed by tours, live albums and video documentaries, revealing his relish for the energy and spontaneity of the stage.     Throughout his self-described bumpy ride, Young has consistently demonstrated the unbridled passion of an artist who understands that self-renewal is the only way to avoid burning out. For this reason, he has remained one of the most significant artists of the rock and roll era.    TIMELINE    November 12, 1945: Neil Young is born in Toronto, Canada.

Common elements of music are   pitch (which governs   melody and   harmony),   rhythm (and its associated concepts   tempo,   meter, and   articulation),   dynamics, and the sonic qualities of   timbre and   texture. The word derives from   Greek  μουσική  ( mousike ), ""(art) of the   Muses"". Definition of music                              Musical notations                           Greek philosophers and ancient  Indians  defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies.   Music theory, within this realm, is studied with the presupposition that music is orderly and often pleasant to hear. However, in the 20th century, composers challenged the notion that music had to be pleasant by creating music that explored harsher, darker   timbres. The existence of some modern-day music genres such as   death metal and   grindcore, which enjoy an extensive   underground following, indicate that even the harshest sounds can be considered music if the listener is so inclined. 20th-century composer   John Cage disagreed with the notion that music must consist of pleasant, discernible melodies. Instead, he argued that any sounds we can hear can be music, saying, for example, ""There is no   noise, only sound."" According to musicologist   Jean-Jacques Nattiez, ""the border between music and noise is always culturally defined—which implies that, even within a single society, this border does not always pass through the same place; in short, there is rarely a consensus.… By all accounts there is no  single  and  intercultural  universal concept defining what music might be, except that it is 'sound through time'."" The creation,   performance, significance, and even the   definition of music vary according to culture and social context. Music ranges from strictly organized compositions (and their recreation in performance), through improvisational music to   aleatoric forms. Music can be divided into   genres and   subgenres, although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to individual interpretation, and occasionally controversial. Within ""  the arts"", music can be classified as a   performing art, a  fine art , or an auditory art form. History                   Image:Elam-tar.jpg Figurines playing stringed instruments, excavated at   Susa, 2nd millennium BC.   Iran National Museum.                                                   The development of music among humans must have taken place against the backdrop of   natural sounds such as birdsong and the sounds other animals use to communicate.   Prehistoric music is the name which is given to all music produced in preliterate cultures. Ancient                                  A range of   paleolithic sites have yielded bones in which lateral holes have been pierced: these are usually identified as  flutes , blown at one end like the  Japanese    shakuhachi. The earliest written records of musical expression are to be found in the   Samaveda of  India  and in 4,000 year old   cuneiform from   Ur. Instruments, such as the seven-holed flute and various types of   stringed instruments have been recovered from the  Indus Valley Civilization  archaeological sites. India has one of the oldest musical traditions in the world—references to   Indian classical music ( marga ) can be found in the ancient scriptures of the   Hindu tradition, the   Vedas. The traditional art or court   music of China has a history stretching for more than three thousand years. Music was an important part of cultural and social life in  Ancient Greece : mixed-gender choruses performed for entertainment, celebration and spiritual ceremonies; musicians and singers had a prominent role in   ancient Greek theatre In the 9th century,   al-Farabi wrote a notable book on music titled   Kitab al-Musiqi al-Kabir  (""Great Book of Music""). He played and invented a variety of  musical instruments  and devised the   Arab tone system of pitch organisation, which is still used in   Arabic music. Medieval and Renaissance Europe                                  While musical life in  Europe  was undoubtedly rich in the early  Medieval  era, as attested by artistic depictions of instruments, writings about music, and other records, the only European repertory which has survived from before about 800 is the   monophonic   liturgical   plainsong of the  Roman Catholic Church , the central tradition of which was called  Gregorian chant . Several schools of liturgical   polyphony flourished beginning in the 12th century. Alongside these traditions of   sacred music, a vibrant tradition of   secular song developed, exemplified by the music of the   troubadours,   trouvères and   Minnesänger. Much of the surviving music of 14th century Europe is secular. By the middle of the 15th century,   composers and singers used a smooth polyphony for sacred   musical compositions such as the   mass, the   motet, and the   laude, and secular forms such as the   chanson and the   madrigal. The introduction of commercial   printing had an immense influence on the dissemination of musical styles. European Baroque                                  The first  operas , written around 1600 and the rise of   contrapuntal music define the end of the Renaissance and the beginning of the  Baroque  era that lasted until roughly 1750, the year of the death of  Johann Sebastian Bach .                      Allegory of Music, by   Filippino Lippi                                               Allegory of Music on the   Opéra Garnier                          German Baroque composers wrote for small   ensembles including strings,  brass , and   woodwinds, as well as   choirs,  pipe organ ,   harpsichord, and   clavichord. During the Baroque period, several major music forms were defined that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further, including the   fugue, the   invention, the   sonata, and the   concerto. European Classical                                  The music of the Classical period is characterized by   homophonic texture, often featuring a prominent melody with   accompaniment. These new melodies tended to be almost voice-like and singable. The now popular   instrumental music was dominated by further evolution of musical forms initially defined in the Baroque period: the sonata, and the concerto, with the addition of the new form, the   symphony.  Joseph Haydn  and  Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , well known even today, are among the central figures of the Classical period. Romantic                                  Ludwig van Beethoven  and  Franz Schubert  were transitional composers, leading into the Romantic period, with their expansion of existing genres, forms, and functions of music. In the Romantic period, the emotional and expressive qualities of music came to take precedence over the orientation towards technique and tradition. The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the  orchestra , and in the role of   concerts as part of   urban society. Later Romantic composers created complex and often much longer musical works, merging and expanding traditional forms that had previously been used separately. For example, counterpoint, combined with harmonic structures to create more extended   chords with increased use of   dissonance and to create dramatic tension and resolution. 20th century                                  In the 20th century there was a vast increase in music listening as the  radio  gained popularity worldwide and new media and technologies were developed to record, capture, reproduce and distribute music. The focus of   art music was characterized by exploration.   Claude Debussy has become well-known and respected for his orientation towards colors and depictions in his compositional style.  Igor Stravinsky ,   Arnold Schoenberg, and John Cage were all influential composers in 20th century art music.  Jazz  evolved and became a significant genre of music over the course of the 20th century, and during the second half of that century,   rock music and   hip hop music did the same. Performance                                                       Chinese   Naxi musicians                          Performance is the physical expression of music. Often, a musical work is performed once its structure and instrumentation are satisfactory to its creators; however, as it gets performed, it can evolve and change. A performance can either be rehearsed or   improvised. Improvisation is a musical idea created on the spot (such as a   guitar solo or a   drum solo), with no prior premeditation, while rehearsal is vigorous repetition of an idea until it has achieved cohesion.   Musicians will generally add improvisation to a well-rehearsed idea to create a unique performance. Many cultures include strong traditions of   solo and performance, such as in Indian classical music, and in the Western Art music tradition. Other cultures, such as in   Bali, include strong traditions of group performance. All cultures include a mixture of both, and performance may range from improvised solo playing for one's enjoyment to highly planned and organised performance rituals such as the modern classical concert, religious processions,   music festivals or   music competitions.  Chamber music, which is music for a small ensemble with only a few of each type of instrument, is often seen as more intimate than symphonic works. A performer may be referred to as a musician. Aural tradition         Many types of music, such as traditional   blues and  folk music  were originally preserved in the memory of performers, and the songs were handed down  orally , or aurally (by ear). When the composer of music is no longer known, this music is often classified as ""traditional"". Different musical traditions have different attitudes towards how and where to make changes to the original source material, from quite strict, to those which demand improvisation or modification to the music. A culture's history may also be passed by ear through song. Ornamentation                                  The detail included explicitly in the   music notation varies between genres and historical periods. In general, art music notation from the 17th through the 19th century required performers to have a great deal of contextual knowledge about performing styles. For example, in the 17th and 18th century, music notated for solo performers typically indicated a simple, unornamented melody. However, it was expected that performers would know how to add stylistically-appropriate ornaments such as   trills and turns. In the 19th century, art music for solo performers may give a general instruction such as to perform the music expressively, without describing in detail how the performer should do this. It was expected that the performer would know how to use tempo changes,   accentuation, and   pauses (among other devices) to obtain this ""expressive"" performance style. In the 20th century, art music notation often became more explicit and used a range of markings and annotations to indicate to performers how they should play or sing the piece. In   popular music and jazz, music notation almost always indicates only the basic framework of the melody, harmony, or performance approach; musicians and singers are expected to know the performance conventions and styles associated with specific genres and pieces. For example, the ""  lead sheet"" for a jazz tune may only indicate the melody and the chord changes. The performers in the   jazz ensemble are expected to know how to ""flesh out"" this basic structure by adding ornaments, improvised music, and chordal accompaniment. Production                                  Music is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or as an   entertainment product for the marketplace. Amateur musicians compose and perform music for their own pleasure, and they do not derive their income from music. Professional musicians are employed by a range of institutions and organisations, including armed forces, churches and synagogues, symphony orchestras,  broadcasting  or   film production companies, and   music schools. Professional musicians sometimes work as freelancers, seeking contracts and engagements in a variety of settings. There are often many links between amateur and professional musicians. Beginning amateur musicians take   lessons with professional musicians. In community settings, advanced amateur musicians perform with professional musicians in a variety of ensembles and orchestras. In some cases, amateur musicians attain a professional level of competence, and they are able to perform in professional performance settings. A distinction is often made between music performed for the benefit of a live audience and music that is performed for the purpose of being recorded and distributed through the music retail system or the broadcasting system. However, there are also many cases where a live performance in front of an audience is recorded and distributed (or broadcast). Composition                                  ""Composition"" is often classed as the creation and recording of music via a medium by which others can interpret it (i.e. paper or sound). Many cultures use at least part of the concept of preconceiving musical material, or composition, as held in western   classical music. Even when music is notated precisely, there are still many decisions that a performer has to make. The process of a performer deciding how to perform music that has been previously composed and notated is termed interpretation. Different performers' interpretations of the same music can vary widely. Composers and song writers who present their own music are interpreting, just as much as those who perform the music of others or folk music. The standard body of choices and techniques present at a given time and a given place is referred to as   performance practice, where as interpretation is generally used to mean either individual choices of a performer, or an aspect of music which is not clear, and therefore has a ""standard"" interpretation. In some musical genres, such as jazz and blues, even more freedom is given to the performer to engage in improvisation on a basic melodic, harmonic, or rhythmic framework. The greatest latitude is given to the performer in a style of performing called   free improvisation, which is material that is spontaneously ""thought of"" (imagined) while being performed,  not  preconceived. According to the analysis of Georgiana Costescu, improvised music usually follows stylistic or genre conventions and even ""fully composed"" includes some   freely chosen material. Composition does not always mean the use of notation, or the known sole authorship of one individual. Music can also be determined by describing a ""process"" which may create musical sounds; examples of this range from wind chimes, through computer programs which select sounds. Music which contains elements selected by chance is called   Aleatoric music, and is associated with such composers as John Cage,   Morton Feldman, and   Witold Lutosławski. Musical composition is a term that describes the composition of a piece of music. Methods of composition vary widely from one composer to another, however in analysing music all forms — spontaneous, trained, or untrained — are built from elements comprising a musical piece. Music can be composed for repeated performance or it can be improvised: composed on the spot. The music can be performed entirely from memory, from a written system of musical notation, or some combination of both. Study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of Western classical music, but the definition of composition is broad enough to include spontaneously improvised works like those of   free jazz performers and African drummers such as the   Ewe drummers. What is important in understanding the composition of a piece is singling out its elements. An understanding of music's formal elements can be helpful in deciphering exactly how a piece is constructed. A universal element of music is how sounds occur in time, which is referred to as the rhythm of a piece of music. When a piece appears to have a changing time-feel, it is considered to be in   rubato time, an   Italian expression that indicates that the tempo of the piece changes to suit the expressive intent of the performer. Even random placement of random sounds, which occurs in   musical montage, occurs within some kind of time, and thus employs time as a musical element. Notation                                  Notation is the written expression of music notes and rhythms on paper using symbols. When music is written down, the pitches and rhythm of the music is notated, along with instructions on how to perform the music. The study of how to read notation involves music theory, harmony, the study of performance practice, and in some cases an understanding of historical performance methods. Written notation varies with style and period of music. In Western Art music, the most common types of written notation are scores, which include all the music parts of an ensemble piece, and parts, which are the music notation for the individual performers or singers. In popular music, jazz, and blues, the standard musical notation is the lead sheet, which notates the melody, chords,   lyrics (if it is a vocal piece), and structure of the music. Scores and parts are also used in popular music and jazz, particularly in large ensembles such as jazz ""big bands."" In popular music,  guitarists  and electric   bass players often read music notated in tablature, which indicates the location of the notes to be played on the instrument using a diagram of the guitar or bass fingerboard. Tabulature was also used in the Baroque era to notate music for the   lute, a stringed, fretted instrument. Notated music is produced as   sheet music. To perform music from notation requires an understanding of both the musical style and the performance practice that is associated with a piece of music or genre. Improvisation                                  Improvisation is the creation of   spontaneous music. Improvisation is often considered an act of instantaneous composition by composers, where compositional techniques are employed with or without preparation. Theory                                  Music theory encompasses the nature and mechanics of music. It often involves identifying patterns that govern composers' techniques. In a more detailed sense, music theory (in the western system) also distills and analyzes the elements of music – rhythm, harmony (harmonic function), melody, structure, and texture. People who study these properties are known as music theorists. Cognition                              Concert in the Mozarteum, Salzburg                          The field of   music cognition involves the study of many aspects of music including how it is processed by listeners. Rather than accepting the standard practices of analyzing, composing, and performing music as a given, much research in music cognition seeks instead to uncover the mental processes that underlie these practices. Also, research in the field seeks to uncover commonalities between the musical traditions of disparate cultures and possible cognitive ""constraints"" that limit these musical systems. Questions regarding musical innateness, and emotional responses to music are also major areas of research in the field. Deaf  people can experience music by feeling the vibrations in their body, a process which can be enhanced if the individual holds a resonant, hollow object. A well-known deaf musician is the composer Ludwig van Beethoven, who composed many famous works even after he had completely lost his hearing. Recent examples of deaf musicians include   Evelyn Glennie, a highly acclaimed   percussionist who has been deaf since age twelve, and   Chris Buck, a virtuoso   violinist who has lost his hearing. This is relevant because it indicates that music is a deeper cognitive process than unexamined phrases such as, ""pleasing to the ear"" would suggest. Much research in music cognition seeks to uncover these complex mental processes involved in listening to music, which may seem intuitively simple, yet are vastly intricate and complex. Sociology                                                    Half-section of the  Song Dynasty  (960–1279) version of  Night Revels of Han Xizai , original by   Gu Hongzhong; the painting shows musicians entertaining guests in a 10th century household. In the centre are three female musicians playing   guan , two female musicians playing   transverse bamboo flutes, and a male musician playing a wooden clapper called  paiban .                                               Music is experienced by individuals in a range of social settings ranging from being alone to attending a large concert. Musical performances take different forms in different cultures and socioeconomic milieus. In Europe and  North America , there is often a divide between what types of music are viewed as a ""  high culture"" and ""  low culture."" ""High culture"" types of music typically include Western art music such as Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and modern-era symphonies, concertos, and solo works, and are typically heard in formal concerts in concert halls and churches, with the audience sitting quietly in seats. Other types of music - including, but not limited to, jazz, blues,   soul, and  country  - are often performed in bars, nightclubs, and theatres, where the audience may be able to drink, dance, and express themselves by cheering. Until the later 20th century, the division between ""high"" and ""low"" musical forms was widely accepted as a valid distinction that separated out better quality, more advanced ""art music"" from the popular styles of music heard in bars and dance halls. However, in the 1980s and 1990s, musicologists studying this perceived divide between ""high"" and ""low"" musical genres argued that this distinction is not based on the musical value or quality of the different types of music. Rather, they argued that this distinction was based largely on the   socioeconomic standing or   social class of the performers or audience of the different types of music. For example, whereas the audience for Classical symphony concerts typically have above-average incomes, the audience for a rap concert in an inner-city area may have below-average incomes. Even though the performers, audience, or venue where non-""art"" music is performed may have a lower socioeconomic status, the music that is performed, such as blues, rap,   punk,   funk, or   ska may be very complex and sophisticated. When composers introduce styles of music which break with convention, there can be a strong resistance from academic music experts and popular culture. Late-period Beethoven string quartets, Stravinsky  ballet  scores,   serialism,   bebop-era jazz, hip hop, punk rock, and   electronica have all been considered non-music by some critics when they were first introduced. Such themes are examined in the  sociology  of music. The sociological study of music, sometimes called   sociomusicology, is often pursued in departments of sociology, media studies, or music, and is closely related to the field of   ethnomusicology. Business                                  The music industry refers to the business industry connected with the creation and sale of music. It consists of record companies,   labels and   publishers that distribute recorded music products internationally and that often control the rights to those products. Some music labels are ""  independent,"" while others are subsidiaries of larger corporate entities or international   media groups. Education         Primary                                  The incorporation of music training from   preschool to   post secondary education is common in North America and Europe. Involvement in music is thought to teach basic skills such as concentration,   counting, listening, and   cooperation while also promoting understanding of  language , improving the ability to   recall information, and creating an environment more conducive to learning in other areas. In   elementary schools, children often learn to play instruments such as the  recorder , sing in small choirs, and learn about the history of Western art music. In secondary schools students may have the opportunity to perform some type of musical ensembles, such as choirs,   marching bands,   concert bands, jazz bands, or orchestras, and in some school systems, music classes may be available. Some students also take private   music lessons with a teacher. Amateur musicians typically take lessons to learn musical rudiments and beginner- to intermediate-level musical techniques. At the  university  level, students in most arts and  humanities  programs can receive   credit for taking music courses, which typically take the form of an overview course on the   history of music, or a   music appreciation course that focuses on listening to music and learning about different musical styles. In addition, most North American and European universities have some type of musical ensembles that non-music students are able to participate in, such as choirs, marching bands, or orchestras. The study of Western art music is increasingly common outside of North America and Europe, such as the   Indonesian Institute of the Arts in   Yogyakarta,  Indonesia , or the classical music programs that are available in  Asian  countries such as  South Korea , Japan, and  China . At the same time, Western universities and colleges are widening their curriculum to include music of non-Western cultures, such as the  music of Africa  or Bali (e.g.   Gamelan music). Academia          Musicology is the study of the subject of music. The earliest definitions defined three sub-disciplines:   systematic musicology,   historical musicology, and comparative musicology or   ethnomusicology. In contemporary scholarship, one is more likely to encounter a division of the discipline into music theory, music history, and ethnomusicology. Research in musicology has often been enriched by cross-disciplinary work, for example in the field of   psychoacoustics. The study of music of non-western cultures, and the cultural study of music, is called ethnomusicology. Graduates of undergraduate music programs can go on to further study in music graduate programs. Graduate degrees include the   Master of Music, the   Master of Arts, the   Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) (e.g., in musicology or music theory), and more recently, the   Doctor of Musical Arts, or DMA. The Master of Music degree, which takes one to two years to complete, is typically awarded to students studying the performance of an instrument, education, voice or composition. The Master of Arts degree, which takes one to two years to complete and often requires a   thesis, is typically awarded to students studying musicology, music history, or music theory.   Undergraduate   university degrees in music, including the   Bachelor of Music, the Bachelor of Music Education, and the   Bachelor of Arts (with a major in music) typically take three to five years to complete. These degrees provide students with a grounding in music theory and music history, and many students also study an instrument or learn singing technique as part of their program. The PhD, which is required for students who want to work as university professors in musicology, music history, or music theory, takes three to five years of study after the Master's degree, during which time the student will complete advanced courses and undertake research for a dissertation. The DMAis a relatively new degree that was created to provide a credential for professional performers or composers that want to work as university professors in musical performance or composition. The DMA takes three to five years after a Master's degree, and includes advanced courses, projects, and performances. In Medieval times, the study of music was one of the   Quadrivium of the seven   Liberal Arts and considered vital to higher learning. Within the quantitative Quadrivium, music, or more accurately   harmonics, was the study of rational proportions.  Zoomusicology is the study of the music of non-human animals, or the musical aspects of sounds produced by non-human animals. As   George Herzog (1941) asked, ""do animals have music?""   François-Bernard Mâche's  Musique, mythe, nature, ou les Dauphins d'Arion  (1983), a study of ""ornitho-musicology"" using a technique of   Nicolas Ruwet's  Language, musique, poésie  (1972)   paradigmatic segmentation analysis, shows that   bird songs are organised according to a repetition-transformation principle. Jean-Jacques Nattiez (1990), argues that ""in the last analysis, it is a human being who decides what is and is not musical, even when the sound is not of human origin. If we acknowledge that sound is not organised and conceptualised (that is, made to form music) merely by its producer, but by the mind that perceives it, then music is uniquely human."" Music theory is the study of music, generally in a highly technical manner outside of other disciplines. More broadly it refers to any study of music, usually related in some form with compositional concerns, and may include  mathematics ,  physics , and  anthropology . What is most commonly taught in beginning music theory classes are guidelines to write in the style of the   common practice period, or   tonal music. Theory, even that which studies music of the common practice period, may take many other forms.   Musical set theory is the application of mathematical  set theory  to music, first applied to  atonal music .  Speculative music theory , contrasted with  analytic music theory , is devoted to the analysis and synthesis of music materials, for example   tuning systems, generally as preparation for composition. Ethnomusicology                                  In the West, much of the history of music that is taught deals with the Western civilization's art music. The history of music in other cultures (""  world music"" or the field of ""ethnomusicology"") is also taught in Western universities. This includes the documented classical traditions of Asian countries outside the influence of Western Europe, as well as the folk or indigenous music of various other cultures. Popular styles of music varied widely from culture to culture, and from period to period. Different cultures emphasised different  instruments , or techniques, or uses for music. Music has been used not only for entertainment, for ceremonies, and for practical and artistic communication, but also for  propaganda  in totalitarian countries. There is a host of music classifications, many of which are caught up in the argument over the definition of music. Among the largest of these is the division between classical music (or ""art"" music), and popular music (or   commercial music - including   rock and roll, country music, and pop music). Some genres don't fit neatly into one of these ""big two"" classifications, (such as folk music, world music, or jazz music). As world cultures have come into  greater contact , their indigenous musical styles have often merged into new styles. For example, the United States   bluegrass style contains elements from   Anglo-  Irish,   Scottish, Irish,   German and African instrumental and vocal traditions, which were able to fuse in the United States' multi-ethnic society. Genres of music are determined as much by tradition and presentation as by the actual music. Some works, like   George Gershwin's   Rhapsody in Blue , are claimed by both jazz and classical music. Many current music festivals celebrate a particular musical genre. Indian music , for example, is one of the oldest and longest living types of music, and is still widely heard and performed in South Asia, as well as internationally (especially since the 1960s). Indian music has mainly 3 forms of classical music,   Hindustani,   Carnatic, and   Dhrupad styles. It has also a large repertoire of styles, which involve only percussion music such as the talavadya performances famous in   South India. Music therapy                                   Robert Burton wrote in his 17th century work,   The Anatomy of Melancholy , that music and dance were critical in treating   mental illness, especially   melancholia. He said that                    But to leave all declamatory speeches in praise of divine music, I will confine myself to my proper subject: besides that excellent power it hath to expel many other diseases, it is a sovereign remedy against despair and melancholy, and will drive away the devil himself.                 Burton noted that                    ...Canus, a Rhodian fiddler, in Philostratus, when Apollonius was inquisitive to know what he could do with his pipe, told him, ""That he would make a melancholy man merry, and him that was merry much merrier than before, a lover more enamoured, a religious man more devout.""                         In November 2006, Dr. Michael J. Crawford and his colleagues also found that music therapy helped  schizophrenic  patients. In the  Ottoman Empire , mental illnesses were treated with music.

Young's work is characterized by deeply personal lyrics, distinctive guitar work, and signature falsetto  tenor  singing voice. Although he accompanies himself on several different instrumentsincluding  piano  and  harmonica his claw-hammer  acoustic guitar  style and often idiosyncratic electric guitar soloing are the linchpins of a sometimes ragged, sometimes polished sound. Although Young has experimented widely with differing music styles, including  swing ,  jazz ,  rockabilly ,  blues , and  electronic music  throughout a varied career, his best known work usually falls into either of two distinct styles:  folk -esque  acoustic   rock  ("" Heart of Gold "", ""Harvest Moon"" and "" Old Man "") and  electric -charged  hard rock  (like "" Cinnamon Girl "", "" Rockin' in the Free World "" and "" Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black) ""). In recent years, Young has adopted elements from newer styles like  industrial ,  alternative country  and  grunge . Young's profound influence on the latter caused some to dub him ""the godfather of grunge"".   Young has directed (or co-directed) a number of  films  using the  pseudonym  Bernard Shakey, including  Journey Through the Past  (1973),  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979),  Human Highway  (1982),  Greendale  (2003), and  CSNY Dj Vu  (2008). He is currently working on a documentary about electric car technology, tentatively titled  Linc/Volt . The project involves a 1959  Lincoln Continental  converted to hybrid technology, which Young plans to drive to  Washington, DC  as an example to lawmakers there. [ 2 ]   He is also an outspoken advocate for environmental issues and small farmers, having co-founded in 1985 the  benefit concert   Farm Aid , and in 1986 helped found The Bridge School, [ 3 ]  and its annual supporting  Bridge School Benefit  concerts, together with his wife Pegi (in this, Young's involvement stems at least partially from the fact that both of his sons have  cerebral palsy  and his daughter, like Young himself, has  epilepsy ).   Although Young sings as frequently about U.S. legends and myths ( Pocahontas ,  space stations , and the settlement of the American West) [ 4 ]  as he does about his native country, he remains a Canadian citizen and has never wanted to relinquish his Canadian citizenship. He has lived in the U.S. for ""so long"" and has stated he has ""got just as much right to vote in them (American elections) as anybody else.""

He spent his early years in the small country town of  Omemee , 130  kilometres  (81  mi ) northeast of Toronto.   Young was diagnosed with diabetes as a child [ 6 ]  and a bout of  polio  at the age of 6 left him with a weakened left side; he still walks with a slight limp.   His parents divorced when Young was 12, and he moved with his mother back to the family home of  Winnipeg , Manitoba, where the formative years of his music career began. Neil and his mother Rassy settled into the working class suburb of  Fort Rouge  where the shy, dry-humoured youth enrolled at Earl Grey Junior High School. It was there that he formed his first band  the Jades , and met  Ken Koblun , later to join him in the Squires.   While attending  Kelvin High School  in Winnipeg, he played in several instrumental rock bands. Young's first stable band was called the Squires, who had a local hit called ""The Sultan"". Young dropped out of high school [ 7 ]  and also played in  Fort William , where they recorded a series of demos produced by a local producer named Ray Dee, whom Young called ""the original Briggs."" [ 8 ]  While in Thunder Bay, Young first encountered  Stephen Stills . In the  2006  film  Heart of Gold  Young relates how he used to spend time as a teenager at  Falcon Lake, Manitoba  where he would endlessly plug coins into the jukebox to hear  Ian Tyson 's "" Four Strong Winds "". Neil also formed a friendship with musician  Randy Bachman .   After leaving the Squires, Neil worked folk clubs in Winnipeg, where he first met  Joni Mitchell . [ 9 ]  Here he wrote some of his earliest and most enduring folk songs such as the classic "" Sugar Mountain "", about his lost youth. Mitchell wrote ""The Circle Game"" in response. [ citation needed ]   In 1965 Young toured Canada as a solo artist. In 1966, he joined the  Rick James -fronted  Mynah Birds . The band managed to secure a record deal with the  Motown  label, but as their first album was being recorded, James was arrested for being  AWOL  from the army. [ 10 ]  After the Mynah Birds disbanded, Young and bass player  Bruce Palmer  relocated to  Los Angeles . Young has admitted in an interview that he was in the United States illegally until receiving a green card in 1970. [ 11 ]     [ edit ]   Buffalo Springfield   Once they reached Los Angeles, Young and Palmer met up with  Stephen Stills ,  Richie Furay , and  Dewey Martin  to form  Buffalo Springfield . A mixture of folk, country,  psychedelia , and rock lent a hard edge by the twin lead guitars of Stills and Young made Buffalo Springfield a critical success, and their first record  Buffalo Springfield  (1967) sold well after Stills' topical song "" For What It's Worth "" became a hit, aided by Young's melodic harmonics played on electric guitar.   Distrust of their management, as well as the arrest and deportation of Palmer, exacerbated the already strained relations among the group members and led to Buffalo Springfield's demise. A second album,  Buffalo Springfield Again , was released in late 1967, but two of Youngs three contributions were solo tracks recorded apart from the rest of the group.   In many ways, these three songs on  Buffalo Springfield Again  are harbingers of much of Young's later work in that, although they all share deeply personal, almost idiosyncratic lyrics, they also present three very different musical approaches to the arrangement of what is essentially an original folk song. ""Mr Soul"" is the only Young song of the three that all five members of the group perform together. In contrast, "" Broken Arrow "" was confessional folk rock of a kind that would characterize much of the music that emerged from the singer-songwriter movement. Youngs experimental production intersperses each verse with snippets of sound from other sources, including opening the song with a sound bite of Dewey Martin singing ""Mr. Soul"" and closing it with the thumping of a heartbeat. ""Expecting to Fly"" was a lushly produced  ballad  featuring a string arrangement that Young's co-producer for the track,  Jack Nitzsche , would dub ""symphonic pop.""   In May 1968, the band split up for good, but in order to fulfill a contractual obligation, a final album,  Last Time Around , was recorded, primarily from recordings made earlier that year. Young contributed the songs ""On the Way Home"" and ""I Am a Child"", singing lead on the latter. In 1997, the band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame; Young did not appear at the ceremony.     [ edit ]   Solo success & CSNY   After the breakup of Buffalo Springfield, Young signed a solo deal with  Reprise Records , home of his colleague and friend  Joni Mitchell , with whom he shared a manager, Elliot Roberts, who manages Young to this day. Young and Nitzsche immediately began work on Young's first solo record,  Neil Young  (November 1968), which received mixed reviews. In a 1970 interview, [ 12 ]  Young deprecated the album as being ""overdubbed rather than played,"" and the quest for music that expresses the spontaneity of the moment has long been a feature of his career. Nevertheless, the album contains some tunes that remain a staple of his live shows, most notably ""The Loner.""   For his next album, Young recruited three musicians from a band called The Rockets:  Danny Whitten  on guitar,  Billy Talbot  on bass guitar, and  Ralph Molina  on  drums . These three took the name  Crazy Horse  (after  the historical figure of the same name ), and  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere  (May 1969), is credited to ""Neil Young with Crazy Horse."" Recorded in just two weeks, the album opens with one of Young's most familiar songs, ""Cinnamon Girl,"" and is dominated by two more, ""Cowgirl in the Sand"" and ""Down by the River,"" that feature lengthy jams showcasing Young's idiosyncratic guitar soloing accompanied sympathetically by Crazy Horse. Young reportedly wrote all three songs on the same day, while nursing a high fever of 103 F (39.5 C) in bed.   Shortly after the release of  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere , Young reunited with Stephen Stills by joining  Crosby, Stills, & Nash , who had already released one album as a trio. Young was originally offered a position as a sideman, but agreed to join only if he received full membership, and the group - winners of the 1969 ""Best New Artist"" Grammy - was renamed Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. [ 13 ]  The quartet debuted in  Chicago  on  August 16 ,  1969 , and later performed at the famous  Woodstock Festival , during which Young skipped the acoustic set and refused to be filmed during the electric set, even telling the cameramen: ""One of you fuckin' guys comes near me and I'm gonna fuckin' hit you with my guitar"". [ 14 ]  During the making of their first album,  Dj Vu , the musicians frequently argued, particularly Young and Stills, who both fought for control. [ 15 ]   "" Ohio "" was written following the  Kent State massacre  on  May 4 ,  1970 , and was a staple of anti-war rallies in the 1970s. The song was quickly recorded by CSNY and immediately released as a single, even though CSNY's ""Teach Your Children"" was still climbing the singles charts. Many believe that the release of ""Ohio"" as a single cut into the sales of ""Teach Your Children"" and prevented that song from reaching the top ten. In the late 1970s and for much of the 1980s, Young refrained from performing ""Ohio"" live, as he considered the song to be dated. In the wake of the 1989  Tiananmen Square massacre , however, Young revived the song in concert, often dedicating it to the  Chinese  students who were killed in the massacre. Crosby, Stills & Nash, as a trio, also returned the song to their live repertoire around the same time, even though Young had provided the lead vocals on the original recording.   Also that year, Young released his third solo album,  After the Gold Rush  (1970), which featured, among others, a young  Nils Lofgren ,  Stephen Stills , and CSNY bassist Greg Reeves. Young also recorded some tracks with Crazy Horse, but dismissed them early in the sessions. Aided by his newfound fame with CSNY, the album was a commercial breakthrough for Young and contains some of his best known work. Notable tracks include the title track, with dream-like lyrics that run a gamut of subjects from drugs and interpersonal relationships to environmental concerns, as well as Youngs controversial and acerbic condemnation of  racism  in "" Southern Man ,"" which, along with a later song entitled ""Alabama,"" later prompted  Lynyrd Skynyrd  to decry Young by name in the lyrics to "" Sweet Home Alabama ."" Young was one of Skynyrd's biggest influences, and Young was an admirer of Skynyrd's music. The respectful rivalry and friendship between Young and Skynyrd front man  Ronnie Van Zant  would serve as a recurring theme in the  Drive-By Truckers ' 2001  concept album   Southern Rock Opera .   With CSNY splitting up and Crazy Horse having signed their own record deal, Young began the year 1971 with a solo tour entitled ""Journey Through the Past."" Later, he recruited a new group of country-music session musicians, whom he christened  The Stray Gators , to record much of the new material that had been premiered on tour for the album  Harvest  (1972).  Harvest  was a massive hit (especially with the country-music crowd) and ""Heart of Gold"" became a US number one single; incidentally, to this day it remains the only No. 1 hit in his long career.   Another notable song was "" The Needle and the Damage Done ,"" a somber lament on the pain caused by heroin addiction; inspired in part by the heavy heroin use of Crazy Horse member Danny Whitten, who would eventually die of an overdose. [ 16 ]   The album's success, however, caught Young off guard, and his first instinct was to back away from stardom. In the handwritten liner notes to the  Decade  compilation, Young described ""Heart of Gold"" as the song that ""put me in the middle of the road. Traveling there soon became a bore, so I headed for the ditch. A rougher ride but I saw more interesting people there.""   On  September 8 ,  1972 , the Academy Award-nominated actress  Carrie Snodgress , with whom he had been living, gave birth to Neil Young's first child. The boy, Zeke, was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Young fell in love with Snodgress after seeing her in a movie (""Diary of a Mad Housewife"") on television after which Young wrote the song "" A Man Needs a Maid "" from the Harvest album, featuring the lyric ""I fell in love with the actress/she was playing a part that I could understand.""     [ edit ]   The Ditch Trilogy   Although a new tour had been planned to follow up on the success of  Harvest , it became apparent during rehearsals that Danny Whitten could not function due to  drug abuse . On  November 18 , 1972, shortly after he was fired from the tour preparations, Whitten was found dead of an  overdose . Young described the incident to  Rolling Stone s  Cameron Crowe  in 1975:  [ 17 ]  ""[We] were rehearsing with him and he just couldn't cut it. He couldn't remember anything. He was too out of it. Too far gone. I had to tell him to go back to L.A. 'It's not happening, man. You're not together enough.' He just said, 'I've got nowhere else to go, man. How am I gonna tell my friends?' And he split. That night the coroner called me from L.A. and told me he'd ODed. That blew my mind. Fucking blew my mind. I loved Danny. I felt responsible. And from there, I had to go right out on this huge tour of huge arenas. I was very nervous and  insecure.""   The album made in the aftermath of this incident,  Time Fades Away  (1973), has often been described by Young as ""my least favourite record,"" and it is, in fact, one of only two of Youngs early recordings that has yet to be officially re-released on CD (the other being the soundtrack album  Journey Through the Past ). The album was recorded live over a tour where Young struggled with his voice and called  David Crosby  and  Graham Nash  to help perform the music. The tour featured  Linda Ronstadt  as the opening act.  Time Fades Away  occupies a unique position in Youngs discography as the first of three albums known collectively as the "" Ditch Trilogy .""   In the second half of 1973, Young formed The Santa Monica Flyers, with Crazy Horse's rhythm section augmented by Nils Lofgren on guitar. Deeply affected by the drug-induced deaths of Whitten and  roadie   Bruce Berry , Young recorded  Tonight's the Night . The album's dark tone and rawness caused Reprise to delay the release until two years later and only after being pressured by Young to do so. [ 18 ]  It received mixed reviews at the time, but is now regarded as a landmark album. In Young's own opinion, it was the closest he ever came to art. [ 19 ]   While his record company delayed the release of  Tonight's the Night,  Young recorded  On the Beach  (1974), which dealt with themes such as the downside of fame and the Californian lifestyle. Like  Time Fades Away  and  Tonight's the Night , it sold poorly but eventually became a critical favourite, presenting some of Young's most original work. In a review of the 2003 re-release on CD of  On the Beach  Derek Svennungsen described the music as ""mesmerizing, harrowing, lucid, and bleary,"" [ 20 ] .     [ edit ]   Return to prominence   After completing  On the Beach , Young reunited with  Harvest  producer Elliot Mazer to record another acoustic album,  Homegrown . Most of the songs were written after Young's breakup with Snodgress, and thus the tone of the album was somewhat dark. Though the album was entirely completed, Young decided to drop the album and release  Tonight's the Night  instead, at the suggestion of  The Band  bassist  Rick Danko . [ 21 ]  Young further explained his move by saying: ""It was a little too personal... it scared me"". [ 22 ]          Neil Young in Austin, Texas on November 9, 1976       Young reformed Crazy Horse with  Frank Sampedro  on guitar as his backup band for  Zuma  (1975). Many of the songs are overtly concerned with failed relationships, and even the epic "" Cortez the Killer ,"" outwardly a retelling of the  Spanish conquest  of  Mexico  from the viewpoint of the  Aztecs , can be seen as an allegory of love lostsomething that didnt save it, however, from being banned in  Franco 's  Spain .   The following year, Young reunited with Stephen Stills for the album  Long May You Run  (1976), credited to  The Stills-Young Band ; the follow-up tour was ended midway through by Young, who sent Stills a  telegram  that read: ""Funny how some things that start spontaneously end that way. Eat a peach, Neil."" [ 23 ]   In 1976, Young performed with  The Band , Joni Mitchell, and other rock musicians in the high profile all-star concert  The Last Waltz . The release of  Martin Scorsese 's movie of the concert was delayed while Scorsese unwillingly re-edited it to obscure the lump of cocaine that was clearly visible hanging from Young's nose during his performance of  ""Helpless."" [ 24 ]  Young later said, ""I'm not proud of that,"" according to one of his biographers.   American Stars 'N Bars  (1977) contained two songs originally recorded for  Homegrown  album, ""Homegrown"" and ""Star of Bethelehem,"" as well as newer material, including the future concert staple "" Like A Hurricane "". Performers included  Linda Ronstadt ,  Emmylou Harris  and Young protg  Nicolette Larson  along with Crazy Horse. Also in 1977, Young released  Decade : a personally selected career summary of material spanning every aspect of his various interests and affiliations, including a handful of unreleased songs.  Comes a Time  (1978) also featured Nicolette Larson and Crazy Horse and became Young's most commercially accessible album in quite some time, marked by a return to his folk roots.   Young next set out on the lengthy ""Rust Never Sleeps"" tour, in which each concert was divided into a solo acoustic set and an electric set with Crazy Horse. Much of the electric set was later seen as a response to punk rock's burgeoning popularity. ""Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)"" compared the changing public perception of  Johnny Rotten  with that of the recently deceased  Elvis Presley , who himself had once been disparaged as a dangerous influence only to later become an  icon . Rotten, meanwhile, returned the favour by playing one of Young's records on a  London  radio show. The accompanying albums  Rust Never Sleeps  (new material, culled from live recordings, but featuring studio overdubs) and  Live Rust  (a mixture of old and new, and a genuine concert recording) captured the two sides of the concerts, with solo acoustic songs on side A, and fierce, uptempo, electric songs on side B. A movie version of the concerts, also called  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979), was directed by Young under the pseudonym Bernard Shakey.   Young was suddenly hip again, and the readers and critics of  Rolling Stone  voted him Artist Of The Year for 1979 (along with The Who), selected  Rust Never Sleeps  as Album Of The Year, and voted him Male Vocalist Of The Year as well.  The Village Voice , meanwhile, honored Young as the Artist of the Decade.     [ edit ]   1980s - Experimental years   The 1980s were a lean time for Young both critically and commercially. After providing the incidental music to a  biopic  of  Hunter S. Thompson  entitled  Where the Buffalo Roam , he recorded  Hawks & Doves  (1980), a folk/country record.  Re-ac-tor  (1981), once again with Crazy Horse, was a faade of distortion and feedback obscuring a relatively weak selection of songs, but his strangest record of the decade came with  Trans  (1982). Recorded partially with  vocoders ,  synthesizers , and other devices that modified instruments and vocals with electronic effects, it is sometimes considered an experiment related to finding a technology that would become a means to communicate for Youngs son (with his wife Pegi), Ben, who has severe  cerebral palsy  and cannot speak. Many fans were baffled by the radical forms of this album and  rockabilly -styled  Everybody's Rockin'  (1983), and record company head  David Geffen  even sued Young for making ""unrepresentative"" musici.e. music that did not sound like Neil Youngthat deliberately lacked commercial appeal. [ 25 ]  Young later stated that he would have preferred to release the songs featuring the  synclavier  and  vocoder  as an EP, and that their inclusion with the Hawaiian-themed rockabilly was a mistake. Also premiered at this time though little seen was an eclectic full-length comedy film  Human Highway  starring, co-directed and co-written by Young.   In 1983, Young worked with British video director  Tim Pope , making two videos - ""Wonderin'"" and ""Cry, Cry, Cry.""   In 1985, he reunited with Crosby, Stills and Nash at  Live Aid  at Philadelphia's  John F. Kennedy Stadium . The two songs that they played, ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"" and "" Daylight Again /Find The Cost of Freedom,"" were the first songs they had played as a quartet in front of a paying audience since 1974.   Old Ways  (1985) saw a return to country music, recorded with a group of friends and session musicians.  Landing on Water  (1986) is entertaining for the blending of synthesizers and other instruments related to the 1980s into Youngs own style, with lyrics that take pot shots at some favourite targets, including CSN in ""Hippie Dream,"" with a chorus that goes: ""But the wooden ships/Were just a hippie dream,"" and David Geffen in ""Drifter,"" with the line: ""Dont try to tell me what I gotta do to fit."" The resumption of his partnership with Crazy Horse on  Life  (1987) fulfilled his contract with Geffen, and Young was finally able to switch labels.   Director Pope again made a series of videos from the album, including ""Touch the Night"" and ""People on the Street"".   Signing with  Warner Brothers  (which distributed Geffen at the time) and returning to Reprise Records, Young produced  This Note's For You  (1988) with a new band, The Bluenotes, whose name rights were owned by musician  Harold Melvin . Young named his band after a cafe called the Blue Note on Main Street in Winnipeg Manitoba, where he had played. The addition of a  brass  section provided a new  jazzier  sound and the title track became his first hit single of the decade. Accompanied by a video which parodied corporate rock, the pretensions of advertising and  Michael Jackson  in particular, the song was initially banned by  MTV  (although the Canadian music channel,  MuchMusic  ran it immediately) before being put into heavy rotation and finally given the  MTV Video Music Award for Best Video of the Year  for 1989. After Melvin sued over the use of the Bluenotes name, Young renamed his back-up group ""Ten Men Workin'"" for the balance of the concert tour.   Young also contributed to that year's CSNY reunion  American Dream  (1988) and CSNY played a few benefit concerts. Young, however, refused to book a full tour with CSN and the foursome would not embark upon a nationwide tour until 2000.     [ edit ]   1990s - Return to country-rock roots   Freedom  was a mixture of acoustic and electric rock dealing with the state of the U.S. and the world in 1989, alongside a set of love songs and a version of the standard ""On Broadway."" "" Rockin' in the Free World "", two versions of which bookended the album, again caught the mood. Some say it became a  de facto  anthem during the fall of the  Berlin Wall , a few months after the record's release. However, most Germans don't remember the song being related to the unification, understandably so, since the lyrics are not about political repression. Like  Bruce Springsteen 's "" Born in the U.S.A. "", the anthemic use of this song was based on largely ignoring the verses, which evoke social problems and implicitly criticize American government policies. In mid-1989, record executive  Terry Tolkin  conceived and produced a tribute album to Young's songs called  The Bridge: A Tribute To Neil Young,  released on his  No.6 Records  label. It featured cover versions of 15 of Young's songs by the cream of the up and coming  Alternative Music  and  Grunge music  bands including  Sonic Youth ,  Nick Cave ,  Soul Asylum ,  Dinosaur Jr ,and  The Pixies . By 1990,  grunge music  was beginning to make its first inroads in the charts and many of its prime movers, including  Nirvana 's  Kurt Cobain  and  Pearl Jam 's  Eddie Vedder , cited Young as a major influence.   Using a barn on his  Northern California  ranch as a studio, he rapidly recorded  Ragged Glory  with Crazy Horse, whose guitar riffs and feedback driven sound showed his new admirers that he could still cut it. Young then headed back out on the road with Orange Country country-punk band  Social Distortion  and  alternative rock  elder statesmen  Sonic Youth  as support, much to the consternation of many of his old fans. [ 26 ] [ 27 ]  Yet the influence of Sonic Youth could be clearly heard on the accompanying home video and live album,  Weld , which also included a bonus CD entitled  Arc , a single 35-minute-long collage of  feedback  and guitar noise that Neil included, evidently at the suggestion of Sonic Youth's  Thurston Moore . [ 28 ]   Arc  was later sold separately.   Young's next move was another return to country music.  Harvest Moon  (1992) was the long-awaited sequel to  Harvest  and reunited him with some of the musicians from that session, as well as singers  Linda Ronstadt  and  James Taylor . The title track was a minor hit and the record was reviewed and sold equally well, containing songs such as ""From Hank to  Hendrix "" and ""Unknown Legend"", a tribute to his wife. His resurgent popularity saw him booked on  MTV Unplugged  in 1993. In 1992 he accompanied fellow  Winnipegger   Randy Bachman  on ""Prairie Town,"" a song that recounts their days in the Winnipeg music scene of the 1960s. That year, he contributed music to the  soundtrack  of the  Jonathan Demme  movie  Philadelphia , and his song ""Philadelphia"" was nominated for the  Academy Award for Best Song , losing out to Bruce Springsteen's contribution to the same film. A summer tour covering both Europe and North America with  Booker T. and the MGs  (with whom he played two songs at a 1992  Bob Dylan  tribute concert at  Madison Square Garden ) was widely praised as a triumph. On a few of these dates, the show ended with a rendition of ""Rockin' in the Free World"" played with  Pearl Jam .   Young was back with Crazy Horse for 1994's  Sleeps with Angels , a much darker record. The title track told the story of  Kurt Cobain 's death; Young had reportedly made repeated attempts to contact Cobain prior to this event. [ 29 ]  Cobain had quoted Young's ""It's better to burn out than fade away"" (a line from "" My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue) "") in his alleged  suicide note , causing Young to emphasize the line ""'cause once you're gone you can't come back"" in live performances at the time. Other songs dealt with drive-by shootings (""Driveby""),  environmentalism  (""Piece of Crap"") and Young's own vision of America (the archetypal car metaphor of ""Trans Am""). Young was inspired to make the record after viewing Cobain's performance on  MTV Unplugged . Still admired by the prime movers of grunge, Young eventually performed with Pearl Jam at the MTV Music Awards during what was described as the highlight of a lackluster show. [ 30 ]  Their collaboration led to a joint tour, with the band and producer  Brendan O'Brien  backing Young. The accompanying album,  Mirror Ball  (1995), recorded as live in the studio captured their loose rock sound, and featured the standout track ""I'm the Ocean"". The year of 1995 also featured Young's entry into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame .   After composing an abstract, distorted feedback-led guitar instrumental soundtrack to  Jim Jarmusch 's  acid western  film  Dead Man  Young recorded a series of loose jams with Crazy Horse that eventually appeared as the critically denigrated  Broken Arrow . The return to Crazy Horse was prompted by the death of mentor, friend, and longtime  producer   David Briggs  in late 1995. The subsequent tours of Europe and North America in 1996 resulted in both a live album and a tour documentary directed by  Jim Jarmusch . Both releases took the name  Year of the Horse .   In 1997, Young participated in the  H.O.R.D.E. Festival 's sixth annual tour.   In 1998, Young shared the stage with the rock band  Phish  at the annual  Farm Aid  concert, and later offered them an opportunity to headline both nights of the Bridge School Benefit concert. Phish took Young up on his offer to headline the Bridge School Benefit (where Young joined Phish for renditions of ""Helpless"" and ""I Shall Be Released."" [ 31 ]  Phish, however, declined Young's later invitation to be his backing band on a 1999 tour. [ 32 ]   The decade ended with  Looking Forward , another reunion with Crosby, Stills and Nash. The subsequent tour of the United States and Canada with the reformed super quartet was a huge success and brought in earnings of $42.1 million, making it the eighth largest grossing tour of 2000.   Young's next album,  Silver & Gold  (2000), contained a number of understated songs with personal lyrics, which was promoted through a mini-tour of solo acoustic shows. This style was continued in  Are You Passionate?  (2002), an album of love songs dedicated to his wife, Pegi.     [ edit ]   In the aftermath of 9/11   Young's 2001 single "" Let's Roll "", was a tribute to the victims of the  September 11, 2001 attacks , and the passengers and crew on  Flight 93  in particular. At the "" America: A Tribute to Heroes "" concert he performed  John Lennon's  "" Imagine "". In 2002,  Q  magazine  named Neil Young in their list of the ""50 Bands To See Before You Die.""   Young hauled out his concept album  Greendale , about an extended family in a small town called Greendale, and how they are torn apart by a murder, in 2003.  Greendale  was recorded with Crazy Horse members Billy Talbot and Ralph Molina. This tale of the Green family also resulted in a movie called  Greendale , written and directed by Young (again using his ""Bernard Shakey"" pseudonym) and starring a few of his friends, who act out and  lip sync  the songs from the album. The film was indeed thoroughly experimental, from Young's rambling on-stage between-song narratives, to his reading apparent transcriptions of these ramblings in the liner notes. ""When I was writing this I had no idea what I was doing, so I was just as surprised as you are,"" Young said later. Young toured extensively with the  Greendale  material throughout 2003 and 2004, first with a solo, acoustic version in Europe, then with a full-cast stage show in North America,  Japan , and  Australia . While audience reaction was sometimes mixed (drunken requests for ""Southern Man"" being an aesthetic impediment at most Young performances), the live stage version of Greendale was for many critics the most satisfying incarnation of the material, and bootlegs of the shows have been widely traded. The second half of each concert consisted of high-decibel renditions of Young classics such as ""Hey Hey, My My,"" ""Cinnamon Girl,"" ""Powderfinger,"" and  Rockin' in the Free World , as well as rarities such as ""The Losing End,"" ""The Old Country Waltz,"" and ""Danger Bird.""   Young spent the latter portion of 2004 giving a series of intimate acoustic concerts in various cities with his wife, Pegi, who is a trained vocalist and guitar player.     [ edit ]   Recent events          From left,  Emmylou Harris , Neil Young and  Pegi Young  perform in  Neil Young: Heart of Gold , which offered renditions of some of Young's best-known songs.       On  March 31 ,  2005 , Young was admitted to a hospital in New York for treatment for a brain  aneurysm . He was treated successfully by a minimally invasive  neuroradiological  procedure. Prior to undergoing the procedure, he wrote the first eight songs of a new album,  Prairie Wind , in  Nashville , with session musicians that included regular Young sideman  Ben Keith  on lap and  pedal steel guitars . Two days after the procedure, Young was forced to cancel a scheduled appearance on the  Juno Awards  telecast in Winnipeg when the area where the surgeons did his procedure (via the  femoral artery ) suddenly began to bleed. While Young finally was able to return to Winnipeg in 2006 with Crosby, Stills and Nash, his first post-aneurysm performance was on  July 2 ,  2005 , at the close of the  Live 8  concert in  Barrie, Ontario . There, he debuted a new song, a soft hymn called ""When God Made Me.""   On  September 28 ,  2005 ,  Prairie Wind  was released. In an interview given to  Time  magazine , Young revealed that he had planned to keep the news of his aneurysm private until he had the bleeding scare, after which he decided to make news of his condition public. The last two songs on the album were written after his aneurysm procedure, and several of the songs, such as ""Fallin' Off the Face of the Earth,"" seem to be inspired by Young's brush with  mortality , the recent death of his father, who suffered from  senile dementia , and Young's  Manitoba  roots.   In 2006,  Neil Young: Heart of Gold , a film made by  Jonathan Demme , premiered at the  Sundance Film Festival . Filmed over two nights at the  Ryman Auditorium  in  Nashville, Tennessee  during the premiere of  Prairie Wind , it includes both new and old songs as well as behind-the scenes-commentary by Young, his wife Pegi, and members of Young's session band.   In April 2006, Young announced the release of  Living with War , an album of protest songs that included the provocatively-titled "" Let's Impeach the President ."" Recorded using his famous  Les Paul  electric guitar, "" Old Black ,"" along with Chad Cromwell (drums), Rick Rosas (bass), and Tommy Brea (trumpet), the album was intended to be a stinging rebuke of U.S. President  George W. Bush  and the  War in Iraq . The album was recorded in a two week period in April, and was then made available over the internet from 28 April 2006 before being released as a CD on 5 May.  Living With War  was Young's most talked about release for years, creating heated political debate and a return to form with perhaps his most critically-acclaimed album since the early 1990s.  Living With War: In the Beginning , a remixed version with the original album's choral backing vocals removed, was released in December of the same year. Its accompanying DVD featured videos directed by Young of every song on the album, footage of the  Iraq War  and demonstrations in the US, and clips from  Al Gore 's  An Inconvenient Truth .          Neil Young on the CSNY ""Freedom Of Speech Tour '06""       From July through September 2006, Neil Young reunited with his former bandmates from  Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young  for the ""Freedom Of Speech Tour '06"" across North America. Chad Cromwell and Rick Rosas made up the band's rhythm section. The entire  Living with War  album was performed on the tour, in addition to other CSN and Neil Young classics such as "" Ohio "" and "" Rockin' in the Free World ."" An accompanying concert film and live album, called  CSNY Deja Vu , were premiered on January 25, 2008, at the Sundance Movie Festival.   2006 also saw the first release from Young's long awaited  Archives  project, as  Live at the Fillmore East , a selection of songs drawn from a 1970 gig with  Crazy Horse , was released in November of that year. The release was marked as number two in the  Archives Performance Series , leaving room for the still-unreleased 1969  Riverboat  bootleg, which will be number one in the series. In March 2007, another historical live album, marked as the third in the  Performance Series , was released. Titled  Live at Massey Hall 1971 , it featured a solo acoustic set from Toronto's Massey Hall, including material from the upcoming  Harvest  album.   On  August 15 ,  2007 , Young played a new album for 100 people at Reprise Records entitled  Chrome Dreams II .  Chrome Dreams  was an album he scrapped in 1977, and the name of two different bootlegs. The new album includes two long songs that time in at 18:13 (""Ordinary People"") and 14:31 (""No Hidden Path""), respectively. The album consists of three songs written previously and seven new songs, all by Young. The album was released on October 23, 2007, timed to coincide with a seven-week tour that had kicked off in Boise, Idaho, ten days earlier.   On February 11, 2008, Neil Young started the European leg of his tour with a concert in  Antwerp ,  Belgium . On July 17, he was interviewed on  PBS  by  Charlie Rose , where he spoke about many things, including his project to make a hybrid 1959 Lincoln. [ 33 ]  In October, a BBC 4 documentary ""Neil Young - Don't be Denied"" was shown, featuring interviews with Neil and a number of his contemporaries. It also summarizes his biography and motivations. [ 34 ]   The latest album in the Performance Series,  Sugar Mountain - Live At Canterbury House 1968  was released on December 2, 2008. Featuring material from Young's earliest solo performances recorded in Ann Arbor, MI November 9, 1968, the album was released as number zero in the  Performance Series .   The first installment of Young's oft-delayed box set  The Archives Vol. 1 1963-1972  was officially announced in 2008 with a trailer.  [ 35 ]   [ 36 ]  The first set of Archives will feature both DVD and Blu-ray editions which will include 128 audio tracks (43 unreleased and 13 never before heard songs), thousands of images (photos, lyrics, letters and memorabilia), and hours of new, previously released and rare videos. Also included will be a 236 page hardbound book. The Blu-ray edition will have HD picture, pristine audio mastered and presented in 24bit 192 khz., and access to photos, trivia and memorabilia without stopping the music. It is currently scheduled for release in 2009.   A March 31,2009 date has been set for Neil's new album 'A Fork in The Road', which will delay the release of the Archives until later in 2009.   Young currently lives on a 1500-acre (6 km) ranch in  La Honda, California , called Broken Arrow. He also owns property in  Fort Lauderdale, Florida , and on the islands of  Hawaii .   Young headlined the 2009  Big Day Out  festival in  New Zealand  and  Australia . Young pushed other current mainstream bands to only secondary headlining, including  Arctic Monkeys  and  The Ting Tings . He will also headline the Friday at  Glastonbury Festival  which has attempted to book him for many years. Although not officially confirmed, a number of sources have suggested this. [ 37 ]     [ edit ]   Influence, importance and inspiration   Neil Young has undeniably been an important artist in the history of American and Canadian popular music and remains a distinct influence upon other recording artists.  Lynyrd Skynyrd s "" Sweet Home Alabama "" was written in response to two of Neil Youngs songs ""Southern Man"" and ""Alabama"". ""Ohio"" which Young recorded with Crosby, Stills and Nash, was a recollection of the tragic events that transpired at Kent State University in May 1970. Young's willingness to be politically outspoken and socially conscious allowed him to influence such important artists such as  Phish ,  Pearl Jam , and  Nirvana . Neil Young is referred to as ""the Godfather of  Grunge "" because of the influence he had on  Kurt Cobain  and  Eddie Vedder  and the entire grunge movement. Kurt Cobain quoted Neil Young in his suicide note, using the line Its better to burn out, than to fade away from Youngs song ""My My, Hey Hey (Out Of The Blue)"". Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam inducted Neil Young into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, citing him as a huge influence. He has also been a big influence on  experimental rock  acts like  Sonic Youth  and  Radiohead . Youngs influence, importance and inspiration within the music scene derive in part from his longevity because of a career spanning more than four decades. His first album was released in 1966 and his latest in 2008.  Bob Dylan 's influence on Young has been so obvious that the former once lambasted: "" Heart of Gold  bothered me every time it came on the radio ... and I'd say, 'Shit, that's me. If it sounds like me it might as well be me. (...) It seemed somebody else had taken my thing and had run away with it, you know, and I never got over it. Maybe tomorrow"" [ 38 ] . The Dutch guitar virtuoso  Jan Akkerman  described a typical electric guitar solo by Young as the sound of ""a Belgian  vibrator "" in a 1994 TV documentary, adding that it somehow became more palatable when one saw Young's grimace to accompany it  [ 39 ] .   The Australian rock group  Powderfinger  attribute their group name to their love of Young.   Toronto  based band  Constantines  recorded a version of Neil's  Fuckin' Up  in  Winnipeg , [ 40 ] which surfaced at the b-side the their ""Our Age"" 7"" [ 41 ] in November 2008. The members of the  Constantines  have occasionally played shows under the name Horsey Craze [ 42 ] , singing Neil Young songs. In early 2006, they released a vinyl only split-album with The Unintended. The Constantines recorded four Neil Young songs for the LP, while The Unintended performed four Gordon Lightfoot songs.   While in Winnipeg on November 2, 2008 during the Canadian leg of his tour,  Bob Dylan  visited the former home of Neil Young in River Heights. The home was where Neil spent some of his teenage years. Dylan was interested in seeing the room where some of Neils first songs were composed.     [ edit ]   Achievements   Young was inducted into the  Canadian Music Hall of Fame  in 1982. He has been inducted into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  twice: first in 1995 for his solo work, with an induction speech given by  Eddie Vedder , and again in 1997 as a member of Buffalo Springfield.   He has also directed five movies under his pseudonym Bernard Shakey, and released them through his own Shakey Pictures imprint:  Journey Through the Past  (1973),  Rust Never Sleeps  (1979)  Human Highway  (1982) (starring new wave band  Devo ), and  Greendale  (2003) and the documentary,  CSNY Deja Vu  (2008). The bonus  DVDs  included in both versions of  Greendale  and in  Prairie Wind  are also directed by Young under the Bernard Shakey alias, and all of Young's home video and DVD releases have been co-released under the Shakey Pictures imprint.   As one of the original founders of  Farm Aid , he remains an active member of the board of directors. For one weekend each October, in  Mountain View, California , he and his wife host the  Bridge School Concerts , which have been drawing international talent and sell-out crowds for nearly two decades with some of the biggest names in rock having performed at the event including  Bruce Springsteen ,  David Bowie ,  The Who ,  Red Hot Chili Peppers ,  Trent Reznor  of  Nine Inch Nails ,  Pearl Jam ,  Sonic Youth  and Sir  Paul McCartney . The concerts are a benefit for the  Bridge School , which develops and uses advanced technologies to aid in the instruction of children with disabilities. Young's involvement stems at least partially from the fact that both of his sons have  cerebral palsy  and his daughter, like Young himself, has  epilepsy .   Young was nominated for an  Oscar  in 1994 for his song ""Philadelphia"" from the film  Philadelphia  (Bruce Springsteen won the award for his song "" Streets of Philadelphia "" from the same film). In his acceptance speech, Springsteen said that ""the award really deserved to be shared by the other nominee's song."" That same night,  Tom Hanks  accepted the Oscar for Best Actor and gave credit for his inspiration to the song ""Philadelphia"".   He was part owner of  Lionel, LLC , a company that makes toy trains and model railroad accessories. [ 43 ]  In 2008 Lionel emerged from bankruptcy and his shares of the company were wiped out. At this time his status with Lionel is unknown, according to Lionel CEO Jerry Calabrese he is still a consultant for Lionel. He was instrumental in the design of the Lionel Legacy control system for model trains [ 43 ]  and it is believed he will continue to develop the system. Young has been named as co-inventor on seven U.S. Patents related to model trains. [ 44 ]   Young has twice received honorary doctorates. He received an Honorary Doctorate of Music from  Lakehead University  in  Thunder Bay ,  Ontario  in 1992, and an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from  San Francisco State University  in 2006. The latter honour was shared with his wife Pegi for their creation of the Bridge School.   In a ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"" list in the June 1996 issue of  Mojo  magazine , Young was ranked No. 9.   In 2003, Rolling Stone listed Young at #83 in its rankings of ""The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time,"" describing him as a ""restless experimenter...who transform[s] the most obvious music into something revelatory."" [ 45 ]   In 2000, Young was inducted into  Canada's Walk of Fame . [ 46 ]  He ranked No. 39 on  VH1 's 100 Greatest Artist of Hard Rock  that same year.   In 2001, Young was awarded the Spirit of Liberty award from the civil liberties group  People for the American Way .   In 2004,  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked Neil Young [ 47 ]  #34 on their list of the  100 Greatest Artists of All Time . [ 48 ]   In 2006, Paste Magazine compiled a ""Greatest Living Songwriters"" list; Young was ranked No. 2 behind  Bob Dylan . (While Young and Dylan have occasionally played together in concert, they have never collaborated on a song together, or played on each others' records).   Jason Bond, an  East Carolina University  biologist, discovered a new species of trapdoor spider in 2007 and named it  Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi  after Young, his favorite singer. [ 49 ]   In 2008, Rolling Stone ranked Young at #37 in its list of ""The 100 Greatest Singers of All-Time. [ 50 ]   In 2009, He was nominated for a Grammy for Best Solo Rock Vocal performance.     [ edit ]   Instruments          Neil Young, 2008 in  Florence       Neil Young is a collector of second-hand guitars, but in recording and performing, he frequently uses just a few instruments. As explained by his longtime guitar technician  Larry Cragg  in the film  Neil Young: Heart of Gold , they include:     1953  Gibson Les Paul Goldtop Nicknamed "" Old Black "", this is Young's primary  electric guitar  and is featured on  Rust Never Sleeps  and most other albums. Old Black got its name from a purely amateur paintjob applied to the originally-gold body of the instrument, sometime before Neil acquired the guitar in the late 1960s. In 1972, a mini- humbucker  pickup from a  Gibson Firebird  guitar was installed into the lead/treble position, replacing a  P-90  as standard on Les Paul guitars from that era. This pickup, severely  microphonic , is considered a crucial component of Neil's sound. A  Bigsby vibrato tailpiece  was installed as early as 1969 on the guitar, and can be heard clearly during the opening of ""Cowgirl in the Sand"" from  Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere . This guitar also features a mini-switch that is used to send the signal from the mini-humbucker direct to the amp, without going through the volume or tone controls. A Les Paul Gold Top of the same year as Old Black was assembled by Neil's guitar tech, using same style Firebird pick up in the guitar as well as the same model Bigsby Vib; but, according to Young, was just not the same as the original. Young acquired Old Black from Jim Messina, swapping one of his Gretches for it in 1969 while Messina was assisting Young on his first solo album. Messina, who played briefly in Buffalo Springfield and produced the band's final album, ""Last Time Around,"" still has the Gretch in his possession.       Martin D-45 His primary  steel-string acoustic guitar ; used to write ""Old Man"" and many other hit songs.   Martin D-28Nicknamed ""Hank"" after its previous owner,  Hank Williams . The guitar came into Young's possession after  Hank Williams, Jr.  had traded it to another owner for some shotguns and it went through a succession of other owners until it was located by Young's longtime friend Grant Boatwright. The guitar was purchased by Young from  Tut Taylor . Young has toured with it for over 30 years. A story about the guitar and inspired song known as ""This Old Guitar"" can be seen about 50 minutes into the film  Neil Young: Heart of Gold . It is Young's primary guitar for the album,  Prairie Wind .   Neil Young can be seen playing a Vagabond Travel Guitar as he sings ""Let's Impeach the President"" on  The Colbert Report  on  Comedy Central .   A 12-string Taylor 855 is used in the first half of the soundtrack and concert film ""Rust Never Sleeps""   1927  Gibson  MastertoneA six-string  banjo , tuned like a guitar. It has been used on many recordings and was played by  James Taylor  on ""Old Man"".   Various vintage  Fender Tweed Deluxe  amplifiers Young's preferred amplifier for electric guitar is the diminutive Fender Deluxe, specifically a Tweed-era model from 1959. Neil purchased his first vintage Deluxe in 1967 for $50 from the drummer of Crazy Horse, Ralph Molina, and has since acquired nearly 450 different examples, all from the same era, but he maintains that it's the original model that sounds superior, and is a crucial component to his trademark sound. The Tweed Deluxe is almost always used in conjunction with a late-1950's Magnatone 280 (similar to the amp used by Lonnie Mack and Buddy Holly). The Magnatone and the Deluxe are paired together in a somewhat unique manner - the external speaker jack from the Deluxe sends the amped signal through a volume potentiometer and directly into the input of the Magnatone. The Magnatone is notable for its true pitch-bending vibrato capabilities, which can be heard as an electric piano amplifier on ""See the Sky About to Rain"". A notable and unique accessory to Young's Deluxe is the Whizzer, a device created specifically for Young, which physically changes the amplifier's settings to pre-set combinations. It has gone through many incarnations.   Gretsch 6120  (Chet Atkins)Before Young bought Old Black, this was his primary electric guitar used during his  Buffalo Springfield  days.   Gretsch White Falcon   Late '50s hollow body that Young purchased near the end of the  Buffalo Springfield  era; in 1969 Young acquired a stereo version of the same vintage guitar from Stills, and this instrument is featured prominently during Young's early '70s period, and can be heard on tracks like ""Ohio,"" ""Southern Man,"" ""Alabama,"" ""L.A.,"" others. It is Neil's primary electric guitar during the  Harvest  era. This particular White Falcon is the stereo 6137, in which the signal from the three bass strings is separated from the signal from the three treble strings. Young typically plays this guitar in this stereo mode, sending the separate signals to two different amps: the Fender Deluxe and typically to either a Fender Tremolux or a low-powered Tweed Fender Twin. The separation of the signals is most prominently heard on the Harvest album song ""Words"".   Neil Young replaced his trademark Les Paul for a Gibson Flying V on the ""Time Fades Away"" tour.   Neil Young played a  Fender Broadcaster  on the Tonight's the Night tour and album.

The event's purpose was to commemorate the fall of the  Berlin Wall . A  video  of the concert was also commercially released.

[ 1 ]  The show had a sell-out crowd of over 250,000 people, and right before the performance started the gates were opened which enabled another 200,000 people to watch.   The concert was staged partly at Waters' expense. While he subsequently earned the money back from the sale of the CD and video releases of the album, the original plan was to donate all profits past his initial investment to the Memorial Fund for Disaster Relief, an UK charity recently founded by the late  Leonard Cheshire . Unfortunately, audio and video sales came in significantly under projections, and the trading arm of the charity (Operation Dinghy) incurred heavy losses. A few years later, the charity was wound up, and the audio and video sales rights from the concert performance returned to Waters. Waters stated on the first airing of the making of The Wall on  In the Studio with Redbeard  in July 1989 that the only way he was to resurrect a live performance of The Wall was ""if the Berlin Wall came down"". A few months after the interview was broadcast, the wall came down.   Initially, Waters tried to get guest musicians like  Peter Gabriel ,  Rod Stewart ,  Joe Cocker ,  Bruce Springsteen  and  Eric Clapton  but they were either unavailable or turned it down. Also, on the same 1989 interview with Redbeard, Waters also stated that ""I might even let  Dave  play guitar."" On  June 30 ,  1990  backstage at the  Knebworth  Pink Floyd performance at Knebworth '90,during a pre-show interview, David Gilmour responded to Roger's statement on an interview with Jim Ladd by saying that ""he and the rest of Pink Floyd ( Nick Mason  and  Rick Wright ) had been given the legal go ahead to perform with Roger but had not been contacted."" Two days later, on  July 2 ,  1990  Waters appeared on the American rock radio call-in show  Rockline  and contradicted his Gilmour invite by saying, ""I don't know where Dave got that idea"".   In the end, the guest artists for the performance included  The Band ,  The Hooters ,  Van Morrison ,  Sinad O'Connor ,  Cyndi Lauper ,  Marianne Faithfull ,  Scorpions ,  Joni Mitchell ,  Paul Carrack ,  Thomas Dolby  and  Bryan Adams , along with actors  Albert Finney ,  Jerry Hall ,  Tim Curry  and  Ute Lemper .   This performance had several differences from Pink Floyd's original production of  The Wall  show. Both ""Mother"" and ""Another Brick in the Wall, Part II"" (like in the 1980/81 concerts) were extended with solos by various instruments and the latter had a cold ending. ""In The Flesh"" (also like the 1980/81 concerts) has an extended intro, and ""Comfortably Numb"" featured dueling solos by the two guitarists as well as an additional chorus at the end of the song. ""The Show Must Go On"" is omitted completely, while both ""The Last Few Bricks"" and ""What Shall We Do Now?"" are included (The Last Few Bricks was shortened). Also, the performance of the song ""The Trial"" had live actors playing the parts, with  Thomas Dolby  playing the part as the teacher, hanging from the wall, Tim Curry was the prosecutor, and Albert Finney was the Judge.   The Wall - Live in Berlin  was released as a live recording of the concert, although a couple of tracks were excised from the CD version, and the  Laserdisc  video in  NTSC  can still be found through second sourcing. A DVD was released in 2003 in the USA by Island/Mercury Records and internationally by Universal Music (Region-free).   ""Tribute,"" the London-based 'good causes' campaign company, was retained to harness worldwide media resources, which included televising the show live in 52 countries for 2 hours, up to 5 repeats of the show in each of 20 countries, a highlights television show in 65 countries and distribution of a double music CD and post-production VHS videotape by  Polygram . Tribute also organised ticket sales for the live event.     [ edit ]   Set list     "" In the Flesh?

[ edit ]   Performance notes     Before the beginning of the show, brief performances by  The Hooters ,  The Band  and  The Chieftains  (with guest  James Galway ) were held, but none of the songs was ever officially released.       In the actual concert on live television, the second song, "" The Thin Ice "" and part of the third song, "" Another Brick in the Wall (Part 1) "", were disrupted when a circuit breaker tripped. It was reset, but immediately tripped again so they had to rewire some equipment. Those two songs had to be re-recorded for the issue of the videotape. After 'The Thin Ice' was interrupted, the original, live American broadcast of the show said: ""This is radio-aid live in berlin. If you're wondering what's happening, is, a production involving some thousands of people, has stopped. And when that has to happen, Roger walked out in front of the crowd, sort of waved to them and said, 'Oh well, this happened a couple of times during rehearsal' - in fact, if you were lucky enough to have seen 'The Wall' in L.A., when it was performed, I think, the second night, there was a curtain that caught fire, some very similar situation has happening [sic] here. They have to back up tapes, they have to re-cue lighting, get everybody ready, and then they're gonna roll it. He's actually kind of jovial about the whole thing, he's walking across the stage and just kinda went 'Aw, shucks,' and the crowd is laughing, they know what happened, that somebody missed a cue and they're gonna rewind, uh, get everything going again, and take the film back...because this is what happens with The Wall...is so tall...they end up using it as a kind of like a drive-in movie projector - uh, screen, rather - they project images on it and everything, so there's a lot of things that have to be re-wound, re-cued...and then they're gonna re-start it and then they're gonna come back to it....You're listening to 'The Wall, Live from Berlin' on the Global Satellite Network. And the reason we're here is for the 'Memorial Fund for Disaster Relief.' And if you'd like to help out, they're trying to get together and - unless you can write a check for $800 million - they're trying to get together some money that will be in a permanent account, and this money will then go whenever there's a disaster, whenever it's needed, somewhere in the world. And you can send your check into for 'the Memorial Fund for Disaster Relief' P.O. Box 4383 Hollywood, California 90078 - and i think we're doing the show again! Let's go back live to the stage! 'The Wall, Live from Berlin'""       The live performance of ""Mother"" was also hounded by a power failure.  Roger Waters  tried to get  Sinad O'Connor  to sing her parts anyway, or mime the song, while the error was being fixed. Offended by being asked to mime, she didn't return after the show to re-record the performance (which is how "" The Thin Ice "" was saved for the CD/Video release.) Instead, the release version of ""Mother"" comes from the dress rehearsal on the previous night before the concert. Consequently, the large projection of Gerald Scarfe's mother character that was projected on the screen during the concert cannot be seen on the video or DVD versions.       Bryan Adams  appeared to be merely miming his guitar-playing in  Young Lust , and the  Scorpions  appear to be doing the same on all their instruments during the fascist rally sequence; the reasons for this are unclear.       Jerry Hall  was criticized for her part as the  groupie  in the track  One of My Turns .       The Wife's part of ""The Trial"" had to be redone in studio, because the image of the live recording had poor quality. What is seen in the video issue is a close-up of Ute Lemper, against a dark background, lip-syncing to the original live sound.       Shot on  Potsdamer Platz , the no man's land between East and West Germany, the producers didn't know if the area would be filled with mines - no one did. Before setting up, they did a sweep of the area and found a cache of munitions and a previously unknown  SS   Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler  bunker. The  Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler  started as Hitler's elite personal bodyguard but were later diverted to Eastern and Western fronts. There is a misconception probably due to the SS division's name that the bunker found was the  Fhrerbunker  or the place were Adolf Hitler committed suicide which is false. The  Fhrerbunker  was in another location. [ 2 ]       At the request of the concert producers, part of the  Berlin Wall  was kept in place as a security fence behind the stage.       Paddy Moloney , bandleader for  The Chieftains , is listed as a guest performer in the show. Although The Chieftains played a daytime set before the concert, his solo contribution to the main show remains a mystery.       During the final chanting of ""Tear down the wall!"" in the Trial sequence, the wall has a projection of a concrete and graffiti marked semblance of the Berlin Wall, just before it is torn down.       The live  Van Morrison  version of "" Comfortably Numb "" is used in the  Martin Scorsese  film  The Departed . It is later used in  HBO 's ' The Sopranos '. Morrison also performed this version on his  2008  concerts.       During the  Run Like Hell  performance, the giant inflatable black pig that appears over the top of the wall actually knocks a few bricks off the top. After this, it doesn't move again and very little light is shone in its direction. It then gets quietly removed from the set at the beginning of  Waiting for the Worms .

Untitled Document       Music      CLASSICAL    Polish classical music was shaped, in large measure, by the Romantic tradition.    Its creator was Fryderyk Chopin (1810- 1849), many of whose works linked the    Romantic idiom with Polish folk music. This tradition was continued by Stanisw    Moniuszko (1819-1852), the composer of national operas and numerous of songs.    The Chopin tradition has also entrenched itself in Polish piano playing. Great    piano virtuosi, such as Jef Hoffmann, Artur Rubinstein or Ignacy Jan Paderewski,    have played Chopin with particular pleasure.   During the interwar period, international competitions were brought to life,    including one of the world's oldest, the Henryk Wieniawski Violin Competition    (a renowned violin virtuoso) in Pozna(since 1935), or the Fryderyk Chopin    Piano Competition in Warsaw (since 1927), in which Dmitri Shostakovich, Janusz    Olejniczak and Krystian Zimerman, among others, made their debut. In the field    of composition, the leading light of the period was Karol Szymanowski (1882-1937),    the creator of emotional music, often including folk colourings (e.g. the ballet     Harnasie ), which has recently become popular in Europe thanks to the    efforts of Sir Simon Rattle, famous for conducting the City of Birmingham Symphony    Orchestra (including the complete recordings for EMI).    After the Second World War, Polish composers, working under strong political    pressure, were forced to write celebratory works. Some emigrated (Roman Palester,    Andrzej Panufnik, Roman Maciejewski), while others, not wishing to buckle under    to the system, alluded to folk music or the ideals of absolute music. Thanks    to this, there arose worthwhile works untainted by political considerations    (Lutoswski's  Symphony No1 , the works of Grana Bacewicz and Bolesw    Szabelski). The situation changed after 1956, alongside the political ""thaw"".    Poles quickly found their feet in the new artistic reality. Pieces displaying    intriguing enlargement on ideas popular in Europe arose with unusual speed;    among such were the works of Tadeusz Baird and Kazimierz Serocki. In 1956, these    artists founded the ""Warsaw Autumn"" International Festival of Contemporary Music,    which still takes place annually and is one of the most important festivals    in Europe.    Equally quickly appeared revolutionary aesthetic ideas related to sonorism,    which is the technique of creating music based solely on sound colour. The pioneer    of sonorism was Krzysztof Penderecki (1933), who pointed a completely new developmental    direction in European contemporary music. Penderecki's avant-gardism was shocking    - he used, without scruple, sounds from the interface between art and life -    rustles, knocking, the wail of saws or the clatter of typewriters (Fluorescence).                                                                                                                                                                                          /td>                                    /td>                                                                       Witold Lutoswski                                                                                                                           Witold Lutoswski (1913-1994), on the other hand, concentrated on questions    of perfection of form and refinement of sound. His music is multi-layered, internally    rich and varied, displaying the discrete charm of constellations of sound, at    the same time not without dramatic interest ( the 3rd and 4th Symphonies    or Piano Concerto ).    Wojciech Kilar (1932) also belonged to the peak of the avant-garde, although    today he is better known for his film music (see p.39); the composer of orchestral    pieces such as:  Riff 62  (1962),  Generique  (1963) and  Diphtongos     (1964). Among the most popular of his works from that time is the symphonic    poem Krzesany (1974), an expression of Kilar's fascination with  minimal    music , characterised by a parsimony of form and content. This piece has    led a fruitful life and is still very much enjoyed by both performers and listeners.                                                                                                                                                                                          /td>                                    /td>                                                                       Henryk Mikoj                    Gecki                                                                                                      The departure from the avant-garde in order to get closer to the listener found    its embodiment in the works of Henryk Mikoj Gecki (1933). Gecki, in his    youth a self-styled supporter of non-compromise, gradually evolved into a mystic,    the best evidence of which is his  Symphony No3 , composed in 1976. Some    years later, it finally achieved an improbable media career. This was caused    by a release by the American company Elektra Nonesuch with a recording of the    Symphony performed by the American singer Dawn Upshaw and the London Sinfonietta.    The piece reached the top of the American and British charts and was the fifth    most popular piece in Britain in 1993. The British radio station Classic FM,    as a result of audience pressure, broadcast sections of Gorecki's piece round    the clock. Listeners to the  Symphony No3  included classical music lovers    as well as people who had no daily contact with such music, young people as    well as long-distance truck drivers. Gecki, with his simple and yet intense    music, reached everyone, revealing the world of primary emotions.    In the atmosphere of bringing the avant-garde to account, many composers returned    to forgotten, traditional ideals. This is particularly apparent in the works    of PaweSzymaki and PaweMykietyn. Their pieces are characterised by original    relationships to the stylistics of Classicism, Romanticism, and even the Baroque    (Mykietyn's  Sonnets  after Shakespeare), a long way from empty imitation.    The basis of this aesthetic approach is the attempt to discover new meaning    in classical art in the context of contemporary culture, which places both composers    in the camp of the musical postmodernists.    This dialogue with tradition is equally strongly apparent in Penderecki's more    recent works, reaching straight for cultural archetypes, evidence for which    can be found chiefly in his oratorios and operas (e.g.  The Devils of Loudun,    Paradise Lost, Die schwarze Maske ), which are the crowning achievement    of Polish operatic composition.    It is also worth recalling the recent premieres of Mykietyn's An Ignoramus    and a Madman, Zygmunt Krauze's Balthazar (on repertoire in Paris) and Bernadetta    Matuszczak's Antigone. Contemporary Polish works for the stage are, in common    with classics of this variety, presented by such leading directors as Mariusz    Treliki, Ryszard Peryt or Krzysztof Nazar. Great vocal-instrumental works    guest at the annual Wratislavia Cantans festival - from Gregorian chant to Gospel    & Negro Spirituals, from classical to avant-garde composers, and all in    wonderful performances by world class orchestras, choirs, groups and soloists,    interpreted by such conductors as Antoni Wit, Kazimierz Kord, Jacek Kaspszyk    or Tadeusz Struga. Jerzy Maksymiuk, one of the most colourful characters among    Polish conductors, tours abroad in the main, ever eager to attempt new and hitherto    unknown works. He has conducted, among others, one of the world's best orchestras,    the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra from Glasgow, receiving, at the end, the    esteemed title of Conductor-Laureate of that orchestra.    Among the artists present on the Polish concert stage, the leading positions    are occupied by singers - Teresa lis-Gara, Ewa Podle?, Kira Boreczko, Wiesw    Ochman and Romuald Tesarowicz. While it is true that many of them live abroad,    similarly to the composers Zygmunt Krauze and Hanna Kulenty, the violinist Bartmiej    Nizio the harpsichordist Elieta Chojnacka, and the pianists Krystian Zimerman    and Piotr Anderszewski, they have strong links with the Polish cultural inheritance,    as may be heard in their repertoire.    JAZZ, POP, ROCK    What is it that distinguishes popular music? It is governed not so much by    established artistic canons as by market forces. It has become a branch of a    gigantic industry in which particular rules apply. Alongside the multinational    record companies, however, there still appear independents, releasing music    which does not require a media clamour. Such music is known as club, or niche    music. Thanks to such niches, the picture of pop-culture is brightened by thousands    of musical colours and tastes. And Polish artists take part in its creation.     It is not difficult to record an album these days, and their worldwide availability    is also nothing unusual. So how, in this enormous artistic market, can Poles    differentiate themselves, what marks out their originality? What is the deciding    factor that makes an American, French or Japanese music-lover reach for a Polish    disk, or the audiences in Hamburg, London or Moscow listen to concerts by Polish    artists?    The post-war history of Polish popular music began with jazz. And that is the    way it stayed until 1950. Then, the Communist authorities decided that jazz    was an expression of sympathy with a hostile ideology. Shortly after, it was    officially denounced and its performance and promotion prohibited. Only during    the second half of the Fifties, together with the ""ideological thaw"", did some    signs of artistic freedom appear. In 1956, jazz enthusiasts under the leadership    of the outspoken writer Leopold Tyrmand (later an igr organised Poland's    first international jazz festival, which is today, going under the name Jazz    Jamboree, the oldest in Europe.    Among the pioneers of the Polish jazz scene was Krzysztof Komeda (1931-1969).    A doctor by education, a pianist and composer by desire, he was the leader of    many groups, the author of countless jazz themes, and one of the most original    composers of film music during the 60's (see p.39).                                                                                                                                                                                        /td>                                    /td>                                                                       Urszula Dudziak                                                                                                      The greatest concentration of artistic activity towards the creation of an    individual musical identity took place in Poland during the Sixties. During    this period, young artists - searching for their own space in literature, film,    theatre, the visual arts, popular music and jazz - all made their debuts. These    searches are most fully and colourfully reflected in the jazz discographies    of the violinist and composer MichaUrbaniak, the vocalist Urszula Dudziak,    the pianist Adam Makowicz, the trumpeter Tomasz Stao, the saxophonist Jan    ""Ptaszyn"" Wrlewski and the pianist, trumpeter and trombonist Andrzej Kurylewicz.    They all began their careers during the Sixties, but gathered their artistic    momentum in the Seventies. Presently, in a musical landscape densely populated    by styles, fashions and trends, their music is an extravagant individuality,    recognised by the world's artistic authorities.   The name of MichaUrbaniak (1943) is most often mentioned these days among    Polish jazz musicians. His discs have been released at home and abroad in pressings    exceeding 1.5 million units. He also appears on the covers of tens of albums    released by the world's leading jazz musicians: Marcus Miller, George Benson,    Billy Cobham, Ron Carter, Joe Zawinul, Wayne Shorter, Sthane Grappelli and    Miles Davis, to name but a few. He surprised them with his openness to everything    new, and his ability to link jazz with rock or hip hop. Even his violins sound    completely different, their sound colour enhanced by electronics, and he can    alter his technique of forming sound to imitate a saxophone's wail or a human    voice.    In turn, Urszula Dudziak's (1943) voice is without doubt one of the most interesting    instruments in contemporary jazz. In 1958, Dudziak became the soloist in Krzysztof    Komeda's group. A few years later, she quit as a conventional jazz vocalist    in order to concentrate on electronic vocal effects. With this change, she created    a new style of jazz singing in which, to this day, she has no competition. She    impresses with her enormous vocal strength, and her intonation, technique, and    fluency, well demonstrated in the hit  Papaya .      Adam Makowicz (1940) has gained worldwide fame among jazz pianists. His performances    of George Gershwin's pieces have delighted more than just American audiences.    For his individual interpretations of Gershwin's music, he received special    permission from the composer's brother, Ira. In his playing the entire history    of jazz piano is reflected as if in a mirror: the charming swing of Teddy Wilson,    the fluency of Art Tatum, the joviality of Errol Garner, the elegance of Oscar    Peterson. He is more concise than Keith Jarrett and jazzier than Chick Corea.    All of this, ornamented with technical virtuosity, improvisational eloquence,    Chopinesque ""slavonicness"", creates a unique musical picture.                                                                                                                                                                                         /td>                                    /td>                                                                       Tomasz Stao                                                                                                      Tomasz Stao (1942), the winner of prestige awards like the Preis der Deutschen    Schallplattenkritik 2000 and the European Jazz Prize 2002, has held the title    of Europe's Number One Trumpeter for thirty years. In 1962, he became a member    of the Jazz Darings quartet, formed together with Adam Makowicz. It was probably    Europe's first Free Jazz group. Shortly thereafter, Stao embarked upon his    own, difficult journey achieving something that characterises the greatest:    a poetic unpredictability and a frantic expressiveness.    International fame is also enjoyed by the saxophonist Zbigniew Namyswski    (1939), one of the most creative figures on the European jazz scene. He was    the first Polish jazz musician to record abroad when he made the album Lola,    released in 1967 by Decca. This fact was noted in a ""Down Beat"" poll (1st place    in the Talent Deserving Wider Recognition category). He is a composer of film    music as well as his own concert and recorded repertoire, and many jazz themes,    in which he borrowed themes from Polish folk music.    Zbigniew Seifert (1946-1979), saxophonist and violinist, passed away prematurely.    During the period from 1967 to 1973 he worked with the Tomasz Stao Quintet.    Later he toured and recorded abroad, most often in West Germany, with the groups    of Albert Mangelsdorff, Chris Hinze, Charlie Mariano, with the group Free Sound,    and with Joachim Kn and McCoy Tyner. In 1976, he recorded his debut solo album,    Man of the Light, which brought him world attention. With a group of renowned    American jazzmen, including John Scofield, Eddie Gomez and Jack DeJohnette,    he recorded his twentieth and final album, Passion, which delights to this day    with its original violin expressiveness.    Polish jazz, by using a universal musical language, quickly and efficiently    found its place on the world stage. The one condition necessary for Polish songs    to cross geographical borders was to break through the language barrier. This    only happened at the beginning of the Nineties, when the multinational record    companies started to appear in the Polish music scene.                                                                                                                                                                                         /td>                                    /td>                                                                       Basia                                                                                                      During the second half of the Eighties, the difficult and somewhat self-contained    British music scene was successfully penetrated by Barbara Trzetrzelewska (1954),    but the Americans first accepted her sometimes swinging, but usually Brazilian-influenced,    songs. Today widely known as Basia, the singer and jazz vocalist, composer and    lyricist began her assault on the musical world in a Broadway recital. From    this artistic temple, with the help of albums, you can reach the furthest corners    of the globe without obstacles; songs reach the highest positions in the charts    without difficulty; and every album is covered in gold or platinum.    The least success on the international scene has been achieved by Polish rock,    it being difficult to compete with the British giants. In the last decade, however,    much has changed. The English language version of one of the group Myslovitz's    albums was promoted with concerts in London. The group's stage presence was    also recognised when they received an MTV European Music Award in 2002 in the    category Best Polish Act. This category, it is worth remembering, appeared just    three years ago.    The Death Metal group Vader is one of the few Polish groups of its type known    and valued on the world music scene. The group was formed in 1985, and five    years later began their international career, supported by the English record    company Earache Records. Since 1993, they have played in Poland at the more    important rock festivals as well as abroad, in Europe, Japan, the USA and Canada.                                                                                                                                                                                          /td>                                    /td>                                                                       Cracow Klezmer                    Band                                                                                                      Fans of an original sound may be pointed in the direction of the Cracow Klezmer    Band, an unusual quartet of young virtuosi playing such instruments as accordion,    violin, clarinet, double bass and percussion. Their dynamic compositions and    surprising arrangements make them one of the most interesting exponents of the    contemporary radical stream in the rebirth of Jewish music. The group do not    limit themselves to purely Jewish influences, however, but also incorporate    elements of the Balkan, Arabic, Romany and Slavonic traditions. They have successfully    toured with such famous names as Brave Old World, Anthony Coleman & Sephardic    Tinge, The Klezmatics, and Dave Krakauer Klezmer Madness. The Cracow Klezmer    Band's music enchanted John Zorn himself, one of the most creative artists on    the contemporary music scene. In 2000, the group's debut album, entitled De    Profundis, was released by his famous New York company TZADIK, followed a year    later by the second - The Warriors.       More and more frequently, independent releases promoting ethnic music, fashionable    the world over, are appearing abroad. For enthusiasts of ethnic-folk music,    there should be a place in the collection for recordings by Trebunie Tutki.    This Polish Highland group is the continuation of a century-old musical family    tradition. They began their professional stage career in 1991 with a concert    with legendary Jamaican roots-reggae group, Twinkle Brothers. The album they    recorded together, (Janosik) in Sherwood, was recognised as one of the best    World Music albums released during the 10-year existence of the World Music    Charts Europe, an organisation of radio producers from the 11 countries gathered    together in the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). Similar popularity was achieved    by the album Best Dub/Greatest Hits. The trance-inducing fiddles, catchy melodies    and rhythmic swagger of the multi-talented Norman Grant create a remarkable    fusion of two musical cultures.    It is also worth getting to know the music of De Press, a folk-punk group founded    in 1980 in Oslo (Norway) on the initiative of Andrzej Dziubek and the Norwegian    musicians Jorn Christensen and Ola Snortheim. The repertoire consists of songs    inspired by Polish highland folk music, liberally besprinkled with elements    of punk, hardcore and ska. The group have collaborated with musicians from Sweden,    Belarus and Russia.    The picture of Polish popular music would be incomplete without mention of    composers of film music. Their achievements, known for years, have been recognised    with many awards. After Bronisw Kaper, the late Henryk Wars made his mark    in Hollywood during the 50s. In the 1960s, the glittering Hollywood career of    Krzysztof Komeda was ended by a tragic accident. Nowadays, the musical ornamentation    of many a well-known film is provided by Jan A.P. Kaczmarek, Wojciech Kilar    and Zbigniew Preisner, co-creators of successes in American and European cinema.

Schaeffer is also well known      (particularly among German-speakers) as a theoretician and historian of contemporary      music and as the author of avant-garde and very amusing plays (including Script      for Three Actors).      Polish pianists are sometimes gifted in unusual ways. Ignacy Jan Paderewski,      having already achieved fame as a musician, did not hesitate before accepting      the top job in the first independent government of the Polish Republic in      1919. Artur Rubinstein and Mieczysw Horszowski were successfully touring      at the age of nearly 100. Jef Hofman invented windscreen wipers and paper      clips, and Janusz Olejniczak played Chopin's role in Andrzej wski's film      La note bleue.     The record for the highest number of sales garnered by a single CD release      of a performance of a contemporary music work (in the classical music category)      - over 1 million copies - belongs to H.M. Gecki's Symphony No3, released      by Elektra Nonesuch.      At the end of the Fifties, Krzysztof Penderecki sent three compositions      to one competition, although only one was allowed. The first he wrote left-handed      (his usual hand), the second right-handed, and the third he asked another      person to copy, all to have the greatest chance of gaining a prize. It turned      out that all three compositions won awards: the First Prize, and two Seconds.     The Sinfonia Varsovia                                                                                                                                                                                        /td>                                    /td>                                                                       Krzysztof Penderecki                                                                                                                          Krzysztof Penderecki is the orchestral director of the Sinfonia Varsovia orchestra,    founded in 1984 from the Polish Chamber Orchestra and considered to be one of    the best in the world. The Sinfonia's first permanent guest conductor was Yehudi    Menuhin, and currently it is JosCura. With an almost unlimited repertoire,    the Sinfonia Varsovia performs all over the world with the best conductors (Mstislav    Rostropovitch, Jerzy Maksymiuk) and artists (JosCarreras, Placido Domingo,    Andreas Vollenweider).

The decision to introduce    these two talented and beautiful artists to the world was taken by Western managers    (including Jim Beach, who for many years managed Queen). Edyta Gniak took    second place in the Eurovision Song Contest in Dublin (1994) and has partnered    the great tenor JosCarreras in a charity concert. The British and German media    have dubbed her the greatest discovery of the last decade. She has all the right    characteristics to eventually occupy the places of Liza Minelli or Whitney Houston:    an exotic beauty, a marvellous voice and a great talent. Anna Maria Jopek has    received and award from the hands of Michel Legrand himself for her vocal abilities,    while Pat Metheny has recently chosen her as a partner for a collaborative jazz    recording. Her onstage charm, jazz spirit and delicacy effectively counterpoint    the sound of Metheny's guitar.

The album was produced by  Brendan O'Brien , who had previously worked on  Pearl Jam 's  Vs.  and  Vitalogy .   Neil Young  joined Pearl Jam in the studio in Seattle in January 1995, eleven days after performing with the band at an abortion-rights benefit in  Washington, D.C. [ 1 ]  The album was recorded in four days' studio time (January 26, January 27, February 7, and February 10). [ 2 ] [ 3 ]  Young took the approach of recording the songs live in the studio. Young brought ""Song X"", ""Act of Love"", and five other songs into the studio to record for the first session in January. [ 1 ] [ 3 ]  For the second session in February, he brought in two more songs. [ 3 ]  Young also wrote two new songs during the February recording sessions, and one song from the January sessions was re-recorded. [ 3 ]  Young said that all of the songs, with the exception of ""Song X"" and ""Act of Love"", were written in the four-day time period in which the album was recorded. [ 3 ]   Young said he traveled to Seattle to record the record for a ""challenge."" [ 3 ]  He said, ""Recording  Mirror Ball  was like audio vrit, just a snapshot of what's happening. Sometimes I didn't know who was playing. I was just conscious of this big smouldering mass of sound."" [ 3 ]  Young called Pearl Jam drummer  Jack Irons  ""unbelievable."" [ 3 ]  He stated that he ""played his ass off on every take at every session,"" and added, ""I can't say enough good things about him."" [ 3 ]  Pearl Jam frontman  Eddie Vedder  was not around much for the recording sessions. [ 4 ]  Vedder explained that he was ""in the midst of a pretty intense stalker problem,"" adding that ""leaving the house wasn't the easiest thing to do."" [ 4 ]  Pearl Jam guitarist  Stone Gossard  said that  Mirror Ball  ""came at a time when we needed it, that Neil thought we were a band that would be good to make a record with. He probably felt sorry for us. He made it all right for us to be who we were. He's not taking his career so seriously that he can't take chances. Suddenly, our band seemed too serious."" [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Music and lyrics   Mirror Ball  captures a loose  rock  sound. The album has a very raw sound to it, with songs ending in feedback and band members talking at the start and at the end of many songs, including Young remarking at the end of ""Downtown"" - ""Well, we know  that  one."" Young wrote all of the tracks for the album, except for ""Peace and Love"", which was co-written by Young and Vedder. William Ruhlmann of  Allmusic  said ""[Pearl Jam] boasts spirited rhythms and dense guitar interplay that Young makes excellent use of in a series of songs built out of simple, melodic rifts."" [ 5 ]   On the lyrical content of  Mirror Ball , Young said, ""There's idealism and reality, the two have got to come together yet there are always major problems when they do. Maybe that's the crux of what I'm trying to say in this new album. It's also a commentary of the differences between my peace and love '60s generation and the more cynical '90s generation."" [ 3 ]  ""Song X"" and ""Act of Love"" were written about  abortion . [ 1 ]  ""Downtown"" includes references to  Jimi Hendrix  and  Led Zeppelin . The reference to Led Zeppelin was partly inspired by Young's performance with the band at the 1995  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  induction ceremony. [ 1 ]     [ edit ]   Release and reception   Mirror Ball  reached number five on the  Billboard  200  album chart.  Mirror Ball  has been certified gold by the  RIAA . [ 6 ]   Rolling Stone  gave  Mirror Ball  four out of five stars. Reviewer J.D. Considine said, ""Though Young is clearly the dominant partner  it's his concept, after all, his songs and his album  it's Pearl Jam who ultimately end up determining the music's shape and feel, providing a level of input and energy that goes well beyond the normal purview of a backing band."" [ 7 ]  David Browne of  Entertainment Weekly  gave the album an A-. Browne said that ""the album has a spontaneous, bang-it-out casualness that is, to say the least, extremely rare for a rock veteran."" However, Browne criticized the album's lyrics, calling them ""mostly jumbled rehashes of standard Young imagery."" [ 8 ]   ""Downtown"" and ""Peace and Love"" had accompanying music videos. ""Downtown"" was the most successful song from  Mirror Ball  on the rock charts, charting at number 6 on the  Billboard   Mainstream Rock Tracks  chart. ""Peace and Love"" also charted on the Mainstream Rock charts. At the  1996 Grammy Awards , ""Downtown"" received a nomination for  Best Rock Song  and ""Peace and Love"" received a nomination for  Best Male Rock Vocal Performance . [ 9 ]   Mirror Ball  received a nomination for  Best Rock Album . [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Imagery and design   Tying in with the album title, a  mirror ball  graces the album's cover art. Due to legal complications between their respective record companies, only Young's name appears on the album sleeve, although the individual members of Pearl Jam are credited inside. [ 10 ]  Pearl Jam's  Merkin Ball  complements the layout and content of the album packaging for  Mirror Ball . The title  Mirror Ball  comes from the line ""There's a mirror ball twirlin'"" from the song ""Downtown"".     [ edit ]   Tour   Following the completion of  Mirror Ball , the members of Pearl Jam without Vedder, but with the addition of O'Brien on keyboards, joined Young in August 1995 for an eleven-date tour in  Europe  to promote the album (when the band toured, fans referred to them as ""Neil Jam""). [ 11 ]  This tour proved very successful with Young's manager Elliot Roberts calling it ""One of the greatest tours we ever had in our whole lives."" [ 12 ]     [ edit ]   Track listing   All songs written by  Neil Young , except where noted:     ""Song X""  4:40   ""Act of Love""  4:54   ""I'm the Ocean""  7:05   ""Big Green Country""  5:08   ""Truth Be Known""  4:39   ""Downtown""  5:10   ""What Happened Yesterday""  0:46   ""Peace and Love"" (Young,  Eddie Vedder )  7:02   ""Throw Your Hatred Down""  5:45   ""Scenery""  8:50   ""Fallen Angel""  1:15       [ edit ]   Outtakes   The songs "" I Got Id "" and ""Long Road"", both written and sung by Vedder, were cut from the album. [ 1 ]  Both songs were recorded at the tail end of the  Mirror Ball  sessions. [ 13 ]  The tracks were later compiled on to Pearl Jam's 1995  Merkin Ball  EP, which is considered the official companion to Young's  Mirror Ball .

They can show us the way back to a consciousness of that universality that underlies all human achievements. They can make us once more realize that nothing in this world exists quite in and by and for itself, but that everything pertaining to the human spirit is correlated and interrelated with everything else. And by so doing they can once more give us a feeling for something that is in truth the beginning and end of all wisdom.

The link between numbers and music was observed by Pythagoras by analyzing the vibrations of strings of various lengths. According to legend he discovered the mathematical rationale of musical consonance from the weights of hammers used by smiths. He found that the interval of an octave is rooted in the ratio 2:1, that of the fifth in 3:2, that of the fourth in 4:3, and that of the whole tone in 9:8. The Pythagoreans applied these ratios to lengths of a string on an instrument called a  canon , or monochord  ( a board with two bridges between which a string is stretched and a third bridge that divides the string in two parts) , and thereby were able to determine mathematically the intonation of an entire musical system.

The Lyre, with 3 strings, according to mythology was invented by  Hermes  and was given to  Apollo  (who some say added another 4 strings). Most common probably was the lyre with 7 strings but there are versions with more strings for example 9 strings (Theophrastus of Piera), 10 strings (Histaeus of Colophon) or 12 strings (Melanippides)              The elements of a lyre:              The soundbox ( echeion ), the 2 arms peichis ( πήχεις  ) or kerata. The crossbar ( zygon ) joining the 2 arms, the strings ( chordai  or  neurai ), gut or linen, attached to the  chordotonion  or  chordotonos , situated in the lower part of the soundbox. The strings passed over a bridge ( magas ) and stretched to reach the zygon, where they were fixed by mobile leather or cotton rings or pegs called  kollaboi  and  kollopes .              Orpheus  obtained the Lyre from  Apollo  when he was a child and lessons how to play it. Historical it is an instrument that was known at least around 3000 BC in Ur. The lyre was known in Crete at least before 1400 as the  Agia Triada Sarcophagus fresco  shows a musician  who plucks at a seven-stringed lyre with a plectrum (and also an Aulos player is shown).  According to a story Orpheus Lyre was thrown in a river and after a journey reached Apollo's temple in Lesbos. Apollo asked  Zeus  the Lyre to become a constellation, the  Lyra constellation , with the known star Vega that once was the polar star. (Strange but it is called by the Britons also  King Athur's Harp Star ).              Amphion  is said to have built Thebes by the music of his lyre.               "" O, had I lived when song was great                In days of old Amphion ,""  Alfred Lord Tennyson                                                        Hermes with a Chelys Lyra                             Coin with seven string Chelys Lyra, Calymna ( Kalymnos )                             Panticapaeum Lyra                                         Chelys Lyra  (χέλυς λύρα) (using a tortoise shell covered by leather). Instrument found at weddings (epithalamia), symposia, and komoi, (activities with men dancing). It was played by women: hetairai or courtesans who entertained at the symposia or respectable women who played at weddings or for their own entertainment. We have also a story how this instrument was discovered by Hermes. At the age of one day (!!!), he climbed out of his cradle and he found the shield of a turtle. The place was in Corinthia in the today municipality  Evrostina  around the mountain Chelydoris. He stretched the skin of a cow around it, fixed two horns through the holes were once the paws of the animal stood and he tied strings at the horizontal connection between the arms. The cow was taken from the cattle of his brother Apollo who was angry until Hermes offered him the lyre. Another version from  A catechism of familar things :  It is supposed to have originated from the discovery of a dead tortoise, the flesh of which had dried and wasted, so that nothing was left within the shell but sinews and cartilages: these, tightened and contracted, on account of their dryness, were rendered sonorous. Some one, Mercury or Apollo, they affirm, in walking along, happening to strike his foot against the tortoise, was greatly pleased with the sound it produced .  From Diane Touliatos-Miliotis :  The other parts of the chelys-lyra included a ""donax,"" which was a cane or reed that possibly functioned as a bridge or brace for the arms. The ""pecheis ( πήχεις  )"" were the arms of the lyra that entered the soundbox from the front. The ""zugon"" or crossbar was notched across the upper ends of the arms to which the seven strings of sheepgut were attached. The chelys-lyra had the same kollopes and plektron as the kithara, but the plektron cord was attached to the base of the outer arms more often than to the base of the soundbox.

Phorminx  (φόρμιγξ) (Similar to the kithara but the arms are straighter and more parallel, and were often elaborately carved, 2) the wooden soundbox of the phorminx has a softer, rounder curve to it, and 3), the soundbox almost always displays unique circle or ""eye"" designs on its face.) Probably played mainly by women and used as a domestic instrument. After the middle of the 4 th  century BC not in use. A Phorminx version named by Max Wegener in 1949 the cradle-Kithara (Wiegenkithara)  From Diane Touliatos-Miliotis :  Homer also refers to the phorminx as bright sounding (ligus) and ornate (daidaleos) in decoration. Homer continues to give us a description of the construction of the instrument by indicating that the instrument's strings were made of sheepgut and that kollopes were used as tuning devices. The kollops over which the string was pulled was a roll of rough leather. It was the roughness which held the string in place at the crossbar. From a Byzantine writer by the name of Eustathius, we know that the kollops was a tuning device made from the hide of the necks of oxen or sheep. Because the ancient Greeks also boiled the sheep and oxen necks for the purpose of making glue, we have the derivation of the word ""kolla"" (glue). Because of the written descriptions and visual depictions, it can be surmised that the phorminx had a curved outline, a hollow space inside the soundbox, and a round base. Another part of the phorminx was the zugon, which although translates as ""yoke"", was the crossbar or bridge which joined the two arms of the instrument that could be decorated.

The flute was used by Spartans as a military music instrument. From Diane Touliatos-Miliotis :  The Phrygian aulos [is] feminine because it is mournful and threnodic, and of the medial instruments... the Pythian aulos participates more in masculinity because it is grave, and the choric aulos in femininity because of its ease at a high pitch.  (according to Aristides Quintilianus )  Aulos Images (common double-reed instrument and the monoaulos) , Aristoxenus considers 5 sizes :  parthenios  (maiden type),  paidikos  (boy type),  kitharisterios  (kithara playing type),  teleios  (complete), and  hyperteleios  (extra complete)  Music lesson, a pupil learns to play the aulos-flute  (See:  The Aulos and Drama: A Performer's Viewpoint)                                                               The Muse Calliope with a Syrinx                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Pan and Daphnis, Altemps Inv8571                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Syrinx  (σύριγξ ) (Panpipe (αυλός του Πανός) with usually 7 pipes).  Already known in  the Cyclades around 2500 BC. According to Mythology  Pan  fell in love with the waternymph Syrinx. She ran away from him and when she could not cross the river Ladon to escape she asked Artemis to help her.  J ust as Pan was about to embrace her, Syrinx changed into cattail reeds. Pan holding the marsh reeds sighed in disappointment, causing the wind to blow through the reeds. He was enchanted by the sound, believing it to be the mournful cry of his beloved Syrinx; He produced a set of pipes so that he could have her with him always.

Phorbeia : A type of bandage that held the two flutes in place using two holes in it in which the flutes could be attached.)  According to Aristotle (Politics) pipes should not be used in education because pipe music is orgiastic and it hinders the use of one's logos   Eric Csapo   (Music and the Muses)                                       Other Instruments                                        Kymbala  (κύμβαλα )(Cymbals,  Cheirokymbala ,  Anakara ) (other names also used  Baboulion  and  Bakyllion, Kymbalion  (small version)). A musical instrument, in the shape of two half globes, which were held one in each hand by the performer, and played by being struck against each other.

From Suidas and the Scholiast on Aristophanes ( Nubes, 260), probably a split reed or cane, which clattered when shaken with the hand. According to Eustathius it was made of shell and brass, as well as wood. Clemens Alexandrinus says that it was an invention of the Sicilians. The word  krotalon  is used also as a metaphor, for a noisy talkative person. The sound of the krotala is called  rhymbos  or  rombos .

This Hegeleos, according to the story, was the son of Tyrsenus, and Tyrsenus was the son of  Heracles  and the Lydian woman; Tyrsenus invented the trumpet, and Hegeleos, the son of Tyrsenus, taught the Dorians with Temenus how to play the instrument, and for this reason gave Athena the surname Trumpet .

Much later, artisans of the Renaissance era re-discovered Aeolian Harps, fascinated with both their physical and etheric properties. Much experimentation with the Aeolian principle, i.e., the vibration of strings by wind, led to a variety of designs and installations as illustrated by these two towers.(circa 1695 AD)   http://www.harmonicwindharps.com/  ,  The Aeolian Harp  . Were such instruments build by the ancient Greeks and if not was the instrument and its name (based on Greek mythology) just invented only in the 17 th  century?                    From the Lyre derived  Lyric poetry  (a term not used before the Hellenistic times) refers to a song accompanied usually by the lyre (and/or the aulos). Forms of Lyric songs sometimes in combination with dance depending on the occasion are:                    Dithyramb , choral song (hymns in honor of Dionysus) at the Dionysia festival, improvised early with the chorus dressed like animals (goats) from which the tragedy (Greek word for song of goats) developed ( Herodotus )                         Enkomion , praise for some person                         Epinikion , song for victory athletic or military “ A poet, along with his trained band of singers and musicians, would stand by the altar to the victor’s god and offer “prayer, praise, and admonition mingling with the fumes of intoxicating poetry ” ( Performance of Epinician Odes )                         Erotikon , love songs                         Hymenaios , wedding songs “ Marriage festivals, for example, used a special kind of lyric poetry called the hymeneal, which was sung during the wedding ceremony. After the wedding, the groom took the bride to his house, accompanied by dancers, instrumentalists, and the singing of another hymenaeum  “ ( Example from the Iliad  ) ( Epithalamion )                         Hymn , praise for a god                         Hyporcheme , song and dance during sacrifice around an altar                         Paean , praise song , traditional hymns to Apollo or Artemis such as described by Homer “ These prayers varied in length and were sung both on private occasions, such as dinners or weddings, and on public ones, such as festivals or battles ”                          Partheneion , songs by chorus of maidens                                            Phallic songs  (phallika)                                       Prosodion , liturgic, thanksgiving “ these were sung at festivals by groups of men and woman carrying flowers, sacred emblems, and sacrifices to the gods. Often, the processions were formal and showy and might have been accompanied by other dancers and chorus singers. The prosodia was a recognized form of religious poetry for which many poets composed and even received rewards at festivals ”                           Skolion , banquet song “ along with the accompaniment of a hired lyre player or piper, the guests took turns singing something—a hymn, a commentary, a piece of advice, anything they wished—or continuing what had been sung by the previous singer ”                          Threnos  funeral song                                                                             Monodic Lyric  (performed by a single person)                    Choral Lyric  (performed for the public, (festivals, religious or athletic) by a choir)                                       Comments by  Autumn Gurgel  Running head: Roots and Theories of the Doctrine of Ethos                                                                Heracles (Hercules) going to his lessons.  He is chaperoned by Linus (some sources say his nanny), who is holding his lyre for him .  Heracles teacher of Music was Linus and Eumolpus. Linus tried to punish Heracles who was not a good student but th result was that he was killed by Heracles who could not control his power.                    The musical education of the Greeks is stressed by all writers. It must be remembered, however, that the word ""music"" had a much wider application at that time than it now has. The Greek word  mousike   at first referred to the arts of the nine Muses. Gradually its meaning was extended to include everything connected with the training of the mind, just as the word  gymnastike  included everything pertaining to the training of the body. To speak of a Greek as having a good ""musical education"" is equivalent to saying that he was trained in  all  the liberal arts, including mathematics. The Greek ideal of education was based upon the idea of universality, of the integration of all branches of learning. "" Musical training ,"" Plato said, "" is a more potent instrument than any other, because rhythm and harmony find their way into the inward places of the soul, on which they mightily fasten ."" To this he added gymnastics, insisting, however, that even physical exercise should be performed for the benefit of the soul, since the soul demands a temple worthy of its occupancy. The combination of music and gymnastics, he said, produces a harmonious balance between soul and body. Physical training develops courage and fortitude; music develops a love of the beautiful, and affords the mental and moral discipline necessary to the acquirement of philosophical knowledge. He considered music, however, as the more important of the two, describing it as the fortress of the State. He warned all intelligent rulers to pay careful attention to the development of music in their state, never allowing bad qualities to creep into it, as these would affect the mental and moral stamina of the citizens who listened to it. Finally he insisted that all art be subordinated to ethics and used as a means of moral education.

At the dawn of the 18th century, the piano was still in itsinfancy having recently evolved from other musical instruments like the arpsichordand the lavichord            Therefore, keyboardists of that time, such as  Johann Sebastian Bach , born in  1685 , composed keyboard works that were never intended for the piano.                     Sebastian Bach was an organist, who developed a unique keyboarding style called ugue which is a polyphonic composing method where each hand plays separate melody lines in a harmonically interwoven manner.             Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , born in  1756 , was a child prodigy by the age of 5, and is probably the most celebrated piano composer of the 18th century.           The early 19th century gave rise to the term lassical music and of all the famous piano composers of that era,  Franz Liszt  was the undisputed heavyweight champ of classical piano composers.           Born in  1811 , it was said that Liszt would lock himself away to practice his piano regimen for up to fourteen hours a day, pushing the piano instrument to its limits, and eventually creating over 1300 piano compositions during his lifetime!           In fact, many piano historians of today still refer to Franz Liszt as the greatest technical keyboardist to ever lay hands on a piano.  (Too bad there were no phonograph recordings at that time)            And apparently, Liszt was a bit of a on Juanin his day. His astonishing showmanship on the piano was said to produce an almost feverish enchantment with the female listeners in his audiences.           The late 19th century would see the first innovator of Jazz music, (which was just being invented in New Orleans during the 1890).                  Born in  1868 ,  Scott Joplin  was a classically trained African-American pianist who combined the early sounds of Jazz with syncopated piano rhythms, creating what would become known as agtime           Joplin tride pianowould not only influence the future of contemporary jazz, but also led to the emergence of swing, bebop, and boogie-woogie.                    At the beginning of the 20th century, famous piano composers like  Duke Ellington ,  Thelonious Monk  and  Art Tatum  would become the innovators of these dynamic keyboarding styles.           The mid 20th century would see yet another marriage of genres that would shift the course of popular music for decades to come.           Born in  1930 , the legendary  Ray Charles  became the first classically trained piano player to combine the distinctive sounds of gospel music with the often picylyrics of rhythm & blues, creating a new brand of music called oul                      Ray use of blues, gospel, country and folk music would also shape the direction of Rock and Roll.            With the 1950 emergence of rock nroll pianists like  Little Richard  and  Jerry Lee Lewis , the wild side of rock music was only just beginning!                 Ray Charles would become the musical inspiration for many other famous piano composers such as  Stevie Wonder ,  Billy Joel , and countless other musical heavyweights of today.             So let take a closer look at some of the most important and famous piano composers in history, review a brief biography of their lives, and highlight the unique contributions theye each given to the world of music ...                              Vince Guaraldi                     Vince Guaraldi  was born on July 17, 1928 in San Francisco, California, USA. He was a jazz pianist who described himself as  ""a reformed boogie-woogie piano player"", although his fellow band mates used to refer to him as ""Dr. Funk"" during the late 1950's and early 1960's.            Vince Guaraldis' Christmas music inspired many other famous piano composers after him, such as David Benoit, who went on to continue scoring the Peanuts series after Guaraldi untimely passing.             Stevie Wonder                     Stevie Wonder  was born  Stevland Hardaway Judkins  in Saginaw, Michigan to Lula Mae Hardaway on May 13, 1950. He has undoubtedly been one of the most beloved and famous piano composers in R&B and popular music over the past four decades.            Despite being blind from the time he was an infant he was an accomplished singer and musician all by the time he was just nine years old.                             Billy Joel                     Billy Joel  was born  William Martin Joel  on May 9, 1949, in the Bronx, New York, and was raised in Hicksville, Long Island.           Enrolling in classical piano lessons at an early age, Joel would become one of the best selling and most famous piano composers of the mid 1970's, 80's and early 1990's.             Ray Charles                     Ray Charles Robinson  was a musical genius who changed the direction of  all  music during his 50-year career, winning dozens of Grammy Awards along the way.            Born on September 23, 1930 in Albany, Georgia, Charles overcame tremendous hardships in his early years to become one of the most innovative and famous piano composers of the 20th century.

The ensemble surveyed its audience some months ago, asking for favorite pieces from the group's rich repertoire. The resulting concert, at St. Matthew's Lutheran Church, was an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink evening of music.                   Director Sharon Hansen and the singers opened with sacred selections of faiths. They gave Copland's ""At the River"" an angelic performance and brought polished, beautifully shaped phrases and exceptional ensemble singing to Sister Cherubim Schaefer's ""Laudate Dominum.""                   With Ben Steinberg's ""Meditation - Oseh Shalom,"" the singers created a creamy unison sound that unfolded into wonderfully warm harmonies. They gave a sweetly earnest take on Robert Harris' ""This Little Light of Mine.""                   The ensemble singers handle the styles and languages of these pieces with complete ease. Hansen's hands move in a controlled, expressive ballet to which the singers respond with tremendous nuance and musical expression and the sort of clarity and precision that finds them in perfect unison on sibilants and consonants.                   - Elaine Schmidt Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, April 13, 2008                                     ""Sharon Hansen's 18 women could sing soup recipes to major scales and mmm-mmm good. . . No wonder Hansen had composers lining up to write music for her group's 10th anniversary concert. Saturday's program, at Elmbrook Church, comprised 10 premieres. That remarkable fact testifies to the superior musicianship of these singers. . . The singers elevated all of this music because they tuned every chord exquisitely and understood the role of their particular note in the mix. This unrelenting awareness of the whole fabric sets the Choral Artists apart and makes the simplest chord progression vivid. Hansen, of course, has a lot to do with this, in rehearsal and on the podium. She seems to have a finger on each note at any given moment.""                   - Tom Strini, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Feb. 17, 2008                                                                       TOP FIVE EVENTS OF 2007-2008                                                     ""Overall, 2007-2008 was a very good classical season, with many memorable highlights. . . Olivier Messiaen's Three Small Liturgies of the Divine Presence was profound as performed by Milwaukee Choral Artists and Present Music. . .""                   - Rick Walters, Shepherd Express, Wednesday, June 25,2008                                                                       #1 PERFORMING ARTS EVENT IN 2007                                                     ""Milwaukeeans never tire of saying that the quantity and quality of our performing arts outshine those of cities twice our size.

Stalheim has also reached out for fruitful collaborations with other groups around town.                    On Nov. 18, the most significant of many collaborators were conductor Sharon Hansen and her Milwaukee Choral Artists. They joined . . . the Present Music ensemble and various guest artists in a rare and exquisite performance of Messiaen's ""Trois petites liturgies de la présence divine."" Hansen, also director of choirs at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, is one of the finest conductors I know. She had complete command of this difficult score and great feeling for its profound beauty.""                   - Tom Strini, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, December 24, 2007                                     ""Sharon Hansen conducted ""Three Liturgies,"" which featured her women's choir, the Milwaukee Choral Artists. Hansen held complete control over a large, well-prepared and highly focused ensemble. They sang and played with an awareness of pitch that turned Messiaen's exotic, chiming harmonies to blazing gold. . . Hansen and her singers and players fully realized Messiaen's colors and impulses, in a performance so disciplined that it was completely free.""                   - Tom Strini, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, November 18, 2007                                                                       #1 PERFORMING ARTS EVENT IN 2005                                                     ""Breakthrough musical group of the year: Sharon Hansen's Milwaukee Choral Artists, a small choir of women, has always been good. But their Liederabend concert (Oct. 14, Woman's Club of Wisconsin) was a revelation. The pitch, the blend and the balance made harmonies gorgeous, and their legato style and dramatic phrasing made the art song deeply expressive. The choir sang with all the unanimity, freedom and flex of a great solo recitalist. The Liederabend was no fluke. The Choral Artists sang Medieval monophony and organum superbly by way of backing up the Boston Camerata on a fine Early Music Now program (Basilica of St. Josaphat, Dec. 3).""                   - Tom Strini, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, December 27, 2005                                     ""Friday evening, Sharon Hansen and her Milwaukee Choral Artists did not sound like a chorus at all.

Their command showed the music in the best possible light. They threw the dance rhythms into sharp relief, and the legato lines flowed sweet and thick as melted chocolate. They articulated Spanish consonants with crackling clarity and formed vowels of ringing unanimity. Chords - even complicated, jazzy extended chords - bloomed in well-tuned, full-color glory. They drew the ear close to their intimate murmurs and bowled it over with blazing climaxes.                   The concentration on the singers' faces, including those of the nine men who joined the women in the second half, was beautiful to behold. They were utterly intent upon their conductor and immediately responsive to her slightest signal, but furrowed no brows. Bright eyes and natural smiles ruled the evening. Most of this music is joyful, and it filled their faces and their voices with joy. They're superb singers and musicians, and they know it. Their preparation and confidence allowed them to enjoy the music and the act of making it, and that is the essence of a great concert.                   They concentrate so upon their leader because Hansen conveys something specific about every detail in the score. Her gestures showed when to come in and when to sing louder or softer. They shaped the phrase, located the beat and so on, skillfully and efficiently. Beyond that, her face and body language said: I love this music right down to my spinal cord. Anyone who looked at her Saturday couldn't help but love the music, too, and that is the essence of great conducting.""                   - Tom Strini, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, February 12, 2006                                     ""The Women of the Milwaukee Choral Artists gave voice to music . . .in a deeply moving, fascinating program . . .

The ensemble surveyed its audience some months ago, asking for favorite pieces from the group's rich repertoire. The resulting concert, at St. Matthew's Lutheran Church, was an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink evening of music.                   Director Sharon Hansen and the singers opened with sacred selections of faiths. They gave Copland's ""At the River"" an angelic performance and brought polished, beautifully shaped phrases and exceptional ensemble singing to Sister Cherubim Schaefer's ""Laudate Dominum.""                   With Ben Steinberg's ""Meditation - Oseh Shalom,"" the singers created a creamy unison sound that unfolded into wonderfully warm harmonies. They gave a sweetly earnest take on Robert Harris' ""This Little Light of Mine.""                   The ensemble singers handle the styles and languages of these pieces with complete ease. Hansen's hands move in a controlled, expressive ballet to which the singers respond with tremendous nuance and musical expression and the sort of clarity and precision that finds them in perfect unison on sibilants and consonants.                   - Elaine Schmidt Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, April 13, 2008                                     ""Sharon Hansen's 18 women could sing soup recipes to major scales and mmm-mmm good. . . No wonder Hansen had composers lining up to write music for her group's 10th anniversary concert. Saturday's program, at Elmbrook Church, comprised 10 premieres. That remarkable fact testifies to the superior musicianship of these singers. . . The singers elevated all of this music because they tuned every chord exquisitely and understood the role of their particular note in the mix. This unrelenting awareness of the whole fabric sets the Choral Artists apart and makes the simplest chord progression vivid. Hansen, of course, has a lot to do with this, in rehearsal and on the podium. She seems to have a finger on each note at any given moment.""                   - Tom Strini, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Feb. 17, 2008                                                                       TOP FIVE EVENTS OF 2007-2008                                                     ""Overall, 2007-2008 was a very good classical season, with many memorable highlights. . . Olivier Messiaen's Three Small Liturgies of the Divine Presence was profound as performed by Milwaukee Choral Artists and Present Music. . .""                   - Rick Walters, Shepherd Express, Wednesday, June 25,2008                                                                       #1 PERFORMING ARTS EVENT IN 2007                                                     ""Milwaukeeans never tire of saying that the quantity and quality of our performing arts outshine those of cities twice our size. We keep saying that because it's true. This year's top 10 list for classical music and dance could have been a top 20.                   #1. Present Music Thanksgiving program, Nov. 18, Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist.  Artistic director Kevin Stalheim has taken Milwaukee on an extraordinary, decades-long musical adventure, and not only through the vast range and number of new compositions he's commissioned. Stalheim has also reached out for fruitful collaborations with other groups around town.                    On Nov. 18, the most significant of many collaborators were conductor Sharon Hansen and her Milwaukee Choral Artists. They joined . . . the Present Music ensemble and various guest artists in a rare and exquisite performance of Messiaen's ""Trois petites liturgies de la présence divine."" Hansen, also director of choirs at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, is one of the finest conductors I know. She had complete command of this difficult score and great feeling for its profound beauty.""                   - Tom Strini, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, December 24, 2007                                     ""Sharon Hansen conducted ""Three Liturgies,"" which featured her women's choir, the Milwaukee Choral Artists. Hansen held complete control over a large, well-prepared and highly focused ensemble. They sang and played with an awareness of pitch that turned Messiaen's exotic, chiming harmonies to blazing gold. . . Hansen and her singers and players fully realized Messiaen's colors and impulses, in a performance so disciplined that it was completely free.""                   - Tom Strini, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, November 18, 2007                                                                       #1 PERFORMING ARTS EVENT IN 2005                                                     ""Breakthrough musical group of the year: Sharon Hansen's Milwaukee Choral Artists, a small choir of women, has always been good. But their Liederabend concert (Oct. 14, Woman's Club of Wisconsin) was a revelation. The pitch, the blend and the balance made harmonies gorgeous, and their legato style and dramatic phrasing made the art song deeply expressive. The choir sang with all the unanimity, freedom and flex of a great solo recitalist. The Liederabend was no fluke. The Choral Artists sang Medieval monophony and organum superbly by way of backing up the Boston Camerata on a fine Early Music Now program (Basilica of St. Josaphat, Dec. 3).""                   - Tom Strini, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, December 27, 2005                                     ""Friday evening, Sharon Hansen and her Milwaukee Choral Artists did not sound like a chorus at all. They approached their ""Liederabend"" - their evening of German Romantic song - like a soloist approaching a recital, to spellbinding effect. . . I've never heard a chorus sound quite like this.""                   - Tom Strini, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, October 14, 2005                                                                       BEST MUSICAL PREMIERE OF 2005                                                     ""And they were just as great in modern music on Nov. 20, when they lit up the gorgeous, complex harmonies of Daron Hagen's ""Flight Music"" at Present Music's Thanksgiving concert at the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist. While we're on the subject, let's name Hagen's ravishing ""Flight Music"" the best musical premiere of 2005.""                   - Tom Strini, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, December 27, 2005                                     ""Flight Music"" premiered Sunday at Present Music's Thanksgiving concert. The group's resident string quartet played the inaugural, along with Sharon Hansen's Milwaukee Choral Artists. The 17 women of this superb choir fine-tuned Hagen's sky-high columns of sound. They set the overtones aglow and lighted up the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist with purely musical electricity.  The women sang and Hansen conducted this difficult work with utter technical command and great sympathy for its ecstatic beauty, its meditative calm and its subtly propulsive rhythm.""                   - Tom Strini, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, November 20, 2005                                                                       OTHER REVIEW QUOTES:                                                     ""Hansen, with her gift for expressive detail, lovingly coaxed every bit of beauty from even the most mundane music. The 18 Milwaukee Choral Artists breathe and phrase as flexibly as a soloist. In the end, the program wasn't about female composers. It was about singing.""                   - Tom Strini, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, October 13, 2007                                     ""Women's voices, refined yet fervent, sang of hope and trial Saturday evening. Who would not be moved? . . . Were it not for Hansen and her 18 highly trained and disciplined singers, we never would have heard the Largo from Dvorak's ""New World"" symphony sung in a cappella vocalize . . . To hear it revived so lovingly and expertly, as it was Saturday, was beyond inspiring. . . Their clear and specific timbres, uncanny pitch and ensemble, and palpable moral commitment made music from the fringes of the repertoire sound central to every human life.""                   - Tom Strini, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, October 15, 2006                                     ""MCA musical director Sharon Hansen and her group of 16 women generously displayed their signature warm, unified timbre and effortless musicality. Listening to Lee Hoiby's Where the Music Comes From was as natural as resting near a country brook. David Brunner's O Music benefited from lovely choral phrasing and graceful accompaniment from cellist Paul Kilpatrick. Hansen conducted with the grace of a dancer, complete with expressive facial gestures and concise arm motions.""                   - Charles Grosz, The Shepherd Express, April 13, 2006                                     ""The Milwaukee Choral Artists succeeded Saturday in every way. Their command showed the music in the best possible light. They threw the dance rhythms into sharp relief, and the legato lines flowed sweet and thick as melted chocolate. They articulated Spanish consonants with crackling clarity and formed vowels of ringing unanimity. Chords - even complicated, jazzy extended chords - bloomed in well-tuned, full-color glory. They drew the ear close to their intimate murmurs and bowled it over with blazing climaxes.                   The concentration on the singers' faces, including those of the nine men who joined the women in the second half, was beautiful to behold. They were utterly intent upon their conductor and immediately responsive to her slightest signal, but furrowed no brows. Bright eyes and natural smiles ruled the evening. Most of this music is joyful, and it filled their faces and their voices with joy. They're superb singers and musicians, and they know it. Their preparation and confidence allowed them to enjoy the music and the act of making it, and that is the essence of a great concert.                   They concentrate so upon their leader because Hansen conveys something specific about every detail in the score. Her gestures showed when to come in and when to sing louder or softer. They shaped the phrase, located the beat and so on, skillfully and efficiently. Beyond that, her face and body language said: I love this music right down to my spinal cord. Anyone who looked at her Saturday couldn't help but love the music, too, and that is the essence of great conducting.""                   - Tom Strini, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, February 12, 2006                                     ""The Women of the Milwaukee Choral Artists gave voice to music . . .in a deeply moving, fascinating program . . . Hansen and the 15 women of the chorus . . .created nearly seamless unison sounds . . . They moved easily from pure, unison sounds . . .to a soaring forte . . .""                   - Elaine Schmidt, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, October 17, 2004                                     "". . .The all-female ensemble underscored the special place they have carved out in the local choral scene . . .stepping from era to era and genre to genre with finesse, polish, and musical integrity . . .enveloping the audience with elegantly sculpted phrases . . .""                   - Elaine Schmidt, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, April 7, 2003                                     ""Gorgeous blend, spot-on pitch, elegant phrasing and impeccable ensemble lifted everything Sharon Hansen's Milwaukee Choral artists sang . . .wow!""                   - Tom Strini, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, April 7, 2002                                     "". . . Wonderful repertoire and of course so musically interpreted and performed. Technique was just taken for granted.

[ 1 ]  Thus,  musical  ideas in improvisation are spontaneous, but may be based on chord changes in  Western music . [ 2 ]   Because improvisation is a performative act and depends on instrumental technique, improvisation is a skill. There are musicians who have never improvised and other musicians who have devoted their entire lives to improvisation.

Francesco Landini ,  Adrian Willaert ,  Diego Ortiz ,  Frescobaldi ,  J.S. Bach ,  Handel ,  Mozart ,  Beethoven ,  Chopin ,  Liszt , and many other famous composers and musicians were known especially for their improvisational skills. Improvisation might have played an important role in the monophonic period. The earliest treatises on polyphony, such as the  Musica enchiriadis  (ninth century), make plain that added parts were improvised for centuries before the first notated examples. However, it was only in the fifteenth century that theorists began making a hard distinction between improvised and written music. [ 4 ]  Many classical forms contained sections for improvisation, such as the  cadenza  in  concertos , or the  preludes  to some keyboard suites by Bach and Handel, which consist of elaborations of a progression of chords, which performers are to use as the basis for their improvisation.  Handel ,  Scarlatti , and  Bach  all belonged to a tradition of solo keyboard improvisation that was not limited to variations, but included the concerto form, typically with moving voices in both hands, occasionally exploring fugue.     [ edit ]   Medieval period   Although melodic improvisation was an important factor in European music from the earliest times, the first detailed information on improvisation technique appears in ninth-century treatises instructing singers on how to add another melody to a pre-existent liturgical chant, in a style called  organum . [ 5 ]  Throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance, improvised  counterpoint  over a  cantus firmus  (a practice found both in church music and in popular dance music) constituted a part of every musician's education, and is regarded as the most important kind of unwritten music before the Baroque period. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Renaissance period   Following the invention of music printing at the beginning of the sixteenth century, there is more detailed documentation of improvisational practice, in the form of published instruction manuals, mainly in Italy. [ 7 ]  In addition to improvising counterpoint over a cantus firmus, singers and instrumentalists improvised melodies over  ostinato  chord patterns, made elaborate embellishments of melodic lines, and invented music extemporaneously without any predetermined schemata. [ 8 ]  Keyboard players likewise performed extempore, freely formed pieces. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Baroque period     [ edit ]   Melodic instruments   Eighteenth-century manuals make it clear that performers on the flute, oboe, violin, and other melodic instruments were expected not only to ornament previously composed pieces, but also spontaneously to improvise preludes. [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Keyboard, lute, and guitar   The pattern of chords in many baroque preludes, for example, can be played on keyboard and guitar over a pedal tone or repeated bass notes. Such progressions can be used in many other structures and contexts, and are still found in Mozart, but most preludes begin with the treble supported by a simple bass.  J.S. Bach , for example, was particularly fond of the sound produced by the dominant seventh harmony played over, i.e., suspended against, the tonic pedal tone. [ 11 ]   There is little or no  Alberti bass  in baroque keyboard music, and instead the accompanying hand supports the moving lines mostly by contrasting them with longer note values, which themselves have a melodic shape and are mostly placed in consonant harmony. This polarity can be reversedanother useful technique for improvisationby changing the longer note values to the right hand and playing moving lines in the left at intervalsor with moving lines in both hands, occasionally. This shift of roles between treble and bass is another definitive characteristic. Finally, in keeping with this polarity, the kind of question and answer which appears in baroque music has the appearance of fugue or canon. This method was a favorite in compositions by  Scarlatti  and  Handel  especially at the beginning of a piece, even when not forming a fugue. [ 12 ]     [ edit ]   Organ improvisation and church music   Improvised accompaniment over a  figured bass  was a common practice during the Baroque era, and to some extent the following periods. Improvisation remains a feature of organ playing in some church services.     [ edit ]   The Classical period     [ edit ]   Keyboard improvisation   Classical music departs from baroque style in that sometimes several voices may move together as  chords  involving both hands, to form brief phrases without any passing tones. Though such motifs were used sparingly by Mozart, they were taken up much more liberally by Beethoven and Schubert. Such chords also appeared to some extent in baroque keyboard music, such as the 3rd movement theme in Bach's  Italian Concerto . But at that time such a chord often appeared only in one clef at a time, (or one hand on the keyboard) and did not form the independent phrases found more in later music. Adorno mentions this movement of the  Italian Concerto  as a more flexible, improvisatory form, in comparison to Mozart, suggesting the gradual diminishment of improvisation well before its decline became obvious. [ 13 ]   The introductory gesture of ""tonic, subdominant, dominant, tonic,"" however, much like its baroque form, continues to appear at the beginning of high-classical and romantic piano pieces (and much other music) as in  Haydn's sonata Hob.16/No. 52  and  Beethoven's sonata opus 78 .   Beethoven and Mozart cultivated mood markings such as  con amore ,  appassionato ,  cantabile , and  expressivo . In fact, it is perhaps because improvisation is spontaneous that it is akin to the communication of love. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Mozart and Beethoven   Beethoven and Mozart left excellent examples of what their improvisations were like, in the sets of variations and the sonatas which they published, and in their cadenzas. As a keyboard player, Mozart competed at least once with  Muzio Clementi . [ 15 ]  Beethoven won many tough improvisatory battles over such rivals as  Johann Nepomuk Hummel  and  Joseph Woelfl . [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Romantic period     [ edit ]   Instrumental   Extemporization, both in the form of introductions to pieces, and links between pieces, continued to be a feature of keyboard concertising until the early 20th-century. Amongst those who practised such improvisation were  Franz Liszt ,  Felix Mendelssohn ,  Anton Rubinstein ,  Paderewski ,  Percy Grainger  and  Pachmann . Improvisation in the area of 'art music' seems to have declined with the growth of recording. [ 17 ]     [ edit ]   Opera   After studying something more than 1,200 early  Verdi  recordings, Will Crutchfield concludes that ""the solo cavatina was the most obvious and enduring locus of soloistic discretion in nineteenth-century opera"".  [ 18 ]  He goes on to identify seven main types of vocal improvisation used by opera singers in this repertory  [ 19 ] :     1. The Verdian full-stop  cadenza   2.  Arias  without full-stop:  ballate ,  canzoni , and  romanze   3. Ornamentation of internal cadences   4. Melodic variants (interpolated hight notes,  acciaccature , rising two-note ""slide"")   5. Strophic variation and the problem of the  cabaletta   6. Facilitations ( puntature , simplification of  fioratura , etc.)   7.  Recitative         [ edit ]   Modern opinions on improvisation in art music     [ edit ]   Theodor Adorno   Toward the end of the section of  Aesthetic Theory  entitled ""Art Beauty"" (in the English edition),  Theodor Adorno  included a brief argument on improvisation's aesthetic value. Claiming that artworks must have a ""thing-character"" through which their spiritual content breaks, Adorno pointed out that the thing-character is in question in the improvised, yet present. [ 20 ]  It may be assumed Adorno meant classical improvisation, not jazz, which he mostly excoriated. He held jazz, for example, to be antithetical to Beethoven. [ 21 ]  There is more extensive treatment, essentially about traditional jazz, in  Prisms  and  The Jargon of Authenticity . [ 22 ]     [ edit ]   Glenn Gould   Improvisation may be pressed to derive something novel from past material, which becomes outmoded through its limited concepts of tonality, form, and variation. Though his understanding of modern music was itself unorthodox,  Glenn Gould  appears to have such a view as he clearly thought musical history was a finite exploration of forms and tonal concepts, and exhaustible. [ 23 ]   Despite these beliefs improvisation formed part of Gould's practicing and even recording, in the music of  Richard Strauss . The crisis of music theory, however, was one of the primary reasons Gould focused on interpretation as an art in studio  recording . In post-baroque music he often found traditional interpretation stale and boring. Gould's technique, which convinced many listeners, became conspicuous in some areas other than Bach and Beethoven. For example, he felt that Mozart could be hackneyed enough, even to cast doubt on the composer's own authority for form and development. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Contemporary improvisation     [ edit ]   Jazz improvisation   Improvisation is one of the basic tenets of jazz. Typically in a jazz piece, the "" head "" (the song's melody along with any backing harmony) is played once by the musicians and often repeated. Improvisation by any of the musicians follows, and this is typically the longest section of a song as each musician improvises their own melody over the harmonic and rhythmic foundation of the head. When the end of the head is reached it is repeated and a solo's length is specified by the number of repetitions of the head necessary. After one musician has finished improvising, another will begin, and no instrument is forbidden from improvising. A repetition of the head will usually end a jazz piece. There are many variations to this pattern; new sections can be added before and after the head, two musicians can alternatively improvise for short amounts of time (known as ""trading""), or several musicians can improvise in a group (collective improvisation is common in  Dixieland  jazz). [ citation needed ]   Many varied scales and their  modes  can be used in improvisation. These mainly depend on the nature of the harmonic framework. Against a C Minor seventh chord, for example, an improvisor would usually have a choice of using C Dorian, C Aeolian ( C natural minor), C blues, and others, depending on the situation and personal taste. Chord changes are very important in jazz improvisation as well. Whole solos can be built around chord tones. [ citation needed ]   In the  bebop  era of jazz in the early 1950s there was a common theme of urgency and technical proficiency. The modal era of jazz moved the harmonic framework for a piece from the fast, dynamic chord progressions of bebop to more static, relaxed chords with longer durations.  Free jazz  performers eschew the explicit harmonic framework for improvisation; the harmony in free jazz is less rigid and less traditional. [ citation needed ]   Illinois Jacquet , for example, is best known for a single solo on the tune  Flying Home , and such solos are often transcribed. They are often not written down in the process, but they help musicians practice the jazz idiom.  Charlie Parker 's improvisations were distinctive, helping to shape the bebop period. Though it is helpful to transcribe on one's own, Parker's solos are often studied in a published collection known as the Omni Book, and groups such as  Supersax  arrange his solos with their own harmonic backing. [ citation needed ]  Another example of a musician who improvises on solo piano is  Keith Jarrett  (see e.g. The Kln Concert ).   Improvisors like  Say  and  Montero  gravitate towards jazz and a fusion with classical music. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Contemporary classical music   While the first half of the twentieth century is marked by an almost total absence of actual improvisation in art music, [ 24 ]  since the 1950s, some contemporary composers have placed fewer restrictions on the improvising performer, using techniques such as vague notation (for example, indicating only that a certain number of notes must sound within a defined period of time). New Music ensembles formed around improvisation were founded, such as the  Scratch Orchestra  in England;  Musica Elettronica Viva  in Italy;  Lukas Foss 's  Improvisation Chamber Ensemble  at the University of California, Los Angeles;  Larry Austin 's  New Music Ensemble  at the University of California, Davis; the  ONCE Group  at Ann Arbor; the  Sonic Arts Group ; and  Sonics , the latter three funding themselves through concerts, tours, and grants. Significant pieces include Foss's  Time Cycles  (1960) and  Echoi  (1963). [ 25 ]   Other composers working with improvisation include  Richard Barrett ,  Pierre Boulez ,  Cornelius Cardew ,  Alvin Curran ,  Stuart Dempster ,  Hugh Davies ,  Karlheinz Essl ,  Vinko Globokar ,  Stephen Nachmanovitch ,  Pauline Oliveros ,  Terry Riley ,  Frederic Rzewski ,  Karlheinz Stockhausen ,  Richard Teitelbaum ,  Christian Wolff ,  Vangelis ,  La Monte Young ,  John Zorn  and  Yitzhak Yedid .   Several pianists also teach classical improvisation and perform, such as David Dolan, [ 26 ]  William Goldstein, [ 27 ]   Yitzhak Yedid  and Eric Barnhill. [ 28 ]     [ edit ]   Pop Music   Also in pop music musical improvisation is present.  Psychedelic rock  acts of the 60s and 70s used improvisations to express the halucinations of LSD and other drugs in a musical language [ 29 ] . Bands like  Pink Floyd ,  Grateful Dead ,  The Doors ,  Velvet Underground ,  Jimi Hendrix  Experience,  Frank Zappa . The  progressive rock  genre also began exploring improvisation as a musical expression,  Henry Cow [ 30 ]   The Soft Machine ,  Robert Fripp ,  Brian Eno .

In a 1959 filmed interview, either in  Glenn Gould: Off the Record  or  Glenn Gould: On the Record , Gould had also lamented the end of the common practice period. He illustrated his opinion with a  thought experiment , arguing that a child raised with only atonal music would eventually show an original interest in tonality. Koenig & Kroitor 1959a or 1959b.

Main article:  Definitions of music .     Music is often defined by contrast with  noise  or  speech . Some definitions of music place it explicitly within a cultural context by defining music as what people accept as musical.  Broadly, here are some groups of definitions:     Those that define music as an external fact, for example ""organized sound"" or as a category of perception   Those that label it according to context as a social construction or subjective experience   Those that seek a  platonic  or quasi-platonic ideal of music which is not rooted in specifically physical or mental terms, but in a higher truth.         The definition of music as  sound  with particular characteristics is taken as a given by  psychoacoustics , and is a common one in  musicology  and  performance . In this view, there are observable patterns to what is broadly labeled music, and while there is understandable cultural variations, the properties of music are the properties of sound as perceived and processed by people.   Traditional philosophies define music as tones ordered horizontally (as melodies) and vertically (as harmonies).  Music theory, within this realm, is studied with the presupposition that music is orderly and often pleasant to hear.    John Cage  is the most famous advocate of the idea that anything can be music, saying, for example, ""There is no noise, only sound,"" though some argue that this somewhat fascistically imposes the definition on everything. According to musicologist  Jean-Jacques Nattiez  (1990 p.47-8,55): ""The border between music and noise is always culturally defined--which implies that, even within a single society, this border does not always pass through the same place; in short, there is rarely a consensus.... By all accounts there is no  single  and  intercultural  universal concept defining what music might be.""   In support of the view that music is a label for a totality of different aspects which are culturally constructed. Often a definition of music lists the aspects or elements that make up music. Molino (1975: 43) argues that, in addition to a lack of consensus, ""any element belonging to the total musical fact can be isolated, or taken as a strategic variable of musical production."" Nattiez gives as examples  Mauricio Kagel 's  Con Voce  [with voice], where a masked trio silently mimes playing instruments. In this example sound, a common element, is excluded, while gesture, a less common element, is given primacy.       The platonic ideal of music is currently the least fashionable in the philosophy of criticism and music, because it is crowded on one side by the physical view - what is the metasubstance of music made of, if not sound? - and on the other hand by the constructed view of music - how can one tell the difference between any metanarrative of music and one which is merely intersubjective? However, its appeal, finding unexpected mathematical relationships in music, and finding analogies between music and physics, for example  string theory , means that this view continues to find adherents, including such critics and performers as  Charles Rosen  and  Edward Rothstein .  [ edit ] Types of Musical Instruments   Wind instruments   Percussion instruments   String instruments    Keyboard instruments     [ edit ] Aspects of music   Main article:  Aspects of music .     The traditional or classical European  aspects of music  often listed are those elements given primacy in European-influenced classical music:  melody ,  harmony ,  rhythm ,  tone color/timbre , and  form . A more comprehensive list is given by stating the aspects of sound:  pitch ,  timbre ,  intensity , and  duration .  4  These aspects combine to create secondary aspects including  structure , texture and style. Other commonly included aspects include the spatial location or the movement in space of sounds, gesture, and dance.  Silence  is also often considered an aspect of music, if it is considered to exist.   As mentioned above, not only do the aspects included as music vary, their importance varies. For instance, melody and harmony are often considered to be given more importance in classical music at the expense of rhythm and timbre. John Cage considers duration the primary aspect of music because it is the only aspect common to both ""sound"" and ""silence.""  It is often debated whether there are aspects of music that are  universal . The debate often hinges on definitions, for instance the fairly common assertion that ""tonality"" is a universal of all music may necessarily require an expansive definition of tonality. A  pulse  is sometimes taken as a universal, yet there exist solo vocal and instrumental genres with free, improvisational rhythms with no regular pulse; 5  one example is the  alap  section of a  Hindustani music  performance. According to  Dane Harwood , ""We must ask whether a cross-cultural musical universal is to be found in the music itself (either its structure or function) or the way in which music is made. By 'music-making,' I intend not only actual performance but also how music is heard, understood, even learned.""  6          [ edit ] Common terms   Main article:  Musical terminology .     Common terms used to discuss particular pieces include  note , which is an abstraction which refers to either a specific pitch and/or rhythm or the written symbol;  melody , which is a succession of notes heard as some sort of unit;  chord , which is a  simultaneity  of notes heard as some sort of unit;  chord progression  which is a  succession  of chords ( simultaneity succession );  harmony , which is the relationship between two or more pitches;  counterpoint , which is the simultaneity and organization of different melodies; and  rhythm  which is the organization of the durational aspects of music.  See also:   List of musical topics .    [ edit ] Production   Main article:  Music industry .     The music industry is that which creates, performs, and promotes music. A great deal of music is produced by  amateurs .    [ edit ] Performance   Main article:  Performance .     Someone who performs, composes, or conducts music is a  musician . Performance is a method for musicians to share music with others.     [ edit ] Solo and ensemble   Many cultures include strong traditions of  solo  or soloistic  performance , such as in  Indian classical music , while other cultures, such as in  Bali , include strong traditions of  group  performance. All cultures include a mixture of both, and performance may range from improvised solo playing for one's enjoyment to highly planned and organized performance rituals such as the modern classical  concert  or  religious processions . What is called  chamber music  is often seen as more intimate than  symphonic  works. A performer is called a  musician , a group being a  musical ensemble  such as a  rock band  or symphony  orchestra .    [ edit ] Oral tradition and notation   Main article:  Musical notation .     Music is often preserved in memory and performance only, handed down  orally , or aurally (""by ear""). Such music, especially that which has no known individual composer, is often classified as ""traditional"". Different musical traditions have different attitudes towards how and where to make changes to the original source material, from quite strict, to those which demand  improvisation . If the music is written down, it is generally in some manner which attempts to capture both what should be heard by listeners, and what the musician should do to perform the music. This is referred to as  musical notation , and the study of how to read notation involves  music theory . Written notation varies with style and period of music, and includes scores, lead sheets, guitar tablature, among the more common notations. Generally music which is to be performed is produced as  sheet music . To perform music from notation requires an understanding of both the musical style and performance practice expected or acceptable.    [ edit ] Improvisation, interpretation, composition   Main articles:  Musical composition  and  Improvisation#Music .     Most cultures use at least part of the concept of preconceiving musical material, or  composition , as held in western classical music. Many but fewer cultures also include the related concept of  interpretation , performing material conceived by others, and less still the contrasting concept of  improvisation , material which is spontaneously thought of while performed,  not  preconceived. However, many cultures and people do not have this distinction at all, using a broader concept which incorporates both without discrimination. Improvised music virtually always follows some rules or conventions and even ""fully composed"" includes some freely chosen material. See also,  precompositional . Composition does not always mean the use of notation, or the known sole authorship of one individual.  Music can also be determined by describing a ""process"" which may create musical sounds, examples of this range from wind chimes, through computer programs which select sounds. Music which contains elements selected by chance is called  Aleatoric music , and is most famously associated with  John Cage  and  Witold Lutoslawski . See:  precompositional ,  form (music) ,  modulation ,  twelve tone technique ,  serialism , and  process music .    [ edit ] Compositions   Musical composition  is a term that describes the makeup of a piece of music. Methods of composition vary widely, however in analyzing music all forms -- spontaneous, trained, or untrained -- are built from elements comprising a musical piece. Music can be composed for repeated performance or it can be  improvised ; composed on the spot. The music can be performed entirely from memory, from a written system of  musical notation , or some combination of both. Study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of Western  classical music , but the definition of  composition  is broad enough to include spontaneously improvised works like those of  free jazz  performers and  African  drummers.  What is important in understanding the composition of a piece is singling out its elements. An understanding of music's  formal elements  can be helpful in deciphering exactly how a piece is made. A universal element of music is  time  or more generally  rhythm . When a piece appears to have no  time , it is considered  rubato . The  Italian  term, meaning ""free time,"" does not mean ""without rhythm,"" but rather that the  tempo  or  time  of the piece changes dynamically. Even random placement of random sounds, often occurring in  musical montage , occurs within some kind of  time , and thus employs  time  as a musical element.  Any musical event comprised of elements can be considered a ""composition.""    [ edit ] Reception and audition   Main article:  Hearing (sense) .     The field of  music cognition  involves the study of many aspects of music including how it is processed by listeners.   Music is experienced by individuals in a huge variety of social settings ranging from being alone to attending a large concert. Concerts take many different forms and may include people dressing in formal wear and sitting quietly in the rows of auditoriums, drinking and dancing in a bar, or loudly cheering and booing in an auditorium.  Deaf  people can experience music by feeling the vibrations in their body; the most famous example of a deaf musician is the composer  Ludwig van Beethoven , who composed many famous works even after he had completely lost his hearing. In more modern times,  Evelyn Glennie , who has been deaf since the age of twelve, is a highly acclaimed percussionist. Also,  Chris Buck , a violinist virtuoso and New Zealander, has recently lost his hearing. See:  Baschet Brothers . See:  psychoacoustics .    [ edit ] Media   The music that composers make can be heard through several  media ; the most traditional way is to hear it live, in the presence, or as one of, the musicians. Live music can also be broadcast over the  radio  or  television . Some musical styles focus on producing a sound for a performance, while others focus on producing a recording which mixes together sounds which were never played ""live"". Recording, even of styles which are essentially live often uses the ability to edit and splice to produce recordings which are considered ""better"" than the actual performance.  In many cultures there is less distinction between performing and listening to music, as virtually everyone is involved in some sort of musical activity, often communal. In industrialized countries, listening to music through a recorded form, such as  sound recording  or watching a  music video , became more common than experiencing live performance, roughly in the middle of the 20th century. Sometimes, live  performances  incorporate prerecorded sounds; for example, a  DJ  uses  disc records  for  scratching .    Audiences can also become performers by using  Karaoke , invented by the Japanese, which uses music video and tracks without voice, so the performer can add his voice to the piece.  See:  sound sculpture .    [ edit ]  Education    [ edit ] Training   Many people, including entire cultures, compose, perform, and improvise music with no training and feel no need for training. Other cultures have traditions of rigorous formal training that may take years and serious dedication. Sometimes this training takes the form of apprenticeship. For example,  Indian  training traditionally take more years than a college education and involves spiritual discipline and reverence for one's  guru  or teacher. In  Bali , everyone learns and practices together. It is also common for people to take  music lessons , short private study sessions with an individual teacher, when they want to learn to play or compose music, usually for a fee. A famous private composition teacher is  Nadia Boulanger .    [ edit ] Secondary education   The incorporation of music performance and theory into a general liberal arts curriculum, from preschool to postsecondary education, is relatively common. Western style secondary schooling is increasingly common around the world, such as  STSI  in  Bali . Meanwhile, western schools are increasingly including the study of the music of other cultures such as the Balinese gamelan, of which there are currently more than 200 in America.    [ edit ] Study   Main articles:  musicology  and  music theory .     Many people also study  about  music in the field of  musicology . The earliest definitions of  musicology  defined three sub-disciplines:  systematic musicology ,  historical musicology , and  comparative musicology . In contemporary scholarship, one is more likely to encounter a division of the discipline into  music theory ,  music history , and  ethnomusicology .  Research in musicology has often been enriched by cross-disciplinary work, for example in the field of  psychoacoustics . The study of music of non-western cultures, and the cultural study of music, is called  ethnomusicology .   In Medieval times, the study of music was one of the  Quadrivium  of the seven  Liberal Arts  and considered vital to higher learning. Within the quantitative  Quadrivium , music, or more accurately  harmonics , was the study of rational proportions.   Zoomusicology  is the study of the music of non-human animals, or the musical aspects of sounds produced by non-human animals. As George Herzog (1941) asked, ""do animals have music?"" Frans-Bernard Me's  Musique, mythe, nature, ou les Dauphins d'Arion  (1983), a study of ""ornitho-musicology"" using a technique of Ruwet's  Language, musique, poe  (1972) paradigmatic segmentation analysis, shows that birdsongs are organized according to a repetition-transformation principle. In the opinion of  Jean-Jacques Nattiez  (1990), ""in the last analysis, it is a human being who decides what is and is not musical, even when the sound is not of human origin. If we acknowledge that sound is not organized and conceptualized (that is, made to form music) merely by its producer, but by the mind that perceives it, then music is uniquely human.""  Music theory is the study of music, generally in a highly technical manner outside of other disciplines. More broadly it refers to any study of music, usually related in some form with compositional concerns, and may include physics, mathematics, and anthropology. What is most commonly taught in beginning music theory classes are guidelines to write in the style of the  common practice period , or  tonal music . Theory, even that which studies music of the common practice period, may take many other forms.  Musical set theory  is the application of mathematical  set theory  to music, first applied to  atonal music .  Speculative music theory , contrasted with  analytic music theory , is devoted to the analysis and synthesis of music materials, for example  tuning systems , generally as preparation for composition. See ""Common Terms"" above.    [ edit ] History   Main article:  History of music .     The history of music in relation to human beings predates the written word and is tied to the development and unique expression of various human  cultures . Popular styles of music varied widely from culture to culture, and from period to period. Different cultures emphasized different  instruments , or techniques.  Music history  itself is the (distinct) subfield of  musicology  and  history , which studies the history of  music theory .  See also:  Music and politics .    [ edit ]  Genres    Main article:  Musical genre .     As there are many definitions for music there are many divisions and groupings of music, many of which are caught up in the argument over the definition of music. Among the larger genres are  classical music ,  popular music  or commercial music (including  rock and roll ),  country music  and  folk music .  There is often disagreement over what constitutes ""real"" music:  Mozart ,  Stravinsky ,  serialism ,  Jazz ,  hip hop ,  punk rock , and  electronica  have all been considered non-music at various times and places.  The term  world music  has been applied to a wide range of music made outside of Europe and European influence, although its initial application, in the context of the World Music Program at Wesleyan University, was as a term including all possible music genres, including European traditions. (In academic circles, the original term for the study of world music, ""comparative musicology"", was replaced in the middle of the twentieth century by ""ethnomusicology"", which is still an unsatisfactory coinage.)  Genres of music are as often determined by tradition and presentation as by the actual music. While most classical music is acoustic and meant to be performed by individuals or groups, many works described as ""classical"" include samples or tape, or are mechanical.  Some works, like  Gershwin 's  Rhapsody in Blue , are claimed by both jazz and classical music.  As world cultures have been  in greater contact , their indigenous musical styles have often merged into new styles.  For example, the U.S.-American  bluegrass  style contains elements from Anglo-Irish, Scottish, Irish, German and some African-American instrumental and vocal traditions, and could only have been a product of the 20th Century.  Many current  music festivals  celebrate a particular musical  genre .

The earliest     examples of this written music come from the medieval Catholic Church, in the form      of  Gregorian chant.  By the1400s, composers began to      write  polyphony.  Polyphonic writing became more     sophisticated as composers changed styles from the  Ars     Antiqua  to the  Ars Nova.  In the 1100s and      1200s,  troubadours  composed the first  secular      music  unaffiliated with the church.                            Gregorian chant:  A single-line melody sung in unison       by one or more people. Chant used religious text for its words and was       written by monks in the Catholic Church.                             Polyphony:  Music that combines two or more lines,       which are more or less independent of each other, at the same      time.                             Ars Antiqua:  The earliest movement of written       polyphony. It originated in the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris in the       1200s.                             Ars Nova:  A French movement of the 1300s that       greatly refined notation and polyphonic writing from the era of Ars      Antiqua.                             Troubadours:  Wandering musicians in Medieval France       who sang songs of courtly love. The troubadours made important musical       innovations and were the first main source of secular music.                                 Renaissance (c. 14401600)      The Renaissance heralded a breakthrough of new ideas and techniques to Western     music and brought innovations at a faster rate than ever before.      The  printing press  enabled easier duplication and     distribution of music and musical treatises, and the study of music became more     common, not only for members of the church. Composers began to view music more as an     expressive art than as a science. They further developed and codified the     conventions of musical notation, began to write  four-part     polyphony  as standard practice, and began to     use  imitation  regularly. By the end of the Renaissance,     composers had mastered the art of  counterpoint.  Instrumental     music rose in prominence relative to vocal music, and the     complete  Mass  was commonly set to music.                            Four-part writing:  A common configuration of four       parts, often abbreviated SATB (short for soprano, alto, tenor, and bass, the       four standard voice registers).                             Imitation:  A device used in polyphony in which one       part follows another by repeating a similar or same passage played first by       the other part.                             Counterpoint:  A device in which two (or more)       melodic lines run simultaneously but neither becomes dominant over the       other, so both can be heard independently.                            Baroque (c. 16001750      The 1600s saw the rise of instrumental music as composers explored techniques     and new instrumental forms.      The  sonata  and  concerto  were born     during this period, and growing virtuosity of performance emerged to accompany these     forms. Keyboard music flourished, specifically     for  harpsichord.  The Baroque era also saw the dawning of new     vocal forms, including the  cantata,      opera,  and  oratorio.  Music became a central     part of daily life, and composers found new ways to express themselves dramatically,     sometimes in extreme fashion. In addition, patrons unaffiliated with the church     began to support composers in large numbers.                            Common practice period:  The period in music from the       early Baroque to the end of the Romantic in which composers used a       well-defined common harmonic language. Composers from this period wrote in a       style we usually associate with traditional concert music.                            Classical (c. 17501810)      Although many people use the term classical music to denote a broad category     of instrumental or vocal music that is different from popular music, this usage     can be confusing because the term also refers more specifically to the Classical     era. In the Classical era, composers reacted against what they saw as unnatural and     exaggerated in the Baroque style. As they sought balance of both expression and     form, formal structures grew in sophistication and became more central to     composition. Music grew increasingly  homophonic,  and     composers reserved use of counterpoint only for specific situations that demanded     it. Orchestral and  chamber music  became more important, and      the  symphony  and  string     quartet  were born as music grew increasingly secular in nature.      The  fortepiano  the precursor to the modern pianowas     invented shortly before the Classical period and became very important, for it was     capable of greater dynamic expression than the harpsichord. Wind instruments that     had developed in the Baroque era came into more widespread use and prominence.                            Homophony:  A musical texture distinct from polyphony       in that it sets one melody together with a subordinate melody against an       accompanimental background.                            Romantic (c. 18101890)      Beethoven opened the door to the Romantic period by defying conventions of the     Classical era and expanding possibilities in his own music. The Romantic composers     were more interested in pure expressive content in their works and used larger     dynamic ranges and longer melodic lines. As a result, composers individual voices     became more distinct from each other, often strikingly so. Some composers relied on     nonmusical subject matter to write  program music  in less     rigid forms, like the orchestral  tone poem.  At the same      time,  nationalism  became an important factor in     composition, as composers began to draw on folk tunes, local  dance     forms,  and other musical material native to their homelands. The size     and scope of music also expanded: Some composers specialized in very short chamber     works, while others wrote lengthy pieces for massive ensembles.                            Program music:  Music written to follow a plot or       describe a nonmusical idea. Berliozs  Symphonie Fantastique,  for instance,       follows the course of a troubled artists life with musical illustrations of       people and events.                             Nationalism:  A turn toward native forms and ideas.       Nationalist composers used folk melodies from their native lands and often       wrote patriotic music.                            Modern (c. 18901950)      At the end of the Romantic period, composers pushed the boundaries of musical     development so far that they eventually broke and a common harmonic language no     longer existed. Harmonies became more dissonant     as  chromaticism  was used to a greater      degree.  Impressionist  composers prioritized color and     texture. Others invented their own rules of counterpoint and harmony, such      as  serialism.  Others,     the  neoclassicists,  turned to music from the past for     inspiration. Many composers broke away from traditional major and minor scales and     used other scales, such as the  whole-tone      scale  and  octatonic scale.                                  Chromaticism:  Use of harmonies that do not exist       naturally in a key. Chromatic music sounds denser and more dissonant and       often modulates to a number of keys within a single piece.                             Impressionism:  In music (as opposed to the visual       arts), a movement founded by Debussy, who made color and texture central       elements in his music                             Neoclassicism:  A movement, pioneered by Stravinsky       in the 1920s, in which composers brought a modern perspective to older       music. Frequently, composers writing in this style used traditional forms       and musical language and then altered it to create a new sound.       Neoromanticism is another movement that came into being a short time      later.                             Serialism:  A method of composing, invented by       Schnberg, in which all twelve notes of the chromatic scale are used in an       ordered succession. Serialism can effectively destroy the feeling of key and       tonality. It is also called  twelve-tone,        dodecaphonic,  or  atonal music.                                         Contemporary (c. 1950Present)      As the 20th century progressed, composers took more liberty with form and     technique and pushed the frontier of music      further.  Experimentalists  tried  extended      techniques  to create new types of sound. The      first  electronic music  opened a new range of     possibilities. Composers introduced  graphic notation  to     achieve new effects like  indeterminacy.  Although some critics     have felt that these new methods have distanced composers from their audiences,     there are still many active contemporary composers all over the world contributing     to a living music history.                            Experimentalism:  A movement that sought to explore       the very idea of music by seeking new ways to create sounds outside of       traditional instrumental playing. Experimental composers tried to create new       definitions of music and redefine the audiences listening      experience.                             Extended techniques:  Unconventional playing       techniques (e.g., knocking the back of a cello, putting an oboe reed in a       trombone mouthpiece) that experimental composers pioneered in their attempts       to create new sounds.                             Electronic music:  Music created with electronic       devices instead of acoustic instruments. The first electronic instrument was       the Theremin, a box that emitted radio waves and produced a unique sound       similar to a violin and human voice combined. In the 1950s, composers       experimented with audiotape pieces called  musique concrte,  which often       incorporated sounds from nature with human sounds. Today, nearly any sound       imaginable can be simulated electronically. Some composers work        in  electroacoustic  media (combinations of       electronic devices and live performers on instruments), while others work in       exclusively electronic means.                             Graphic notation:  A new approach to music notation       that emerged in the middle of the 20th century. Graphic notation incorporates       images, charts, and shapes not found in traditional music notation to       communicate the composers wishes.                             Indeterminacy:  A technique in which the composer       leaves certain choices to the performer, including what notes, rhythms, or       speed to play. Indeterminacy introduces a level of randomness and       improvisation in performance.                                       Previous:  Musical Forms and Genres   Next:  Notable Composers in Western Music                                                                                                                            The complete 6-page chart for only $4.95.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     NEED A STUDY BREAK?                                                                    Check out SparkLife for the latest on TV, movies, music, and more.                                                                                                                                                                                    Go now...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               YOUR COLLEGE FIT                                                                    Our SparkCollege personality quiz determines your best college fit.                                                                                                                                                                                   Take it now...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             SAT VOCAB NOVELS                                                                    Fast and fun.

T HE play is set mainly in the little town of River City, Iowa, in 1912, but the opening scene is on a moving train in which the dialogue of travelling salesmen and the musical background beautifully simulate the bouncy rhythm of the jogging train. Aboard this train the salesmen are discussing the selling powers of one Harold Hill, without realizing that he is also one of the passengers. Harold Hill gets off at River City and comes to the centre of the town. There an old crony, Marcellus Washburn, tells him he will never be able to work his racket in this town: Harold Hill's racket is to go from town to town and influence its citizens to start a boys' band; then to abscond with the money the townspeople give him for the purchase of instruments and uniforms. Marcellus further informs Harold that the main obstacle in River City is the town librarian/music teacher, Marian Paroo, a ""stuck up"" sort of girl, who can be counted upon to see right through Harold's chicanery. Undaunted, Harold Hill proceeds to arouse the town's enthusiasm for starting a boys' band by pointing out the corrupt influence on their children of the local pool parlour (""Trouble""). When Marion Paroo appears, Harold tries to win her over with his charm, but she brushes him off rudely. But Marian is a soft and sentimental girl, as she reveals by speaking to the stars (""Goodnight, My Someone"").                        Inside the gymnasium of Madison High School a patriotic tableau is being given; Mayor Shinn follows with an address. Harold Hill demands the attention of the audience and starts once again to expound his ideas about a boys' band until the kids become infected with his enthusiasm (""Seventy-Six Trombones""). Later the same evening, Harold Hill goes to the library to win Marian over to his cause. He tries to impress her by telling her he is a ""professor"" of music, a graduate of the Gary, Indiana University, in the gold medal class of 1905. But Marian tells him in no uncertain terms that he cannot mesmerize or hoodwink her the way he had done the rest of the townspeople. Thus brushed off unceremoniously, Harold consoles himself with the idea that, after all, he has no possible interest in a girl as prim and conventional as Marian. (""The Sadder but Wiser Girl""). Nevertheless, he makes another effort to win over Marian, by sneaking up to her desk at the library and trying to convince her that he is infatuated with her (""Marian the Librarian"").                        But all the while, Harold keeps alive the enthusiasm for his band project, and goes about town signing applicants. Cuttingly, Marian asks him why he does not use his gift to greater advantage at a carnival. She knows he is a fraud, and thus will have no traffic with him, even though she is not the kind of girl who waits for a knight in shining armor (""My White Knight""). The reason Marian knows he is a fraud is because she has consulted the  Indiana State Educational Journal  and has discovered that Gary, Indiana University, had not even been founded in 1905. She is about to bring this information to the leading citizens of the town when Wells Fargo arrives with the musical instruments and uniforms, creating so much enthusiasm and excitement among her neighbors that she simply does not have the heart to disillusion them about Harold Hill. Indeed, now that Harold has, indeed, delivered the instruments and the uniforms without absconding with the money she is much more sympathetic to him; and there is no question in her mind that he is a man of considerable charm. Her resistance to him is finally broken: She comes to tell Harold she is in love with him (""Till There Was You""). Now Harold Hill gives himself up completely to making a success of the boys' band. In a stirring finale the boys appear in full regalia and sound their first raucous notes as members of the town band.

Sgt. Pepper, in many ways, refines that breakthrough, as the Beatles consciously synthesized such disparate influences as psychedelia, art-song, classical music, rock & roll, and music hall, often in the course of one song. Not once does the diversity seem forced -- the genius of the record is how the vaudevillian ""When I'm 64"" seems like a logical extension of ""Within You Without You"" and how it provides a gateway to the chiming guitars of ""Lovely Rita."" There's no discounting the individual contributions of each member or their producer,  George Martin , but the preponderance of whimsy and self-conscious art gives the impression that Paul McCartney is the leader of the Lonely Hearts Club Band. He dominates the album in terms of compositions, setting the tone for the album with his unabashed melodicism and deviously clever arrangements. In comparison,  Lennon 's contributions seem fewer, and a couple of them are a little slight but his major statements are stunning. ""With a Little Help From My Friends"" is the ideal  Ringo  tune, a rolling, friendly pop song that hides genuine  Lennon  anguish,  la ""Help!""; ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"" remains one of the touchstones of British psychedelia; and he's the mastermind behind the bulk of ""A Day in the Life,"" a haunting number that skillfully blends  Lennon 's verse and chorus with  McCartney 's bridge. It's possible to argue that there are better  Beatles  albums, yet no album is as historically important as this. After Sgt. Pepper, there were no rules to follow -- rock and pop bands could try anything, for better or worse. Ironically, few tried to achieve the sweeping, all-encompassing embrace of music as the Beatles did here. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, All Music Guide     Tracks       Track Title   iTunes   Composers   Performers   Time        Sgt.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  is the eighth studio album by the  British   rock  band  The Beatles . Recorded over a 129-day period beginning on  6 December   1966 , [ 1 ]  the album was released on  1 June   1967  in the  United Kingdom  and the following day in the  United States .  Sgt. Pepper  is often described as The Beatles'  magnum opus , [ 2 ] [ 3 ]  and one of the most influential albums of all time by prominent critics and publications. It was ranked  the greatest album of all time  by  Rolling Stone  in 2003.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  was being recorded, "" Beatlemania "" was waning. The Beatles had grown tired of touring and had quit the road in August 1966. After one particular concert, while being driven away in the back of a small van, the four of themeven  Paul McCartney , who was perhaps the most in favour of continuing to tourdecided that enough was enough. [ 4 ]  From that point on the Beatles became an entirely studio-based band. For the first time in their careers, the band had more than ample time with which to prepare their next record. As  EMI 's premier act and Britain's most successful pop group they had almost unlimited access to the state of the art technology of  Abbey Road Studios . All four band members had already developed a preference for long late night sessions, although they were still extremely efficient and highly disciplined in their studio habits.   George Harrison, the lead guitarist of the Beatles, went on a trip to India to learn to play the  sitar , an Indian instrument, with  Ravi Shankar , a renowned sitarist. Harrison brought back with him Indian culture and music. [ 5 ]   Two songs dropped from  Sgt. Pepper , "" Strawberry Fields Forever "" and "" Penny Lane "", were both recorded in late 1966 and early 1967. Brian Epstein decided that a new single was needed; [ 6 ]  the two songs were issued as a double-A-sided single in February 1967. [ 7 ]  In keeping with the group's usual practice, the single tracks were not included on the LP (a decision Martin maintains he regrets to this day). [ 6 ]  They were released only as a single in the UK at the time, but were included as part of the American LP version of  Magical Mystery Tour  (which was issued as a 6-track  EP  in Britain). The Harrison composition "" Only a Northern Song "" was also recorded during the  Pepper  sessions but did not see release until January 1969 when the soundtrack album for the animated feature  Yellow Submarine  was issued.       Concept   With  Sgt. Pepper , the Beatles wanted to create a record that could, in effect, tour for them  an idea they had already explored with the promotional film-clips made over the previous years, intended to promote them in the United States when they were not touring there.   McCartney decided that he should create fictitious characters for each band member and record an album that would be a performance by that fictitious band. This ""alter-ego group"" gave the Beatles the freedom to experiment with songs. [ 4 ]   The Beatles' fame motivated them to grow moustaches and beards and even longer hair, and was an inspiration for the disguise of their flamboyant Sgt. Pepper costumes. McCartney was well known for going out in public in disguise and all four had used aliases for travel bookings and hotel reservations.   Thus, the album starts with the title song, which introduces Sgt. Pepper's band itself; this song  segues  seamlessly into a sung introduction for bandleader ""Billy Shears"" (Starr), who performs "" With a Little Help from My Friends "". A  reprise  version of the title song was also recorded, and appears on side 2 of the original album (just prior to the climactic ""A Day in the Life""), creating a ""bookending"" effect.   However, the Beatles effectively abandoned the concept after recording the first two songs and the repri  "

They were arguably one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century, selling over a billion records. [Citation Needed]  The Beatles played and recorded many genres of  rock and roll , from Tin Pan Alley to  psychedelic rock .   The four Beatles were  John Lennon  (1940-1980),  George Harrison  (1943-2001),  Paul McCartney  (1942- ), and  Ringo Starr  (1940- ). Most of the Beatles' songs were co-written by Lennon and McCartney.  In the latter half of the 1960s the majority of their songs were written individually, but retained the ""Lennon/McCartney"" writing credit.  George Harrison's songs became more prominent on the albums following  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band .  Having evolved from the high school band known as The Quarrymen, around 1962 the Beatles began playing in Hamburg, Germany, and became very popular there. A year later, thanks to underground radio, they were the biggest band in their native land of the UK. In 1964, the Beatles made their historic trip to the United States to perform on  The Ed Sullivan Show . To date, this performance is one of the highest-rated television events in history.   The Lennon/McCartney ballads often displayed a personal  vulnerability  which was extraordinarily appealing to young teenage girls. For example, ""Help"" contrasts a man's younger macho attitude (""I never needed anybody's help in any way"") with a more grown-up attitude (""I changed my mind, I'll open up the door. Help me if you can"").  As the years passed, the Beatles' sound grew. From an old-fashioned rock and roll sound similar to the Beach Boys and Carl Perkins, the band put out a much more mature sound on  Revolver . They even experimented with folk on  Rubber Soul . In 1967, the Beatles' album  Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band  changed music as we know it forever. The psychedelic sound reflected what was going on in the world at that time and also displayed brilliant use of new technologies (such as stereo sound).   With the  ( The Beatles  (the ""White Album""), the Beatles had evolved into hard rockers. The songs had become more personal, and the band was beginning to fall apart. Prior to Lennon hooking up with  Yoko Ono , the lads had agreed that only the four of them would be in the recording studio (no lady friends of any type). [1]  Also, creative differences were creating tension among the Fab Four.      Their next project, originally to be titled ""Get Back"" and intended to ""get them back"" to recording songs the way they had in the earlier years and also to become a filmed documentary, exposed all the personal chafing and difficulties they were having.  The tapes were shelved since none of the band wanted to deal with them.  At this point, although the public did not know it, the band had virtually broken up.  However, at McCartney's urging, they assembled in the studio one more time and gave their fans what was to be their swan song, the splendid  Abbey Road .  The ""Get Back"" tapes and film were handed over to Phil Spector to do something with them, and he produced the album that was released as  Let It Be , in conjunction with the release of the film, which was more a documentary of a band breaking up than one writing and recording new music in their studio.  It wasn't long before the lawsuits to dissolve the partnership were flying, and the band members were releasing solo albums. [2]   In 2006, Cirque du Soleil opened a Beatle-themed show in Las Vegas, the aptly titled  Love . The show has been an outstanding success, and so has the album put out of the same name, featuring new remixes of Beatles songs by Beatles producer George Martin and his son Giles. The album also features previously unreleased versions of Beatles classics such as ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" and ""Strawberry Fields Forever"".  The Beatles were inducted into the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  in 1988.  As solo artists, all but Ringo have been inducted (Lennon in 1994, McCartney in 1999 and Harrison in 2004).  In 2004  Rolling Stone  magazine ranked the Beatles #1 on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. [3]   The two surviving Beatles are Ringo Starr and Sir Paul McCartney, who both still continue their recording and performing careers.

The Beatles include George Harrison, John Lennon(1940-1980), Paul McCartney, and Richard Starkey(Ringo Starr). All of the Beatles where born and raised in Liverpool, England. John Lennon was considered the leader of the band. George Harrison was the lead guitarist. John Lennon was a song writer, one of the two lead singers, and rhythm guitarist. Paul McCartney was a song writer, one of the two lead singers, and a bassist. Ringo Starr played the drums.  John Lennon's first band was called the Quarrymen (named after his High School). None of the three Beatles were in this band. Paul joined the group in 1957 and Harrison joined in 1958. They played with bass guitarist Sut Sutcliffe, and Pete Best, a drummer. Sutcliffe left in 1961 and Ringo Starr joined the band. Pete Best was asked to leave the band on April 16, 1962. He was considered the Beatles undisputed sex symbol. The Beatles were discovered on November 9, 1961 by Brian Epstein, a manager of a record store in Liverpool as well as an x British Army soldier.  The Beatles first two song were Love Me Do and Please, Please Me.  The Beatles starred in two movies, A Hard Days Night, and Help. They also had their own full length cartoon called Yellow Submarine. The movie A Hard Days Night earned 1.3 million dollars in its first week. The Beatles early music was influenced by singers Chuck Berry and Elvis Presley.  In November of 1963 the Beatles performed in front of the Queen of England. This was an incredible honor. By the end of 1963 the Beatles were the biggest music group in England. The Beatles came to New York City for the first time in 1964. They were an instant success. A couple of weeks later after their New York appearance, the five best selling records were by the Beatles. They became world famous by the end of 1964. Also in 1964 the song I Want To Hold Your Hand marked the beginning of BEATLEMANIA.  The Beatles were unusual because most rock was strong beat with no melody. The Beatles added melody to rock. The Beatles also added strong and meaningful lyrics. John Lennon wrote a book called In His Own Write. The Beatles started a new era of music. They wore their hair long and shaggy. This haircut was known as the Beatles haircut. All across the world people started wearing their hair like the Beatles.  John Lennon described the Beatles like this When you said it, it was crawly things, when you read it, it was beat music. The Beatles made their last stage appearance together in 1966. In 1967 the Beatles put together a master piece. The master piece was Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Heart Club Band. The Beatles never had a chance to perform Sergeant Peppers Lonely Heart Club Band. Also in 1967 Brian Epstein, the manager of the Beatles, died. Also in 1967 the Beatles directed a movie, Magical Mystery Tour. The movie was about themselves in which they toured the English countryside in search of wonder, fun, and magic.  In 1970 the world famous and world loved Beatles separated. Everybody was hoping to see the Beatles come back together. That hope ended when the peace loving John Lennon was killed outside his New York City apartment by 25 year old Mark David Chapman.

clueweb09-en0001-73-12528	"              HISTORY OF ELECTRONIC AND COMPUTER MUSIC     INCLUDING AUTOMATIC INSTRUMENTS AND COMPOSITION MACHINES       compiled and annotated by Dr. Kristine H. Burns                   2nd century, BC . The Hydraulis was invented by Ktesibios sometime in the second century B.C. Ktesibios, the son of a Greek barber, was fascinated by pneumatics and wrote an early treatise on the use of hydraulic systems for powering mechanical devices. His most famous invention, the Hydraulis, used water to regulate the air pressure inside an organ. A small cistern called the pnigeus was turned upside down and placed inside a barrel of water. A set of pumps forced air into the pnigeus, forming an air reservoir, and that air was channeled up into the organ's action.    Greek Aeolian harp. This may be considered the first automatic instrument. It was named for  Aeolus , the Greek god of the wind. The instrument had two bridges over which the strings passed. The instrument was placed in a window where air current would pass, and the strings were activated by the wind current. Rather than being of different lengths, the strings were all the same length and tuned to the same pitch, but because of different string thicknesses, varying pitches could be produced.    5th-6th centuries BC , Pythagorus discovered numerical ratios corresponding to intervals of the musical scale. He associated these ratios with what he called ""harmony of the spheres.""    890 AD   Banu Musa  was an organ-building treatise; this was the first written documentation of an automatic instrument.     ca. 995-1050 , Guido of Arezzo, a composer, developed an early form of solmization that used a system of mnemonics to learn ""unknown songs."" The method involved the assignment of alphabetic representations, syllables, to varying joints of the human hand. This system of mnemonics was apparently adapted from a technique used by almanac makers of the time.    1400s  The hurdy-gurdy, an organ-grinder-like instrument, was developed.    Isorhythmic motets were developed. These songs made use of patterns of rhythms and pitches to define the composition. Composers like Machaut (14th century), Dufay and Dunstable, (15th century) composed isorhythmic motets. Duration and melody patterns, the talea and the color respectively, were not of identical length. Music was developed by the different permutations of pitch and rhythmic values. So if there were 5 durations and 7 pitches, the pitches were lined up with the durations. Whatever pitches were 'leftover,' got moved to the first duration values. The composer would permute through all pitches and durations before the original pattern would begin again.     Soggetto cavato, a technique of mapping letters of the alphabet into pitches, was developed. This technique was used Josquin's Mass based on the name of Hercules, the Duke of Ferrara. One application of soggetto cavato would involve be to take the vowels in Hercules as follows: e=re=D; u=ut=C (in the solfege system of do, re, mi, fa, etc., ut was the original do syllable); e=re=D. This pattern of vowel-mapping could continue for first and last names, as well as towns and cities.    1500s  The first mechanically driven organs were built; water organs called hydraulis were in existence.    Don Nicola Vicentino (1511-1572), Italian composer and theorist, invented Archicembalo, a harpsichord-like instrument with six keyboards and thirty-one steps to an octave.    1600s  Athanasius Kircher, described in his book,  Musurgia Universalis  (1600), a mechanical device that composed music. He used number and arithmetic-number relationships to represent scale, rhythm, and tempo relations, called the  Arca Musarithmica .    1624  English philosopher and essayist, Francis Bacon wrote about a scientific utopia in the  New Atlantis . He stated ""we have sound-houses, where we practice and demonstrate all sounds, and their generation. We have harmonies which you have not, of quarter-sounds, and less slides of sounds.""    1641 Blaise Pascal develops the first calculating machine.     1644  The Nouvelle invention de lever, an hydraulic engine produced musical sounds.    1738  Mechanical singing birds and barrel organs were in existence.    The Industrial Revolution flourished. There were attempts to harness steam power to mechanical computation machines    1761  Abbe Delaborde constructed a Clavecin Electrique, Paris, France.    Benjamin Franklin perfected the Glass Harmonica.    Maelzel, inventor of the metronome, and friend of Beethoven invented the Panharmonicon, a keyboard instrument.    1787  Mozart composed the  Musikalisches Wurfelspiel  (Musical Dice Game). This composition was a series of precomposed measures arranged in random eight-bar phrases to build the composition. Each throw of a pair of dice represented an individual measure, so after eight throws the first phrase was determined.    1796  Carillons, ""a sliver of steel, shaped, polished, tempered and then screwed into position so that the projections on a rotating cylinder could pluck at its free extremity,"" were invented.     1830  Robert Schumann composer the  Abegg Variations , op. 1. This composition was named for one of his girlfriends. The principal theme is based on the letters of her name: A-B-E-G-G--this was a later application of a soggetto cavato technique.    1832  Samuel Morse invented the telegraph.    1833-34  Charles Babbage, a British scientist builds the Difference Enginer, a large mechanical computer. In 1834, he imagines the Analytical Engine, a machine that was never realized. Ada Lovelace, daughter of Lord Byron, assisted in the documentation of these fantastic devices.    1835  Schumann composed the  Carnaval  pieces, op. 9 , twenty-one short pieces for piano. Each piece is based on a different character.    1850  D.D. Parmelee patented the first key-driven adding machine.    1859  David E. Hughes invented a typewriting telegraph utilizing a piano-like keyboard to activate the mechanism.    1863  Hermann Helmholtz wrote the book,  On the Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis for the Theory of Music . Historically this book was one of the foundations of modern acoustics (this book completed the earlier work of Joseph Sauveur).    1867  Hipps invented the Electromechanical Piano in Neuchatel, Switzerland. He was the director of the telegraph factory there.    1876  Elisha Gray (an inventor of a telephone, along with Bell) invented the Electroharmonic or Electromusical Piano; this instrument transmitted musical tones over wires.    Koenig's Tonametric was invented. This instrument divided four octaves into 670 equal parts--this was an early instrument that made use of microtuning.    1877  Thomas Edison (1847-1931) invented the phonograph. To record, an indentation on a moving strip of paraffin coated paper tape was made by means of a diaphragm with an attached needle. This mechanism eventually lead to a continuously grooved, revolving metal cylinder wrapped in tin foil.    Emile Berliner (1851-1929) developed and patented the cylindrical and disc phonograph system, simultaneously with Edison.    Dorr E. Felti, perfected a calculator with key-driven ratchet wheels which could be moved by one or more teeth at a time.    1880  Alexander Graham Bell (1847-1922) financed his own laboratory in Washington, D.C. Together with Charles S. Tainter, Bell devised and patented several means for transmitting and recording sound.    1895  Julian Carillo's theories of microtones, 96 tone scale, constructed instruments to reproduce divisions as small as a sixteenth tone. He demonstrated his instruments in New York, 1926. The instruments included an Octavina for eighth tones and an Arpa Citera for sixteenth tones. There are several recordings of Carillo's music, especially the string quartets.    1897  E.S. Votey invented the Pianola, an instrument that used a pre-punched, perforated paper roll moved over a capillary bridge. The holes in the paper corresponded to 88 openings in the board.    1898  Valdemar Poulson (1869-1942) patented his ""Telegraphone,"" the first magnetic recording machine.    1906  Thaddeus Cahill invented the Dynamophone, a machine that produced music by an alternating current running dynamos. This was the first additive synthesis device. The Dynamophone was also known as the Telharmonium. The instrument weighed over 200 tons and was designed to transmit sound over telephone wires; however, the wires were too delicate for all the signals. You can sort of consider him the 'Father of Muzak.' The generators produced pure tones of various frequencies and intensity; volume control supplied dynamics. Articles appeared in  McClure's Magazine  that stated ""democracy in music...the musician uses keys and stops to build up voices of flute or clarinet, as the artist uses his brushes for mixing color to obtain a certain hue...it may revolutionize our musical art...""    Lee De Forest (1873-1961) invented the Triode or Audion tube, the first vacuum tube.    1907  Ferruccio Busoni (1866-1924) believed that the current musical system was severely limited, so he stated that instrumental music was dead. His treatise on aesthetics,  Sketch of a New Music , discussed the future of music.    1910  The first radio broadcast in NYC (first radio station was built in 1920, also in NYC).    1912  The Italian Futurist movement was founded by Luigi Russolo (1885-1947), a painter, and Filippo Marinetti, a poet. Marinetti wrote the manifesto,  Musica Futurista ; the Futurist Movement's creed was ""To present the musical soul of the masses, of the great factories, of the railways, of the transatlantic liners, of the battleships, of the automobiles and airplanes. To add to the great central themes of the musical poem the domain of the machines and the victorious kingdom of Electricity.""    Henry Cowell (1897-1965) introduced tone clusters in piano music.  The Banshee  and  Aeolian Harp  are good examples.     1914  The first concert of Futurist music took place. The ""art of noises"" concert was presented by Marinetti and Russolo in Milan, Italy.    1920  Lev (Leon) Theremin, Russia, invented the Aetherophone (later called the Theremin or Thereminovox). The instrument used 2 vacuum tube oscillators to produce beat notes. Musical sounds were created by ""heterodyning"" from oscillators which varied pitch. A circuit was altered by changing the distance between 2 elements. The instrument had a radio antenna to control dynamics and a rod sticking out the side that controlled pitch. The performer would move his/her hand along the rod to change pitch, while simultaneously moving his/her other hand in proximity to the antenna. Many composers used this instrument including Varese.    1922  Darius Milhaud (b. 1892) experimented with vocal transformation by phonograph speed changes.    Ottorino Respighi (1879-1936) called for a phonograph recording of nightingales in his  Pini di Roma  (Pines of Rome).    1926  Jorg Mager built an electronic instrument, the Spharophon. The instrument was first presented at the Donaueschingen Festival (Rimsky-Korsakov composed some experimental works for this instrument). Mager later developed a Partiturophon and a Kaleidophon, both used in theatrical productions. All of these instruments were destroyed in W.W.II.    George Antheil (1900-1959) composed  Ballet Mechanique . Antheil was an expatriate American living in France. The work was scored for pianos, xylophones, pianola, doorbells, and an airplane propeller.    1928  Maurice Martenot (b. 1928, France) built the Ondes Martenot (first called the Ondes Musicales). The instrument used the same basic idea as the Theremin, but instead of a radio antenna, it utilized a moveable electrode was used to produce capacitance variants. Performers wore a ring that passed over the keyboard. The instrument used subtractive synthesis. Composers such as Honegger, Messiaen, Milhaud, Dutilleux, and Varese all composed for the instrument.    Friedrich Trautwein (1888-1956, Germany) built the Trautonium. Composers such as Hindemith, Richard Strauss, and Varese wrote for it, although no recordings can be found.    1929  Laurens Hammond (b. 1895, USA), built instruments such as the Hammond Organ, Novachord, Solovox, and reverb devices in the United States. The Hammond Organ used 91 rotary electromagnetic disk generators driven by a synchronous motor with associated gears and tone wheels. It used additive synthesis.    1931  Ruth Crawford Seeger's  String Quartet 1931  was composed. This is one of the first works to employ extended serialism, a systematic organization of pitch, rhythm, dynamics, and articulation.    Henry Cowell worked with Leon Theremin to build the Rhythmicon, an instrument which could play metrical combinations of virtually unlimited complexity. With this instrument Cowell composed the  Rhythmicana Concerto .    Jorg Mager (Germany) was commissioned to create electronic bell sounds for the Bayreuth production of  Parsifal    1935  Allegemeine Elektrizitats Gesellschaft (AEG), built and demonstrated the first Magnetophon (tape recorder).    1937  ""War of the Worlds"" was directed by Orson Welles. Welles was the first director to use the fade and dissolve technique, first seen in ""Citizen Kane."" To date, most film directors used blunt splices instead.    Electrochord (the electroacoustic piano) was built.    1938  Novachord built.    1939  Stream of consciousness films came about.    John Cage (1912-1992) began experimenting with indeterminacy. In his composition,  Imaginary Landscape No. 1 , multiple performers are asked to perform on multiple record players, changing the variable speed settings.    1930s  Plastic audio tape was developed.    The Sonorous Cross (an instrument like a Theremin) was built.    1941  Joseph Schillinger wrote the  The Schillinger System of Musical Composition . This book offered prescriptions for composition--rhythms, pitches, harmonies, etc. Schilllinger's principal students was George Gershwin and Glenn Miller.    The Ondioline was built.    1944  Percy Grainger and Burnett Cross patented a machine that ""freed"" music from the constraints of conventional tuning systems and rhythmic inadequacies of human performers. Mechanical invention for composing ""Free Music"" used eight oscillators and synchronizing equipment in conjunction with photo-sensitive graph paper with the intention that the projected notation could be converted into sound.    1947  Bell Labs developed and produced the solid state transistor.    Milton Babbitt's  Three Compositions for Piano  serialized all aspects of pitch, rhythm, dynamics, and articulation.    The Solovox and the Clavioline were built.    1948  John Scott Trotter built a composition machine for popular music.    Hugh LeCaine (Canada) built the Electronic Sakbutt, an instrument that actually sounded like a cello.    Pierre Schaeffer (b. 1910), a sound technician working at Radio-diffusion-Television Francaise (RTF) in Paris, produced several short studies in what he called  Musique concrete . October, 1948, Schaeffer's early studies were broadcast in a ""concert of noises.""    Joseph Schillinger wrote   The Mathematical Basis of the Arts .    1949  Pierre Schaeffer and engineer Jacques Poullin worked on experiments in sound which they titled ""Musique concrete."" 1949-50 Schaeffer and Henry (1927-96), along with Poullin composed  Symphonie pour un homme seul  (Symphony for a Man Alone); the work actually premiered March 18, 1950.    Olivier Messiaen composed his  Mode de valeurs et d'intensities  (Mode of Durations and Intensities), a piano composition that ""established 'scales' not only of pitch but also of duration, loudness, and attack.""    The Melochord was invented by H. Bode.    1940s The following instruments were built: the Electronium Pi (actually used by a few German composers, including: Brehme, Degen, and Jacobi), the Multimonica, the Polychord organ, the Tuttivox, the Marshall organ, and other small electric organs.    1950  The Milan Studio was established by Luciano Berio (b. 1925, Italy).    1951->  Clara Rockmore performed on the Theremin in worldwide concerts.    Variations on a Door and a Sigh  was composed by Pierre Henry.    The RTF studio was formally established as the Groupe de Musique Concrete, the group opened itself to other composers, including Messiaen and his pupils Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and George Barraque. Boulez and Stockhausen left soon after because Schaeffer was not interested in using electronically-generated sounds, but rather wanted to do everything based on recordings.    John Cage's use of indeterminacy culminated with  Music of Changes , a work based on the charts from the  I Ching , the Chinese book of Oracles.    Structures, Book Ia  was one of Pierre Boulez' earliest attempts at employing a small amount of musical material, called cells (whether for use as pitches, durations, dynamics, or attack points), in a highly serialized structure.    1951-53  Eimert and Beyer (b. 1901) produced the first compositions using electronically-generated pitches. The pieces used a mechanized device that produced melodies based on Markov analysis of Stephen Foster tunes.    1952  The Cologne station of Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk (later Westdeutscher Rundfunk) was founded by Herbert Eimert. He was soon joined by Stockhausen, and they set out to create what they called  Elektronische Musik .    John Cage's  4'33""  was composed. The composer was trying to liberate the performer and the composer from having to make any conscious decisions, therefore, the only sounds in this piece are those produce by the audience.    1953 Robert Beyer, Werner Meyer-Eppler (b. 1913) and Eimert began experimenting with electronically-generated sounds. Eimert and Meyer-Eppler taught at Darmstadt Summer School (Germany), and gave presentations in Paris as well.    Louis and Bebe Baron set up a private studio in New York, and provided soundtracks for sci-fi films like  Forbidden Planet   (1956) and  Atlantis  that used electronic sound scores.    Otto Luening (b. 1900, USA; d. 1996, USA) and Vladimir Ussachevsky (b. 1911, Manchuria; d. 1990, USA) present first concert at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, October 28. The program included Ussachevsky's  Sonic Contours  (created from piano recordings), and Luening's  Fantasy in Space  (using flute recordings). Following the concert, they were asked to be on the Today Show with Dave Garroway. Musicians Local 802 raised a fuss because Luening and Ussachevsky were not members of the musicians' union.    1953-4  Karlheinz Stockhausen (b. 1928) used Helmholtz' research as the basis of his  Studie I  and  Studie II . He tried to build increasingly complex synthesized sounds from simple pure frequencies (sine waves).    1954 The Cologne Radio Series ""Music of Our Time"" (October 19) used only electronically-generated sounds by Stockhausen, Eimert, Pousseur, etc. The pieces used strict serial techniques.    Dripsody  was composed by Hugh LeCaine. The single sound source for this concrete piece is a drip of water.    1955  Harry Olson and Belar, both working for RCA, invent the Electronic Music Synthesizer, aka the Olson-Belar Sound Synthesizer. This synth used sawtooth waves that were filtered for other types of timbres. The user programmed the synthesizer with a typewriter-like keyboard that punched commands into a 40-channel paper tape using binary code.    The Columbia-Princeton Studio started, with its beginnings mostly in the living room of Ussachevsky and then the apartment of Luening.     Lejaren Hiller (1924-92) and Leonard Isaacson, from the University of Illinois composed the  Illiac String Quartet , the first piece of computer-generated music. The piece was so named because it used a Univac computer and was composed at the University of Illinois.    1955-56  Karlheinz Stockhausen composed  Gesang der Junglinge . This work used both concrete recordings of boys' voices and synthesized sounds. The original version was composed for five loudspeakers, but was eventually reduced to four. The text from the Benedicite (O all ye works of the Lord, bless ye the Lord), which appears in Daniel as the canticle sung by the three young Jews consigned to the fiery furnace by Nebuchadnezzar.    1956  Martin Klein and Douglas Bolitho used a Datatron computer called Push-Button Bertha to compose music. This computer was used to compose popular tunes; the tunes were derived from random numerical data that was sieved, or mapped, into a preset tonal scheme.    Tokyo at Japanese Radio, an electronic studio established.    Luening and Ussachevsky wrote incidental music for Orson Welles'  King Lear  , City Center, New York.    1957   Of Wood and Brass  was composed by Luening. Sound sources included trumpets, trombones and marimbas.    Scambi , composed by Henri Pousseur, was created at the Milan Studio, Italy.    Warsaw at Polish Radio, an electronic studio established.    Munich, the Siemens Company, an electronic studio established.     Eindhoven, the Philips Company, an electronic studio established.     David Seville created the Chipmunks, by playing recordings of human voices at double speed. Electronic manipulation was never really used again in rock for about ten years.    1958  Edgard Varese (1883-1965) composed  Poeme Electronique  for the World's Fair, Brussels. The work was composed for the Philips Pavilion, a building designed by the famous architect, Le Corbusier who was assisted by Iannis Xenakis (who later became well-known as a composer rather than an architect). The work was performed on ca. 425 loudspeakers, and was accompanied by projected images. This was truly one of the first large-scale multimedia productions.    Iannis Xenakis (b.1922) composed  Concret PH . This work was also composed for the Brussels World's Fair. It made use of a single sound source: amplified burning charcoal.    Max Mathews, of Bell Laboratories, generated music by computers.     John Cage composed  Fontana Mix  at the Milan Studio.    London, BBC Radiophonic Workshop, an electronic studio established.    Stockholm, Swedish Radio, an electronic studio established.    The Studio for Experimental Music at the University of Illinois established, directed by Lejaren Hiller.    Pierre Henry leaves the Group de Musique Concrete; they reorganize as the Groupe de Recherches Musicales (GRM)    Gordon Mumma and Robert Ashley founded the Cooperative Studio for Electronic Music, Ann Arbor , MI (University of Michigan).    Luciano Berio composed Thema-omaggio a Joyce . The sound source is woman reading from Joyce's  Ulysses .    1958-60  Stockhausen composed  Kontakte  (Contacts) for four-channel tape. There was a second version for piano, percussion and tape.    1958-9  Mauricio Kagel, an Argentinian composer, composed  Transicion II , the first piece to call for live tape recorder as part of performance. The work was realized in Cologne. Two musicians perform on a piano, one in the traditional manner, the other playing on the strings and wood. Two other performers use tape recorders so that the work can unites its present of live sounds with its future of pre-recorded materials from later on and its past of recordings made earlier in the performance.    Max Mathews, at Bell Labs, began experimenting with computer programs to create sound material. Mathews and Joan Miller also at Bell Labs, write MUSIC4, the first wide-spread computer sound synthesis program. Versions I through III were experimental versions written in assemble language. Music IV and Music V were written in FORTRAN. MUSIC4 did not allow reentrant instruments (same instrument becoming active again when it is already active), MUSIC5 added this. MUSIC4 required as many different instruments as the thickest chord, while MUSIC5 allowed a score to refer to an instrument as a template, which could then be called upon as many times as was necessary.    The Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center was formally established. The group had applied through the Rockefeller Foundation, and suggested the creation of a University Council for Electronic Music. They asked for technical assistants, electronic equipment, space and materials available to other composers free of charge. A grant of $175,000 over five years was made to Columbia and Princeton Universities. In January, 1959, under the direction of Luening and Ussachevsky of Columbia, and Milton Babbitt and Roger Sessions of Princeton, the Center was formally established.    The RCA Mark II synthesizer was built at Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center (the original version was built for the artificial creation of human speech). The Mark II contained oscillators and noise generators. The operator had to give the synthesizer instructions on a punched paper roll to control pitch, volume, duration and timbre. The synth used a conventional equal-tempered twelve-note scale.    1960  Composers of more traditional orchestral music began to rebel. Many composers tried to get quasi-electronic sounds out of traditional instruments. Bruno Bartelozzi, wrote new book on extended instrumental techniques.    Morton Subotnick, Pauline Oliveros, and Ramon Sender established the San Francisco Tape Music Center.    John Cage composed  Cartridge Music , an indeterminate score for several performers applying gramophone cartridges and contact mics to various objects.    1961  The first electronic music concerts at the Columbia-Princeton Studio were held; the music was received with much hostility from other faculty members.    Varese finally completed  Deserts  at the Columbia-Princeton Studio.    Fortran-based Music IV was used in the generation of ""Bicycle Built for Two"" (Mathews).    The production of integrated circuits and specifically VLSI-very large scale integration.    Robert Moog met Herbert Deutsch, and together they created a voltage-controlled synthesizer.    Luciano Berio composed  Visage . This radio composition is based on the idea of non-verbal communication. There are many word-like passages, but only one word is spoken during the entire composition (actually heard twice),  parole  (Italian for 'word'). Cathy Berberian, the composer's wife, was the performer.     The theoretical work,  Meta+Hodos , written in 1961 by James Tenney ( META Meta+Hodos , 1975 followed).    1962  Bell Labs mass produces transistors, professional amplifiers and suppliers.    PLF 2  was developed by James Tenney. This computer program was used to write  Four Stochastic Studies ,  Ergodos  and others.    Iannis Xenakis composed  Bohor  for eight tracks of sound.     Milton Babbitt composed  Ensembles for Synthesizer  (1962-64) at the Columbia-Princeton Studio.    At the University of Illinois, Kenneth Gaburo composed  Antiphony III , for chorus and tape.    Paul Ketoff built the synket. This synthesizer was built for composer John Eaton and was designed specifically as a live performance instrument.    1963  Lejaren Hiller and Robert Baker composed the  Computer Cantata .    Babbitt composed  Philomel  at the Columbia-Princeton Studio. The story is about Philomel, a woman without a tongue, who is transformed into a nightingale (based on a story by Ovid).    Mario Davidovsky composed  Synchronism I  for flute and tape. Davidovsky has since written many ""synchronism"" pieces. These works are all written for live instrument(s) and tape. They explore the synchronizing of events between the live and tape.    1964  The fully developed Moog was released. The modular idea came from the miniaturization of electronics.    Gottfried Michael Koenig used PR-1 (Project 1), a computer program that was written in Fortran and implemented on an IBM 7090 computer. The purpose of the program was to provide data to calculate structure in musical composition; written to perform algorithmic serial operations on incoming data. The second version of PR-1 completed, 1965.    Karlheinz Stockhausen composed  Mikrophonie I , a piece that required six musicians to generate. Two performers play a large tam-tam, while two others move microphones around the instrument to pick up different timbres, and the final two performers are controlling electronic processing.    Ilhan Mimaroglu, a Turkish-American composer, wrote  Bowery Bum . This is a concrete composition, and used rubber band as single source. It was based on a painting by Dubuffet.    1965  Hi-fi gear is commercially produced.    The first commercially-available Moog.    Varese died.    Karlheinz Stockhausen composed  Solo . The composition used a tape recorder with moveable heads to redefine variations in delay between recording and playback, live manipulation during performance.     Karlheinz Stockhausen composed  Mikrophonie II  for choir, Hammond organ, electronics and tape.    Steve Reich composed  It's gonna rain . This is one of the first phase pieces.    1966  The Moog Quartet offered world-wide concerts of (mainly) parlor music.    Herbert Brun composed  Non Sequitur VI    Steve Reich composed  Come out , another phase piece.    1967  Walter Carlos (later Wendy) composed  Switched on Bach  using a Moog synthesizer.    Iannis Xenakis wrote  Musiques Formelles  (Formalized Music). The first discussion of granular synthesis and the clouds and grains of sound is presented in this book.    Leon Kirschner composed  String Quartet No. 3 , the first piece with electronics to win the Pulitzer Prize.    Kenneth Gaburo composed  Antiphony IV , a work for trombone, piccolo, choir and tape.    Morton Subotnick composed  Silver Apples of the Moon  (title from Yeats), the first work commissioned specifically for the recorded medium.    The Grateful Dead released  Anthem of the Sun  and Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention released  Uncle Meat . Both albums made extensive use of electronic manipulation.    1968  Lejaren Hiller and John Cage composed  HPSCHD .     Morton Subotnick composed  The Wild Bull    Hugh Davies compiled an international catalogue of electronic music.    1969  Terry Riley composed  Rainbow in Curved Air      late 1960s  The Sal-Mar Construction was built. The instrument was named for composer Salvatore Martirano and designed by him. The Sal-Mar Construction weighed over fifteen hundred pounds and consisted of ""analog circuits controlled by internal digital circuits controlled by the composer/performer via a touch-control keyboard with 291 touch-sensitive keys.""    Godfrey Winham and Hubert Howe adapted MUSIC IV for the IBM 7094 as MUSIC4B was written in assembly language; MUSIC4BF (a Fortran-language adaptation of MUSIC4B, one version was written by Winham, another was written by Howe).    Music V variants include MUSIC360 and MUSIC11 for the IBM360 and the PDP11 computers, these were written by Barry Vercoe, Roger Hale, and Carl Howe at MIT, respectively.    GROOVE was developed by Mathews and F. Richard Moore at Bell Labs, and was used to control analog synthesizers.    1970  Charles Wuorinen composed ""Times Encomium,"" the first Pulitzer Prize winner for entirely electronic composition.    Charles Dodge composed  Earth's Magnetic Field . This is a great example of mapping numerical statistics into musical data.    Steve Reich composed  Four Organs .    1972  Pink Floyd's album  The Dark Side of the Moon  was released; it used ensembles of synthesizers, also used concrete tracks as interludes between tunes.    1973  SAWDUST, a language by Herbert Brun, used functions including: ELEMENT, LINK, MINGLE, MERGER, VARY, and TURN.    1974  The Mellotron was built. The instrument was an early sample player that used tape loops. There were versions that played string sounds or flute sounds, and the instrument was used in movie soundtracks and on recordings.    Clara Rockmore releases Theremin recordings.    1976  Composer Philip Glass collaborated with librettist Robert Wilson on  Einstein on the Beach . This was a large-scale multimedia 'opera' in the minimalist style.    1977  The Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique (IRCAM), Paris, under direction of Pierre Boulez.     Systems Concepts Digital Synthesizer (SCDS), built by Peter Samson for CCRMA, signal generating and processing elements all executing in parallel, and capable of running in real time. There are 256 digital oscillators, 128 signal modifiers (filters, reverb, amplitude scalers), a scratch-pad memory for communicating values between processing elements, and a large memory for reverberation and table storage.    1980  Philip Glass composed  Satyagraha , another full scale opera in the minimalist style.    1981  Larry Austin composed  Canadian Coastlines , a composition that used a land map of Canada in order to determine textural, rhythmic, and melodic content.    Music V variants: newer developments include Cmusic (by F.R. Moore), so named because it is written entirely in C programming language.    1985  HMSL, Hierarchical Music Specification Language was released. The basic organization of HMSL is a series of data structures called ""morphs"" (named for the flexible or morphological design of the software). Within the superstructure of these morphs there exist other data substructures named shapes, collections, structures, structures, productions, jobs, players, and actions. These secondary types of morphs are used to control aspects of higher level scheduling and routines.    Interactor, by Morton Subotnick and Mark Coniglio, was designed specifically for live performance and score-following capabilities.     1986  Another Music V variant was release--CSound, by Barry Vercoe of MIT.    Jam Factory written by programmer David Zicarelli. He was trying to create a program that would listen to MIDI input and 'improvise' immediately at some level of proficiency, while allowing (Zicarelli) to improve its ability.    Joel Chadabe, Offenhartz, Widoff, and Zicarelli began work on an algorithmic program that could be used as an improvisation environment. The performer could be seated at the computer and shape data in real time by ""a set of scroll bars that changed the parameters of this algorithm, such as the size of the jump from one note to another, the lowest and highest note, etc."" The original version was to be named ""Maestro,"" then ""RMan"" (Random Manager), and finally, ""M.""    Music Mouse, written by Laurie Speigel, was designed to be a stand-alone performance system. It may be used as a MIDI controller or as a performance station using the Macintosh internal sound. Unlike other programs for the Macintosh environment, Music Mouse was not intended to be used as a recorder/player program. Instead, the program enables the programmer to ""play"" the computer. Check out the software at:  http://www.dorsai.org/~spiegel/ls_programs.html      The Max program was written in the C language and was developed at IRCAM by Miller Puckette. It was later scheduled for distribution by Intelligent Music (the company that also distributed M and Jam Factory), but it was the Opcode company that eventually released it. Miller Puckette's original intention was to build a language that could control IRCAM's 4X synthesizer, and there was no need for the graphical implementation. The graphics were added after a version of Max for Macintosh computer using MIDI was proposed. Since 1989, David Zicarelli has updated and expanded the program for the Macintosh environment.

The album was produced by  Brendan O'Brien , who had previously worked on  Pearl Jam 's  Vs.  and  Vitalogy .   Neil Young  joined Pearl Jam in the studio in Seattle in January 1995, eleven days after performing with the band at an abortion-rights benefit in  Washington, D.C. [ 1 ]  The album was recorded in four days' studio time (January 26, January 27, February 7, and February 10). [ 2 ] [ 3 ]  Young took the approach of recording the songs live in the studio. Young brought ""Song X"", ""Act of Love"", and five other songs into the studio to record for the first session in January. [ 1 ] [ 3 ]  For the second session in February, he brought in two more songs. [ 3 ]  Young also wrote two new songs during the February recording sessions, and one song from the January sessions was re-recorded. [ 3 ]  Young said that all of the songs, with the exception of ""Song X"" and ""Act of Love"", were written in the four-day time period in which the album was recorded. [ 3 ]   Young said he traveled to Seattle to record the record for a ""challenge."" [ 3 ]  He said, ""Recording  Mirror Ball  was like audio vrit, just a snapshot of what's happening. Sometimes I didn't know who was playing. I was just conscious of this big smouldering mass of sound."" [ 3 ]  Young called Pearl Jam drummer  Jack Irons  ""unbelievable."" [ 3 ]  He stated that he ""played his ass off on every take at every session,"" and added, ""I can't say enough good things about him."" [ 3 ]  Pearl Jam frontman  Eddie Vedder  was not around much for the recording sessions. [ 4 ]  Vedder explained that he was ""in the midst of a pretty intense stalker problem,"" adding that ""leaving the house wasn't the easiest thing to do."" [ 4 ]  Pearl Jam guitarist  Stone Gossard  said that  Mirror Ball  ""came at a time when we needed it, that Neil thought we were a band that would be good to make a record with. He probably felt sorry for us. He made it all right for us to be who we were. He's not taking his career so seriously that he can't take chances. Suddenly, our band seemed too serious."" [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   Music and lyrics   Mirror Ball  captures a loose  rock  sound. The album has a very raw sound to it, with songs ending in feedback and band members talking at the start and at the end of many songs, including Young remarking at the end of ""Downtown""  ""Well, we know  that  one."" Young wrote all of the tracks for the album, except for ""Peace and Love"", which was co-written by Young and Vedder. William Ruhlmann of  Allmusic  said ""[Pearl Jam] boasts spirited rhythms and dense guitar interplay that Young makes excellent use of in a series of songs built out of simple, melodic rifts."" [ 5 ]   On the lyrical content of  Mirror Ball , Young said, ""There's idealism and reality, the two have got to come together yet there are always major problems when they do. Maybe that's the crux of what I'm trying to say in this new album. It's also a commentary of the differences between my peace and love '60s generation and the more cynical '90s generation."" [ 3 ]  ""Song X"" and ""Act of Love"" were written about  abortion . [ 1 ]  ""Downtown"" includes references to  Jimi Hendrix  and  Led Zeppelin . The reference to Led Zeppelin was partly inspired by Young's performance with the band at the 1995  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  induction ceremony. [ 1 ]     [ edit ]   Release and reception   Mirror Ball  reached number five on the  Billboard  200  album chart.  Mirror Ball  has been certified gold by the  RIAA . [ 6 ]   Rolling Stone  staff writer J.D. Considine gave  Mirror Ball  four out of five stars, saying, ""Though Young is clearly the dominant partner  it's his concept, after all, his songs and his album  it's Pearl Jam who ultimately end up determining the music's shape and feel, providing a level of input and energy that goes well beyond the normal purview of a backing band."" [ 7 ]  David Browne of  Entertainment Weekly  gave the album an A-. Browne said that ""the album has a spontaneous, bang-it-out casualness that is, to say the least, extremely rare for a rock veteran."" However, Browne criticized the album's lyrics, calling them ""mostly jumbled rehashes of standard Young imagery."" [ 8 ]   ""Downtown"" and ""Peace and Love"" had accompanying music videos. ""Downtown"" was the most successful song from  Mirror Ball  on the rock charts, reaching number six on the  Mainstream Rock  charts. ""Peace and Love"" also charted on the Mainstream Rock charts. At the  1996 Grammy Awards , ""Downtown"" received a nomination for  Best Rock Song  and ""Peace and Love"" received a nomination for  Best Male Rock Vocal Performance . [ 9 ]   Mirror Ball  received a nomination for  Best Rock Album . [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Packaging   Tying in with the album title, a  mirror ball  graces the album's cover art. Due to legal complications between their respective record companies, only Young's name appears on the album sleeve, although the individual members of Pearl Jam are credited inside. [ 10 ]  Pearl Jam's  Merkin Ball  complements the layout and content of the album packaging for  Mirror Ball . The title  Mirror Ball  comes from the line ""There's a mirror ball twirlin'"" from the song ""Downtown"".     [ edit ]   Tour   Following the completion of  Mirror Ball , the members of Pearl Jam without Vedder, but with the addition of O'Brien on keyboards, joined Young in August 1995 for an eleven-date tour in  Europe  to promote the album (when the band toured, fans referred to them as ""Neil Jam""). [ 11 ]  Pearl Jam guitarist  Mike McCready  said, ""It was a dream come true. We got to play a bunch of Neil Young songs with Neil Young himself and got to go to Berlin, to Jerusalem, to the Red Sea."" [ 12 ]  This tour proved very successful with Young's manager Elliot Roberts calling it ""One of the greatest tours we ever had in our whole lives.""

[ 1 ]  Both songs were recorded at the tail end of the  Mirror Ball  sessions. [ 14 ]  The tracks were later compiled on to Pearl Jam's 1995  Merkin Ball  EP, which is considered the official companion to Young's  Mirror Ball .

It was recorded in  1973 , its release delayed for two years. It peaked at #25 on the  Billboard 200 . In 2003, the album was ranked number 331 on  Rolling Stone  magazine's list of  the 500 greatest albums of all time .           Contents       1   Content   2   Liner notes   3   Critical reception   4   Track listing with personnel     4.1   Side one   4.2   Side two       5   Personnel     5.1   Band credits       6   Charts     6.1   Album       7   External links               [ edit ]   Content   Dark, heartfelt, and raw,  Tonight's the Night  was initially rejected by Young's record company (a running theme in Young's career) as the second uncommercial release in a row and an unacceptable follow-up to his popular breakthrough,  Harvest , and too stark a contrast with Young's work with  Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young .   Young's album was a startlingly direct expression of grief:  Crazy Horse  guitarist  Danny Whitten  and Young's friend and roadie  Bruce Berry  had both died of drug overdoses in the months before the songs were written. The title track mentions Bruce Berry by name, while Whitten's guitar and vocal work highlight ""Come on Baby, Let's Go Downtown"", recorded live in 1970. The song would later appear, unedited, on a live album from the same concerts,  Live at the Fillmore East , and credited to Whitten only as author.     [ edit ]   Liner notes   Included with the vinyl release of  Tonight's the Night  was a seemingly strange insert that added to Neil Young's claim that  Tonight's the Night  was the closest he ever came to art. Emphasising the personal nature of the album, the self-penned liner notes contained an apology: ""I'm sorry. You don't know these people. This means nothing to you."" The original inserts/liner notes included in the vinyl release were quite cryptic in their conveyance.   On the front of the insert is a letter to the mysterious ""Waterface"" character, no explanation is given to their identity, although in  Shakey: Neil Young's Biography  by Jimmy McDonough, Young says that ""Waterface is the person writing the letter. When I read the letter, I'm Waterface. It's just a stupid thing - a suicide note without the suicide."" (McDonough).   The back of the insert was equally puzzling, as it appeared in the insert superimposed over the credits to Young's  On the Beach  album, released a year prior. This passage is reportedly the lyrics to an unreleased song titled ""Florida"", referred to in  Shakey  as ""A cockamamie spoken-word dream, set to the shrieking accompaniment of either Young or  (Ben)  Keith drawing a wet finger around the rim of a glass."" (McDonough).   When unfolded, comprising a whole side of the insert was a lengthy article printed entirely in Dutch and is in fact a review of a  Tonight's the Night  live show by Dutch journalist Constant Meijers for the Dutch rock-magazine ""Muziekkrant Oor"". In 1976 Young said he chose to print it ""Because I didn't understand any of it myself, and when someone is so sickened and fucked up as I was then, everything's in Dutch anyway."" Also, Neil Young told Constant Meijers during a week's visit he made to Young's ranch in California, that he chose the article after some Dutch girls who were visiting him translated the story and made him aware of the fact ""that someone on the other end of the world exactly understood what he was trying to say.""   The  Reprise Records  sticker on the vinyl record itself was printed in black and white rather than the standard orange color, a process Young undertook again on the CD label art for 1994's  Sleeps With Angels . Original printings of the sleeve were done on blotter paper which proved quite costly as reprints of the album are no longer printed that way.   Scratched into the run-out grooves on Side One is the message ""Hello Waterface"" while the run-out grooves on Side Two read ""Goodbye Waterface"". The picture of  Roy Orbison  is taken from a  bootleg  tape Young came across and, feeling bad that Orbison most likely did not know the bootleg existed, printed it in the insert for him to see.   In  Shakey: Neil Young's Biography  by Jimmy McDonough, Young maintains that along with the inserts there was a small package of glitter inside the sleeve that was meant to fall out (""Our  Bowie  statement."" (McDonough)), spilling when the listener took the record out. However, both Jimmy McDonough and Joel Bernstein (Young's archivist) have yet to find a copy of Tonight's the Night featuring the glitter package.     [ edit ]   Critical reception   Dave Marsh  wrote in the original  Rolling Stone  review:     ""The music has a feeling of offhand, first-take crudity matched recently only by  Blood on the Tracks , almost as though Young wanted us to miss its ultimate majesty in order to emphasize its ragged edge of desolation. [...] More than any of Young's earlier songs and albums-even the despondent  On the Beach  and the mordant, rancorous  Time Fades Away  --  Tonight's the Night  is preoccupied with death and disaster. [...] There is no sense of retreat, no apology, no excuses offered and no quarter given. If anything, these are the old ideas with a new sense of aggressiveness. The jitteriness of the music, its sloppy, unarranged (but decidedly structured) feeling is clearly calculated.""     In a followup review published ten years later, Marsh wrote:     ""The record chronicles the post-hippie, post-Vietnam demise of counterculture idealism, and a generation's long, slow trickle down the drain through drugs, violence, and twisted sexuality. This is Young's only conceputally cohesive record, and it's a great one.""

clueweb09-en0001-40-19962	                   The Beatles Lyrics           The Beatles are among the most influential popular music artists    of the second half of the 20th century, affecting the culture of Britain    and America and the postwar baby boom generation, and the entire    English-speaking world, especially during the 1960s and early 1970s.     They synthesized all that was good about early rock and roll, and    changed it into something original and even more exciting. They    established the prototype for the self-contained rock group that wrote    and performed their own material. As composers, their craft, melodic    inventiveness, and lyrics were second to none, and key to the evolution of rock from    its blues/R&B-based forms into a style that was far more eclectic, but    equally visceral. As singers, both John Lennon and Paul McCartney were    among the best and most expressive vocalists in rock; the group's    harmonies were intricate and exhilarating. As performers, they were (at    least until touring had ground them down) exciting and photogenic; when    they retreated into the studio, they were instrumental in pioneering    advanced techniques and multi-layered arrangements.

The film was made in the summer of 2005 in  Nashville, Tennessee , premiered at the  Sundance Film Festival , and was released to theaters on February 10, 2006. The film documents Young's premiere of his songs from his album  Prairie Wind  at the  Ryman Auditorium .

They and the other band members describe the concert and the making of  Prairie Wind . The recording of the album and the filming of the concert occurred just before and after Young's surgery to correct a  cerebral aneurysm , and just a few months after the death of Young's father  Scott Young .   The first half of the concert consists entirely of songs from  Prairie Wind , and the second half consists of acoustic songs from throughout Young's career. Young is typically reticent during concerts, but this concert is an exception and Young describes the inspiration behind several of his songs.     [ edit ]   Songs in the film   The performance captured in  Neil Young: Heart of Gold  was filmed over two nights on  August 18  and  19 ,  2005  at the  Ryman Auditorium  in  Nashville, Tennessee . In order to increase the length of the concert film, director  Jonathan Demme  asked  Neil Young  to supplement the songs from  Prairie Wind  with an  encore  set of older songs. Young agreed and selected songs that he had previously recorded in Nashville. The two sets are set apart by a costume change for the musicians and a different backdrop on the stage.   All songs are written by Young, except where otherwise noted.     [ edit ]   Prairie Wind  set     ""The Painter""   ""No Wonder""  featuring Neil Young's longtime friend Grant Boatwright playing "" Old Black "", the only use of  electric guitar  in the concert.   ""Falling Off the Face of the Earth""   ""Far From Home""  Young introduces the song by telling a story about his father giving him an  Arthur Godfrey   ukelele  when he was about 7 years old and working on a chicken farm.   ""It's a Dream""   ""Prairie Wind""   ""Here for You""   ""This Old Guitar""  duet with  Emmylou Harris ; Young notes that he is playing a guitar (a  Martin D-28 ) once owned by  Hank Williams .   ""When God Made Me""  features Young playing piano, backed by the Fisk University Jubilee Singers and  Spooner Oldham  on organ.       [ edit ]   Encore set     ""I Am a Child""   ""Harvest Moon""   "" Heart of Gold ""   "" Old Man ""   "" The Needle and the Damage Done ""   ""Old King""  features Young on six-string  banjo , accompanied by  Emmylou Harris  on  rhythm guitar  and harmony vocals.   ""Comes a Time""  dedicated to  Nicolette Larson  who sang on Young's  Comes a Time  album; features the backing singers and crew lined up across the front of the stage playing acoustic guitars.   "" Four Strong Winds ""  written by  Ian Tyson .   ""One of These Days""   ""The Old Laughing Lady""  over the closing credits; Young on solo acoustic guitar, alone on stage in a chair, playing to an empty auditorium.

It contains thirty-five of Young's songs recorded between 1966 and 1976, among them five tracks that had been unreleased up to that point. It peaked at #43 on the  Billboard  Top Pop Albums chart.           Contents       1   History   2   Alternate early version   3   Track listing     3.1   Side one   3.2   Side two   3.3   Side three   3.4   Side four   3.5   Side five   3.6   Side six       4   Notes   5   External links   6   Charts               [ edit ]   History   Compiled by Young himself, with his hand-written notes about each track, representing every album from his career and various affiliations through 1977 with the exception of  Four Way Street  and  Time Fades Away . Of the previously unreleased songs, ""Down to the Wire"" features the New Orleans pianist  Dr. John  with  Buffalo Springfield  on an item from their shelved  Stampede  album; "" Love Is a Rose "" was a minor hit for  Linda Ronstadt  in 1975; ""Winterlong"" received a cover by  Pixies  on the Neil Young tribute album from 1989,  The Bridge ; and ""Campaigner"" is yet another Young song critical of  Richard Nixon . The track ""Long May You Run"" is a different mix to that found on the  album of the same name , featuring the harmonies of the full  CSNY  before Crosby & Nash left the recording sessions.   The album has been lauded in many quarters as one of the best examples of a career retrospective for a rock and roll artist, and as a template for the  box set  collections that would follow in the 1980s and beyond. However, in the original article on Young from the first edition of the  Rolling Stone  Illustrated History of Rock and Roll  and a subsequent article in the  1983  Rolling Stone Record Guide , critic  Dave Marsh  used this album to accuse Young of deliberately manufacturing a self-mythology, arguing that while his highlights could be seen to place him on a level with other greats from his generation like  Bob Dylan  or  The Beatles , the particulars of his catalogue did not bear this out. The magazine has since excised the article from subsequent editions of the Illustrated History book; a somewhat messy transcription of it can be found at the link below (despite his scathing view of Young's career, Marsh gave the album the highest possible rating).   For many years,  Decade  was the only Neil Young compilation album available. A 1993 compilation called  Lucky Thirteen  was released, but it only covered Young's 1982-1988 output. It was not until 2004 that  Reprise Records  released a single-disc retrospective, simply titled  Greatest Hits . Since the 1980s, Young has promised fans a follow up collection, variously referred to as  Decade II  or  Archives  and ranging in size from a box set to an entire series of audio and/or video releases. In the meantime, the first release of archival material since  Decade  and  Lucky Thirteen  would appear in 2006,  Live at the Fillmore East , a recording from a 1970 concert featuring  Crazy Horse  with  Danny Whitten .     [ edit ]   Alternate early version   Initially,  Decade  was to be released in 1976, but was pulled at the last minute by Young. It was shelved until the following year, where it appeared with two songs removed from the original tracklist (a live version of ""Don't Cry No Tears"" recorded in Japan in 1976, and a live version of ""Pushed it Over The End"" recorded in 1974). Also removed were the following comments on those two songs and  Time Fades Away , from Young's handwritten liner notes [ 1 ] :     ""Time Fades Away. No songs from this album are included here. It was recorded on my biggest tour ever, 65 shows in 90 days. Money hassles among everyone concerned ruined this tour and record for me but i released it anyway so you folks could see what could happen if you lose it for a while. I was becoming more interested in an audio verite approach than satistfying the public demands for a repition of Harvest.""       ""Don't Cry No Tears. Initially titled 'I Wonder,' this song was written in 1964. One of my first songs. This is a live recording from Japan with Crazy Horse.""       ""Pushed It over the End. Recorded live on the road in Chicago, 1974. Thanks to Crosby & Nash's help on the overdubbed chorus, I was able to complete this work. I wrote it for Patty Hearst and her countless brothers and sisters. Also, I wrote it for myself and the increasing distance between me and you.""

It contains a previously unreleased song ""Stringman"", that dates from 1976. The taping of the show was also released on  VHS .   The recording of this installment of the MTV series ""Unplugged"" was rife with tension, as Young was not happy with the performances of almost everyone in the band. In fact, the released version is actually the second attempt made at recording a set suitable for airing and release.

Please help  improve the article  or discuss these issues on the  talk page .     It needs  additional  references or sources  for  verification .   Tagged since July 2007.             This article is about Western  art music  from 1000 AD to the present.  For Western art music from 1750 to 1820, see  Classical period (music) .  For all art music styles, see  List of classical music styles .       Periods of European art music       Early       Medieval   (500  1400)       Renaissance   (1400  1600)       Common practice       Baroque   (1600  1760)       Classical   (1730  1820)       Romantic   (1815  1910)       Modern and contemporary       20th century   (1900  2000)       Contemporary   (1975  present)       Classical music  is a broad term that usually refers to mainstream music produced in, or rooted in the traditions of  Western   liturgical  and  secular music , encompassing a broad period from roughly the 9th century to present times. [ 1 ]  The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the  common practice period .   European music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and  popular musical  forms by its system of  staff notation , in use since about the 16th century. [ 2 ]  Western staff notation is used by composers to prescribe to the performer the  pitch ,  speed ,  meter , individual  rhythms  and exact execution of a piece of music. This leaves less room for practices, such as improvisation and  ad libitum  ornamentation, that are frequently heard in non-European art music (compare  Indian classical music  and  Japanese traditional music ) and popular music. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ]   The public taste for and appreciation of formal music of this type waned in the late 1900s in the  United States  and  United Kingdom  in particular. [ 6 ]  Certainly this period has seen classical music falling well behind the immense commercial success of popular music, in the opinion of some [ who? ] , although the number of CDs sold is not indicative of the popularity of classical music. [ 7 ]   The term ""classical music"" did not appear until the early 19th century, in an attempt to ""canonize"" the period from  Johann Sebastian Bach  to  Beethoven  as a golden age. [ 8 ]  The earliest reference to ""classical music"" recorded by the  Oxford English Dictionary  is from about 1836. [ 9 ] [ 10 ]  Many writers feel that ""classical"" is an inappropriate term for mainstream and  avant-garde  music written since the latter part of the 19th century; hence the common usage of apostrophes as a short-hand for ""so-called"".

Vague descriptions are plentiful, such as describing classical music as anything that ""lasts a long time,"" a statement made rather moot when one considers contemporary composers who are described as ""classical;"" or music that has certain instruments like violins, which are also found in  bluegrass music ,  Broadway  music, and other genres; or ""relaxing"" or ""background"" music for affluent people, descriptions which are probably only accurate when describing court music from the  Baroque  and  Classical  periods. However, there are characteristics that classical music contains that generally few or no other genres of music contain.     [ edit ]   Instrumentation   Classical and popular music are often distinguished by their choice of instruments. There are few if any genres in which so many different instruments are used simultaneously by performing groups such as symphony  orchestras , which often contain as many as 5 or so different types of  string instruments  including  violins , violas, cellos, double basses and  harp ; 7 or more types of  woodwind  instruments; 4 or so types of  brass  instrument; and many diverse  percussion  instruments, sometimes as many as 10 different types. Also prevalent, especially in  opera , is the human  voice . Comparatively, most popular music genres involve fewer instruments. For instance a typical  rock band  will consist of a drummer, a guitarist or two, a singer or two, an electric bassist and, less universally, a keyboardist. Of course, crossover influences, such as string sections in pop recordings, are very popular as well, but rarely are backing strings considered to be part of pop or rock bands.   The instruments used in common practice classical music were mostly invented before the mid-19th century (often much earlier), and codified in the 18th and 19th centuries. They consist of the instruments found in an orchestra, together with a few other solo instruments (such as the  piano ,  harpsichord , and  organ ).   Electric instruments such as the  electric guitar  appear occasionally in the classical music of the 20th and 21st centuries. Both classical and popular musicians have experimented in recent decades with electronic instruments such as the  synthesizer , electric and digital techniques such as the use of sampled or computer-generated sounds, and the sounds of instruments from other cultures such as the  gamelan .   None of the bass instruments existed until the Renaissance. In Medieval music, instruments are divided in two categories: loud instruments for use outdoors or in church, and quieter instruments for indoor use. Many instruments which are associated today with popular music used to have important roles in early classical music, such as  bagpipes ,  vihuelas ,  hurdy-gurdies  and some woodwind instruments. On the other hand, the acoustic guitar, for example, which used to be associated mainly with popular music, has gained prominence in classical music through the 19th and 20th centuries.   While  equal temperament  became gradually accepted as the dominant  musical temperament  during the 19th century, different historical temperaments are often used for music from earlier periods. For instance, music of the  English Renaissance  is often performed in  mean tone  temperament.     [ edit ]   Form and technical execution   Whereas the majority of popular styles, such as  rock music , lend themselves to the  song  form, classical music can also take on the form of the  concerto ,  symphony ,  opera ,  dance music ,  suite ,  tude ,  symphonic poem , and others.   Classical composers often aspire to imbue their music with a very complex relationship between its affective (emotional) content and the intellectual means by which it is achieved. Many of the most esteemed works of classical music make use of  musical development , the process by which a musical germ, idea or  motif  is repeated in different contexts or in altered form. The  classical genres of sonata form  and fugue employ rigorous forms of musical development.   Along with a certain desire for composers to attain high technical achievement in writing their music, performers of classical music are faced with similar goals of technical mastery, as demonstrated by the proportionately high amount of schooling and private study most successful classical musicians have had when compared to ""popular"" genre musicians, and the large number of secondary schools, including the  conservatories , dedicated to the study of classical music. The only other genre in the Western world with comparable secondary education opportunities is  jazz .     [ edit ]   Complexity   Performance of classical music repertoire often demands a significant level of technical mastery on the part of the musician; proficiency in  sight-reading  and  ensemble  playing, thorough understanding of  tonal  and  harmonic  principles, knowledge of  performance practice , and a familiarity with the style/musical idiom inherent to a given period, composer or musical work are among the most essential of skills for the competent, classically trained musician. Works of classical repertoire often exhibit artistic complexity through the use of  thematic  development,  phrasing ,  harmonization ,  modulation  (change of key),  texture , and, of course,  musical form  itself. Larger-scale compositional forms (such as that of the  symphony ,  concerto ,  opera  or  oratorio , for example) usually represent a hierarchy of smaller units consisting of  phrases ,  periods ,  sections , and  movements .  Musical analysis  of a composition aims at achieving greater understanding of it through the study of this complexity, leading to more meaningful hearing and a greater appreciation of the composer's style.     [ edit ]   Society   Often perceived as opulent or signifying some aspect of upper-level society, classical music has generally never been as popular with working-class society. However, the traditional perception that only upper-class society has access to and appreciation for classical music, or even that classical music represents the upper-class society, may not be true, given that many if not most working classical musicians fall somewhere in the middle-class income range in the United States, and that classical concertgoers and CD buyers are not necessarily upper class. [ citation needed ]  Even in the Classical era, Mozart's  opere buffe  such as  Cos fan tutte  were popular with ordinary people.   Classical music regularly features in pop culture, forming background music for movies, television programs and advertisements. As a result most people in the Western World regularly and often unknowingly listen to classical music; this means that it can be argued that the relatively low levels of recorded music sales may not be a good indicator of its actual popularity. In more recent times the association of certain classical pieces with major events has led to brief upsurges in interest in particular classical genres. A good example of this was the choice of  Nessun dorma  from  Giacomo Puccini 's opera  Turandot  as the theme tune for the  1990 Soccer World Cup , which led to a noticeable increase in popular interest in opera and in particular in tenor arias, which led to the huge sellout concerts by  The Three Tenors . Such events are often cited as helping to drive increases in the audiences at many classical concerts that have been observed in recent times.     [ edit ]   History     See also:  History of music     The major time divisions of classical music are the early period (which includes  Medieval  (476  1400) and  Renaissance  (1400  1600)), the Common practice period (which includes  Baroque  (1600  1750); the  Classical  (1730  1820) and  Romantic  (1815  1910)) periods, and the modern and contemporary period which includes  20th century classical  (1900  2000) and  contemporary classical  (1975  current).   The dates are  generalizations , since the periods overlapped and the categories are somewhat arbitrary. For example, the use of  counterpoint  and  fugue , which is considered characteristic of the Baroque era, was continued by  Mozart , who is generally classified as typical of the classical period.  Beethoven , who is often described as a founder of the romantic period, and  Brahms , who is classified as romantic, also used counterpoint and fugue, but it is other characteristics of their music that define their period.   The prefix  neo  is used to describe a 20th century or contemporary composition written in the style of an earlier period, such as classical, romantic, or modern.  Stravinsky's   Pulcinella , for example, is a  neoclassical  composition because it is stylistically similar to works of the Classical period.     [ edit ]   Roots       Main article:  Ancient music       The roots of western classical music lie in early Christian liturgical music, and its influences date even further back to the  Ancient Greeks . Development of individual tones and scales was done by ancient Greeks such as  Aristoxenus  and the mathematician  Pythagoras . [ 12 ]  Pythagoras created a tuning system and helped to codify  musical notation . Ancient Greek instruments such as the  aulos  (a  reed instrument ) and the  lyre  (a stringed instrument similar to a small harp) eventually led to the modern day instruments of a classical orchestra. [ 13 ]  The antecedent to the early period was the era of  ancient music  from before the fall of the  Roman Empire  (476 AD). Very little music survives from this time, most of it from Ancient Greece.     [ edit ]   Early Period       Main articles:  Medieval music  and  Renaissance music     See also:  List of Medieval composers  and  List of Renaissance composers     The Medieval period includes music from after the fall of Rome to about 1400.  Monophonic  chant, also called plainsong or  Gregorian Chant , was the dominant form until about 1100. [ 14 ]   Polyphonic  (multi-voiced) music developed from monophonic chant throughout the late  Middle Ages  and into the  Renaissance , including the more complex voicings of  motets . The Renaissance period was from 1400  1600. It was characterized by greater use of  instrumentation , multiple interweaving melodic lines and by the use of the first  bass instruments . Social dancing became more widespread, so musical forms appropriate to accompanying dance began to standardize.   It is in this time that the notation of music on a  staff  and other elements of  musical notation  began to take its current shape. [ 15 ]  This invention made possible the separation of the  composition  of a piece of music from its  transmission ; without written music, transmission was oral, and subject to change every time it was transmitted. With a  musical score , a work of music could be performed without requiring the composer's presence. [ 14 ]  The invention of the movable-type  printing press  in the 15th century had predictably far-reaching consequences on the preservation and transmission of music. [ 16 ]   Typical stringed instruments of the Early Period include the harp,  lute ,  vielle , and  psaltery , while wind instruments included the  flute  family (including  recorder ),  shawm  (an early member of the  oboe  family),  trumpet , and the  bagpipe . Simple  pipe organs  existed, but were largely confined to churches, although portable varieties existed. [ 17 ]  Later in the period, early versions of  keyboard  instruments like the  clavichord  and  harpsichord  began to appear. Stringed instruments such as the  viol  had emerged by the 16th century, as had a wider variety of brass and reed instruments. Printing enabled the standardization of descriptions and specifications of instruments, as well as instruction in their use. [ 18 ]     [ edit ]   Common Practice Period   The  Common Practice Period  is when many of the notions that make up the idea of western classical music took shape, standardized, or were codified in some way. It began with the Baroque era, running from roughly 1600 to the middle of the 18th century. The Classical era followed, ending roughly around 1820. The Romantic era ran through the 19th century, ending about 1910.     [ edit ]   Baroque music       Main article:  Baroque music     See also:  List of Baroque composers     Baroque music is characterized by the use of complex tonal  counterpoint  and the use of a  basso continuo , a continuous bass line. In this time, the beginnings of the  sonata form  took shape in the  canzona , as did a more formalized notion of  theme and variations . The tonalities of  major and minor  as means for managing dissonance and  chromaticism  in music took full shape. [ 19 ]   During the Baroque keyboard music played on the  harpsichord  and  pipe organ  became increasingly popular, and the  violin  family of stringed instruments took the form we generally see today.  Opera  as a staged musical drama began to differentiate itself from earlier musical and dramatic forms, and vocal forms like the  cantata  and  oratorio  became more common. [ 20 ]  Instrumental ensembles began to distinguish and standardize by size, giving rise to the early  orchestra  for larger ensembles, with  chamber music  being written for smaller groups of instruments where parts are played by individual (instead of massed) instruments. The  concerto  as a vehicle for solo performance accompanied by an orchestra became widespread, although the relationship between soloist and orchestra was relatively simple. The theories surrounding  equal temperament  began to be put in wider practice, especially as it enabled a wider range of chromatic possibilities in hard-to-tune keyboard instruments. (For example, equal temperament made possible  Bach 's  Well-Tempered Clavier .) [ 21 ]     [ edit ]   Classical period music       Main article:  Classical period (music)     See also:  List of Classical era composers     The Classical period, from about 1750  1820, established many of the norms of composition, presentation and style, and was when the  piano  became the predominant keyboard instrument. The  basic  forces required for an orchestra became somewhat standardized (although they would grow as the potential of a wider array of instruments was developed in the following centuries). Chamber music grew to include ensembles with as many as 8-10 performers for  serenades . Opera continued to develop, with regional styles in  Italy , France, and German-speaking lands predominating. The  opera buffa , or comic opera, gained in popularity. The  symphony  came into its own as a musical form, and the concerto was developed as a vehicle for displays of virtuoso playing skill. Orchestras no longer required a  harpsichord  (which had been part of the traditional  continuo  in the Baroque style), and were often led by the lead violinist (whom we now call the  concertmaster ). [ 22 ]   Wind instruments became more refined in the Classical period. While  double reeded  instruments like the  oboe  and  bassoon  became somewhat standardized in the Baroque, the  clarinet  family of  single reeds  did not receive wide use until  Mozart  expanded its role in orchestral, chamber, and concerto settings.     [ edit ]   Romantic era music       Main article:  Romantic music     See also:  List of Romantic composers     The music of the Romantic era, from 1820  1910, was characterized by increased attention to melody and rhythm, as well as expressive and emotional elements, paralleling  romanticism  in other art forms. Musical forms began to break from the Classical era forms (even as those were being codified), with free-form pieces with titles like  nocturne ,  fantasia , and  prelude  being written, where accepted ideas about the exposition and development of themes were ignored or minimized. [ 23 ]  The music became more chromatic, dissonant, and tonally colorful, with tensions (with respect to accepted norms of the older forms) about key signatures increasing. [ 24 ]  The  art song  (or  Lied ) came to maturity in this era, as did the epic scales of  grand opera , which culminated with  Richard Wagner 's  Ring cycle . [ 25 ]   In the 19th century, musical institutions were able to separate themselves from the control of wealthy patrons, as composers and musicians were able to construct lives independent of the whims of the sometimes fickle nobility. Increasing interest in music by the growing middle classes throughout western Europe spurred the creation of organizations for the teaching, performance, and preservation of music. The piano, which achieved its modern construction in this era, in part due to industrial advances in metallurgy, became widely popular with the middle class, whose demands for the instrument spurred a large number of piano builders. Most symphony orchestras with long histories date their founding to this era. [ 24 ]  Some musicians and composers were the stars of the day; some, like  Franz Liszt  and  Niccol Paganini , fulfilled both roles. [ 26 ]   The family of instruments used, especially in orchestras, grew. A wider array of percussion instruments began to appear. Brass instruments took on larger roles, as the introduction of  rotary valves  made it possible for them to play a wider range of notes. The size of the orchestra (typically around 40 in the Classical era) grew to be over 100. [ 24 ]   Gustav Mahler 's 1906  Symphony of a Thousand , for example, has been performed with over 150 instrumentalists and choirs over 400 strong.   The influence of the European musical ideas also began to spread beyond the boundaries of Europe, as European cultural ideas and institutions began to follow colonial expansion into other parts of the world. There was also a rise within Europe, especially toward the end of the era, of  nationalism  in music (echoing, in some cases, political sentiments of the time), as composers such as  Edvard Grieg ,  Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov , and  Antonn Dvok  echoed traditional music of their homelands in their compositions. [ 27 ]     [ edit ]   20th century, modern, and contemporary music       Main articles:  20th century classical music  and  Contemporary classical music     See also:  List of 20th century classical composers  and  List of 21st century classical composers     The modern era began with  Impressionist music  from 1910  1920, which was dominated by French composers who went against the traditional German ways of art and music. Impressionist music by  Erik Satie ,  Claude Debussy  and  Maurice Ravel  used the  pentatonic scale , long, flowing phrases and free rhythms.  Modernism , 1905 - 1985, marked a period when many composers rejected certain values of the ""common practice"" period, such as traditional tonality, melody, instrumentation, and structure. Composers, academics, and musicians developed extensions of music theory and technique in this time. 20th century classical music, encompassing a wide variety of post-Romantic styles composed through the year 1999, includes late Romantic, Modern and Postmodern styles of composition. The term contemporary music is sometimes used to describe music composed in the late 20th century through present day.     [ edit ]   Timeline of composers                                                                                                                                                                                                                     [ edit ]   Significance of written notation   Classical music is considered primarily a  written  musical tradition, preserved in  music notation , as opposed to being transmitted orally, by rote, or in recordings of particular performances. While there are differences between particular performances of a classical work, a piece of classical music is generally held to transcend any  interpretation  of it. The use of musical notation is an effective method for transmitting classical music, since the written music contains the technical instructions for performing the work. The written score, however, does not usually contain explicit instructions as to how to interpret the piece in terms of production or performance, apart from directions for dynamics, tempo and expression (to a certain extent); this is left to the discretion of the performers, who are guided by their personal experience and musical education, their knowledge of the work's idiom, and the accumulated body of historic performance practices.   However,  improvisation  once played an important role in classical music. A remnant of this improvisatory tradition in classical music can be heard in the  cadenza , a passage found mostly in concertos and solo works, designed to allow skilled performers to exhibit their virtuoso skills on the instrument. Traditionally this was improvised by the performer; however more often than not, it is written for (or occasionally by) the performer beforehand.   Its written transmission, along with the veneration bestowed on certain classical works, has led to the expectation that performers will play a work in a way that realizes in detail the original intentions of the composer. During the 19th century the details that composers put in their scores generally increased. Yet the opposite trend  admiration of performers for new ""interpretations"" of the composer's work  can be seen, and it is not unknown for a composer to praise a performer for achieving a better realization of the composer's original intent than the composer was able to imagine. Thus, classical music performers often achieve very high reputations for their musicianship, even if they do not compose themselves. Generally however, it is the composers who are remembered more than the performers.   Another consequence of the primacy of the composer's written score is that improvisation plays a relatively minor role in classical music, in sharp contrast to traditions like  jazz , where improvisation is central. Improvisation in classical music performance was far more common during the Baroque era than in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and recently the performance of such music by modern classical musicians has been enriched by a revival of the old improvisational practices. During the classical period, Mozart and Beethoven sometimes improvised the cadenzas to their  piano concertos  (and thereby encouraged others to do so), but they also provided written cadenzas for use by other soloists.     [ edit ]   Influence   One criterion used to distinguish works of the classical musical canon is that of cultural durability. However, this is not a distinguishing mark of all classical music: while works by J. S. Bach continue to be widely performed and highly regarded, music by many of Bach's contemporaries is deemed mediocre and is rarely performed, even though it is squarely in the ""classical"" realm. To some extent, the notion of such durability is a  self-fulfilling prophecy  (and therefore a fallacy), simply because classical music is studied and preserved at much higher levels than other music.     [ edit ]   Popular music   Classical music has often incorporated elements or even taken material from popular music. Examples include occasional music such as Brahms' use of student drinking songs in his  Academic Festival Overture , genres exemplified by  Kurt Weill 's  The Threepenny Opera , and the influence of jazz on early- and mid-twentieth century composers including  Maurice Ravel , as exemplified by the movement entitled ""Blues"" in his sonata for violin and piano. [ 28 ]  Certain  postmodern ,  minimalist  and  postminimalist  classical composers acknowledge a debt to popular music. [ 29 ]   There are, likewise, numerous examples of influence flowing in the opposite direction, including popular songs based on classical music, the use to which  Pachelbel's Canon  has been put since the 1970s, [ 30 ]  and the musical  crossover  phenomenon, where classical musicians have achieved success in the popular music arena (one notable example is the  Hooked on Classics  series of recordings made by the  Royal Philharmonic Orchestra  in the early 1980s). Some rock bands such as  Emerson, Lake & Palmer  have recorded classical compositions.     [ edit ]   Folk music   Further information:  European Classical Composers Noted for Use of Folk Music   Composers of classical music have often made use of  folk music  (music created by musicians who are commonly not classically trained, often from a purely oral tradition). Some composers, like  Dvok  and  Smetana , [ 31 ]  have used folk themes to impart a nationalist flavor to their work, while others (like  Bartk ) have used specific themes, lifted whole from their folk-music origins. [ 32 ]     [ edit ]   Commercialism   Certain staples of classical music are often used commercially (that is, either in advertising or in the soundtracks of movies made for entertainment). In television commercials, several loud, bombastically rhythmic orchestral passages have become clichs, particularly the opening of  Richard Strauss '  Also sprach Zarathustra  (made famous in  2001: A Space Odyssey ) and the opening section ""O Fortuna"" of  Carl Orff 's  Carmina Burana ; other examples in the same vein are the  Dies Irae  from the  Verdi  Requiem,  Edvard Grieg 's  In the Hall of the Mountain King  from  Peer Gynt , the opening bars of  Beethoven 's  Symphony No. 5 , Wagner's  Ride of the Valkyries  from  Die Walkre , and excerpts of  Aaron Copland 's  Rodeo .   Similarly, movies and television often revert to standard, clichd snatches of classical music to convey refinement or opulence: some of the most-often heard pieces in this category include  Mozart 's  Eine kleine Nachtmusik ,  Vivaldi 's  Four Seasons , and  Mussorgsky 's  A Night on Bald Mountain .     [ edit ]   Education       Main article:  Music education       Throughout history, parents have often made sure that their children receive classical music training from a young age. Some parents pursue music lessons for their children for social reasons or in an effort to instill a useful sense of self-discipline. Some consider that a degree of knowledge of important works of classical music is part of a good general education.   During the 1990s, several research papers and popular books emergence touting the so-called  Mozart effect : a temporary, small elevation of scores on certain tests as a result of listening to Mozart. The popularized version of the controversial theory was expressed succinctly by a  New York Times  music columnist: ""researchers... have determined that listening to Mozart actually makes you smarter."" [ 33 ]  Promoters marketed CDs claimed to induce the effect. Florida passed a law requiring toddlers in state-run schools to listen to classical music every day, and in 1998 the governor of Georgia budgeted $105,000 per year to provide every child born in Georgia with a tape or CD of classical music. One of the co-authors of the original studies of the Mozart effect commented ""I don't think it can hurt. I'm all for exposing children to wonderful cultural experiences. But I do think the money could be better spent on  music education  programs.""

It was recorded in  1973 , its release delayed for two years. It peaked at #25 on the  Billboard 200 . In 2003, the album was ranked number 331 on  Rolling Stone  magazine's list of  the 500 greatest albums of all time .

Young's album was a startlingly direct expression of grief:  Crazy Horse  guitarist  Danny Whitten  and Young's friend and roadie  Bruce Berry  had both died of drug overdoses in the months before the songs were written. The title track mentions Bruce Berry by name, while Whitten's guitar and vocal work highlight ""Come on Baby, Let's Go Downtown"", recorded live in 1970. The song would later appear, unedited, on a live album from the same concerts,  Live at the Fillmore East , and credited to Whitten only as author.     [ edit ]   Liner notes   Included with the vinyl release of  Tonight's the Night  was a seemingly strange insert that added to Neil Young's claim that  Tonight's the Night  was the closest he ever came to art. Emphasising the personal nature of the album, the self-penned liner notes contained an apology: ""I'm sorry. You don't know these people. This means nothing to you."" The original inserts/liner notes included in the vinyl release were quite cryptic in their conveyance.   On the front of the insert is a letter to the mysterious ""Waterface"" character, no explanation is given to their identity, although in  Shakey: Neil Young's Biography  by Jimmy McDonough, Young says that ""Waterface is the person writing the letter. When I read the letter, I'm Waterface. It's just a stupid thing - a suicide note without the suicide."" (McDonough).   The back of the insert was equally puzzling, as it appeared in the insert superimposed over the credits to Young's  On the Beach  album, released a year prior. This passage is reportedly the lyrics to an unreleased song titled ""Florida"", referred to in  Shakey  as ""A cockamamie spoken-word dream, set to the shrieking accompaniment of either Young or  (Ben)  Keith drawing a wet finger around the rim of a glass."" (McDonough).   When unfolded, comprising a whole side of the insert was a lengthy article printed entirely in Dutch and is in fact a review of a  Tonight's the Night  live show by Dutch journalist Constant Meijers for the Dutch rock-magazine ""Muziekkrant Oor"". In 1976 Young said he chose to print it ""Because I didn't understand any of it myself, and when someone is so sickened and fucked up as I was then, everything's in Dutch anyway."" Also, Neil Young told Constant Meijers during a week's visit he made to Young's ranch in California, that he chose the article after some Dutch girls who were visiting him translated the story and made him aware of the fact ""that someone on the other end of the world exactly understood what he was trying to say.""   The  Reprise Records  sticker on the vinyl record itself was printed in black and white rather than the standard orange color, a process Young undertook again on the CD label art for 1994's  Sleeps With Angels . Original printings of the sleeve were done on blotter paper which proved quite costly as reprints of the album are no longer printed that way.   Scratched into the run-out grooves on Side One is the message ""Hello Waterface"" while the run-out grooves on Side Two read ""Goodbye Waterface"". The picture of  Roy Orbison  is taken from a  bootleg  tape Young came across and, feeling bad that Orbison most likely did not know the bootleg existed, printed it in the insert for him to see.   In  Shakey: Neil Young's Biography  by Jimmy McDonough, Young maintains that along with the inserts there was a small package of glitter inside the sleeve that was meant to fall out (""Our  Bowie  statement."" (McDonough)), spilling when the listener took the record out. However, both Jimmy McDonough and Joel Bernstein (Young's archivist) have yet to find a copy of Tonight's the Night featuring the glitter package.     [ edit ]   Critical reception   Dave Marsh  wrote in the original  Rolling Stone  review:     ""The music has a feeling of offhand, first-take crudity matched recently only by  Blood on the Tracks , almost as though Young wanted us to miss its ultimate majesty in order to emphasize its ragged edge of desolation. [...] More than any of Young's earlier songs and albums-even the despondent  On the Beach  and the mordant, rancorous  Time Fades Away  --  Tonight's the Night  is preoccupied with death and disaster. [...] There is no sense of retreat, no apology, no excuses offered and no quarter given. If anything, these are the old ideas with a new sense of aggressiveness. The jitteriness of the music, its sloppy, unarranged (but decidedly structured) feeling is clearly calculated.""     In a followup review published ten years later, Marsh wrote:     ""The record chronicles the post-hippie, post-Vietnam demise of counterculture idealism, and a generation's long, slow trickle down the drain through drugs, violence, and twisted sexuality. This is Young's only conceputally cohesive record, and it's a great one.""

[ 1 ]  Thus,  musical  ideas in improvisation are spontaneous, but may be based on chord changes in  Western music . [ 2 ]   Because improvisation is a performative act and depends on instrumental technique, improvisation is a skill. There are musicians who have never improvised and other musicians who have devoted their entire lives to improvisation.

Francesco Landini ,  Adrian Willaert ,  Diego Ortiz ,  Frescobaldi ,  J.S. Bach ,  Handel ,  Mozart ,  Beethoven ,  Chopin ,  Liszt , and many other famous composers and musicians were known especially for their improvisational skills. Improvisation might have played an important role in the monophonic period. The earliest treatises on polyphony, such as the  Musica enchiriadis  (ninth century), make plain that added parts were improvised for centuries before the first notated examples. However, it was only in the fifteenth century that theorists began making a hard distinction between improvised and written music. [ 4 ]  Many classical forms contained sections for improvisation, such as the  cadenza  in  concertos , or the  preludes  to some keyboard suites by Bach and Handel, which consist of elaborations of a progression of chords, which performers are to use as the basis for their improvisation.  Handel ,  Scarlatti , and  Bach  all belonged to a tradition of solo keyboard improvisation that was not limited to variations, but included the concerto form, typically with moving voices in both hands, occasionally exploring fugue.     [ edit ]   Medieval period   Although melodic improvisation was an important factor in European music from the earliest times, the first detailed information on improvisation technique appears in ninth-century treatises instructing singers on how to add another melody to a pre-existent liturgical chant, in a style called  organum . [ 5 ]  Throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance, improvised  counterpoint  over a  cantus firmus  (a practice found both in church music and in popular dance music) constituted a part of every musician's education, and is regarded as the most important kind of unwritten music before the Baroque period. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   Renaissance period   Following the invention of music printing at the beginning of the sixteenth century, there is more detailed documentation of improvisational practice, in the form of published instruction manuals, mainly in Italy. [ 7 ]  In addition to improvising counterpoint over a cantus firmus, singers and instrumentalists improvised melodies over  ostinato  chord patterns, made elaborate embellishments of melodic lines, and invented music extemporaneously without any predetermined schemata. [ 8 ]  Keyboard players likewise performed extempore, freely formed pieces. [ 9 ]     [ edit ]   Baroque period     [ edit ]   Melodic instruments   Eighteenth-century manuals make it clear that performers on the flute, oboe, violin, and other melodic instruments were expected not only to ornament previously composed pieces, but also spontaneously to improvise preludes. [ 10 ]     [ edit ]   Keyboard, lute, and guitar   The pattern of chords in many baroque preludes, for example, can be played on keyboard and guitar over a pedal tone or repeated bass notes. Such progressions can be used in many other structures and contexts, and are still found in Mozart, but most preludes begin with the treble supported by a simple bass.  J.S. Bach , for example, was particularly fond of the sound produced by the dominant seventh harmony played over, i.e., suspended against, the tonic pedal tone. [ 11 ]   There is little or no  Alberti bass  in baroque keyboard music, and instead the accompanying hand supports the moving lines mostly by contrasting them with longer note values, which themselves have a melodic shape and are mostly placed in consonant harmony. This polarity can be reversedanother useful technique for improvisationby changing the longer note values to the right hand and playing moving lines in the left at intervalsor with moving lines in both hands, occasionally. This shift of roles between treble and bass is another definitive characteristic. Finally, in keeping with this polarity, the kind of question and answer which appears in baroque music has the appearance of fugue or canon. This method was a favorite in compositions by  Scarlatti  and  Handel  especially at the beginning of a piece, even when not forming a fugue. [ 12 ]     [ edit ]   Organ improvisation and church music   Improvised accompaniment over a  figured bass  was a common practice during the Baroque era, and to some extent the following periods. Improvisation remains a feature of organ playing in some church services.     [ edit ]   The Classical period     [ edit ]   Keyboard improvisation   Classical music departs from baroque style in that sometimes several voices may move together as  chords  involving both hands, to form brief phrases without any passing tones. Though such motifs were used sparingly by Mozart, they were taken up much more liberally by Beethoven and Schubert. Such chords also appeared to some extent in baroque keyboard music, such as the 3rd movement theme in Bach's  Italian Concerto . But at that time such a chord often appeared only in one clef at a time, (or one hand on the keyboard) and did not form the independent phrases found more in later music. Adorno mentions this movement of the  Italian Concerto  as a more flexible, improvisatory form, in comparison to Mozart, suggesting the gradual diminishment of improvisation well before its decline became obvious. [ 13 ]   The introductory gesture of ""tonic, subdominant, dominant, tonic,"" however, much like its baroque form, continues to appear at the beginning of high-classical and romantic piano pieces (and much other music) as in  Haydn's sonata Hob.16/No. 52  and  Beethoven's sonata opus 78 .   Beethoven and Mozart cultivated mood markings such as  con amore ,  appassionato ,  cantabile , and  expressivo . In fact, it is perhaps because improvisation is spontaneous that it is akin to the communication of love. [ 14 ]     [ edit ]   Mozart and Beethoven   Beethoven and Mozart left excellent examples of what their improvisations were like, in the sets of variations and the sonatas which they published, and in their cadenzas. As a keyboard player, Mozart competed at least once with  Muzio Clementi . [ 15 ]  Beethoven won many tough improvisatory battles over such rivals as  Johann Nepomuk Hummel  and  Joseph Woelfl . [ 16 ]     [ edit ]   Romantic period     [ edit ]   Instrumental   Extemporization, both in the form of introductions to pieces, and links between pieces, continued to be a feature of keyboard concertising until the early 20th-century. Amongst those who practised such improvisation were  Franz Liszt ,  Felix Mendelssohn ,  Anton Rubinstein ,  Paderewski ,  Percy Grainger  and  Pachmann . Improvisation in the area of 'art music' seems to have declined with the growth of recording. [ 17 ]     [ edit ]   Opera   After studying something more than 1,200 early  Verdi  recordings, Will Crutchfield concludes that ""the solo cavatina was the most obvious and enduring locus of soloistic discretion in nineteenth-century opera"".  [ 18 ]  He goes on to identify seven main types of vocal improvisation used by opera singers in this repertory  [ 19 ] :     1. The Verdian full-stop  cadenza   2.  Arias  without full-stop:  ballate ,  canzoni , and  romanze   3. Ornamentation of internal cadences   4. Melodic variants (interpolated hight notes,  acciaccature , rising two-note ""slide"")   5. Strophic variation and the problem of the  cabaletta   6. Facilitations ( puntature , simplification of  fioratura , etc.)   7.  Recitative         [ edit ]   Modern opinions on improvisation in art music     [ edit ]   Theodor Adorno   Toward the end of the section of  Aesthetic Theory  entitled ""Art Beauty"" (in the English edition),  Theodor Adorno  included a brief argument on improvisation's aesthetic value. Claiming that artworks must have a ""thing-character"" through which their spiritual content breaks, Adorno pointed out that the thing-character is in question in the improvised, yet present. [ 20 ]  It may be assumed Adorno meant classical improvisation, not jazz, which he mostly excoriated. He held jazz, for example, to be antithetical to Beethoven. [ 21 ]  There is more extensive treatment, essentially about traditional jazz, in  Prisms  and  The Jargon of Authenticity . [ 22 ]     [ edit ]   Glenn Gould   Improvisation may be pressed to derive something novel from past material, which becomes outmoded through its limited concepts of tonality, form, and variation. Though his understanding of modern music was itself unorthodox,  Glenn Gould  appears to have such a view as he clearly thought musical history was a finite exploration of forms and tonal concepts, and exhaustible. [ 23 ]   Despite these beliefs improvisation formed part of Gould's practicing and even recording, in the music of  Richard Strauss . The crisis of music theory, however, was one of the primary reasons Gould focused on interpretation as an art in studio  recording . In post-baroque music he often found traditional interpretation stale and boring. Gould's technique, which convinced many listeners, became conspicuous in some areas other than Bach and Beethoven. For example, he felt that Mozart could be hackneyed enough, even to cast doubt on the composer's own authority for form and development. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Contemporary improvisation     [ edit ]   Jazz improvisation   Improvisation is one of the basic tenets of jazz. Typically in a jazz piece, the "" head "" (the song's melody along with any backing harmony) is played once by the musicians and often repeated. Improvisation by any of the musicians follows, and this is typically the longest section of a song as each musician improvises their own melody over the harmonic and rhythmic foundation of the head. When the end of the head is reached it is repeated and a solo's length is specified by the number of repetitions of the head necessary. After one musician has finished improvising, another will begin, and no instrument is forbidden from improvising. A repetition of the head will usually end a jazz piece. There are many variations to this pattern; new sections can be added before and after the head, two musicians can alternatively improvise for short amounts of time (known as ""trading""), or several musicians can improvise in a group (collective improvisation is common in  Dixieland  jazz). [ citation needed ]   Many varied scales and their  modes  can be used in improvisation. These mainly depend on the nature of the harmonic framework. Against a C Minor seventh chord, for example, an improvisor would usually have a choice of using C Dorian, C Aeolian ( C natural minor), C blues, and others, depending on the situation and personal taste. Chord changes are very important in jazz improvisation as well. Whole solos can be built around chord tones. [ citation needed ]   In the  bebop  era of jazz in the early 1950s there was a common theme of urgency and technical proficiency. The modal era of jazz moved the harmonic framework for a piece from the fast, dynamic chord progressions of bebop to more static, relaxed chords with longer durations.  Free jazz  performers eschew the explicit harmonic framework for improvisation; the harmony in free jazz is less rigid and less traditional. [ citation needed ]   Illinois Jacquet , for example, is best known for a single solo on the tune  Flying Home , and such solos are often transcribed. They are often not written down in the process, but they help musicians practice the jazz idiom.  Charlie Parker 's improvisations were distinctive, helping to shape the bebop period. Though it is helpful to transcribe on one's own, Parker's solos are often studied in a published collection known as the Omni Book, and groups such as  Supersax  arrange his solos with their own harmonic backing. [ citation needed ]  Another example of a musician who improvises on solo piano is  Keith Jarrett  (see e.g. The Kln Concert ).   Improvisors like  Say  and  Montero  gravitate towards jazz and a fusion with classical music. [ citation needed ]     [ edit ]   Contemporary classical music   While the first half of the twentieth century is marked by an almost total absence of actual improvisation in art music, [ 24 ]  since the 1950s, some contemporary composers have placed fewer restrictions on the improvising performer, using techniques such as vague notation (for example, indicating only that a certain number of notes must sound within a defined period of time). New Music ensembles formed around improvisation were founded, such as the  Scratch Orchestra  in England;  Musica Elettronica Viva  in Italy;  Lukas Foss 's  Improvisation Chamber Ensemble  at the University of California, Los Angeles;  Larry Austin 's  New Music Ensemble  at the University of California, Davis; the  ONCE Group  at Ann Arbor; the  Sonic Arts Group ; and  Sonics , the latter three funding themselves through concerts, tours, and grants. Significant pieces include Foss's  Time Cycles  (1960) and  Echoi  (1963). [ 25 ]   Other composers working with improvisation include  Richard Barrett ,  Pierre Boulez ,  Cornelius Cardew ,  Alvin Curran ,  Stuart Dempster ,  Hugh Davies ,  Karlheinz Essl ,  Vinko Globokar ,  Stephen Nachmanovitch ,  Pauline Oliveros ,  Terry Riley ,  Frederic Rzewski ,  Karlheinz Stockhausen ,  Richard Teitelbaum ,  Christian Wolff ,  Vangelis ,  La Monte Young ,  John Zorn  and  Yitzhak Yedid .   Several pianists also teach classical improvisation and perform, such as David Dolan, [ 26 ]  William Goldstein, [ 27 ]   Yitzhak Yedid  and Eric Barnhill.

Gould was quoting  Albert Schweitzer  on the first fugue, but felt this description apt for the final fugue. In a 1959 filmed interview, either in  Glenn Gould: Off the Record  or  Glenn Gould: On the Record , Gould had also lamented the end of the common practice period. He illustrated his opinion with a  thought experiment , arguing that a child raised with only atonal music would eventually show an original interest in tonality. Koenig & Kroitor 1959a or 1959b.
