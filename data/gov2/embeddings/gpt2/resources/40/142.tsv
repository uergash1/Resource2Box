The patentability of inventions under U.S. law is determined by the Patent          and Trademark Office (USPTO) in the Department of Commerce. A patent application          is judged on four criteria. The invention must be ""useful"" in a practical          sense (the inventor must identify some useful purpose for it), ""novel""          (i.e., not known or used before the filing), and ""nonobvious"" (i.e., not          an improvement easily made by someone trained in the relevant area). The          invention also must be described in sufficient detail to enable one skilled          in the field to use it for the stated purpose (sometimes called the ""enablement""          criterion).          In general, raw products of nature are not patentable. DNA products usually          become patentable when they have been isolated, purified, or modified          to produce a unique form not found in nature.          The USPTO has 3 years to issue a patent. In Europe, the timeframe is          18 months. The USPTO is adopting a similar system. Patents are good for          20 years from filing date.         In the United States, patent priority is based on the ""first to invent""          principle: whoever made the invention first (and can prove it) is awarded          property rights for the 20-year period. Inventors have a one-year grace          period to file after they publish. All other countries except the Philippines,          however, follow a ""first inventor to file"" rule in establishing priority          when granting patents.          Many biotech patents have been applied for as provisional patents. This          means that persons or companies filing the provisional patent application          have up to one year to file their actual patent claim. The provisional          patent must contain a written description of said invention and the names          of the inventors. This one-year grace period does not count as one of          the 20 years that the patent is issued for.         When a biotechnology patent involving an altered product of nature is          issued, the patent holder is required to deposit a sample of the new invention          into one of the 26 worldwide culture depositories. Most DNA-related patents          are issued by the USPTO, the European Patent Office, or the Japanese Patent          Office.         Currently over three million genome-related patent applications have          been filed. U.S. patent applications are confidential until a patent is          issued, so determining which sequences are the subject of patent applications          is impossible. Those who use sequences from public databases today risk          facing a future injunction if those sequences turn out to be patented          by a private company on the basis of previously filed patent applications.                  Patenting Genes, Gene Fragments, SNPS,          Gene Tests, Proteins, and Stem Cells         In terms of genetics , inventors must           (1) identify novel genetic sequences,           (2) specify the sequence's product,           (3) specify how the product functions in nature --ie, its use           (4) enable one skilled in the field to use the sequence for its stated          purpose         Genes and Gene Fragments            USPTO has issued a few patents for gene fragments. Full sequence and function          often are not known for gene fragments. On pending applications, their          utility has been identified by such vague definitions as providing scientific          probes to help find a gene or another EST or to help map a chromosome.          Questions have arisen over the issue of when, from discovery to development          into useful products, exclusive right to genes could be claimed.          The 300- to 500-base gene fragments, called expressed sequence tags          (ESTs), represent only 10 to 30% of the average cDNA, and the genomic          genes are often 10 to 20 times larger than the cDNA. A cDNA molecule is          a laboratory-made version of a gene that contains only its information-rich          (exon) regions; these molecules provide a way for genome researchers to          fast-forward through the genome to biologically important areas. The original          chromosomal locations and biological functions of the full genes identified          by ESTs are unknown in most cases.          Patent applications for such gene fragments have sparked controversy          among scientists, many of whom have urged the USPTO not to grant broad          patents in this early stage of human genome research to applicants who          have neither characterized the genes nor determined their functions and          uses.          In December 1999, the USPTO issued stiffer interim guidelines (made          final in January 2001) stating that more usefulness—specifically          how the product functions in nature—must now be shown before gene          fragments are considered patentable. The new  rules           call for ""specific and substantial utility that is credible,"" but some          still feel the rules are too lax.          The patenting of gene fragments is controversial. Some say that patenting          such discoveries is inappropriate because the effort to find any given          EST is small compared with the work of isolating and characterizing a          gene and gene product, finding out what it does, and developing a commercial          product. They feel that allowing holders of such ""gatekeeper"" patents          to exercise undue control over the commercial fruits of genome research          would be unfair. Similarly, allowing multiple patents on different parts          of the same genome sequence --say on a gene fragment, the gene, and the          protein-- adds undue costs to the researcher who wants to examine the          sequence. Not only does the researcher have to pay each patent holder          via licensing for the opportunity to study the sequence, he also has to          pay his own staff to research the different patents and determine which          are applicable to the area of the genome he wants to study.         SNPs          Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are DNA sequence variations that          occur when a single nucleotide (A,T,C,or G) in the genome sequence is          altered. For example a SNP might change the DNA sequence AAGGCTAA to ATGGCTAA.          SNPs occur every 100 to 1000 bases along the 3-billion-base human genome.          SNPs can occur in both coding (gene) and noncoding regions of the genome.          Many SNPs have no effect on cell function, but scientists believe others          could predispose people to disease or influence their response to a drug.          Variations in DNA sequence can have a major impact on how humans respond          to disease; environmental insults such as bacteria, viruses, toxins, and          chemicals; and drugs and other therapies. This makes SNPs of great value          for biomedical research and for developing pharmaceutical products or          medical diagnostics. Scientists believe SNP maps will help them identify          the multiple genes associated with such complex diseases as cancer, diabetes,          vascular disease, and some forms of mental illness. These associations          are difficult to establish with conventional gene-hunting methods because          a single altered gene may make only a small contribution to the disease.          In April 1999, ten large pharmaceutical companies and the U.K. Wellcome          Trust philanthropy announced the establishment of a non-profit foundation          to find and map 300,000 common SNPs (they found 1.8 million). Their goal          was to generate a widely accepted, high-quality, extensive, publicly available          map using SNPs as markers evenly distributed throughout the human genome.          The consortium plans to patent all the SNPs found but will enforce the          patents only to prevent others from patenting the same information. Information          found by the consortium is being made freely available.         Gene Tests          As disease genes are found, complementary gene tests are developed to          screen for the gene in humans who suspect they may be at risk for developing          the disease. These tests are usually patented and licensed by the owners          of the disease gene patent. Royalties are due the patent holder each time          the tests are administered, and only licensed entities can conduct the          tests.         Proteins           Proteins do the work of the cell. A complete set of genetic information          is contained in each cell. This information provides a specific set of          instructions to the body. The body carries out these instructions via          proteins. Genes encode proteins.          All living organisms are composed largely of proteins, which have three          main cellular functions: to provide cell structure and be involved in          cell signaling and cell communication functions. Enzymes are proteins.          Proteins are important to researchers because they are the links between          genes and pharmaceutical development. They indicate which genes are expressed          or are being used. Important for understanding gene function, proteins          also have unique shapes or structures. Understanding these structures          and how potential pharmaceuticals will bind to them is a key element in          drug design.         Stem Cells          Therapeutic cloning, also called ""embryo cloning"" or ""cloning          for biomedical research,"" is the production of human embryos for          use in research. The goal of this process is not to create cloned human          beings but rather to harvest stem cells that can be used to study human          development and treat disease. Stem cells are important to biomedical          researchers because they can be used to generate virtually any type of          specialized cell in the human body. See the  Cloning           page for more information on therapeutic and other types of cloning.         Cell lines and genetically modified single-cell organisms are considered          patentable material. One of the earliest cases involving the patentability          of single-cell organisms was Diamond v. Chakrabarty in 1980, in which          the Supreme Court ruled that genetically modified bacteria were patentable.         Patents for stem cells from monkeys and other organisms already have          been issued. Therefore, based on past court rulings, human embryonic stem          cells are technically patentable. A lot of social and legal controversy          has developed in response to the potential patentability of human stem          cells. A major concern is that patents for human stem cells and human          cloning techniques violate the principle against the ownership of human          beings. In the U.S. patent system, patents are granted based on existing          technical patent criteria. Ethical concerns have not influenced this process          in the past, but, the stem cell debate may change this. It will be interesting          to see how patent law regarding stem cell research will play out. (1)                       Why patent?           Research scientists who work in public institutions often are troubled          by the concept of intellectual property because their norms tell them          that science will advance more rapidly if researchers enjoy free access          to knowledge. By contrast, the law of intellectual property rests on an          assumption that, without exclusive rights, no one will be willing to invest          in research and development (R&D).          Patenting provides a strategy for protecting inventions without secrecy.          A patent grants the right to exclude others from making, using, and selling          the invention for a limited term, 20 years from application filing date          in most of the world. To get a patent, an inventor must disclose the invention          fully so as to enable others to make and use it. Within the realm of industrial          research, the patent system promotes more disclosure than would occur          if secrecy were the only means of excluding competitors. This is less          clear in the case of public-sector research, which typically is published          with or without patent protection.          The argument for patenting public-sector inventions is a variation on          the standard justification for patents in commercial settings. The argument          is that postinvention development costs typically far exceed preinvention          research outlays, and firms are unwilling to make this substantial investment          without protection from competition. Patents thus facilitate transfer          of technology to the private sector by providing exclusive rights to preserve          the profit incentives of innovating firms. Patents are generally considered          to be very positive. In the case of genetic patenting, it is the scope          and number of claims that has generated controversy.           What are some of the potential arguments for          gene patenting?                    Researchers are rewarded for their discoveries and can use monies            gained from patenting to further their research                        The investment of resources is encouraged by providing a monopoly            to the inventor and prohibiting competitors from making, using, or selling            the invention without a license.                        Wasteful duplication of effort is prevented.                         Research is forced into new, unexplored areas.                        Secrecy is reduced and all researchers are ensured access to the new            invention.                         What are some of the potential arguments against gene          patenting?                     Patents of partial and uncharacterized cDNA sequences will reward            those who make routine discoveries but penalize those who determine            biological function or application (inappropriate reward given to the            easiest step in the process).                        Patents could impede the development of diagnostics and therapeutics            by third parties because of the costs associated with using patented            research data.                        Patent stacking (allowing a single genomic sequence to be patented            in several ways such as an EST, a gene, and a SNP) may discourage product            development because of high royalty costs owed to all patent owners            of that sequence; these are costs that will likely be passed on to the            consumer.                        Because patent applications remain secret until granted, companies            may work on developing a product only to find that new patents have            been granted along the way, with unexpected licensing costs and possible            infringement penalties.                        Costs increase not only for paying for patent licensing but also for            determining what patents apply and who has rights to downstream products.                        Patent holders are being allowed to patent a part of nature --a basic            constituent of life; this allows one organism to own all or part of            another organism.                        Private biotechs who own certain patents can monopolize certain gene            test markets.                        Patent filings are replacing journal articles as places for public            disclosure --reducing the body of knowledge in the literature.                   What does U.S. patent policy say about gene patenting?                    1980 Diamond v. Chakrabarty              Prior to 1980, life forms were considered a part of nature and were            not patentable.  Diamond v. Chakrabarty changed this with the 5            to 4 U.S. Supreme Court decision that genetically engineered (modified)            bacteria were patentable because they did not occur naturally in nature.            In this case, Chakrabarty had modified a bacteria to create an oil-dissolving            bioengineered microbe.                        Since Diamond v. Chakrabarty, patents have been issued on whole genes            whose function is known. More recently, inventors began to seek patents            on sequences of DNA that were less than a whole gene. The Patent Office            is developing guidelines on how to deal with these fragments since they            often do not have a known function.                        Some patents have been granted for fragments of DNA. That presents            the problem of someone trying to patent a larger fragment or gene that            contains the already patented sequence. Questions have been raised as            to whether the second inventor will need to obtain a license from the            first or whether he can obtain the patent without the first patent holder's            permission. These types of questions are likely to arise in the near            future and will most likely be resolved in courts designated to hear            patent actions.                        Patents have been prohibited by Congress in only a few cases where            the issuance of a patent was contrary to the public interest.             An example of this was the prohibition of patents on nuclear weapons.             The American Medical Association has made a similar request against            the patenting of medical and surgical procedures.                        U.S. House of Representatives Oversight Hearing on "" Gene            Patents and Other Genomic Inventions "" Thursday, July 13, 2000. Related             HGN article .                        Representative Lynn Rivers  introduced             the following two bills addressing the increasingly troublesome effects            of human gene patenting to the 107th Congress. No action has yet been            taken on these bills.                           Genomic Research and Diagnostic Accessibility Act of 2002 ( H.R.                3967 )               Genomic Science and Technology Innovation Act of 2002 ( H.R.                3966 )                               How does genome information placed in the public          domain work? Who can use it?           All genome sequence generated by the Human Genome Project has been deposited          into GenBank, a public database freely accessible by anyone with a connection          to the Internet. For an introduction on how to search GenBank and other          nucleotide databases at the National Center of Biotechnology Information,          see the  Gene          and Protein Database Guide  and a related  tutorial           available at  Gene          Gateway , an online guide to learning about genes, proteins, and disorders.          Disseminating information in the public domain encourages widespread          use of information, minimizes transaction costs, and makes R&D cheaper          and faster. Of particular relevance to research science, a vigorous public          domain can supply a meeting place for people, information, and ideas that          might not find each other in the course of more organized, licensed encounters.          Information in the public domain is accessible to users who otherwise          would be priced out of the market.

BACKGROUND Because of the stereoselectivity of enzymes such as aldolases that participate in the metabolism of carbohydrates, it is extremely difficult to design and make new carbohydrates that can be used to study carbohydrate metabolism. There is a need for such synthetic compounds for use as experimental tools in elucidating the molecular character of the numerous and varied pathways involved in carbohydrate anabolism and catabolism. Of particular relevance to the present invention is the sugar, N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc) or sialic acid. NeuAc is an integral component of most cells and is believed to play a major role in imparting electrical charge characteristics to such cells. Further, NeuAc-like 3   Appeal No. 1996-1959 Application No. 07/946,546 compounds such as the eight and nine -carbon sugar moieties KDO and KDN are major constituents of non-mammalian tissues. N-Acetylneuraminic Acid (NeuAc) aldolase, also commonly referred to as sialic acid aldolase is a type I aldolase known to form an enamine intermediate with pyruvate, which reversibly reacts with the second substrate N-acetylmannosamine to give NeuAc... Neu-Ac aldolase is known to accept many aldoses as acceptor substrates. In all previously known aldol condensation reactions with such acceptor substrates, the eneamine [sic] intermediate approaches the si face of the incoming aldehyde substrate to form a new stereogenic center of S configuration.... Based on such current knowledge concerning aldolase stereoselectivity, therefore, NeuAc aldolase is considered to be useful for only the production of S -sugars having S configuration. As is disclosed hereinafter, NeuAc aldolase has now unexpectedly been found to be capable of the production of certain ketoaldonic acids having a formed stereogenic center of R configuration. Specification, page 2, line 26 to page 3, line 35. N-Acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc) aldolase, is known to accept many aldoses as acceptor substrates to form stereogenic centers of S configuration. Despite the recognized stereoselectivity of NeuAc aldolase, Appellants have found that it is possible to produce ketoaldonic acids having a formed stereogenic center of R configuration when NeuAc aldolase catalyzes the condensation of pyruvate and certain five or six carbon L -configured acceptor substrate aldoses (Id., page 4 and page 9, lines 7 -14). The compounds of the present claims have a formed stereogenic center of R configuration created by the re attack of pyruvate on the 4   Appeal No. 1996-1959 Application No. 07/946,546 acceptor substrate. This is in contrast to previously known aldol condensation reactions using NeuAc aldolase where: the attack is on the si face of the acceptor substrate and the resulting condensation product has a formed stereogenic center of S configuration. See e.g., Auge et al., New J. Chem., 12:733 (1988); Auge et al., Tetrahedron, 46:201 (1990); and Kim et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 110:6481 (1988). Id., page 8, lines 21-27. DISCUSSION Anticipation The rejections of claim 6 under 35 U.S.C. 102(b) will be addressed together, because Schreiner's compound 5e and Schrell's compound 3 are identical. The Examiner argues that compound 5e in Scheme 3 of Schreiner (page 583) and compound 3 disclosed by Schrell (page 1111) illustrate the acid form of the compound designated Formula VIII of the present claim (Examiner's Answer, page 6, bottom, to the top of page 7). The Examiner points to Schreiner, page 583, column 1, lines 28-30 and argues that the dehydrogenated form of formula 5e was known in the art. According to the Examiner, the scheme depicted on page 1111 in Schrell also indicates that ""[d]ehydrogenation of ketoaldonic acid compounds was previously known in this art,"" Id., page 7, first full paragraph. In the Supplemental  5   Appeal No. 1996-1959 Application No. 07/946,546 Answer, page 3, line 13 through page 4, line 4, the Examiner reiterates her p osition that the cited prior art anticipates claim 6 because both references disclose dehydrogenated forms of ketoaldonic acids. Appellants argue that the compounds of the cited prior art and of claim 6, are isomers, ""but not merely optical isomers"" (Brief, page 2, bottom). At page 4 of the Brief, Appellants illustrate the claimed compound (VIIIa, on the left) and the prior art compound (3a, on the right). Comparison of substituent groups at a number of carbon atoms of these compounds reveals that they a re in opposite configuration, (I or J). This observation is summarized in the table found at the bottom of page 4 of the Brief. The Reply Brief, page 6, discusses the same point, and illustrates an alternative chair form of compound of VIII (VIIIb) in which the oxygen is placed in the same position as the oxygen of the compound taught by both Schreiner and Schrell to allow easier comparison between the two formulae. Comparing the substituents of VIIIb and 5e, again, Appellants argue that at a number of carbon atoms, the substituents occupy different positions in the two molecules. The discussion at page 4 of the Reply Brief respecting Exhibits 1 and 3 (which illustrate the conventional nomenclature and numbering of carbohydrates) addresses the significanc e of the positioning of substituents: [t]hose structures represent glucose as compared to galactose, mannose, idose, allose, altrose, talose, or gulose because of the projections of the hydroxyls above or below the plane of the depicted ring. In galactose, 6   Appeal No. 1996-1959 Application No. 07/946,546 the 4-position hydroxyl is up rather than down, where as in mannose, the 2 position hydroxyl is up rather than down, with all of the other hydroxyls maintaining the their same configurations relative to the plane of the ring.....by using ring structural formulas, workers of less than ordinary skill in the art can know the identity of a sugar, and one can identify a single sugar from among the 32 possible optical and anomeric isomers for a given C6H12O6 sugar. Appellants argue that the compound taught by Schreiner and Schrell differs from the compound of claim 6 with respect to the position of the substituent at a number of carbon atoms on the ring. According to the Appellants, just as glucose is different from galactose and mannose (by virtue of the positioning of the hydroxyl substituents), so too is the claimed compound different from that taught by the cited art. The Examiner does not come to grips with Appellants' argument, either in the Answer or in the Supplemental Answer. Rather, the Examiner steadfastly maintains her position that the compound of the claim and that of the prior art are the same. The Examiner appears to ignore Appellants' exhibits, documenting conventional numbering and nomenclature for carbohydrates (sugars, in particular). In the face of Appellants' detailed comparison between the claimed compound and the prior art compound, including a discussion on the fundamentals of carbohydrate structure and nomenclature, we find that the Examiner's position is untenable.  7   Appeal No. 1996-1959 Application No. 07/946,546 As stated in Verdegaal Bros. v. Union Oil Co. of California, 814 F.2d 628, 631, 2 USPQ2d 1051, 1053 (Fed.

In addition, ""...elements must be arranged as required by the claim"" (In re Bond , 910 F.2d 831, 832, 15 USPQ2d 1566, 1567 (Fed. Cir. 1990). That is not the case here. On the contrary, the Examiner has not established that Schreiner or Schrell teaches the same compound recited in claim 6. The Examiner has not established a prima facie case of anticipation and, accordingly, the rejection of claim 6 under 35 U.S.C.  102(b) as described by either Schreiner or Schrell is reversed. Obviousness The Examiner rejected claims 3 -6, 10-14 and 16 under 35 U.S.C.  103(a) over the combination of Schreiner and Schrell: Schreiner et al show the acid form of the compound designated Formula VIII in instant claim 6 and instant claim 10...Schreiner et al also show a comparable method for the synthesis of the ketoaldonic acids. Note page 581-583. Further, Schreiner et al teach a method for the preparation of nonulosonic acid. Note pages 581 and 583. Thus, Schreiner et al substantially teach the present invention except for showing each compound and process step claimed...Regarding the compounds designated as Formulae V, VI, VII and IX described in instant claims 3 -5 and 16, Schrell et al show closely analogous compounds that can contain suitable substituents, viz., ""Ac""....With respect to instant process claims 11-15, Schrell et al show comparable process or method steps for the synthesis of closely analogous ketoaldonic acid compounds...Therefore it would have been obvious...to provide the ketoaldonic acid compounds d escribed in the present invention 8   Appeal No. 1996-1959 Application No. 07/946,546 along with the process for preparing these ketoaldonic acid compounds because to modify the conventional ketoaldonic acid compounds shown by Schreiner et al and Schrell et al through dehydrogenation in order to obtain the desired compounds claimed was suggested earlier since Schreiner et al teach that comparison of the rate of hydrogenation in ketoaldonic isomers was previously known in this art and the Schrell et al teaching implies that the dehydrogenated form of the keto aldonic compounds were also known in this art. Answer, pages 4 -6. The Examiner does not explain, however, why the method steps of the references are considered ""comparable"" to the methods of the present claims. It appears that this rejection stems from the Examiner's unwavering (and incorrect) position that the compound illustrated by Schreiner and Schrell (designated 5e and 3, respectively) is merely an acid form of the compound of Formula VIII (Claim 6). That position is incorrect, for the reasons already discussed. Further, the Examiner does not explain how the combined teachings of the references would have led the ordinary artisan to the specific compounds of claims 3 -6 and 16, but simply opines that Schrell teaches compounds that are ""analogous"" to those of the present claims (Answer, first complete sentence, page 5 and the sentence bridging pages 4 and 5 of the Supplemental Answer). With respect to method claims 10-14, the Examiner does not point to any portion or portions of the cited references disclosing or suggesting the limitations of those claims. Neither Schreiner nor Schrell teaches enzymatic (biochemical) 9   Appeal No. 1996-1959 Application No. 07/946,546 reactions comprising pyruvate, NeuAc aldolase (sialic acid aldolase) and specific acceptor substrates. Neither reference teaches that the conventional stereoselectivity of NeuAc aldolase (sialic acid aldolase) can be ""overridden"" by use of specific acceptor substrates, resulting in aldol condensation products (ketoaldonic acids) with formed stereogenic centers of R configuration. The refore, it is not clear how, and the Examiner has not explained how, the combination of references would lead the ordinary artisan to the claimed methods involving pyruvate, sialic acid aldolase and specific acceptor substrates. Accordingly, we reverse the rejection of claims 3 -6, 10-14 and 16 over the combination of Schreiner and Schrell. In conclusion, we reverse the rejection of claim 6 under 35 U.S.C.  102(b) as anticipated by Schreiner; the rejection of claim 6 under 35 U.S.C.  102(b) as being anticipated by Schrell; and the rejection of claims 3 -6, 10-14 and 16 under 35 U.S.C.  103(a) as unpatentable over Schreiner in combination with Schrell. The Examiner's decision is reversed. REVERSE  SHERMAN D.

THE INVENTION Appellants claim a fuel composition which includes a liquid petroleum fuel and an oil soluble dispersant comprising an oil soluble reaction product of a recited hydrocarbyl 1   Appeal No. 1998-1213 Application 08/450,506  substituted C4 to C  10  dicarboxylic acid producing material and Claim 27 is illustrative and  a specified basic reactant. reads as follows:  27. A fuel composition comprising (i) a liquid petroleum fuel and (ii) an oil soluble dispersant comprising an oil soluble reaction product of a reaction mixture comprising: (a) a hydrocarbyl substituted C4 to C10 dicarboxylic acid producing material formed by reacting olefin polymer of C2 to C10 monoolefin having a number average molecular weight of about 1500 to 5,000 and a C4 to C10 monounsaturated acid material, wherein the substituted material has a functionality ratio of from about 1.05 to 1.25 dicarboxylic acid producing moieties per molecule of said olefin polymer used in the reaction; and a basic reactant selected from the group consisting of polyamine, polyhydric alcohol, amino alcohol and mixtures thereof. THE REFERENCE Meinhardt et al. (Meinhardt) 1980 4,234,435 Nov. 18,  (b)  THE REJECTION Claims 27, 30-33 and 56-69 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C.  102(b) as being anticipated by Meinhardt. OPINION  2   Appeal No. 1998-1213 Application 08/450,506  We have carefully considered all of the arguments advanced by appellants and the examiner and agree with appellants that the aforementioned rejection is not well founded. reverse this rejection. Accordingly, we  In order for a claimed invention to be anticipated under 35 U.S.C.  102(b), all of the elements of the claim must be found in one reference. See Scripps Clinic & Research Found.  v. Genentech Inc., 927 F.2d 1565, 1576, 18 USPQ2d 1001, 1010 (Fed. Cir. 1991). Appellants' claims require a fuel composition which includes an oil soluble reaction product of the recited dicarboxylic acid producing material and basic reactant. examiner argues that Meinhardt teaches that the acylating reagent itself, i.e., the dicarboxylic acid producing material, can be used as an additive for lubricant and fuel compositions (col. 19, lines 53-55), and that Meinhardt teaches at column 44, lines 61-64 that the acylating reagents The  3   Appeal No. 1998-1213 Application 08/450,506  can be reacted with polyamines and/or polyhydric alcohols. The portion of the reference relied upon by the examiner for the second of these teachings, however, pertains to mineral oils (col. 44, line 61 - col. 45, line 10). The examiner has  provided no evidence that one of ordinary skill in the art would have interpreted the term ""mineral oils"" to include fuels. Moreover, throughout the reference, Meinhardt refers  to the reaction products of the acylating reagents and polyamines  and/or polyhydric alcohols as being additives for lubricants. Consequently, we find that the examiner has not carried the burden of establishing a prima facie case of anticipation of appellants' claimed invention over Meinhardt. Also, for the following additional reason, we find that a prima facie case of anticipation has not been established by the examiner. Appellants' claims require that the hydrocarbyl substituted dicarboxylic acid producing material has a  4   Appeal No. 1998-1213 Application 08/450,506  functionality ratio of from about 1.05 to 1.25 dicarboxylic acid producing moieties per molecule of olefin polymer used in the reaction. The ""used in the reaction"" phrase indicates  that the functionality ratio is based on the total of both the reacted and unreacted polyolefin (specification, page 8, lines 17-22). Meinhardt's acylating agent has within its structure  an average of at least 1.3 succinic groups for each equivalent weight of substituent group, wherein the substituent group is derived from a polyalkylene (col. 3, lines 52-61; col. 4, lines 18-20). Appellants argue that Meinhardt's ratio, like appellants' ratio, is a functionality ratio, rather than being a succination  ratio, and is different in quantity than appellants' functionality ratio (brief, pages 5-6). A succination ratio  differs from appellants' functionality ratio in that the succination ratio is based upon only the reacted polymer, i.e., that which is substituted with succinic groups (brief,  5   Appeal No. 1998-1213 Application 08/450,506  page 5).1  Thus, a succination ratio is equal to the  functionality ratio if all of the polymer reacts, and otherwise is greater than the functionality ratio (brief, page 6). To decide the issue of anticipation we need not make a finding as to which ratio Meinhardt discloses because, first, if Meinhardt's ratio is a functionality ratio, it is different in quantity than that recited in appellants' claims and, therefore, Meinhardt does not anticipate appellants' claimed invention. Second, even if Meinhardt discloses a succination  ratio, it would not be possible to calculate the corresponding functionality ratio because there is no disclosure in Meinhardt of the fraction of the polymer which is substituted with succinic groups. Thus,  it would not be possible to determine whether Meinhardt anticipates appellants' claimed invention. The formulas for calculating a functionality ratio and a succination ratio are shown in appellants' brief (pages 5-6). 6 1   Appeal No. 1998-1213 Application 08/450,506  The examiner appears to argue that 1) Meinhardt's examples upon which appellants' calculated functionality ratios of 1.55 to 1.69 (brief, page 5) are based have polyolefin:dibasic acid ratios of about 1:2, 2) Meinhardt teaches that the polyalkylene:acidic reactant ratio can be at least 1:1.5 (col. 17, lines 28-30), 3) multiplying, say, appellants' calculated 1.64 functionality ratio by 1.5/2 gives 1.23, which falls within appellants' recited functionality ratio range of about 1.05 to 1.25, and 4) therefore, Meinhardt anticipates appellants' claimed invention (answer, page 5). This argument is based upon functionality ratio, which is calculated using the formula on page 5 of appellants' brief, being directly proportional to charge ratio regardless of composition, and the examiner has not established this relationship. The examiner, therefore, has not shown that  each limitation of the invention recited in any of appellants' claims is disclosed in a single reference. Consequently, the  examiner has not established a prima facie case of anticipation of appellants' claimed invention.  7   Appeal No. 1998-1213 Application 08/450,506  DECISION The rejection of claims 27, 30-33 and 56-69 under 35 U.S.C.  102(b) as being anticipated by Meinhardt is reversed.

If this warning appears, select either No or No to All to ensure that other applications continue to function properly.  User Manual for ePAVE 5.1 New Utility Page 12 of 110   NOTE: If users remove files that are shared by other programs during uninstallation, their system may not function properly. Leaving shared files on the computer will not harm the system. After completing the uninstallation of the older version of ePAVE, install ePAVE 5.1. Special Installation Circumstances Networked Computers  ePAVE can be used with Internet connections on a network and with networked machines. In order to install ePAVE or some of its components, users will be required to have local administrator privileges. If users are unsure if they have these privileges, it is best to contact Information Technology staff. The installation program will offer a prompt during the installation process to indicate that local administrator privileges are required for installation.  Administrator Privilege dialogue box  Although it is possible to use ePAVE in a network environment, users should carefully consider its effect on file management. In a networked environment, application files created in ePAVE must reside in network storage that is mapped to all machines that are working with ePAVE using the same naming convention. All files should be in a dedicated folder for two reasons: to allow common access to the files from any PC on the network and to allow EFS to locate, attach, and bundle the files within the application during the final assembly of the submission into a package. EFS stores all files from a single application together, based on their pathname. Thus, once the files have been stored, their location should not be changed. Multiple Computers  The installation of ePAVE is subject to license agreements that set forth the terms to allow installation on one or more computers. In order for ePAVE to upload an electronic submission properly, a digital certificate file must be transferred. Users may obtain a high level digital certificates in a two-step process by requesting reference information from the USPTO and creating the certificates with the USPTO's Direct Security software after receiving access codes. A low-level digital certificate is built in to ePAVE and may be used for new utility and provisional submissions only.  User Manual for ePAVE 5.1 New Utility Page 13 of 110   There is no need to reinstall USPTO Direct on multiple machines because users may transfer their profile and the digital certificate file to a computer that will be used to file the patent application submission. What is ePAVE? What is EFS? EFS is designed around a common submission engine that presents data collection screens to the user to collect patent application information and create electronic patent application forms in eXtensible Markup Language (XML). The submission engine is a desktop software program called EFS electronic Packaging and Validation Engine (ePAVE). In addition to providing electronic forms, ePAVE allows the user to attach a tagged, structured specification document that includes links to applicable figure image files. Other patent application documents, such as a declaration or a power of attorney, may attached as scanned single-page tiff image files or included as XML documents. EFS electronic Packaging and Validation Engine (ePAVE) desktop software enables patent applicants and appointed practitioners to conduct real time electronic filing of select new utility and provisional patent applications. EFS also allows user to file four types of subsequent filings over the Internet. These subsequent file types are select pre-grant publication submissions; information disclosure statements for pending applications, assignment documents for previously filed applications and patents, and submission of amino acid or nucleotide sequence listings required during prosecution of a pending biotechnology patent application. Who may use EFS?  The USPTO authorizes select individuals to use EFS to file patent applications electronically. These authorized individuals include inventors, attorneys of record or otherwise registered, agents of record or otherwise registered, assignees of record of the entire interest, and assignees of record of an undivided part interest. For more information see 37 C.F.R. 1.33(b). Application Types Allowed  EFS allows submission of six filing types: new utility and provisional patent applications, pregrant publication submissions, information disclosure statements and biosequence listings for pending patent applications, and assignment recordation documents for previously filed patent applications and patents. To use EFS software to submit pre-grant publication filings, please refer to pre-grant publication regulations 37 CFR, Sections 1.211-1.221, for a full description of the process and legal requirements. A biosequence listing in computer readable form (CRF) may be included with a new utility or provisional application. Alternatively, if you have a pending utility patent application that requires a nucleotide or amino acid sequence submission, you may file the biosequence listing as a separate follow-on filing. The submission software accepts ASCII Sequence Listing files created by a sequence listing authoring tool, PatentIn (as well as accommodating ASCII Sequence listing files created by other standard methods or editors). Refer to 37 CFR 1.824. The  User Manual for ePAVE 5.1 New Utility Page 14 of 110   sequence listing shall be submitted in American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) text. No other formats are accepted. For new utility, provisional, and pre-grant publication submissions, the user must first create a specification document as an Extensible Mark-up Language (XML) tagged electronic document. The user may then use ePAVE submission software to attach and send the application specification with any figures to USPTO along with other patent application forms and files. Using ePAVE submission software users may: author XML documents such as fee transmittal or application data sheet; attach electronic documents and image files in specified formats; and validate the completeness of the submission based on patent business rules. The ePAVE program automatically bundles, compresses, and digitally signs the submission package once the applicant or appointed practitioner enters an electronic signature and digital certificate authentication information. Using the digital certificate, the software automatically establishes a Secure Socket Layer encrypted session with the USPTO server and transmits the package to the USPTO. An acknowledgement receipt is displayed in real time at the filer's desktop after the submission package is received and validated at the USPTO without error.  SECTION 5: Key Steps in the Electronic Filing Process The following procedure outlines the steps that must be completed in order for you to file a patent application electronically via EFS. Step 1: Install ePAVE  Install the ePAVE tool. Step 2: Obtain a PKI digital certificate  According to 35 U.S.C. Section 122 USPTO must maintain patent applications in confidence. In order to comply with this law, the USPTO distributes software that supports secure communication among the USPTO, applicants, and practitioners. As a result, the USPTO has implemented several electronic commerce projects that promote secure communications, including instituting rules to protect applicants when they file patent applications electronically and providing electronic access to pending patent applications to authorized persons via the Patent Application Information Retrieval (PAIR) system. USPTO has implemented public key infrastructure technology to provide the security of these systems. A PKI digital certificate is necessary to ensure the security of the electronic transmission of patent applications and is used to establish a Secure Socket Layer connection with the USPTO server for secure transmission of patent application information. When filing a new utility or provisional patent application, users may use the low-level digital certificate that is built in to ePAVE. The low-level digital certificate is compatible with the public key infrastructure that is implemented by the USPTO and allows secure communications  User Manual for ePAVE 5.1 New Utility Page 15 of 110   between applicants and the USPTO. Low-level digital certificates may only be used to file new utility and provisional submissions. High-level digital certificates issued by the USPTO require an approval process. USPTO will also provide a version of Entrust Direct security software that is custom-made for the USPTO and is used to create the high-level digital certificate. Entrust Direct is compatible with the public key infrastructure that is implemented by the USPTO and enables secure communications among individual applicants, practitioners, and the USPTO. Note: Obtaining a high level PKI certificate is recommended. It can be used to access application information in private PAIR and allows all six filing types to be submitted. To find out how to obtain a PKI digital certificate, please contact the Electronic Business Center (EBC) for patents. Step 3: Format all files  Any patent application that is submitted to the USPTO via EFS must meet certain formatting requirements.  File Names File names are limited to 25 characters and must be alphanumeric. The hyphen and period characters can be used in file names. The USPTO recommends using the 8.3 file-naming convention when naming files that will be used with ePAVE. This convention allows for file name to contain up to eight characters for the name of the file itself and three characters for the file extension and requires both components to be separated by a period. Here is an example of a file name that complies with the 8.3 file-naming convention: newfile1.doc. Allowable characters in file and folder names include letters, numbers, hyphens (-), and periods (.). Special characters should not be included in file names, such as ampersands (&), commas (,), number signs (#), quotation marks (""), and spaces ( ). It is imperative that special characters not be used because they will cause errors that may affect the transmission of the patent application. In naming the ePAVE folder that contains the submission files, the folder name must be different than the names of any other files or figures that are included in the submission.  Images Since images are an integral part of patent applications, they must meet strict requirements before being submitted as part of a patent application. The USPTO has established the following requirements for images that apply to any patent application that is filed electronically. All images must be scanned or converted into TIFF images and comply with the following format: a resolution of 300x300 dpi, black and white only, compressed with the CCITT Group 4  User Manual for ePAVE 5.1 New Utility Page 16 of 110   Compression or uncompressed, and a maximum size of 8  by requirements apply to the following types of images: Inline graphics (including complex chemical structures, custom characters) Drawings (figures)  It is recommended that one Figure tiff file.

SECTION 6: Using ePAVE 5.1 Introduction  The ePAVE submission engine is used to create a patent application (also referred to as a package), view and print it, validate it, and send it electronically to the USPTO. Updating EFS Submission Program (ePAVE)  The USPTO will periodically release new versions of the ePAVE software. When this occurs, users will need to update the ePAVE software. In order to ensure that the most current version of ePAVE is running, ePAVE automatically provides the option to check the version each time ePAVE is launched.  EPAVE Version Verification  Select Yes to automatically launch an Internet connection and connect to the USPTO server. If the installed version on your machine is not the most recent, check the USPTO website at http://www.uspto.gov/ebc/efs/index.html to determine if a new version is available.  User Manual for ePAVE 5.1 New Utility Page 17 of 110   If you receive the following error message after clicking Yes, your version of ePAVE is not the most current. Select OK on the Version error screen and go to the EFS website at www.uspto.gov to download the latest ePAVE software. You may also obtain updated versions of the five EFS User Manuals from this site.  Version Error screen  Select No on the Version Verification screen to launch ePAVE software without checking for the most recent version. After selecting No, a new submission may be created. After beginning the upload process, the ePAVE software will automatically check the version. If the installed version is not the most recent, check the USPTO website at http://www.uspto.gov/ebc/efs/index.html to determine if a new version is available.  Disable or Re-enable Version Checking at Startup  If you want to disable ePAVE's automatic version checking on startup, you may deselect it from the View menu. Click the Enable Version Check (at Start) to toggle it on and off. The check mark indicates that version checking at startup is active, and is not shown once you disable this feature.

Forms may also be printed by highlighting the form in the Attach Files to Project screen and selecting View. Print the form by right clicking and selecting Print or by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + P. Filing Large Submissions Using Compact Discs  If a user attempts to file a submission that exceeds the EFS system limit of 100 Megabytes, ePAVE generates an error message and advises the user to submit the large application on a compact disc (CD or CD-R). Submissions larger than 100MB cannot be submitted via the Internet. If a large biotechnology sequence listing, table, or computer program listing is causing the large application size, these items may be submitted with the application according to the  User Manual for ePAVE 5.1 New Utility Page 25 of 110   requirements of 37 C.F.R. 1.52 (e) with the large section on CD and the rest in paper. However, regardless of the cause of the large size of the submission, EFS can be used to file the application on CD. The process requires a compact disc recorder, and can only be used for submissions that fit on a single compact disc.  Before Saving to CD Before saving the zip files and sending the CD to USPTO, verify that all image files are compressed. If the application figure images are not compressed, the images can be compressed using various image editors. Use the following procedure to compress application figure images:    Remove the specification XML document from the attachments in ePAVE. Open one of the images in an image-viewing tool. Specify the following settings for the image: File type: TIFF Color: Black & White Compression: CCITT Group 4 Resolution: 300x300 dpi Save the image. If the tiff image problem is caused by a declaration, power of attorney, or assignment tiff image file, do the following: Open the image in an image-viewing tool. Specify the following settings for the image: File type: TIFF Color: Black & White Compression: CCITT Group 4 Resolution: 300x300 dpi Save the image.         Saving a Submission on CD If the submission is still larger than 100 MB after compressing image files, use the following procedure to submit packages larger that 100MB on CD:  Print out the Transmittal Form from the Attach Files to Project screen by selecting the file including the suffix pkgdata.  User Manual for ePAVE 5.1 New Utility Page 26 of 110      Copy the submission folder that contains the entire application from the workstation to compact disc-recordable (CD-R) media. Wrap the CD in a hard case within a padded protective mailing envelope, and attach a copy of the transmittal form. Enclose a cover letter explaining that the submission contains an application that was too large to be submitted via the Internet. See 37 CFR 1.52 for more information on providing compact discs to USPTO. Hand carry or mail the CD-R and a copy of the paper transmittal form and cover letter to the USPTO. The submission may also be deposited with the US Postal Service under the Express Mail procedures of 37 CFR  1.10. Keep a copy of the CD and transmittal form for your records.      Once the USPTO receives the CD in the mailroom, the date of receipt is recorded and the submission is uploaded to the EFS server, where the files are unzipped. The application files will then be processed as EFS submissions and an acknowledgement receipt will be mailed. If the files contain large tables, sequence listings or computer program listings, the USPTO has the option of not printing the large files, but rather burning two CD-Rs of such data and treating them under the CD practice of 37 CFR 1.52(e). If the file is an amino acid/ nucleotide sequence listing, then one additional copy of such a sequence listing will be created and sent to Scientific and Technology Information Center as the Computer Readable Form of the sequence listing. In any case, one CD is placed in the file, and one is put in the CD repository. USPTO Office of Initial Patent Examination's Electronic Application Review Office processes payment by credit card or deposit account in the same manner as an on-line submission. The files provided on CD are signed, so the patent application data is protected during mailing and any storage time at the USPTO.

BAIRD _____________ Appeal No. 96-1990 Application 07/536,910 ______________ ON BRIEF _______________ Before BARRETT, LEE and CARMICHAEL, Administrative Patent Judges. LEE, Administrative Patent Judge. DECISION ON APPEAL This is a decision on appeal under 35 U.S.C.  134 from the examiner's final rejection of claims 6-34, 36-38, and 40-41. claim has been allowed. Reference relied on by the Examiner Leung et al. (Leung), ""A Distortion Model for Chinese Character Generation,"" IEEE 1985 Proceedings of the International Conference on Cybernetics and Society, Tucson, Arizona, November No 1  1  Application for patent filed June 12, 1990.  1   Appeal No. 96-1990 Application 07/536,910  12-15, 1985, pp. 38-41. The Rejections on Appeal Claims 6-34, 36-38 and 40-41 stand finally rejected under 35 U.S.C.  103 as being unpatentable over Leung. The Invention The invention is directed to a method and apparatus for generating defective pixel representations of character images and also to a method and apparatus for using the generated defective pixel representations to infer or train an optical image classifier. The classifier should recognize the intended  character despite defective pixel representations of the same. A user can select one or more defective class parameters each of which specifies a corresponding class of defective pixel representation. A set of defective pixel representations is  generated which belongs to the defect class specified by the user selected defect class parameters. Representative claims 6 and 20 are reproduced below: 6. A method of generating examples of defective pixel representations of symbols comprising the steps of: receiving one or more defect class parameters selected by a user from a plurality thereof, each defect class parameter specifying a class of pixel representation defects; 2   Appeal No. 96-1990 Application 07/536,910  receiving a set of one or more model symbols; and  generating a set of defective pixel representations of the symbols from the set of model symbols in response to the defect class parameters, the defective pixel representations including pixel representation defects belonging to the defect classes specified by the defect class parameters. 20. Apparatus for generating examples of defective pixel representations of symbols comprising: means for receiving a set of one or more defect class parameters selected by a user of the apparatus from a plurality thereof, each defect class parameter specifying a class of pixel representation defects; a set of one or more model symbols; and representations response to the representations to the classes means for making a set of defective pixel of the symbols from the set of model symbols in defect class parameters, the defective pixel including pixel representation defects belonging specified by the defect class parameters.  Independent claims 34 and 38 are similar to claims 6 and 20 insofar as the generation of defective pixel representations are concerned. However, claims 34 and 38 further use the defective  pixel representations to ""infer"" a classifier. Opinion We do not sustain the rejection of claims 6-34, 36-38 and  3   Appeal No. 96-1990 Application 07/536,910  40-41. All of the independent claims require the generation of defective pixel representations according to particular userselectable classes of pixel representation defects. Specifically, one or more defect class parameters selected by a user from among a plurality of defect class parameters is received whereby each defect class parameter specifies a corresponding class of pixel representation defects. A set of  defective pixel representations is generated wherein the pixel representation defects are those belonging to the defect class or classes specified by the defect class parameters. In this  manner, the set of defective pixel representations to be generated can be specifically tailored to user-selectable classes of pixel representation defects. We reject the appellant's argument that Leung ""has nothing whatever to do with pixel representations"" (Br. at 8). Variations in the slope of the strokes of Chinese characters and in the size of various subparts of the same Chinese characters yield pixel representation defects as compared to the model or perfect Chinese characters. As is explained in the Background  portion of the appellant's specification (at 1), defective pixel representations can come from many sources, including dirt or 4   Appeal No. 96-1990 Application 07/536,910  folds on the paper, skewed positioning of the printing paper, or even the optics of the scanning process. In such light, there is  no reason to exclude poor handwriting as a source of defective pixel representation. Claim terms are properly construed  according to their broadest reasonable interpretation consistent with the specification. In re Zletz, 893 F.2d 319, 321, 13  USPQ2d 1320, 1322 (Fed. Cir. 1989); In re Yamamoto, 740 F.2d 1569, 1571, 222 USPQ 934, 936 (Fed. Cir. 1984); In re Pearson, 494 F.2d 1399, 1404, 181 USPQ 641, 645 (CCPA 1974); In re Prater, 415 F.2d 1393, 1404, 162 USPQ 541, 550 (CCPA 1969). The appellant's main argument is correct, however, that ""Leung generates defective characters for only a single class of defects, namely those resulting from variations in handwriting"" (Br. at 8). While it is true that Leung discusses two types of  handwriting variations, i.e., one resulting from different slopes for the same stroke in a Chinese character and the other resulting from different sizes for the same subparts of a Chinese character, Leung does not disclose or reasonably suggest generating different handwriting samples based on only one of the two types of variations. In Leung, the user does not select any  particular class of defective pixel representations and the system does not receive any defect class parameter. 5 Rather, the   Appeal No. 96-1990 Application 07/536,910  set of generated samples always includes defects arising from the two types of predetermined handwriting variations, the slope of strokes and the size of subparts of characters. The appellant  correctly states (Br. at 8) that ""Leung cannot and does not permit the user to provide parameters which specify classes of  defects and thereby to define his own model for the defects."" (Emphasis in original.) We reject the examiner's statement (answer at 4) that ""[A]lthough the `user' does not explicitly specify a `set of one or more defect class parameters', some `defect class parameters' are implicitly specified because of the imperfect nature of handwriting."" We agree with the appellant that model symbols  inputted by a user are not defect class parameters specifying particular classes of defects. The imperfect nature of  handwriting is a basis to conclude that the model symbols are not perfect but is no reason to conclude that the symbols are defect class parameters specifying particular classes of defects. In short, in Leung the class of defective pixel representation to be embodied in the set of generated samples is predetermined and also fixed. Shearing operations are performed  to simulate different slopes in strokes and warping operations 6   Appeal No. 96-1990 Application 07/536,910  are performed to simulate different relative sizes in the subpatterns of a character (Leung, pp. 38-39). Both shearing and  warping operations are performed no matter what the model symbols are. Leung, alone, would not have reasonably suggested the  inputting of user selected defect class parameters and the generation of defective pixel representations according to the defect classes specified by the inputted defect class parameters. We agree with the appellant (Br. at 10) that the claimed invention permits the user to define his or her own defect model and to generate defective pixel representations corresponding to the defined model by selecting from among a number of defect classes. Leung, on the other hand, does not disclose or suggest  user-selection of particular defect classes to tailor or customize the output pixel representations to the desired or preferred defect classes. For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the rejection of claims 6-34, 36-38 and 40-41 under 35 U.S.C.  103 as being unpatentable over Leung.  7   Appeal No. 96-1990 Application 07/536,910  Conclusion The rejection of claims 6-34, 36-38, and 40-41 under 35 U.S.C.  103 as being unpatentable over Leung is reversed.

                                              d. pool-change means for adding a pool-change temporary variable to said pool, then evaluating said pool and if said pool                         is negative subtracting said pool from said pool-change and setting said pool to zero;                                               e. pot calculation means for setting a pot change equal to said pool-change, then setting said pot-change equal to said pot-change                         multiplied by said pot multiplier and divided by said pot divisor, storing any remainder from the division into a pot remainder                         temporary variable;                                               f. pot accumulator means for adding said pot remainder to said pot remainder accumulator and evaluating said pot remainder                         accumulator, then if said pot remainder accumulator is negative repeatedly subtracting one from said pot change and adding                         said pot divisor to said pot remainder accumulator until said pot remainder accumulator becomes positive;                                               g. pot remainder means for comparing said pot remainder accumulator to said pot divisor and if said pot remainder accumulator                         is greater than said pot divisor, repeatedly adding one to said pot change and subtracting said pot divisor from said pot                         remainder accumulator until said pot remainder accumulator is less than said pot divisor;                                               h. pot additive means for adding said pot change to said pot and if new value in said pot is a negative value, repeatedly                         adding one to said pot and subtracting said pot divisor from said pot remainder accumulator until said pot is positive;                                               i. pot zero means for determining that said paypot is associated with an active said zeropot and that said paypot has insufficient                         said credits according to a threshold paypot parameter, then adding a portion of said zeropot to said paypot and reducing                         said zeropot by same said portion of said zeropot;                                               j. pot change means for determining that an associated pot is active for said pool and that said pool-change is other than                         zero, then processing said pool-change for said associated pot by operating said pot percentage means, said pot calculation                         means, said pot accumulator means, said pot remainder means, said pot additive means and said pot zero means;                                               k. format means for acquiring a plurality of data according to prespecified requirements, then formatting said data into a                         data packet;                                               l. data means for detecting any changes to said data, then calling said format means to format said pool, said pot, said pot                         multiplier, said pot divisor and said pot remainder accumulator;                                               m. display means for calling said data means, then displaying said data packet;                         n. pot final means for repeatedly operating said pot change means until all active said pot associated with said pool have                         been processed, then operating said display means;

Rogan to Leave USPTO in Early 2004                  James E. Rogan , Under Secretary                  of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the U.S.                  Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), has announced that he intends                  to leave his post on  January 9, 2004 . Under                  Rogan's direction, the USPTO has improved in every aspect of                  its operations. Early in his tenure Rogan, who has headed the                  agency since December 2001, launched a five-year 21st Century                  Strategic Plan that is revolutionizing the U.S. patent and trademark                  systems. The House Commerce, State, Justice and Judiciary Appropriations                  Subcommittee report for USPTO’s 2004 budget notes that “this                  plan calls for some of the most sweeping changes to the patent                  review process in 200 years and the committee supports these                  recommendations.”              During his two short years at the helm of the USPTO, Rogan changed             the culture of the agency by making quality, not the time it takes             to get a patent, the hallmark of its work. The USPTO now has an extensive             program of quality-based initiatives, including new programs certifying             that current and prospective patent examiners and managers, as well             patent attorneys and agents, have the requisite knowledge, skills,             and abilities to produce top quality examination results. Rogan also             established a comprehensive quality assurance program for patents             and trademarks that mandates quality reviews throughout the examination             process.                  >>                 Read more ...                                                                 >>  More news     and notices ...                                                                                                        21st                   Century                     Strategic Plan                                                                                                                                                                 About                               USPTO                             Contact us                             How to...

Projects generate new knowledge about how to apply underlying                    scientific principles to develop products or processes. If the                    technology is commercially successful, it provides the basis                    for products or processes that can be marketed. And with commercial                    success and dissemination of the newly gained knowledge comes                    the possibility of benefiting the economy in ways that go beyond                    the benefits received directly by the innovating firm.                                              Parties Other than                the Innovator Can Benefit               If a project creates and disseminates                new technical knowledge, parties other than the developers tend                to benefit. That is true even if the new knowledge takes the form                of ""We tried to develop this technology using the following approaches,                and we were unsuccessful."" In that case, others may use this information                to avoid pursuing comparable methods that would likely be wasteful.                Or an underlying technology may be successfully developed even though                a larger commercialization goal is not met.                 New knowledge developed in a project                can be diffused in a variety of ways. One way, discussed in the                next section, is the marketing of new goods or services. Other ways                relevant to the 38 completed ATP projects are publication by the                U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) of patents granted; registration                of copyrights; interactions among research partners, suppliers,                customers and others; preparation of technical papers that are published                or presented at conferences; distribution of nonproprietary project                descriptions by government funding agencies; and project-related                workshops and meetings.                 Public Disclosure                of Patent Filing Information               When applying for a patent, an inventor                must explicitly describe the invention. Because patent law requires                that the invention be both novel and useful, the inventor must demonstrate                that the invention is essentially different from any other invention                and must describe how it can be used. When an application is filed,                the USPTO discloses neither the application nor the fact that it                has been filed. But when the USPTO grants a patent, the full application                text describing how the invention may be used and how it is related                to other technologies is put into the public record.                 The decision to seek patent protection                for intellectual property is influenced by many factors, including                the ease with which others can copy the property's intellectual                content and the difficulty of defending a patent position from infringers.                Some companies, therefore, may decide that patent protection is                not worth its expense, or they may decide that a strategy of trade                secrets and speed to market is a more effective strategy. Or patents                may be filed at an earlier stage in the process and trade secrets                used in later stages.                 The importance of patents as a strategy                to protect intellectual property varies among technology fields.                In some, particularly computer software, patenting is rarely a viable                option. Among the six projects that involve only software, no patents                have been granted and only one patent was sought.                 In other fields patents are important,                and many were sought for technologies that emerged from ATP projects.                American Superconductor, for example, has received six patents for                its ATP-funded electric-motor technology and has eight applications                still under consideration.                 Even when patent protection is sought,                there are substantial differences across industries in the lag time                between patent application and grant. Consequently, the absence                of patents at this time does not imply that patents will not be                granted in the future. An application may have been filed but the                patent not yet granted.                               In yet other fields, patenting typically                occurs at the very early stages of a project, when the basic ideas                are forming. The consequences of this fact might show an ATP-funded                project without patent activity, because the ATP funding comes after                the very early stages of the R&D efforts.                 Even with all these considerations,                patent statistics contain useful information about technology development                and dissemination of the new knowledge. Fifteen of the projects                have thus far been granted patents, with a total of 50 patents granted                to them.                 Figure 4  displays                the number of projects which had different numbers of patent grants.                Three projects each produced five or more patents. Two projects                each produced four patents. Fifteen projects each produced at least                one patent. For 23 projects, more than half, no patents have yet                been granted.                                                    Click on image for                  large scale version.                                                                                  For some projects, applications for                patents have been filed but the patents have not yet been granted.                The delay can be caused by a number of factors, such as the technology                area and extent of review by the Patent and Trademark Office, among                others.  Figure 5  presents data for patent                applications filed but not yet granted for the 38 completed ATP                projects. For 12 projects, patent applications have been filed but                patents have not yet been granted. The total number of outstanding                patent applications is 51 for the 12 projects.                   (11)  Three projects                have five or more applications outstanding. For 26 projects, about                two-thirds of the 38, there are no patent applications outstanding.                                                                   Click on image for                  large scale version.                                                                                  Eight of the 12 projects which have                patent filings not yet granted are among the 15 projects which have                already received patent grants; four of the 12 projects that have                one or more outstanding patents applications have not already been                granted patents. Thus, 19 of the 38 projects, or 50%, have engaged                in patent activity for technologies developed with the ATP funding.                                Copyrights and Registration                for Software               The U.S. copyright system, also administered                by the USPTO, works somewhat like the patent system but with important                differences. A writer or other creator of a work or expression has                an inherent copyright. The creator may register the copyright with                the USPTO for added protection. For technology creations, protection                via copyright is not as useful as patent protection. So when patenting                is an option, it is usually chosen over copyright registration.                                Registration of copyrights would seem                to be important for ATP projects that generate computer software                applications. Though six of the projects primarily entailed software                technology, copyrights were not registered for any of them. In one                case, however, the company is considering such a move to better                protect its intellectual property.                 Technology Transfer                to Partners and Customers               If it conducts a project alone, a company                can maintain a high level of secrecy about its technology. It may,                however, develop technology in conjunction with three general classes                of collaborators: joint venture members, subcontractors or informal                partners. If it does so, it frequently shares technological information                with these collaborators. In addition, the collaboration may be                involve several types of partners: companies, universities, national                laboratories, or non-profit organizations.                 Providing a precise tabulation of collaborations                across the classes and types of partners is difficult because of                the many ways in which collaboration may be accomplished. Using                a fairly broad definition of collaboration, it appears that for                slightly more than half of the 38 projects, there was collaboration                with one or more other companies. The next most prominent type of                partner was the university, with about half of the projects involving                one or more universities in the research and development effort.                Government laboratories and non-profit organizations were each involved                in less than a sixth of the projects.                 For about two-thirds of the projects,                there was an explicit arrangement for collaboration for at least                one of the types of partners described above. In addition, some                of the other projects had collaborative arrangements of a more informal                nature that were not captured in the tabulation of research-related                collaborations.                 For the vast majority of new technologies,                successful development and commercialization requires the inventor                to also secure the participation of companies beyond those involved                in the research. Some will be suppliers of inputs to the production                process. Some will be partners in production. Others will be potential                users and distributors of the new products or processes derived                from the technology.                 Disclosure in Technical                Presentations and Publications               Much technology is disseminated via                the publication of papers in technical and professional journals.                Through publication, the knowledge gained by participants in an                ATP project is passed on to others outside the project. These recipients                of the knowledge may then use it commercially. Publication of research                findings is therefore frequently delayed until patents or some other                kind of protection for the intellectual property has been secured.                                Table 4 summarizes information about                technical papers generated by the 38 projects. At least sixteen                of the projects yielded publications (where the existence of publications                is unknown, the project is counted in the ""0 or unknown"" line in                the table), and five projects produced more than ten publications                each.

Such is the case with the ATP/company                cost-sharing partnerships. Nonproprietary information has been disclosed                to the public for each of the 431 projects funded by the ATP through                1998. The project information is available on the ATP web site on                the Internet ( http://jazz.nist.gov/atpcf/prjbriefs/listmaker.cfm ),                and new nonproprietary project descriptions are added to the site                as new awards are made.                 ATP Workshops               To help the public learn more about                the projects it funds, the ATP organizes and sponsors numerous public                workshops, where companies present nonconfidential aspects of their                ATP-funded research and engage in open discussions. These workshops                facilitate information flow in several directions - among awardee                companies and from them to other companies, ATP project managers,                other government program managers, the press, potential investors,                and universities.                 Knowledge Gained From                Product Use or Examination               When a good or service that incorporates                new technology is delivered, the buyer often will be able to learn                a great deal about the technology. The mere functioning of a new                product will reveal some information about the technology. Intentional                investigation into how the product works will reveal more. Taking                it apart, sometimes called reverse engineering, will reveal even                more. For 24 of the 38 projects reviewed for this study, some commercial                products or processes based on the ATP-funded technology are already                on the market, where through use or examination they are providing                others with information about the new technologies.

SABB __________ Appeal No. 94-2100 Application 07/902,109 __________ ON BRIEF __________ Before GRON, PAK and ELLIS, Administrative Patent Judges. ELLIS, Administrative Patent Judge. DECISION ON APPEAL This is an appeal from the final rejection of claims 1, 2, 5, 8 and 10, all the claims pending in the application. Claim 1 1  Application for patent filed June 22, 1992. According to the appellant, this application is a division of Application 07/794,227, filed November 19, 1991, now U.S. Patent 5,149,815, issued September 22, 1992, which is a division of Application 07/692,743, filed April 29, 1991, now U.S. Patent 5,093,333, issued March 3, 1992. 1  1   Appeal No. 94-2100 Application 07/902,109  is illustrative of the subject matter on appeal and reads as follows:  1.  A compound of the formula I  wherein R1 is H, alkyl or cycloalkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms; R2 is H, alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, cyano, halo, nitro, amino or mono or dialkylamino in which the alkyl groups have 1 to 6 carbon atoms; R3 is H or alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms; n is 1 to 5 and R4 and R5 taken with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached are a piperazin-1-yl moiety in the 4-position of which is H, alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms or unsubstituted or substituted pyrimidinyl, pyridinyl, or pyrazinyl wherein the substituents are alkyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, alkoxyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, halo, cyano, nitro or trifluoromethyl or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate thereof. 2   Appeal No. 94-2100 Application 07/902,109  A reference relied on by the appellant is: Molchan, et al. (Molchan), ""Increased Cognitive Sensitivity to Scopolamine With Age and a Perspective on the Scopolamine Model,"" Brain Research Reviews, vol. 17, pp. 215-226 (1992). Claims 1, 2, 5, 8 and 10 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C.  112, first paragraph, as being based on a non-enabling disclosure. We reverse. The examiner argues that the specification fails ""to positively assert that the claimed compounds have utility."" Answer, p. 3. According to the examiner, ""the evidence presented  [in the specification] is not sufficient to demonstrate that the claimed compounds possess actual utility in currently available form."" Id.  Although it appears that the rejection is based on the issue of whether the claims have a practical utility, a  101 issue, the rejection in the Answer, and throughout prosecution of the application, has been under the first paragraph of  112. Therefore, our consideration of the issues is limited to whether the specification would have enabled one skilled in the art to ""make and use"" the claimed compositions; i.e, whether the specification satisfies the requirements of  112, first paragraph. 3   Appeal No. 94-2100 Application 07/902,109  To that end we point out that the specification is presumed to be ""in compliance with the enablement requirement of  112, first paragraph, unless there is reason to doubt the objective truth of the statements contained therein."" F.2d 220, 223, 169 USPQ 367, 369 (CCPA 1971). In re Marzocchi, 439 It is well  established that when making a rejection under  112, the examiner has the burden of presenting adequate reasons as to why the specification would not have enabled a person skilled in the art to make and use the full scope of the claimed invention. re Angstadt, 537 F.2d 498, 502, 190 USPQ 214, 217 (CCPA 1976). Turning to the specification, we find that it states that, based on the in vitro and in vivo data disclosed therein, the claimed compositions are selective for central [nervous system] cholinergic M1 receptors and are able to reverse scopolamine-induced hyperactivity and to improve scopolamine-induced amnesia in the radial arm maze in rats. Compounds having this activity may be useful for treatment of diseases involving hypofunction of the cortical cholinergic system [Specification, p. 2, lines 29-33]. Absent reasons or evidence to the contrary, the presumption is that this teaching, in conjunction with the rest of the specification which includes the methods of making the claimed compositions and the assays described in Examples 1 through 13, is sufficient to satisfy the enablement requirement of 35 U.S.C. 4 In   Appeal No. 94-2100 Application 07/902,109   112, first paragraph.  However, in the case before us, we do  not find that the examiner has provided a single reason as to why one skilled in the art would have doubted the truth of these statements or why the specification would not have enabled such person to ""use"" the claimed compositions. As we understand it, the examiner's actual position is that the specification would not have enabled one skilled in the art to use the claimed compositions to cure Alzheimer's disease. However, such is not the utility asserted by the specification in the quoted section above. Rather, the quote only suggests that  the claimed compositions, having the demonstrated utility of reversing scopolamine-induced hyperactivity and improving scopolamine-induced amnesia in rats, may be useful for treating diseases involving hypofunction of the cortical cholinergic system. With respect to Alzheimer's disease, the specification  states that in view of the effectiveness of the tested compositions on M1 receptors of the central nervous system, that ""selective compounds may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of disease states in which cholinergic disfunction is apparent, such as senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type. where in the specification, is it alleged that the claimed compounds are to be used exclusively for the cure, or treatment, 5 No   Appeal No. 94-2100 Application 07/902,109  of Alzheimer's.  Thus, there is no need for the specification to  positively demonstrate the successful treatment of Alzheimer's patients in order to satisfy the enablement requirement of  112, first paragraph. The examiner's contends that ""scopolamine induced amnesia is only a screening test which screening test is deemed insufficient to employ [sic, comply?] with the statute."" Answer, p. 3.  Here, it appears that the examiner is questioning the relevance of the disclosed in vitro and in vivo screening assays with respect to the ability of the present compositions to treat Alzheimer's. Again, however, the examiner has not provided any  reasons as to why the results of the screening tests do not correlate with the suggested utility of treating ""diseases involving hypofunction of the cortical cholinergic system,"" or with the treatment of Alzheimer's. 32-33. Specification, p. 2, lines  Moreover, we point out that the Federal Circuit recently  addressed the issue of enablement with regard to screening assays in animals. In In re Brana, 51 F.3d 1560, 1567, 34 USPQ2d 1436,  1442 (Fed. Cir. 1995), the court stated that proof of an alleged pharmaceutical by statistically significant tests experimental animals is sufficient re Krimmel, 292 F.2d 948, 953, 130 1961); see also In re Bergel, 292 6 property for a compound with standard to establish utility. In USPQ 215, 219 (CCPA F.2d 958, 130 USPQ 205   Appeal No. 94-2100 Application 07/902,109  (CCPA 1961). In concluding that similar in vivo tests were adequate proof of utility the court in In re Krimmel stated: We hold as we do because it is our firm conviction that one has taught the public that a compound exhibits some desirable pharmaceutical property in a standard experimental animal has made a significant and useful contribution to the art, even though it may eventually appear that the compound is without value in the treatment of humans. And FDA approval, however, is not a prerequisite for finding a compound useful within the meaning of patent laws. Scott, 34 F.3d 1058, 1063, 32 USPQ2d 1115, 1120. Usefulness in patent law, and in particular in the context of pharmaceutical inventions, necessarily includes the expectation of further research and development. The stage at which an invention in this field becomes useful is well before it is ready to be administered to humans. Here, we find that the appellant has provided evidence that the screening assays which were employed to test the claimed compositions were performed using standard experimental animal models. See the Molchan publication. We note that Molchan  recognizes that the scopolamine model has limitations, however, contrary to the examiner's assertion, we do not find that such acknowledgment in any way suggests that the models be discarded or the results obtained therefrom, disregarded. Rather, the  Molchan studies indicate that the effects of scopolamine are age dependent. We direct attention to the concluding statements on  p. 224 of Molchan (first complete paragraph) that 7   Appeal No. 94-2100 Application 07/902,109  older subjects were significantly more impaired than the younger by scopolamine on some tests of learning and memory. This increased sensitivity of the older group to scopolamine is consistent with studies in animals and humans showing decreased cholinergic system function with age. The findings also indicate that age is an important variable to consider in using the scopolamine model of memory impairment. Thus, absent evidence to the contrary, we hold that the appellant's specification would have enabled one skilled in the art to ""make and use"" the claimed compositions at the time the application was filed. Accordingly, decision of the examiner is reversed. REVERSED  TEDDY S. GRON Administrative Patent Judge  CHUNG K.
