GX233-95-8328018	"CONDIT HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT FERC NO. 2342  REMOVAL PLAN SUMMARY INTRODUCTION Parties to the Condit Hydroelectric Project Settlement Agreement (""Settlement Agreement"") reached agreement on a proposed removal plan for Condit Dam and demolition and removal of all Condit Hydroelectric Project (""Project"") facilities with the exception of the Project's powerhouse. The proposed removal plan described as the ""Selected Approach"" in the Condit Hydroelectric :Project Removal Summary Report (May 1998) submitted to the Commission in 1998 as supplemented by removal activities and cost modifications listed in the Cost Removal Worksheet, a copy of which is attached hereto, collectively are the ""Removal Plan."" This document, the ""Removal Plan Summary,"" describes the basic elements of the proposed Removal Plan and includes a schedule of the removal activities. The demolition and removal of Condit Dam and other Project facilities, except for the Project powerhouse, are estimated to take one (1) year. In accordance with the Settlement Agreement, PacifiCorp's contribution to planning, engineering, design, mobilization, demobilization, construction and demolition costs for Project removal in accordance with the Removal Plan shall not exceed $13,650,000 (1999 dollars). In the event of any conflict between this Removal Plan Summary and the Settlement Agreement or the Removal Plan, the Settlement Agreement and the Removal Plan shall control.  Removal Plan Summary Page - 1   The method for Project removal agreed upon in the Settlement Agreement was not reviewed in the Commission's October 1996 Final Environmental Impact Statement. The Settlement Agreement contemplates that before the Commission takes final action on PacifiCorp's application for the Amended License that the Commission needs to prepare a supplement to the October 1996 Final Environmental Impact Statement, engage in consultation as appropriate under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, and take other actions as appropriate. REMOVAL PLAN ELEMENTS Dam Removal. The removal of Condit Dam would be accomplished by excavating a drain tunnel through the concrete base of the dam to rapidly drain the reservoir and to allow the dam to be removed in quarried blocks of concrete using conventional construction techniques. The drain tunnel is to be 12 feet high by 18 feet wide and would be excavated using drilling and explosives at the base of the dam, at elevation 174. The tunnel size is capable of passing 10,000 cfs. Concrete excavated from the tunnel would be transported to a spoil area adjacent to the dam by trucks that are loaded by a rough-terrain crane. An access road would be constructed to the existing spillway apron deck. The last 15 feet of the tunnel would be drilled and blasted, allowing the reservoir and impounded sediments to be sluiced through the tunnel, lowering the reservoir to stream level in about 6 hours. Prior to this final tunnel blast, a barge mounted clamshell crane would be floated in front of the dam to excavate sediment and debris from the area in front of the projected tunnel hole-through. When the area has been sufficiently cleaned out, the crane and barge would be  Removal Plan Summary Page - 2   removed from the reservoir and the final tunnel blast would be detonated to drain the reservoir. Should the tunnel plug with woody reservoir debris, measures will be taken to clear the jam. To allow anadromous fish to pass the site during the dismantling of the dam, a series of protective fish pockets would be excavated in each of the walls of the tunnel to allow a place for fish to rest during their passage upstream. Concrete excavation of the dam would proceed in the dry and start at the East End of the dam. Using drilling and explosives, concrete blocks with dimensions of 10 feet high by 4 feet deep by 6 feet wide would be removed with a highline yarder-type system to trucks for transport to the spoil area. The block size was selected to minimize the cost of excavation and hoist capacity, which would require average lifts of about 33,600 lbs. Construction would proceed across the dam in a series of top slicing cuts at ten-foot vertical intervals. The (very top cut and the front and back faces of the dam in each cut would be drilled and blasted into blocks and loaded into trucks with an excavator and hauled off the dam. As the top slice cuts progress downward and the dam widens, the center section would be drilled and blasted into rubble much like a highway rock cut excavation. The concrete rubble would be loaded into trucks with an excavator and hauled off the dam. This procedure would significantly decrease the cost of concrete demolition. As the top slice cuts across the top of the dam progress downwards below elevation 225, the existing river channel gets narrow and steep. At this point a crane would be set up on the spillway slab to hoist concrete from this lower area. As the excavation reaches the level of the drain tunnel, the center portion of the area adjacent to the tunnel would be excavated down to bedrock leaving sections of intact concrete along the edge of the tunnel and along the front and back faces of the dam to hold the water out. When the center section is completely excavated to Removal Plan Summary Page - 3   bedrock, the edge sections are blasted into blocks and hoisted out of the river channel. This should put the river down to its original channel. Lastly, the area around the drain tunnel is excavated in a similar method. This work must be scheduled during low river flows in order to perform a good job of removing the concrete from the footprint of the dam in this lower section. An earlier proposal for Project removal called for a gate to be fitted to the dam drain tunnel to control releases. Based on subsequent studies of sediment removal and with the concurrence of involved parties, it was decided as reflected in the Condit Hydroelectric Project Removal Summary Report that a more rapid removal of the sediments was preferred. Appurtenant Facilities Removal. In addition to removing the concrete gravity dam including its Obermeyer crest spillway gate and other spillway and intake gates, demolition of the Project facilities also would involve removal of the upstream cofferdams, wood stave pipeline, steel surge tank, and the wooden and steel penstocks. Upstream Cofferdams: Photographs and drawings show that the cofferdams used to divert and control water during the original construction of the dam were flooded when the reservoir was allowed to fill, and would require removal to return the site to preconstruction conditions. To remove these structures, it is envisioned that a road would be constructed from the top of the excavated concrete dam and would ramp down to area of the cofferdams. The cofferdams are expected to be at least partially exposed by the erosive flushing of the reservoir. Some blasting would probably be necessary to remove one of the cofferdams, since the photographs indicate that fill concrete was probably placed in one cofferdam in lieu of the puddled earthen materials shown on the original construction drawings. The concrete, stones and boulders, and timber members of the cofferdams would be excavated and trucked to the spoil area. The temporary Removal Plan Summary Page - 4   construction road would also allow access to the upstream area where logs and other debris have sunk to the bottom of the reservoir. Some of these logs would be removed, as necessary, to promote reservoir sediment erosion. Surge Tank: The steel surge tank and its concrete foundations would be removed to eliminate a future public safety hazard. To allow demolition of the concrete foundation of the tank, drilling and blasting techniques would be used. The foundation and tank materials would be loaded into trucks and transported to the spoil area for burial. Wood Stave Pipeline and Steel & Wood Penstocks: The existing 13.5 foot diameter, 5100 foot long wood stave pipeline and the 650 foot long steel and wood penstocks, would be removed along with their concrete foundations. All of these materials would be transported to the spoil area and buried. At the time of construction it may be economically feasible to re-cycle some of these materials, and transport them to an off site recycling firm. For example, the scrap steel from the penstock, surge tank, and steel bands and fittings of the wood stave pipeline could have value at the time of removal. Site Preparations. Because the dam is located in a steep area, room for construction-demolition adjacent to the dam is limited. It is proposed that a ten-acre area be purchased and used for a site setup and staging area, a borrow pit and a spoil area. Site setup facilities would include an office trailer, equipment parts vans, equipment fueling and maintenance station, an equipment parking area and an explosives magazine site. It is estimated that two to three thousand cubic yards of fill material may be required for the construction of access roads to various areas of the project. This material could be removed from this spoil area and later back filled as the construction site is reclaimed. Removal Plan Summary Page - 5   A significant volume of waste materials would be generated from the demolition of the dam and associated facilities. Estimated quantities of some of these materials are listed as follows:     Concrete - over 45,000 cubic yards (broken volume) Wood Pipe Staves - over 6,000 cubic yards stacked Steel - over 400 tons Woody Reservoir Debris - from drained reservoir area (unknown quantity) Certainly, some of this material could be hauled off and recycled dependant on the market economics of recycling at the time of construction. A fairly large area would be required to store, sort and transport this material for recycling. Access Road Construction. One of the first activities of the project would be construction of an access road to the spillway slab below the dam to permit excavation of the reservoir drain tunnel located at the base of the dam. Access roads into the drained reservoir area would be used during removal of the cofferdams immediately upstream. Other access roads would be required for the removal of the 5100-foot long wood stave flowline. REMOVAL PLAN SCHEDULE An aggressive schedule has been developed to complete the dam removal project within one year. The attached schedule, Figure 1, shows the sequence and timing of the major tasks. Certain criteria have been used to develop the schedule and includes the following:    Work that affects water quality and quantity should be performed after October 1st. (US Fish & Wildlife Service, 21 January 1998 memo) The diversion dam used in the original construction of the dam should be removed prior to May 1st to allow fish passage. (US Fish & Wildlife Service, 21 January 1998 memo) Excavation of the 12X18 ft. drain tunnel at the base of the dam and the removal of low level concrete in the old river channel must be performed during low river flows (July through November)  Removal Plan Summary Page - 6   The success of this schedule is dependent upon many factors that are difficult to predict such as actual river flows and weather conditions that would be encountered and the impact of buried wood debris in the reservoir. If significant wood debris is encountered, the speed of sediment erosion could be reduced and additional time may be required to handle the debris and to keep the drain tunnel through the dam open. REMOVAL PLAN CONSTRUCTION COSTS Although the structural removal work and the flushing of trapped sediments in the reservoir would consist primarily of demolition, rather than construction, the work has been referred to in the Settlement Agreement as ""construction"" because construction contractors would perform the work. The Condit Hydroelectric Project Removal Summary Report (May 1998) prepared by an independent consultant identified removal elements and estimated construction costs of $10,420,000 (1998 dollars) for the ""Selected Approach,"" including allowances for overhead and contingencies (15%), legal, administration and engineering (10%), and minor building permits (3%). With the assistance of another independent consultant, parties to the Settlement Agreement reviewed and adjusted both removal elements and construction costs. Based on that review, the Removal Costs Worksheet identifies removal elements and construction costs of $13,650,000 (1999 dollars) for the Selected Approach,"" including allowances for overhead (15%), legal, administration, and engineering (10%), and minor building permits (3%). The ""Removal Cost Elements"" total set forth in the Removal Cost Worksheet is the basis of ""Construction Costs"" set forth in Section 4.1.1 of the Settlement Agreement.

Oil is chiefly produced from the Lower Cretaceous limestone, called the Sunniland Zone by drillers, that underlies the region at depths ranging from 11,000 to 12,000 ft. Along with the crude oil produced are large quantities of saltwater, called brine. The brines are several times saltier than seawater, and small amounts spilled on the surface can render a potable water supply useless for many years. Analyses of selected oil field brine are shown in  table 11 . Chloride concentrations range from 108,000 to 164,570 mg/L, compared with about 19,200 mg/L for seawater.      Total oil production for the 13 fields during 1943-83 was 77.3 million barrels (bbl) (3.2 billion gallons (Ggal)), and brine production was 193.2 million bbl (8.1 Ggal). The largest producer of oil and brine ( fig. 28 , site 4) yielded 35 million bbl of oil and 73 million bbl of brine during 1966-83. The next largest producer ( fig. 28 , site 1) yielded 18 million bbl of oil and 52 million bbl of brine during 1943-83. During 1943-66, the ratio of brine to oil was relatively stable, as production was mostly from the field shown as site 1 in  figure 28 . Subsequent oil production at site 4 resulted in significantly greater amounts of brine, and in 1971 oil production leveled off while brine production continued to increase exponentially ( fig. 29 ). Ultimately, oil production began to decline in 1977, and brine production continued to rise. The brine-to-oil ratio in 1983 was 6.4 to 1.0 compared with a 1 to 1 ratio in 1964.

Brine and oil production for southern Florida oil fields, 1943-83. [ larger version ]                                 Some of the produced brine was used to repressure the oil-producing zone during 1966-83 to enhance oil recovery. This process is termed ""water flooding"" or ""secondary recovery"" and generally involves injection of the brine back into an abandoned oil well. About 23.6 million bbl (991 million gallons; Mgal) of brine were reinjected into the producing zone for water flooding.      A summary of brine production, by oil field, is presented in  table 12 . During 1943-83, about 193.2 million bbl (8.1 Ggal) of brine were produced, of which 169.6 million bbl (7.1 Ggal) were injected into the Boulder Zone (Lower Floridan aquifer) and 23.6 million bbl (1.0 Ggal) were injected back into the oil-producing zone.      Figure 30  shows the hydrogeology and construction details of typical oil field brine disposal wells at two oil fields (sites 12 and 1). The injection well at site 12 was constructed since establishment of the UIC regulations and incorporates current design criteria. The injection well at site 1 is a converted oil-production well with a cement plug in the lower confining unit of the Floridan aquifer system. Both wells, however, inject brine through perforations into the Boulder Zone (Lower Floridan aquifer), The main difference between the injection wells is that the injection well at site 12 has two strings of casing that extend from land surface to the middle confining unit of the Floridan aquifer system, whereas the well at site 1 has only one string of casing to protect brackish ground water in the Upper Floridan aquifer. Also, the injection well at site 12 has associated with it a separate monitoring well (not shown in  fig. 30 ) used to provide an early warning for leaks and upward migration of saltwater.

Elwha Dam was completed in 1913 at river mile (RM) 4.9, and includes a 108-foot-high concrete gravity section, gated spillways on both abutments, and a powerhouse with four generating units rated at a combined capacity of 14.8 megawatts (MW). Glines Canyon Dam was completed in 1927 at RM 13.4 and includes a 210-foot-high concrete thin arch section, a gated spillway on the left abutment, a thrust block on the right abutment, and a powerhouse with a single generating unit rated at 13.3 MW. Elwha Dam impounds Lake Aldwell, which has a surface area of 267 acres and a storage capacity of 8,100 acre-feet at elevation of 197.0 feet. Glines Canyon Dam impounds Lake Mills, which has a surface area of 415 acres and a storage capacity of 40,500 acre-feet at elevation of 590.33 feet. Both dams are currently owned and operated by the James River Corporation.   The goal of restoring the Elwha River ecosystem and native anadromous fisheries requires removal of Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams. The plan to meet this goal includes the following objectives:  · Safely remove Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams.   · Accommodate river flows during dam removal, through diversion channels and notches.   · Facilitate sediment management through controlled releases and systematic construction schedules.   · Address environmental issues by planning work shutdowns during certain periods.   · Retain certain structures for historical preservation at Glines Canyon Dam, allowing public viewing of the site from structures on both abutments and retaining the historic powerhouse.   · Achieve reasonable costs by limiting structure removal at Glines Canyon Dam and by selecting construction methods that are economical but do not sacrifice safety.        A Dam Removal Task Group was established to prepare feasibility-level designs and cost estimates for dam removal. The design process for development of the dam removal plans consisted of the following steps:  · Review existing information, including previous studies performed by others for the  Draft Staff Report  (FERC 1993) and  The Elwha Report  (Interior and Commerce, 1994).   · Develop reasonable dam removal alternatives by considering previous designs, existing site conditions, project objectives, and current construction practices.   · Identify and address issues that could impact construction, including streamflow diversion, sediment management, safety, and environmental concerns.   · Develop an efficient construction sequence to minimize potential flood impacts and accommodate periodic shutdowns for salmon runs and potential flood flows.   · Prepare feasibility-level cost estimates for removal of each dam based on the preferred dam removal alternatives and assumed demolition methods.   · Document design studies by preparing a technical memorandum and feasibility drawings.  The reservoir behind Elwha Dam would initially be lowered by about 50 feet with the construction of a diversion channel through the existing location of the left abutment spillway. This would permit removal of the concrete gravity section and excavation of a significant portion of the upstream fill materials. The remaining reservoir would be lowered an additional 40 feet by the incremental removal of the remaining rockfill within the original river channel. All structures would either be removed or buried at the Elwha damsite, and the diversion channel would be backfilled to provide natural-looking contours on the left abutment.   Using a combination of blasting and sawcutting, the concrete arch portion of Glines Canyon Dam would be removed in 7.5-foot layers from the existing dam crest at elevation of 590.33 feet to the final streambed level at an elevation of 400 feet. Streamflow diversion would be provided by the existing power penstock for reservoir levels above 530 feet, and by a series of 15-foot-deep excavated notches alternating between the left and right sides of the concrete arch at 7.5-foot intervals, between elevations of 522.83 and 410.33 feet. The concrete thrust block, gravity wall, and embankment dike located on the right abutment of the dam would be retained for use as a public overlook. The gated spillway, penstock, gatehouse, and powerhouse structures on the left abutment would be retained for their historical significance and interpretive potential.   The total field cost of dam removal is currently estimated at $20.2 million, including an allowance of 20 percent for contingencies. Costs for engineering and construction management would add approximately 20 percent to the overall project cost. A construction period of about 2 years is anticipated, with a recommended notice-to-proceed date of November 1. The proposed construction schedules and detailed cost estimates are included in Appendices E and F, respectively.   Additional construction requirements associated with dam removal include hazardous waste collection and disposal, removal of transmission lines, and road improvements. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (the Service) has prepared a separate report on the proposed collection and disposal of hazardous waste at both dam sites, with an estimated cost to the project of $1.2 million. Removal of 14 miles of transmission lines and poles was estimated to cost $238,000 (plus contingencies) in 1990. Improvements necessary for the Olympic Hot Springs Road for rehabilitation following dam removal are discussed in this technical memorandum, and by the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) in a separate report on flood protection requirements. Detailed costs of all features are discussed in a separate cost summary report in Appendix E.     CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION          The Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act (Public Law 102-495, also called the Elwha Restoration Act), passed by Congress in 1992, requires the ""¼full restoration of the Elwha River ecosystem and native anadromous fisheries."" Since 1911, the Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams in northwestern Washington have blocked anadromous fish passage to more than 70 miles of the Elwha River and its tributaries, limiting anadromous salmon and steelhead trout production to the lower 4.9 miles of the river below Elwha Dam. The removal of Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams was determined by the Secretary of the Interior to be the only alternative that would achieve the goal desired by Congress.   Extensive studies of potential dam removal alternatives have been performed by others; primarily Hosey & Associates Engineering Company (1989) for dam owner James River II, Inc. (now James River Corporation), and Summit Technology Consulting Engineers, Inc. (1991) for the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe. For demonstration of the technical feasibility of removing both dams,  The Elwha Report  (Interior and Commerce, 1994) includes the work of consultants Summit Technology with R. W. Beck and Associates (1993) and provides estimated costs for the project. As part of an interagency effort, the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) conducted a feasibility-level study on dam removal, sediment management, and water treatment alternatives to achieve restoration of the Elwha River. A plan of study for this work was completed in July 1994, and a Dam Removal Task Group was established to prepare feasibility-level designs and cost estimates for dam removal.   This technical memorandum discusses various dam removal alternatives, including those studied previously, and presents a preferred dam removal plan which is considered to be economical, technically feasible, and fully compatible with project objectives. This technical memorandum was utilized as a source document by the National Park Service (NPS) for the ""programmatic""  Final Environmental Impact Statement I  (Final EIS, Vol. I),  Elwha River Ecosystem Restoration  (June 1995). This document will also serve as source material for the draft ""implementation"" Final EIS, Vol II (April 1996).   While specific methods have been developed for removal of both dams for purposes of preparing cost estimates, the Dam Removal Task Group believes there may be some merit in having contractors submit technical and cost proposals for dam removal during the contract procurement process. This concept, called ""negotiated procurement,"" may allow for more efficient methods and for cost savings, and is often used when alternative or innovative approaches to construction are desired. This contracting process has been successfully used by Reclamation for many projects, and should result in the optimum dam removal plan for the lowest overall cost        CHAPTER II. PROJECT OBJECTIVES          The action proposed by the programmatic Final EIS is ""¼to fully restore the Elwha River ecosystem and native anadromous fisheries through the decommissioning of Elwha Dam and Glines Canyon Dam and removal of all structures necessary, including all or part of both dams, powerhouses, reservoirs, and associated facilities to achieve this purpose."" (Interior and Commerce, 1994)   The plan of study (July 1994) identified the following objectives to achieve project restoration:  · Develop and evaluate alternative plans for removing Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams and for controlling river flows while the dams are being removed.   · Develop and evaluate alternative plans to restore the physical characteristics of the Elwha River channel and to remove and/or stabilize reservoir sediments.   · Determine the long-term equilibrium channel characteristics of the Elwha River in the area of the reservoirs and downstream to its mouth at the Strait of Juan de Fuca.   · Identify impacts to water quality and use. Develop and evaluate alternative plans for addressing water quality impacts and maintaining water supplies.   · Identify economic impacts associated with dam removal.  The Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act (P. L. 102-495) authorized acquisition of both projects at a cost of $29.5 million, subject to the appropriation of necessary funds. The purchase is to include both dams, appurtenant works, and project lands. Upon conveyance of the projects to the United States, the Secretary of the Interior will be responsible for maintaining the dams in a safe condition until their removal. Both dams are currently listed in the National Register of Historic Places and an ""Historic American Engineering Record"" must be prepared to fully document each project as mitigation for their removal. Retention of portions of the original structures to the extent possible could help mitigate the impacts of dam removal and facilitate project interpretation.              CHAPTER III. EXISTING PROJECT FEATURES          A. ELWHA DAM    1. General description  — Elwha Dam is located on the Elwha River, about 4.9 miles upstream from the Strait of Juan de Fuca, on Washington State’s Olympic Peninsula. The dam was originally constructed in 1911-13, and impounds a reservoir (Lake Aldwell) having a surface area of 267 acres and a storage capacity of 8,100 acre-feet at an elevation of 197.0 feet. Since 1983, the reservoir level has been held within a 1-foot range of normal water surface, resulting in essentially a run-of-the-river operational mode, with flood flows required to be passed with little reduction. The primary benefit of the reservoir is power generation, although recreational benefits are also available. Maximum power generation occurs with 1,800 cubic feet per second (cfs) released equally through the four turbines, with any excess flow released from the gated spillways located on both abutments. Access to Elwha Dam is provided by an unpaved road off State Highway 112, just east of the Elwha River bridge.   Elwha Dam is currently classified by Reclamation (April 1995a) as ""high hazard,"" a category determined by the potential for loss of life in the event of a dam failure. An inundation map for failure of Elwha Dam was prepared by Harza Northwest, Inc. (1992). Peak flows of 159,000 cfs at the dam, reducing to 109,000 cfs at the lower Elwha River, resulted from the dam-break simulation. A safety-of-dams classification code of ""FAIR"" is appropriate for Elwha Dam, based on current NPS guidelines. The FAIR classification indicates that no existing or potential dam safety deficiencies are recognized for normal operating conditions, that all essential elements can be expected to function under normal operating conditions, and that remotely occurring events of magnitudes approaching a probable maximum flood (PMF) or maximum credible earthquake (MCE) may cause a dam safety deficiency. Additional hydrologic and seismotectonic analyses, including the development of a new PMF and MCE using current methods, may be required in the event the dam is not removed.   Elwha Dam and its appurtenant structures were inspected for the NPS in September 1994, and an evaluation report was completed in April 1995. A copy of this report, complete with project drawings and photographs, is included in Appendix B. Detailed descriptions of each of the project features are provided below, and are based on previously published reports and available project drawings. All elevations used in this technical memorandum are based on mean sea level, and are 9.5 feet higher than the original project datum.   2. Gravity section  — The concrete gravity section has a structural height of 108 feet, a crest length of 112 feet at elevation of 199.5 feet, a crest width of 8 feet, a base width of 100 feet, and an estimated volume of 12,000 cubic yards (yd 3 ) above elevation of 90 feet. The upstream face is vertical and the downstream face is stepped, with an average slope of 0.85:1. A timber access bridge is above the dam crest and extends about 430 feet between the abutments, with chain-link fencing along both sides. Four low-level sluiceway outlets, each 5 feet wide by 10 feet high, extend through the gravity section at ""invert"" (lowest point of the interior) elevation of 121.5 feet, with iron slide gates provided on the upstream face.   Concrete plugs were constructed within 10 feet of the upstream end of these outlets in 1980 to permanently seal them. Currently, the downstream steps of the gravity section show signs of deterioration and spalling (the loss of surface concrete, usually caused by impact or abrasion), but the concrete mass is believed to be reasonably sound.   The concrete gravity section was originally founded on alluvial sands and gravels 80 feet thick.   A structural failure (blowout) of the foundation occurred during initial filling in October 1912, resulting in loss of the reservoir beneath the concrete structure (see Appendix A, Construction History). The subsequent placement of various materials (rockfill, fir mattresses [bundles of branches], hydraulic fill, and gunite (a type of reinforced concrete) upstream of the gravity section was effective in reducing the amount of seepage through the foundation. Investigations in 1968 revealed the existence of a large void beneath the gravity section (up to 15 feet deep), and measurements in 1972 showed a seepage flow of about 70 cfs. Compressive testing of concrete cores indicated compressive strengths in the 2,000 to 2,500 pounds per square inch (lbs/in 2 ) range. Post-tensioned, fully-grouted tendons were installed in the concrete gravity section in 1980 and 1986 to improve structural stability during overtopping and seismic events.   3. North spillway  — A gated spillway is provided on the left abutment of the dam, containing four 13.75- by 19-foot Tainter (radial) gates with a maximum estimated release capacity of 18,700 cfs at elevation of 200.0 feet. The reinforced-concrete gate structure has an overflow crest at elevation of 179.2 feet, a total length of 82.3 feet at the bridge deck (elevation of 205.0 feet), and an estimated concrete volume of 2,400 yd 3 . A concrete, ogee-shaped overflow section is provided below gate No. 3 for fish passage. Post-tensioned, fully-grouted tendons were installed in the north spillway piers in 1980 and 1987 to improve structural stability during overtopping and seismic events. The spillway chute was excavated in bedrock and extends over 250 feet from the spillway crest to the river channel, with a width of about 76 feet. Massive concrete gravity walls are provided along both sides of the excavated spillway chute, with an estimated volume of 2,000 yd 3 . The steel Tainter gates have a radius of 20 feet from the trunnion pins and a total weight of 52,000 pounds. Stoplog slots are provided in the concrete piers upstream of the gates. A single gate hoist is provided for local or remote operation of the gates, with an estimated weight of 5,000 pounds. A discharge curve for all four spillway gates fully open is provided in Figure 1.   4. South spillway  — A second gated spillway is provided on the right abutment of the dam, containing five 13.75- by 19-foot Tainter gates with a maximum estimated release capacity of 23,300 cfs at elevation of 200.0 feet. The south spillway was constructed in 1914, after the initial filling and structural failure of the dam foundation. The reinforced-concrete gate structure has an overflow crest at elevation of 179.2 feet, a total length of 90.9 feet at the bridge deck (elevation of 205.0 feet), and an estimated concrete volume of 1,600 yd 3 . Post-tensioned, fully-grouted tendons were installed in the south spillway piers in 1980 and 1986 to improve structural stability during overtopping and seismic events. The steel Tainter gates have a radius of 20 feet from the trunnion pins and a combined weight of 65,000 pounds. Stoplog slots are provided in the concrete piers upstream of the gates. A single gate hoist is provided for local operation of the gates, with an estimated weight of 5,000 pounds. A discharge curve for all five spillway gates fully open is provided in Figure 2.

Intake structure  — A concrete intake structure is provided between the gravity section and the north spillway, with a crest length of 131.5 feet and four intake sills at elevation of 174.5 feet. The reinforced-concrete structure is founded on bedrock and has an estimated concrete volume of 3,400 yd 3 . The intake structure provides four upstream 12.7- by 13-foot slide gates and hydraulic hoists for the penstocks serving the downstream powerhouse, for a total weight of 40,000 pounds. Trashracks provided upstream of each penstock inlet have a combined weight of 70,000 pounds. Post-tensioned, fully-grouted tendons (9 total) were installed in the intake structure piers in 1980 and 1987 to improve structural stability during overtopping and seismic events. Concrete compressive strengths are low, ranging from 1,100 to 2,500 lbs/in 2 .   6. Penstocks and surge tank  — Four steel penstocks are provided between the intake structure and the powerhouse. Each penstock is about 190 feet long with an intake sill at elevation of 174.5 feet. The penstocks are supported on concrete saddles and within concrete thrust blocks having a total volume of about 600 yd 3 . The two penstocks to the north are each 9.5 feet in diameter and supply water to units 1 and 2. A 15-foot-diameter penstock to the south is supplied by two 9.5-foot-diameter penstocks at the upstream end, and branches at a surge tank to two smaller penstocks serving units 3 and 4. The surge tank is 120 feet high, with a tank diameter of 25 feet and a 20-foot-diameter riser pipe. A 30-inch-diameter penstock is provided for station service. Total release capacity of the power penstocks is 1,800 cfs while generating power. The steel penstocks have a total estimated weight of 572,000 pounds. The surge tank has an estimated weight of 275,000 pounds. A concrete walkway has an estimated volume of 50 yd 3 .   7. Powerhouse  — The powerhouse structure is located on the left abutment downstream from the intake structure, and includes two circa-1914 horizontal double-runner turbine generators (units 1 and 2, each rated at 3,000 kilovolt amperes [kVA] and 4,800 horsepower) and two circa-1922 vertical single-runner Francis-type turbine generators (units 3 and 4; each rated at 3,330 kVA and 5,000 horsepower) for production, a smaller horizontal turbine generator for station service (at 200 kVA), and governors and other auxiliaries for the units. The maximum rated capacity of the powerplant is 14.8 MW. Penstock releases are controlled by wicket gates at each turbine generator. The control room is located in the original powerhouse and contains the main control panel, communications, and protective relays. Manually-operated butterfly guard valves are provided for units 3 and 4, in addition to the slide gates at the intake structure. The second floor of the powerhouse contains a small machine shop and transformers and circuit breakers for the units.   The powerhouse structure is of reinforced concrete and has a main floor covering about 7,800 square feet (ft 2 ), with an estimated 6,900 yd 3  of concrete and 3,800 ft 2  of glass-pane windows. The mechanical equipment, including the turbines, governors, and overhead cranes, has an estimated weight of 515,000 pounds. The electrical equipment, including the generators, exciters, transformers, and circuit breakers, has an estimated weight of 950,000 pounds. Discharge curves for units 3 and 4 (vertical units) with various gate openings and with the turbine runners removed (for no-load operation) are provided in Figure 3.   8. Transformer yard  — A small transformer yard or substation is located on the right abutment downstream from the dam, above the access road. At the transformer yard, the generator voltage is transformed to 69 kV and conveyed about 6 miles via an overhead three-phase transmission line to the Daishowa-America paper mill (Line No. 1) or about 8 miles to the Bonneville Power Administration-City of Port Angeles substation (Line No. 2). A chain-link fence surrounds the electrical equipment at the site. The estimated weights for the electrical equipment within the transformer yard are included in the total weight provided above for the powerhouse.   9. Reservoir forebay  — Between 1913 and 1919, a massive stabilizing fill of large rock and hydraulically-placed fill (sand and gravel) was placed immediately upstream from the concrete gravity section within the forebay area. An estimated 200,000 yd 3  of earthen materials (including about 25 percent rockfill) must be removed to restore the original river channel. A reinforced-concrete (gunite) channel lining was constructed on the fill in the early 1920's within 200-300 feet of the dam, covering about 60,000 ft 2  of the forebay area between both abutments with an average thickness of 3 inches. The total estimated volume of the concrete channel lining is about 600 yd 3 . The channel fill includes an earthen dike extending upstream from a large concrete block at the penstock intake structure, to divide the forebay area into two distinct channels to the north and south spillways. The concrete block has a top surface at an elevation of 196 feet, and an estimated volume of 1,400 yd 3 .   Additional seepage control measures located within the forebay area include large fir mattresses having an estimated volume of over 2,000 yd 3 . A series of sheet-pile cutoffs were constructed to depths up to 50 feet below the streambed surface both upstream and downstream from the dam. A concrete-filled caisson was constructed near the toe of the dam below an elevation of 100 feet.   10. Fish screens and rearing pens  — An Eicher fish-screen facility is located on the left abutment above the penstock for Unit 1, and is owned by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). A small derrick boom crane was erected for installation and operation of the facility. Two large salmon rearing pens and a smaller tank-like structure were constructed on the reservoir near the right abutment. Access to the rearing pens on the reservoir is through the shop garage on the right abutment. These items are no longer used. At EPRI’s direction, James River Corporation offered the material to the City of Port Angeles. Port Angeles has identified specific items that it wants to salvage; the remainder becomes part of the project.   11. Log boom  — A log boom is on the reservoir and consists of logs cabled or chained together. The estimated length of the log boom is about 330 feet between abutments, and about 490 feet to the left end of the intake structure to isolate the left (north) spillway channel for controlled releases of floating logs to the river.   12. Maintenance shop and outbuildings  — A maintenance shop/office and garage is located on the right abutment of the dam, with smaller, wood-frame structures located on both abutments. The maintenance shop/office has asbestos siding and floor tile, with a floor area of about 2,150 ft 2 , including an attached garage with vehicle access doors on both ends. A garage on the left abutment has a floor area of about 630 ft 2 .      Figure 3. — Elwha Dam Powerplant Discharge Curve (Vertical Units)    new generation hard copy received 3/20/96   B. GLINES CANYON DAM    1. General description  — Glines Canyon Dam is located on the Elwha River within the Olympic National Park, about 13.4 miles upstream from the Strait of Juan de Fuca, on Washington’s Olympic Peninsula. The dam was originally constructed in 1926-1927, and impounds a reservoir (Lake Mills) having a surface area of 415 acres and a storage capacity of 40,500 acre feet at elevation of 590.33 feet. Since 1975, Glines Canyon Dam has been operated as a run-of-the-river facility, with flood flows generally required to be released with little reduction. The primary benefit of the reservoir is power generation, although recreational benefits are also available. Maximum power generation occurs with 1,150 cfs released through the single turbine, with any excess flow released from the gated spillway located on the left abutment. Remote operation of the turbine and of one spillway gate is possible from Elwha Dam. Access to Glines Canyon Dam is provided by the Olympic Hot Springs Road off U.S. Highway 101.   Glines Canyon Dam is currently classified by Reclamation (April 1995b) as ""high hazard,"" determined by the potential for loss of life in the event of a dam failure. An inundation map for failure of Glines Canyon Dam was prepared by Harza Northwest, Inc. in 1992. Peak flows of 650,000 cfs at the dam, reducing to 350,000 cfs at the lower Elwha River (including overtopping failure of Elwha Dam), resulted from the dam-break simulation. A safety of dams classification code of ""SATISFACTORY"" is appropriate for Glines Canyon Dam, based on current NPS guidelines. The SATISFACTORY classification indicates that no existing or potential dam safety deficiencies are recognized, and that all essential elements can be expected to function under all operating conditions, including such events as the PMF or MCE, which have only a remote chance of occurring. Additional hydrologic and seismotectonic analyses, including the development of a new PMF and MCE using current methods, may be required in the event the dam is not removed.   Glines Canyon Dam and its appurtenant structures were inspected for the NPS in September 1994, and an evaluation report was completed in April 1995. A copy of this report, complete with project drawings and photographs, is included in Appendix B. Detailed descriptions of each of the project features are provided below, and are based on previously published reports and available project drawings. All elevations used in this technical memorandum are based on mean sea level, and are 19.67 feet lower than the original project datum.   2. Arch dam  — The varied radius, concrete, thin-arch dam has a structural height of 210 feet, with a crest length of 150 feet at elevation of 590.33 feet, a crest width of 4 feet, a base width of 46 feet, and an estimated volume of 15,200 yd 3  above elevation of 400 feet. The upper 50 feet of the arch dam is reinforced near the abutments. The downstream face is vertical above elevation of 426 feet and the upstream face is curved. An abandoned low-level outlet works, or sluiceway, is located through the arch dam at centerline elevation of 450.33 feet. The outlet consists of a circular intake with a hinged, hemispherical trashrack, a 6-foot-long transition from an 11-foot-diameter to a 5-foot-diameter conduit, a 60-inch-diameter butterfly valve, and an 18-foot-long outlet transition from a 5-foot-diameter to a 6.5-foot-diameter conduit. A vertical ladder well on the downstream face of the arch dam and a horizontal adit provides access from the dam crest to the butterfly valve operator, which reportedly has not been operated since original construction. The trashrack, butterfly valve, and operator have a combined weight of about 12,200 pounds.   A concrete walkway and supporting piers were removed from the dam crest in 1969 to facilitate dam overtopping for passage of large floods up to the PMF. The dam crest serves as an overflow spillway with a discharge capacity of 86,000 cfs at the maximum water surface elevation of 611.8 feet. A concrete apron extends about 36 feet downstream from the dam between the canyon walls for erosion protection at the toe of the dam.   The downstream face of the arch dam was closely examined by Harza Northwest, Inc. in September 1991, and was found to be in very good condition, with no cracking, spalling, or significant seepage observed. Non-destructive strength testing of the downstream face resulted in relative concrete strengths ranging from 2,800 to 3,200 lbs/in 2 . The upper 18 feet of the upstream face of the arch dam was observed during the reservoir draw-down test in April 1994 and there were no visible signs of structural distress. An underwater inspection of the arch dam was performed in 1994 by Reclamation’s Pacific Northwest Regional Office using a remote-controlled camera, with no problems reported. Vertical and horizontal movements at measurement points on the arch dam, thrust block, gravity section, and penstock anchor have been satisfactory since monitoring began in 1966.   3. Thrust block and gravity section  — The right end of the arch dam contacts a concrete gravity thrust block, adjoining a low concrete gravity section and a reinforced concrete wall on the right abutment. The thrust block is 20 feet wide and 30 feet long at the crest elevation of 600.33 feet, and extends up to 40 feet above the bedrock foundation. The thrust block includes an abandoned 6 feet wide log flume along the far face, with an invert at elevation of 581.3 feet. The gravity section is 55 feet long and contains a 0.7:1 downstream face batter below an elevation of 593 feet, with an 18-inch-thick wall above this elevation. The reinforced concrete wall is 55 feet long and 3 feet thick. The gravity section and concrete wall contain a 6-foot-wide, 12-inch-thick reinforced concrete deck at elevation of 600.33 feet. The thrust block, gravity section, and concrete wall have a total estimated volume of 2,100 yd 3 . Post-tensioned, grouted, and ungrouted tendons were installed in the gravity section in 1969, 1973, and 1989 to improve structural stability during overtopping and seismic events. Lampposts and handrails are located along the perimeter of the thrust block and reinforced concrete deck.   4. Embankment dikes  — An earthfill embankment is located beyond the concrete wall and gravity section on the upper right (north) abutment, and was modified in 1969 for containment of the PMF. The embankment has a crest length of 175 feet at elevation of 612.33 feet, a crest width of 8 feet, and 1:1 slopes. Riprap slope protection is provided on the upstream slope below elevation of 595 feet, with grass cover above elevation of 595 feet and on the downstream slope. The embankment contains a concrete core wall and has a maximum height of 80 feet above the bedrock foundation. The total estimated volume of the embankment is 5,500 yd 3 .   A second earthfill embankment was constructed on the upper left abutment beyond the gated spillway in 1973 for containment of the PMF. The embankment has a crest length of 260 feet at elevation of 612.33 feet, a crest width of 8 feet, and 1½:1 slopes protected by grass cover. The total estimated volume of the embankment is 2,400 yd 3 .   5. Gated spillway  — A gated spillway is located on the left abutment of the dam, with an overflow crest at elevation of 570.33 feet, and five 20- by 20-foot Tainter gates with a maximum release capacity of 63,000 cfs at reservoir elevation of 611.8 feet. Spillway releases pass through a reinforced concrete chute and flip structure to the river channel below.   The spillway structure has a total length of 120 feet at the bridge deck (elevation of 600.3 feet) and an estimated concrete volume of 2,500 yd 3 . Post-tensioned, fully grouted tendons were installed in the spillway piers in 1989 to improve structural stability during overtopping and seismic events. Each steel Tainter gate has a radius of 15 feet from the trunnion pin at elevation of 578.33 feet.   A single hoist motor is located on the hoist deck for gate operation. The combined weight of the Tainter gates and gate hoist is about 100,000 pounds. Stoplog slots are located in the upstream piers. A discharge curve for all spillway gates fully open is provided in Figure 4.   6. Intake structure  — A 115-foot-high intake structure is located at the upstream end of the power penstock tunnel, about 200 feet from the left abutment shoreline. The lower intake chamber (at the tunnel portal) and the upper trashrack tower are reinforced concrete, with a combined volume of 450 yd 3 . The steel trashracks have an estimated weight of 50,000 pounds. The intake invert is at elevation of 501.4 feet. Access to the trashrack tower is by boat.   7. Power penstock tunnel  — The power penstock tunnel extends 568 feet between portals through the left abutment of the dam. The upstream portion is lined with concrete on the crown and sidewalls only, with a minimum diameter of 11 feet and a length of 167 feet. A 45-foot-long, concrete-lined transition is provided for the rectangular guard gate section at station 1+92, with a sill at elevation of 503.33 feet. The downstream portion of the power penstock tunnel is concrete-lined for about 172 feet (11-foot diameter), dropping about 27 feet in elevation, and then is unlined for the final 184 feet (13.5-foot diameter). The unlined portion contains a 10-foot-diameter riveted steel pressure pipe.   8. Gatehouse and shaft  — A reinforced-concrete gatehouse (floor elevation of 606.75 feet) is supported on concrete columns 17.5 feet above an 86-foot-deep, concrete-lined gate shaft extending to the power penstock tunnel invert. A 7- by 12-foot caterpillar guard gate is located within the 3- by 9-foot gate shaft for emergency closure and for penstock maintenance. Access to the power penstock tunnel is located downstream of the guard gate slot by a 2.5- by 2.5-foot access shaft. The gate and access shafts are covered by steel grating at the lower deck elevation of 589.2 feet. Access to the gatehouse is provided by a concrete footbridge. The gatehouse, support columns, and footbridge have a combined estimated concrete volume of 30 yd 3 . The portion of the gate shaft above the ground surface has an estimated concrete volume of 60 yd 3 . Gate operating equipment within the gatehouse is estimated to weigh 10,000 pounds.   9. Penstock and surge tank  — A 10-foot-diameter steel penstock extends about 75 feet from the downstream tunnel portal at station 5+70 to a steel transition and surge tank. The surge tank is about 150 feet high and is located at station 6+70 (centerline). The steel tank is 20 feet in diameter, with an 11-foot-diameter riser pipe and steel support structure on concrete footings. The penstock transitions to a 11.58-foot-diameter and drops about 73 feet between station 6+90 (downstream from the surge tank) and station 7+96 (at the powerhouse). A stairway is located on the sloping penstock for access to the surge tank, downstream tunnel portal, and transformer yard. Total weight of the steel penstock pipe between stations 5+70 and 7+96 is about 168,000 pounds. The surge tank has a total estimated weight of 130,000 pounds.   10. Powerhouse  — The powerhouse is located 700 feet downstream from the dam on the left abutment, and includes a vertical Francis-type turbine generator (centerline station 8+26, elevation of 403.33 feet) rated at 13,333 kVA and 17,500 horsepower for commercial use, a horizontal Pelton-type turbine generator rated at 50 kW for station service, and governors and other auxiliaries for the units. Penstock releases are controlled by wicket gates at the vertical turbine generator, with an 8.5-foot-diameter, hydraulically-operated butterfly valve provided just upstream. The unit has a maximum release capacity of 1,150 cfs while generating power. Discharge curves for various gate openings with the turbine runner removed (for greater capacity under no load conditions) are provided in Figure 5.   The powerhouse is reinforced concrete and measures approximately 40 by 60 feet, covering an area of about 2,400 ft 2 . The superstructure (above the main floor, elevation of 410.33 feet) has an estimated concrete volume of 500 yd 3  and about 1,200 ft 2  of glass-pane windows. The mechanical equipment, including the turbine, governors, and overhead crane, has an estimated weight of 400,000 pounds. The electrical equipment, including the generators, exciter, and transformers, has an estimated weight of 325,000 pounds. A concrete retaining wall located at the powerhouse within the tailrace area has a top width of 3 feet and is approximately 55 feet long, for an estimated volume of 140 yd 3 . A small metal shed near the powerhouse measures 12 by 20 feet and covers an area of 240 ft 2 . Access to the powerhouse is provided by an unpaved road from the left (west) abutment access road (Olympic Hot Springs Road).   11. Transformer yard  — A transformer yard, or substation, located on the left abutment above the powerhouse, is where the generator voltage is transformed to 69 kV and conveyed about 7 miles via an overhead three-phase transmission line (Line No. 3) to Elwha Dam. The yard contains electrical transformer equipment within a fenced area, including three single-phase transformers, a circuit breaker, and a disconnect switch. A metal shop building near the transformer yard measures 20 by 20 feet, covering an area of 400 ft 2 . Access to the transformer yard is by unpaved road from the left abutment access road, or by stairway and footpath from the powerhouse.   12. Log boom  — An extensive log boom system is located on the reservoir about 300 feet upstream from the dam, consisting of logs cabled or chained together and anchored on both abutments. Provisions have been made for boat passage, and for periodic release of accumulated debris through the log boom and over the dam crest.   13. Maintenance shop and outbuildings  — Two wood-frame residences, a boat house, and a maintenance shop are located on the left abutment of the dam. The two-story residences each measure 25 by 35 feet in plan view, covering a combined area of 1,750 ft 2 . The maintenance shop measures 27 by 50 feet, covering an area of 1,350 ft 2 . The maintenance shop is one of the original construction camp buildings, and has the original blacksmith shop intact. The boat house measures 15 by 25 feet, with an area of 375 ft 2 .

ENGINEERING GEOLOGY    A. ELWHA DAM    The foundation of Elwha Dam primarily consists of a variably-cemented, gravel conglomerate bedrock of the Twin Rivers Group, which directly underlies the structure. The exception is the main gravity section in the old river channel which is founded on Elwha River alluvium. Two vertical exploration holes (DH-A4 and DH-A5) were drilled in the left abutment forebay area in 1994 for core sampling and determination of bedrock depth. The conglomerate appears to be massively bedded, and moderately to slightly fractured. Three distinct joint sets were observed in the core, with generally rough and planar to irregular surfaces, which are lightly-stained-to-coated with iron oxide minerals. The first joint set dipped 5-15 degrees with a typical spacing of 2-10 feet. The second joint set dipped 20-35 degrees with a typical spacing of 1-2 feet, but as wide as 11-13 feet. The third joint set dipped 50-65 degrees with a typical spacing of 1-8 feet.   Excavations within the generally moderately to strongly cemented conglomerate are expected to produce stable, near-vertical cutslopes. Localized zones of more intense fracturing may be encountered near the blast hole locations from 1913, which may inhibit the effectiveness of blasting and result in local over-excavation. A top-of-bedrock contour map was developed for the damsite based on geologic mapping of bedrock outcrops, drill hole data, and available information from project drawings and records, and is included in  Geologic Design Data Report for Removal of Elwha Dam  (Reclamation, May 1996).   Following failure of the dam foundation and loss of the reservoir in October 1912, the forebay area immediately upstream from the dam was backfilled in stages between 1913 and 1919 to restore the reservoir and reduce seepage losses through the foundation. Heavy blasting of both canyon walls was performed in 1913 to produce material to plug an open gap beneath the main gravity section resulting from blowout of the foundation alluvium. An estimated 50,000 yd 3  of rockfill was deposited into the river channel, with the boulders ranging in size from 2 to 40 tons, although considerable smaller-size material would also have been produced by the blast. An additional 6,000 yd 3  of rockfill was excavated from the approach channel for the south (right) spillway and dumped into the river channel upstream from the dam prior to the blast. A thick blanket of fir mattresses (bundles of boughs) was placed on top of the rockfill within 150 feet of the dam to help reduce the seepage beneath the main gravity section, and was overlain by loose rock and earth (silt, sand, and gravel with cobbles and minor boulders) from 1913-14. Hydraulic fill was mined from glacial deposits on the right abutment high above the dam using high-pressure water jets, and transported to the forebay area through a network of flumes and pipelines from 1918-19. Laboratory testing of drill hole samples of the hydraulic fill indicates an average gradation of 66 percent sand, 24 percent gravel, and 10 percent non-plastic, silty fines.   A review of construction photographs suggests cobble-size materials, ranging up to 8 inches in diameter, may comprise 5-15 percent of the fill, and that wooden planks and timbers from the old flume system remain in the fill. In-place densities of all channel fill materials are expected to be low, possibly 70 to 80 pounds per cubic foot (lbs/ft 3 ), with specific gravities of about 2.64. Excavations through granular materials will likely have to be laid back to 2:1 slopes or flatter to insure stability of the fill materials in open cuts.   Bathymetric surveys of the Lake Aldwell forebay area indicated the presence of an irregular, hummocky lobe of landslide material completely blocking the Elwha River channel about 700 feet upstream from the dam, with an estimated volume of 15,000 yd 3  (lobe only). The surface elevation of the slide mass ranges from elevation of 165 feet on the left abutment to elevation of 150 feet over much of the length of the lobe, with a crest length of about 125 feet and a maximum width of about 110 feet. An apparent lack of surface erosion suggests the landslide is relatively young in age and probably dates from initial filling of the reservoir or later.   The landslide materials are probably derived from the granular glacial sediments exposed upslope from the slide mass. Representative exposures of glacial sediments were estimated to contain 50 percent sand, 35 percent gravel, 10 percent non-plastic fines, and about 5 percent cobble with a trace of plus-12-inch boulders. A considerable amount of excavation may be required to achieve a stable slope within the saturated landslide materials. Reservoir draw-down rates during dam removal may have to be limited to allow time for drainage of the landslide materials, to reduce the potential for further landsliding. A reconnaissance-level review of the reservoir rim in March 1995 did not locate any other areas prone to future landsliding. Much of the reservoir shoreline consists of bedrock outcrops or compact glacial sediments which are now considered stable.         B. GLINES CANYON DAM    The foundation of Glines Canyon Dam consists of a basalt bedrock of the Crescent Formation, which directly underlies the entire arch dam section and appurtenant structures. The basalt is very fine-grained with widely-spaced fracturing.   The forebay area was examined by the Pacific Northwest Regional Office dive team using a remotely-operated vehicle (ROV). The examination failed to locate the intake trashrack for the abandoned sluiceway, which is believed to be entombed within reservoir sediments. The ROV camera showed fine sediments at the dam with numerous water-logged trees and woody debris. Bathymetric surveys of the area indicate sediment accumulation to an elevation of 445 feet.           CHAPTER V. HYDROLOGY          A. ELWHA RIVER BASIN    The Elwha River is a coarse-bed stream located on the Olympic Peninsula of northwestern Washington. The river basin is the fourth largest on the peninsula (by drainage area) and has over 100 miles of tributary streams. The river flows northward 45 miles from the base of Mount Olympus to the Strait of Juan de Fuca near the City of Port Angeles, Washington. The river falls about 4,500 feet in elevation to sea level, and has an average annual instantaneous flow of about 1,500 cfs. The watershed has a drainage area of 325 square miles; 83 percent of which is within Olympic National Park. Within the park boundaries, the watershed is pristine and water quality is excellent. The climate of the area is characterized by mild, wet winters and relatively cool, dry summers. Average annual rainfall ranges from over 100 inches at the upper end of the watershed area to about 40 inches at the mouth.         B. NORMAL STREAMFLOW    Elwha Dam is located 4.9 river miles upstream from the mouth of the river, and Glines Canyon Dam is located 8.5 river miles upstream from Elwha Dam. Streamflow has been recorded for the Elwha River at the McDonald Bridge gauging station (USGS No. 12045500), located between the two dams and representing a watershed of 269 square miles, for the periods 1898–1902 and 1920-date.   Measurements from 1898-1926 represent unregulated, or natural, flows. Since 1927, the recorded flows reflect regulation by Glines Canyon Dam. Average daily and monthly discharges, by month, recorded at the McDonald Bridge gauge are provided in table 1. Average daily discharges for each calendar day are provided in table 2. A flow distribution for the Elwha River based on daily discharge records from 1920–90 is provided in table 3. Duration tables of two mean daily flows for each month, with exceedance probabilities, are provided in table 4.                     Table 1. — Mean Average Daily and Monthly Discharges, Elwha River †           Month        Daily Average        Monthly Average            Maximum        Minimum            October        *952        2,800        252            November        1,655        4,667        219            December        2,092        5,111        642            January        1,863        4,033        424            February        1,708        3,826        476            March        1,300        3,307        511            April        1,265        2,210        689            May        1,935        3,333        962            June        2,293        4,096        922            July        1,559        2,917        595            August        846        1,642        434            September        618        1,331        330          Source: USGS; measured at the McDonald Bridge gauging station (USGS No. 12045500)     † Period of record Water Years 1898-1901, 1919-94; adjusted for storage since 1927.

FLOODS    Floods in the Elwha River basin are generally the product of rain on saturated ground, and in rare cases, rain on snow-covered ground. The major floods recorded at the stream gauge have generally occurred between November and March, which coincides with the rainy season. Approximately 75 percent of the average annual rainfall occurs during these five months. The largest flood peak ever recorded on the Elwha River was 41,600 cfs on November 18, 1898, which was prior to the construction of the dams. Since dam construction, the largest flood peak recorded was 30,000 cfs on November 26, 1950. Base flow conditions reflect ground-water discharge, and melting of glaciers and residual snowpacks at the higher elevations within the basin.   Frequency floods having 15-day durations were developed for the drainage areas above Glines Canyon Dam, between Glines Canyon and Elwha Dams, and from Elwha Dam to the mouth, for recurrence intervals of 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 500 years (Reclamation, March 1995a). Seasonal flood hydrographs were also developed for the July through October period at Glines Canyon Dam, having probabilities of occurrence of 50, 20, 10, and 5 percent. The computed frequency flood peaks are provided in Tables 5 and 6. The flood hydrographs are provided in Figures 6 through 9.   Both reservoirs on the Elwha River are operated as run-of-the-river projects, with little or no effect on flood peaks. Glines Canyon Dam impounds Lake Mills, which has a surface area of 415 acres and a storage capacity of about 40,500 acre feet at elevation of 590.33 feet (Interior and Commerce, 1994). Capacity and area curves for Lake Mills are provided in Figure 10. Current sediment estimates for Lake Mills would reduce the total storage capacity by about 7,800 acre feet, nearly 20 percent. Elwha Dam impounds Lake Aldwell, which has a surface area of 267 acres and a storage capacity of about 8,100 acre feet at elevation of 197.0 feet (Interior and Commerce, 1994). Area and capacity curves for Lake Aldwell are not available. Revised area and capacity curves for both reservoirs will be developed using final design, based on latest survey data. Current sediment estimates for Lake Aldwell would reduce the total storage capacity by about 2,400 acre feet, nearly 30 percent.         Table 5. — Frequency Flood Peaks, Elwha River  (in cfs)            Recurrence      Interval        Above Glines      Canyon Dam      (255 square miles)        Between Glines and Elwha      (63 square miles)        Elwha Dam      to Mouth      (7 square miles)            2-year        11,821        1,381        505            5-year        19,204        2,243        821            10-year        25,017        2,922        1,069            25-year        33,440        3,905        1,429            50-year        40,519        4,732        1,731            100-year        48,307        5,641        2,064            200-year        56,886        6,643        2,431            500-year        69,578        8,126        2,973                  Table 6. — Seasonal Flood Peaks Above Glines Canyon Dam, Elwha River  (in cfs)            Probability of Occurrence      (percent)         Seasonal Flood Peak      (July-October)            50        4,431            20        7,263            10        9,781            5        12,689          Figure 6. — Flood Hydrographs, Elwha River at Glines Canyon Dam     Available only in full-page 2nd generation hard copy          Figure 7. — Flood Hydrographs, Glines Canyon Dam to Elwha Dam   Full-page 2nd generation hard copy          Figure 8. — Flood Hydrographs, Elwha Dam to Mouth of Elwha River   Full-page 2nd generation hard copy                Figure 9. — Seasonal Flood Hydrographs, Elwha River at Glines Canyon Dam   Full-page 2nd generation hard copy  insert     Figure 10. — Capacity and Area Curves, Glines Canyon Dam    Full-page 2nd generation hard copy                 CHAPTER VI. DISCUSSION OF DAM REMOVAL ALTERNATIVES          A. PREVIOUS STUDIES    1. FERC Draft Staff Report  — The  Draft Staff Report  was issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Office of Hydropower Licensing in March 1993. The  Draft Staff Report  was prepared in response to applications submitted by James River II, Inc. (now James River Corporation) for licenses to operate and maintain the Glines Canyon Hydroelectric Project (FERC No. 588) and the Elwha Hydroelectric Project (FERC No. 2683). The  Draft Staff Report  includes an evaluation of the potential natural resource benefits, economic costs, and environmental impacts of dam-retention and dam-removal alternatives. Dam-removal alternatives were originally prepared for the damowner by Hosey & Associates Engineering Company (1989). Staff-formulated approaches to dam removal are documented in the  Draft Staff Report . Diversion tunnels were recommended at both damsites for the passage of flood flows up to 3,500 cfs, corresponding to the estimated 10-year, July to September flood. All concrete structures were to be demolished using drill and blast methods, with the rubble used for restoration of site topography or hauled to off-site disposal areas. Estimated costs for the diversion tunnel and structure removal amounted to $12.3 million at Elwha Dam and $5.5 million at Glines Canyon Dam, for a combined estimated cost of $17.8 million(in 1990 dollars). Details of the dam removal alternatives for both damsites are described in Appendix A, Parts 3 and 4 of the  Draft Staff Report .   2. The Elwha Report  —  The Elwha Report  was prepared by agencies of the Departments of the Interior and Commerce, and by representatives of the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe (Tribe), pursuant to Public Law 102-495 for the restoration of the Elwha River ecosystem and native anadromous fisheries. The dam removal alternatives presented in  The Elwha Report  were originally prepared by consultants to the Tribe, Summit Technology Consulting Engineers, Inc. (November 1991). These studies also assumed the removal of all existing structures from both damsites, using drill and blast methods. Streamflow diversion was to be provided by various methods, for the passage of flood flows up to 5,000 cfs, corresponding to the estimated 2-year, 7-day average flood. Both projects were to be removed concurrently, over a period of 2 to 3 years. Estimated costs for a surface diversion channel and structure removal at Elwha Dam amounted to $8.6 million, and estimated costs for a low-level diversion and structure removal at Glines Canyon Dam amounted to $8.4 million, for a combined estimated cost of $17 million (in 1992 dollars). Details of the dam removal alternatives for both damsites are described in Appendix F of  The Elwha Report  (Interior and Commerce, 1994).   The Elwha Report  notes that different vertical control datums were used for the original construction of Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams. Original elevations for the Elwha Project, recorded on as-built and report drawings, were reported to be 8 feet lower than the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929. Conversely, original elevations for the Glines Canyon Project were reported to be 19.67 feet higher than the NGVD datum. Recent soundings of Lake Mills and reaches of the Elwha River used the NGVD datum. For clarity,  The Elwha Report  related all project feature elevations to the 1929 NGVD datum, referred to as mean sea level. Recent site surveys performed by Reclamation suggest the Elwha project datum is 9.5 feet lower than the NGVD datum.   B. ELWHA DAM REMOVAL ALTERNATIVES    The previous studies for the removal of Elwha Dam required the removal of all structures from the site, including the concrete gravity (main dam) section, intake structure, penstocks, surge tank, powerhouse, and both spillways. Reclamation identified minimum removal requirements at the Elwha damsite for fish passage and public safety, but the cultural significance of the site to the Tribe supported full removal of all features.   Various alternatives for dam removal have been categorized by the method of streamflow diversion used. Previous studies presented in the  Draft Staff Report ,  The Elwha Report , and supporting documents, and recent studies performed by the Dam Removal Task Group, considered several streamflow diversion methods for removal of Elwha Dam, as discussed below.   1. Diversion Tunnel  — The  Draft Staff Report  recommended construction of a 12-foot-diameter, 980-foot-long, concrete-lined tunnel through the left (north) abutment of Elwha Dam (left of the spillway), in combination with incremental notching of the main dam section, for streamflow diversion. A lake tap would be used to extend the tunnel excavation to the reservoir, and a 10- by 14-foot wheel-mounted gate would be installed within a concrete-lined shaft to provide flow control. The reservoir would be drawn down in 5-foot stages by alternating excavations at the north and south spillways to an elevation of 150 feet, after which time the reservoir would be completely drained (during the low flow period) and the main dam and channel fill materials would be removed. The diversion tunnel alternative was believed to afford the greatest degree of downstream safety during the dam-removal and sediment-control activities. This was due to its ability to control reservoir levels and safely pass high flows while minimizing the potential for uncontrolled release of water and sediment through the potentially unstable channel fill materials. Controlled-demolition and surface diversion-channel alternatives were considered to be less reliable. The estimated cost for the diversion tunnel and structure removal was $12.3 million (1990 dollars).   The Elwha Report  proposed a diversion tunnel through the right (south) abutment of Elwha Dam (right of the spillway), with an intake located upstream of the fill material behind the main dam section and an outlet about 250 feet downstream of the dam. An additional 220-foot-long pipe extension would convey the water beyond a downstream cofferdam. The diversion tunnel would be about 900 feet long and would have a finished diameter of 13 feet. The principal features would include a lake tap, gate shaft with bonneted roller-gate, concrete-lined tunnel, and energy-dissipating structure. Following construction of the diversion tunnel, reservoir levels would be lowered and streamflow would completely bypass the demolition area. The lake tap inlet would be lowered in 10-foot stages by controlled blasting as the reservoir is drawn down. The tunnel and shaft would be plugged following restoration of the river to its natural channel. The estimated cost for the diversion tunnel and structure removal was $14.5 million (1992 dollars).   The Dam Removal Task Group believes significant risk and expense would be associated with the construction of a temporary diversion tunnel at Elwha Dam. Excavation and disturbance of the bedrock was also identified as a concern by the Tribe, due to its cultural significance. Since other streamflow-diversion methods would be technically feasible at a lower cost, the diversion tunnel alternative was eliminated from further consideration.   2. Surface Diversion Channel  —  The Elwha Report  also proposed the excavation of a surface diversion channel on the left (north) abutment to permit streamflow to bypass the dam structures, with reservoir levels controlled by diversion-channel elevations. The reservoir would first be lowered using the existing power penstocks and south spillway (on the right abutment). A cofferdam would be constructed upstream of the north spillway (on the left abutment) to permit removal of the spillway structure and excavation of a diversion channel through bedrock to elevation of 135 feet (20 feet lower than proposed in the  Draft Staff Report ). The cofferdam would be constructed of reinforced rockfill for overtopping protection, with an impermeable geomembrane located on the upstream face. The reservoir would be lowered further by staged excavation of the upstream cofferdam and streamflow diversion through the excavated channel, to permit removal of the remaining structures. Following removal of the dam and restoration of the natural river channel, the diversion channel would be backfilled and revegetated. The estimated cost for the surface diversion channel and structure removal was $8.6 million (1992 dollars).   The Dam Removal Task Group selected this basic alternative for further development, based on anticipated costs and likelihood of success. Although higher channel elevations were considered, requiring less rock excavation and larger cofferdams, the analyses favored the deeper rock-cut channel for streamflow diversion, allowing more of the channel fill excavation to be performed under dry conditions.   3. Other Alternatives  — A significant concern for the removal of Elwha Dam is the potential instability of the channel fill materials placed to cutoff seepage beneath the dam during its early history (1912-19; see Appendix A), which if disturbed, could produce a piping failure of the dam foundation similar to that which occurred in 1912. Several options which address this concern were evaluated by the Dam Removal Task Group and are discussed below.  a. River Channel Realignment  — This option would provide a new river channel through the bedrock on the left (north) abutment, along the existing alignment of the north spillway. The new channel would be excavated as necessary to meet fish-passage criteria. The technical advantage of this option is that it avoids disturbing the existing dam and upstream channel fill blanket materials, and thus the potential for piping failure is no greater than under the existing conditions (i.e., minimal). However, this alternative was determined to be unacceptable due to its failure to restore the natural river channel and significant cultural sites within the dam and forebay area, and its excessive excavation and disturbance of bedrock (also of cultural significance).   b. Upstream Cutoff at Dam  — Another option consists of driving large diameter (5-6 feet) piles through the channel fill at the upstream face of the dam and into the bedrock, to reduce the seepage flow and blowout potential during excavation of the channel fill. Although the piles would be driven as close together as possible, a positive seal between the piles would not be provided. Advancing the piles through the rockfill, boulders, and logs in the channel fill could be very difficult, and its effectiveness in controlling seepage beneath the dam could be minimal.   Professor Arthur Casagrande described the effects of imperfect cutoffs and provided equations for calculating cutoff efficiency (Casagrande, 1961). Assuming the depth of channel fill to be cutoff is 70 feet, the base width of the dam is 97 feet, eleven 6-foot-diameter piles are required to cross the channel at the upstream face of the dam, and an average ¼-inch gap remains between the individual piles, the cutoff efficiency would only be 28 percent. That is, 72 percent of the seepage flow occurring without the cutoff piles would still pass through the gaps in the pile wall. If the number of piles required and/or the average width of the gaps increased, the cutoff efficiency would drop to even lower values. Thus, with the potential difficulties in installing the piles, and the questionable effectiveness of the resulting cutoff, this option would not appear to be feasible.   c. Foundation Stabilization at Dam  — A third option includes backfilling the void beneath the dam with cement grout or tremie concrete to stabilize the dam foundation. This option may be difficult to achieve due to the large seepage flow in the channel fill. A material with a controlled set-time (such as a chemical grout) or admixtures would be needed to accelerate the setting time of cement grout or concrete. Shannon and Wilson, Inc. (1968) drilled four holes through the dam in 1967. Three of these holes penetrated the upstream face of the dam at different elevations. Based on the water levels measured in these holes, it was concluded that the primary water barrier is the concrete channel lining (gunite), hydraulic fill, and fir mattresses above elevation of 148 feet, and that the underlying rockfill is essentially free-draining. Shannon and Wilson recommended that no attempt be made to backfill or grout the void space beneath the dam, because this would significantly reduce the existing drainage, change the flow paths, and possibly initiate piping of the underlying sands and gravels. This appears to be a sound interpretation of the data that was collected, and any such treatment would have to strengthen the existing materials below and downstream of the void, as well as fill the void itself.   d. Downstream Berm at Dam  — Construction of a rockfill berm against the toe of the dam was considered to stabilize the foundation of the structure so that the upstream fill could be breached, and the dam notched down, in a controlled fashion. When the dam was reconstructed in 1913, the downstream area was first filled in and a stable-though-pervious condition was attained with the reservoir at an elevation of 118 feet. It appears that the upper 20 feet of the downstream fill has been eroded since the reconstruction due to spillway discharges. If this free-draining fill were to be replaced and strengthened to provide an appropriate safety factor for the higher water level that would exist when the fir mattresses were breached, a stable condition would result. The upstream fill would be slowly breached to monitor the piezometric levels within the dam and the downstream flows. If the piezometric levels and downstream flows increased, it would be necessary to wait until the reservoir recedes and the flows reduce before proceeding with the excavation. Several problems were identified for this option, including:    · the berm would have to resist streamflows and possibly flood flows during notching of the dam,   · a source of rockfill would be needed for the berm construction, and   · removal of the berm materials would be required following demolition of the dam.     e. Restore Sluiceways for Low-level Outlets  — The existing concrete gravity section includes four 5- by 10-foot sluiceway openings with an invert at elevation of 121.5 feet. Although these openings were plugged with concrete within 10 feet of the original iron gates on the upstream face, the plugs could be removed and the low-level release capacity restored with the necessary excavation of the upstream channel fill materials. This upstream excavation within potentially unstable materials could result in a requirement for the passage of flows down a steep-cut slope, unless the iron gates could be restored or replaced to control streamflows. A downstream stability berm would be required to prevent blowout of the foundation materials under the higher reservoir heads. This option presented several technical concerns with no apparent cost savings.   C. GLINES CANYON DAM REMOVAL ALTERNATIVES    The previous studies for the removal of Glines Canyon Dam required the removal of all structures from the site, including the arch dam, thrust block, gravity section, embankment dikes, gated spillway, intake structure, gatehouse, penstock, surge tank, and powerhouse. For the current studies, Reclamation identified minimum removal requirements at the site for fish passage and public safety. The thrust block, gated spillway, and powerhouse were proposed to be retained to minimize the costs of dam removal and provide opportunities for cultural and historical interpretation of the site. Since the dam is currently listed in the National Register of Historic Places, this would help minimize the loss of historic resources.   Various alternatives for dam removal have been categorized by the method of streamflow diversion used. Previous studies presented in the  Draft Staff Report ,  The Elwha Report , and recent studies performed by the Dam Removal Task Group, considered several streamflow diversion methods for removal of Glines Canyon Dam, as discussed below.   1. Diversion tunnel  — The  Draft Staff Report  recommended the construction of a 12-foot-diameter, 925-foot-long, concrete-lined tunnel through the left abutment of Glines Canyon Dam, in combination with incremental notching of the main dam section, for streamflow diversion. A lake tap would be used to extend the tunnel excavation to the reservoir, and a 9- by 12-foot wheel-mounted gate would be installed within a concrete-lined shaft to provide flow control. The reservoir would be drawn down in 5-foot stages by alternating excavations between the left and right sides of the concrete arch, with the concrete blasted into the river channel below. Floods in excess of the capacity of the notches and diversion tunnel would overtop the remaining crest of the dam. The additional release capacity of a low-level diversion tunnel was recommended for a conservative estimate without further investigations. The report indicated the most economically desirable option could be simply to lower the dam incrementally using the existing bypass capacity. Other diversion options studied included a surface diversion channel to the existing intake structure, and the construction of a low-level outlet through the arch dam. The majority of the demolition work was to be performed during the low-flow period from July through September. The estimated cost for the diversion tunnel and structure removal was $5.5 million (1990 dollars).   The Elwha Report  proposed a diversion tunnel through the left (west) abutment of Glines Canyon Dam, with an intake near the existing power tunnel intake and an outlet about 100 feet downstream of the powerplant. The diversion tunnel would be about 800 feet long and would have a finished diameter of 13 feet. The principal features would include a lake tap, gate shaft with bonneted roller-gate, concrete-lined tunnel, and energy-dissipating structure. Following construction of the diversion tunnel, reservoir levels would be lowered and streamflow would completely bypass the demolition area. The lake tap inlet would be lowered in 10-foot stages by controlled blasting as the reservoir is drawn down. A cofferdam constructed just upstream of the tunnel outlet would permit construction of a haul road to the base of the dam for removal of concrete rubble. The diversion tunnel and gate shaft would be plugged following removal of the dam. The estimated cost for the diversion tunnel and structure removal was $12.4 million (1992 dollars).   The Dam Removal Task Group believes significant risk and expense would be associated with the construction of a temporary diversion tunnel at Glines Canyon Dam. Since other streamflow diversion methods would be technically feasible at a lower cost, the diversion tunnel alternative was eliminated from further consideration.   2. Low-level Diversion  —  The Elwha Report  includes an alternative to enlarge the existing 5-foot-diameter sluiceway outlet in the arch dam section. Construction of an enlarged hole through the arch dam would alter stress patterns in the concrete structure. A finite element analysis of the structure by R. W. Beck and Associates in  The Elwha Report  indicated a 10-foot-diameter conduit (13-foot-diameter excavation) constructed through the arch dam would not overstress the concrete or cause a rupture of the structure. Construction of the new outlet would require the underwater removal of the existing trashrack and lake sediments, and the installation of a large steel bulkhead on the upstream face of the dam. Reservoir releases would continue to be made through the power penstock until completion of the new outlet. Reservoir releases through the new outlet would be controlled to an elevation of 460 feet by a 117-inch-diameter fixed-cone valve. Below elevation of 460 feet, streamflow would pass through gated notches in the remaining portion of the dam in a progressive stepped approach, as described below. The estimated cost for the low-level outlet and structure removal was $8.4 million (1992 dollars).   The  Draft Staff Report  briefly described a similar diversion alternative, requiring a new 7.5-foot-diameter outlet through the arch section with a 6-foot-diameter regulating valve for low-level releases, but structural analyses were not performed to confirm feasibility.   Although the Dam Removal Task Group felt this alternative would be technically feasible, the element of risk associated with underwater construction, and the probable interference of debris and sediments at the upstream face of the dam on the bulkhead installation and operation of the outlet, would be of concern. There did not seem to be a clear advantage in construction costs for this alternative, and design costs would be higher for the necessary finite element analyses.   3. Notches Through Dam  — A third alternative proposed in  The Elwha Report  would allow streamflow to pass through gated notches in the dam structure at various elevations, allowing reservoir levels to be progressively lowered in stages. After lowering the reservoir using the spillway and power penstock, the portion of the structure above the reservoir level would be demolished and removed, using either a barge or a boom crane. This concept assumes the power penstock would first be modified at the powerplant by the installation of an 11-foot-diameter fixed-cone valve for reservoir releases above elevation of 515 feet. Construction of nine gated notches at 12.5-foot intervals between sill elevations 490 and 390 feet (streambed) was assumed to require the underwater installation of a large steel bulkhead at each notch location. An 18- by 25-foot slide gate would be installed at the upstream end of each notch to facilitate removal of the bulkhead and to regulate releases for sediment management. A stability analysis of the arch dam was performed to demonstrate safe passage of a 25,000 cfs flow through a 17-foot-wide by 25-foot-deep notch with 15 feet of surcharge over the dam crest. The estimated cost for the structure removal utilizing gated notches was $9.1 million (1992 dollars).   The recommended alternative in the  Draft Staff Report  included incremental notching of the dam in combination with the construction of a diversion tunnel. The notches would each cover one-half the crest length of the dam, alternating from side to side at 10-foot intervals to the riverbed.   The Dam Removal Task Group selected this basic alternative for further development, based on anticipated costs and likelihood of success. Elimination of the proposed powerplant modifications for installation of an 11-foot-diameter fixed-cone valve would lower the estimated cost in  The Elwha Report  to about $7.6 million. Penstock releases could be controlled by the existing wicket gates, with the turbine runner removed to ensure operating capability under no-load conditions. A non-gated notch alternative which could be constructed without an upstream bulkhead could produce further cost savings, provided the objectives of the sediment management plan could still be achieved.   4. Other Alternatives  — The  Draft Staff Report  and  The Elwha Report  briefly discussed a channel bypass alternative which would use the existing power intake and penstock for streamflow diversion. A small diversion embankment would divert flows at the upper end of the reservoir into a trapezoidal channel running along the west edge of the reservoir for 8,000 to 9,000 feet. The  Draft Staff Report  indicated the channel would have a 23-foot bottom width and 1:1 sideslopes, with a capacity of 3,500 cfs. Numerous potential problems and very high construction costs were identified for this alternative, and no further studies were performed.   The Dam Removal Task Group looked at potential variations of the basic dam removal alternatives for Glines Canyon Dam documented in the earlier reports. Construction sequence, structure removal requirements, concrete demolition methods, and waste disposal opportunities were all investigated.   Previous studies assumed a construction sequence for which both dams would be removed at the same time, to shorten the overall construction schedule. However, if the removal of Glines Canyon Dam did not begin until after the removal of Elwha Dam, a flood surcharge space could be provided in the upstream reservoir (Lake Mills) to provide a flood control benefit for the Elwha Dam operations. Downstream releases could then be regulated using the spillway gates and power penstock at Glines Canyon Dam, to reduce the river control costs for removal of Elwha Dam. The relatively small storage capacity of the downstream reservoir (Lake Aldwell) would reduce its potential value as a sediment trap for removal of Glines Canyon Dam first, and anadromous fish passage upstream from Freshwater Bay is not improved until Elwha Dam is removed. The recommended dam removal plan retains Glines Canyon Dam until the completion of the surface diversion channel at Elwha Dam, for flood control benefits during the early excavation operations. Dam removal at both sites would be completed by November of the second year.   Minimum structure removal requirements for river restoration at Glines Canyon Dam include the removal of the majority of the arch dam section between the rock abutments and above the streambed. Portions of the arch dam abutments and base could possibly remain to the extent they are shown to be stable and outside minimum channel limits to accommodate flood flows and fish passage.   To ensure public safety, the log boom, trashrack tower, and surge tank tower should be removed, and the openings for the power penstock tunnel and gate shaft should be sealed. In addition, minimum removal requirements include the removal of any hazardous materials and much of the electrical equipment from the powerplant area, including transmission poles and overhead wires. The left abutment spillway and the right abutment thrust block, gravity section, and earthfill embankment may be left intact to serve as a public overlook for interpretation of the damsite, and the powerplant structure may be modified to serve as an interpretive center. The existing wood-frame structures on the left abutment may be found to be useful during and following construction for various purposes.   Previous studies assumed concrete demolition would be performed using conventional drill-and-blast techniques. A variety of alternative demolition methods were evaluated for the current studies, including diamond-wire sawcutting, stitch drilling, chemical splitting, hoe-ramming, high-pressure water-blasting, flame-cutting, and combinations of these methods (see Appendix F). The diamond-wire sawcutting and hoe-ramming methods of concrete demolition seemed to provide some potential advantages, warranting further study. Diamond-wire sawcutting was extensively used to breach Waddell Dam, a multiple-arch concrete dam in Arizona, under a negotiated contract for Reclamation. Bluebird Dam, a 58-foot-high concrete arch dam located within the Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado, was completely demolished using a boom-mounted hydraulic impact hammer (""hoe-ram"").   The size and shape of concrete waste materials, and the associated handling and disposal requirements, are dependent upon the material composition (strength and presence of reinforcing steel) and demolition method selected. While concrete rubble would result from blasting and hoe-ramming, sawcutting would produce smooth-faced blocks of large sizes. Previous studies assumed concrete rubble would be removed using a barge on the reservoir, or trucks on a downstream haul road within the river channel. A downstream haul would only be feasible when streamflow diversion is provided by the power penstock or by a diversion tunnel, and would be located between the existing powerplant and the base of the arch dam section. The removal of Bluebird Dam used air-lifting extensively, while large cranes or cableways could serve the narrow Glines Canyon site effectively. Conveyor belts would possibly be feasible for shorter haul distances and for smaller materials. Waste materials would be disposed of in either land or ocean sites, or commercial uses could be found for some of the materials. Steel items could probably be salvaged for recycling, and possibly some of the equipment could be salvaged for its historical or commercial value.           CHAPTER VII. PROPOSED PLANS FOR DAM REMOVAL          The Dam Removal Task Group developed the following dam removal plans for the feasibility-level designs and cost estimates. These plans are considered to be technically feasible, economical, and compatible with the sediment management plans and project objectives. Negotiated procurement is recommended for future contracting of the demolition work, by which technical proposals would be solicited for selection based on both technical merit and cost (see Chapter XI). This contracting process has been successfully used by Reclamation for many projects, and should result in the optimum dam removal plan.         A. ELWHA DAM    1. Decommissioning of powerplant  — This would include any work at the Elwha Dam powerplant required in advance of the dam removal contract work, including de-energizing the electrical equipment, preparing selected equipment for long-term storage, removing hazardous materials, re-routing transmission lines, replacing the grounding grid for the electric power utility, and removing smaller items of historical value. The turbine runners would be removed from the two vertical units (3 and 4) to permit no-load releases through the 15-foot-diameter penstock. This work would be performed under contract. Hazardous waste collection and disposal is covered in Chapter VIII, Section A.   2. Site access and mobilization  — The right (south) abutment of Elwha Dam can be accessed by an existing, unpaved road off of State Highway 112, located just east of a bridge over the Elwha River. Site access improvements may be required for approximately 0.4 miles of permanent road, for widening as necessary to accommodate construction traffic, and for normal maintenance of the roadway surface and drainage culverts during the contract period. No other improvements to the existing road are anticipated.   Access to the left abutment of Elwha Dam is currently provided by an existing single-lane timber bridge across the dam crest from the right abutment. This access will disappear soon after the dam removal work begins. Alternate access may be provided by an old horse trail/logging road crossing the left abutment ridge from Dan Kelly Road off of State Highway 112, across public (Washington State Department of Natural Resources) and private land. Significant improvements to the roadway width and grade would be required for a distance of over 1.2 miles for this trail to be used for equipment travel, including the construction of at least one culvert crossing to reroute a small creek. Although the cost estimate for dam removal assumes the use of a floating bridge (""flexifloat"") for construction access to the left abutment for a period of time before the reservoir is drained (currently estimated at 75 days), the alternate left abutment access road should be investigated further during final design.   Temporary haul roads will be required to be established within the forebay area for excavation of the channel fill materials, with a small allowance included in the cost estimate. Maximum grades should generally not exceed 12 percent.   Mobilization costs are estimated to represent about 5 percent of the cost of dam removal, and would include costs for a dragline and two large mobile cranes with 200-foot booms. Crane pads will be required on the intake structure for removal of the left (north) spillway gates and the penstocks, on the right abutment for removal of the south spillway gates, and near the powerhouse for removal of the mechanical and electrical equipment. Construction power is assumed to be supplied by a single 150 kVA engine-generator, although alternate sources of electric power may be available. The cost of supplying electric power from the local utility or from the Bonneville Power Administration should be investigated during final design.   The current estimate assumes no constraints on construction activities will be necessary for protection of threatened and endangered species. Potential nesting sites for the spotted owl and marbled murrelet (both threatened and endangered species) exist near the State Highway 112 bridge and in the upper reservoir area. Observation of these nesting areas by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service occurred during the 1995 nesting season (May 1-August 15) and is planned for the same period in 1996. If these nests are found to be active, ""permits to take"" (issued by the Service) should be investigated in lieu of placing noise limits and other constraints on the construction activities. Estimates of blasting parameters for removal of Elwha Dam were developed by Reclamation for use in modeling environmental noise levels during construction. The results of this model are reported in Appendix G, ""Estimated Blasting Parameters for Noise Analysis — Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams.""   3. Streamflow diversion  — A surface diversion channel will be excavated through the left (north) spillway channel to lower the reservoir level for removal of the concrete gravity section from the original river channel and much of the fill material from the forebay area. Details of the proposed diversion plan are provided in the following paragraphs. The discharge capacity of the proposed surface diversion channel is shown in Figure 11. Average daily discharges are assumed for purposes of estimating reservoir levels and diversion requirements.   The contractor is assumed to begin site mobilization in November, continuing through the winter months. Glines Canyon Dam would be operated for flood control to the maximum possible extent during this period, passing normal inflow through the power penstock while using available reservoir storage in Lake Mills to reduce flood peaks. Lake Aldwell would be drawn down by March 1 to an elevation of 182 feet, using the right (south) spillway and the 15-foot-diameter penstock for reservoir releases. A temporary cofferdam (about 8-10 feet high) would be constructed within the left (north) spillway approach channel about 300 feet upstream from the dam for unwatering of the channel area to permit removal of the concrete lining (gunite cap). A double-wall sheet-pile cofferdam (about 20 feet high) would be constructed across the approach channel from the left abutment to the existing concrete block (within 100 feet of the north spillway), for construction access to a crane pad on the intake structure and for flood protection. The sheet-piles would be driven to bedrock to provide a positive cutoff. The north spillway gate structure would be removed, and a diversion channel would be excavated within bedrock to an elevation of 135 feet. A dragline would be used within the reservoir upstream of the sheet-pile cofferdam for excavation of the temporary cofferdam and channel fill materials (sands and gravels), as necessary, to establish a deeper approach channel.   Following the spring runoff (May and June), the reservoir would again be lowered to an elevation of 182 feet. The construction of a smaller gravity wall (about 8 to 10 feet high) immediately downstream of the sheet-pile cofferdam would permit the removal of the sheet-pile cofferdam under a balanced reservoir head. The cofferdam foundation would remain as a bedrock plug within the diversion channel. The right half of the gravity wall would be breached during the low-flow period (beginning in August), lowering the reservoir to an elevation of 174 feet (below the power penstock intake sill). The gravity wall could be constructed from precast concrete blocks (DoublewalÔ units) used previously for construction of the temporary cofferdam.   Using the left half of the gravity wall as a working platform, a portion of the bedrock plug would be excavated (by blasting) to a maximum depth of 15 feet below the water surface, releasing an instantaneous peak flow of up to 3,000 cfs and lowering the reservoir to an elevation of 167 feet within a matter of hours. Subsequent drilling and blasting of the channel plug in stages from the bedrock surface would lower the reservoir to elevations of 160, 152, 144, and 139 feet, within a 2-3 week period.   Streamflow diversion would continue through the newly excavated channel for one full year while the channel fill materials are removed. Reservoir levels for average streamflow conditions will vary between elevations of 138 and 144 feet. The excavated surface of the concrete gravity section would remain above the level of the channel fill for flood protection, until the channel fill becomes predominantly rockfill and erosion-resistant. After the channel fill materials have been excavated to about an elevation of 145 feet, the remaining portion of the concrete gravity section would be removed to an elevation of about 90 feet. During the low-flow period of the second year, excavation within the channel fill materials would progress below the water level within the diversion channel, resulting in the diversion of streamflow along its original course through the damsite. The river channel would be lowered in 2-foot increments along its full length until reaching the desired grade at an elevation of 95 feet. This work would be performed over a 3-month period from August through October.   4. Structure removal  — All concrete structures will be either removed or buried at Elwha Dam, and the left (north) spillway outlet channel will be backfilled to restore the site to approximate pre-dam conditions. Wood-frame structures will be retained for use during the demolition contract, then removed. All mechanical and electrical items, timber, glass, fencing, and hazardous materials will be removed from the site for disposal. The structure removal plan for Elwha Dam consists of four stages described below, and as depicted on drawings 1440-D-150 through -153 (Appendix C).   Stage One — Surface Diversion Channel Development  (see Drawing 1440-D-150)  a. With the reservoir at its normal level, provide construction access to the left abutment using a floating bridge (""flexifloat"") from the right abutment. Alternative access may be provided by a barge from the right abutment or from the Indian Creek boat ramp (located at the upper end of the reservoir), or by construction of a temporary access road from State Highway 112 along an existing trail (about 1.2 miles) as described in Section 2 above. Deliver a mobile crane, bulldozer, and other equipment as needed to the left abutment. Remove the log boom as required.   b. Draw the reservoir down to the lowest possible level using both spillways and the 15-foot-diameter penstock (units 3 and 4). (Glines Canyon Dam will be operated for flood control during this period to the maximum possible extent.)   c. Establish a temporary stockpile area on the left abutment with a storage capacity of about 3,400 yd 3 . Construct an access road to the left (north) spillway approach channel area (maximum 12 percent grade).   d. Construct an 8- to 10-foot-high temporary cofferdam at the upstream end of the left (north) spillway approach channel as required to unwater the channel area. Twenty-four precast concrete DoublewalÔ units (or a similar product), backfilled with pervious sand and gravel were assumed for the cost estimate. Each precast unit is 4 feet high, 8 feet long, and 8 feet wide, with a weight of about 5 tons. Remove the exposed concrete channel lining (gunite cap) between the temporary cofferdam and the north spillway, and place the concrete rubble (about 300 yd 3 ) in the temporary stockpile area. Maintain diversion releases through the south (right) spillway and 15-foot-diameter penstock.   e. With the temporary cofferdam in place, construct from the left abutment a 20-foot-wide, double-wall sheet-pile cofferdam across the north spillway approach channel to the existing concrete block (elevation of 196 feet). Drive sheet piles through the existing fill (surface elevation of 175 feet) to refusal in bedrock (approximate elevation of 170 feet). Using tiebacks for structural support, backfill the sheet-pile cofferdam with clean sand and/or gravel from a local commercial source (assumed necessary to avoid the processing of available site materials). The total weight of sheet-piles and tiebacks assumed for the cost estimate is 200,000 pounds, with 2,000 yd 3  of pervious backfill required. Drill and blast any bedrock within the surface diversion channel limits upstream from the sheet-pile cofferdam foundation to an elevation of 135 feet, but leave the shotrock in place.   f. Permanently close the slide gates for the two 9.5-foot-diameter power penstocks. Construct a 40-foot-wide crane pad between the existing concrete block and the intake structure, using additional sheet piles and pervious backfill. Remove the temporary cofferdam from the approach channel before the reservoir rises, and stockpile the precast concrete units and backfill materials for later use.   g. Move the mobile crane with 200-foot boom from the left abutment, across the sheet-pile cofferdam, and onto the crane pad. Remove the 9.5-foot-diameter penstock pipe sections using cutting torches, a bulldozer, and the crane. Deliver the penstock pipe sections to the existing access bridge on the dam crest (or to an alternate location) for removal by a second mobile crane and subsequent delivery to a flatbed truck on the main access road.   h. Remove the four spillway gates and the gate hoist using the mobile cranes (as was done for the penstock pipe sections). Demolish the left (north) spillway gate structure and excavate the downstream portion of the diversion channel to invert elevation of 135 feet. Drill and blast the reinforced concrete structure in 1 or 2 shots, then blast the bedrock in 3 or 4 layers. Move an estimated 2,900 yd 3  of concrete rubble and 7,600 yd 3  of rock fill to the adjoining penstock site. Pile the waste materials outside the right wall of the left (north) spillway and upstream from the concrete wall at the powerhouse to a stable configuration, using a bulldozer. The stockpile area on the left abutment may also be used for temporary waste disposal. Concrete gravity walls downstream from the gate structure and outside the limits of the diversion channel may be left in place.         Stage Two — Streamflow Diversion and Powerhouse Demolition  (see Drawing 1440-D-151)   a. Construct a temporary gravity wall at the toe of the sheet-pile cofferdam (between the cofferdam and the cutslope for the diversion channel) to the reservoir surface elevation. Thirty-four precast concrete DoublewalÔ units (or a similar product) backfilled with pervious sand and gravel (as used for the upstream cofferdam) were assumed for the cost estimate.   b. Equalize the reservoir head on both sides of the sheet-pile cofferdam by filling the interspace between the cofferdam and the gravity wall with water. Breach the sheet-pile cofferdam by removing the sheet piles using a crane (starting at either end). Remove the sheet piles and backfill materials from the site. Leave the bedrock channel plug in place.   c. Breach the temporary gravity wall by removing 23 precast concrete units from the right half of the structure, and place 22 of the precast units at the upstream face of the left half of the structure (on the bedrock channel plug). This will provide a large working platform above the left half of the bedrock channel plug for operation of drilling equipment. Streamflow will begin to pass through the diversion channel above the bedrock surface (elevation of 170 feet), and possibly through the 15-foot-diameter penstock (depending upon the inflow rate).   d. Excavate an approach channel within the reservoir to an elevation of 135 feet, from the landslide area (approximately 800 feet upstream from the dam) to the bedrock channel plug. A bottom width of about 40 feet and 2:1 slopes in the existing hydraulic fill materials were assumed, representing an in-place volume of about 60,000 yd 3 . The northern channel slope will be formed by the existing bedrock face. The required excavation of the channel fill materials (sands and gravels) may be performed from a floating bridge or barge, using a dragline or clamshell. Excavated materials will either be hauled directly off-site to an approved disposal area, or placed temporarily within the right spillway approach channel for later removal. The cost estimate assumes the excavated materials are placed in the approach channel area for later removal.   e. With the upstream and downstream channels excavated to an elevation of 135 feet, begin controlled blasting of the bedrock channel plug in five stages from elevation of 170 feet to elevation of 135 feet. The first stage will be drilled from the working platform area, and will include removal of the precast concrete units and a portion of the bedrock to an elevation of 160 feet. A trapezoidal channel will be created with a bottom width of about 15 feet, and will lower the reservoir surface below an elevation of 170 feet. The second, third, and fourth stages will be drilled from the bedrock surface at an elevation of 170 feet, to elevations of 152, 144, and 135 feet, respectively. The fifth stage will remove the benches remaining from the previous stages to produce the final channel width of 30 feet, allowing the reservoir water levels to stabilize between each stage at increasingly lower elevations. Following each blast, excavated rock will be washed downstream, to be removed from the diversion channel and dumped onto the penstock site using the crane and a clamshell bucket. The total in-place volume of the bedrock within the diversion channel plug is about 2,400 yd 3 . (The removal of Glines Canyon Dam can begin following the successful completion of the diversion channel at Elwha Dam.) Sediment releases will be initiated from Lake Aldwell during this period.   f. Following lowering of the reservoir below the intake sill elevation, close the remaining slide gates and remove the 15-foot-diameter penstock using cutting torches, a bulldozer, and the crane.   g. Construct a temporary ramp fill from the existing concrete block (elevation of 196 feet) to the existing right spillway channel (elevation of 178 feet) at a maximum grade of 15 percent, using materials excavated for the upstream approach channel or other local materials within the forebay area. With the diversion channel safely established at elevation of 135 feet, move the crane down the temporary ramp to the right channel area. Remove the sheet-piles and pervious backfill used for the crane pad.   h. Using the crane on the right abutment or in the right channel area, demolish the south (right) spillway, and excavate the concrete gravity section to an elevation of 170 feet. Remove the timber access bridge, five spillway gates, and gate hoist using the crane(s) and remove the materials from the site using flatbed trucks. Drill and blast the reinforced concrete spillway structure in 1 or 2 shots, and excavate the upper portion of the concrete gravity section in 3 or 4 layers. Remove an estimated 2,200 yd 3  of reinforced concrete rubble from the spillway location, and an estimated 2,200 yd 3  of concrete rubble from the upper portion of the gravity section, to an approved disposal site. Also remove the remaining portions of the concrete channel lining (gunite cap) from the forebay area (400 yd 3 ).   i. Construct a short ramp and an access road from the right channel area, across the south spillway foundation and lowered gravity section, to the left abutment. Limit the maximum grade to 15 percent. The width of the gravity section at an elevation of 170 feet is about 28 feet. Move the crane from the right channel area to a left abutment crane pad above the existing powerhouse.   j. Construct a downstream cofferdam within the river between the powerhouse and the spillway channel as needed to unwater the powerhouse tailrace area. An estimated volume of 3,500 yd 3  would be required to provide an embankment having a 10-foot crest width and 2:1 slopes. Install a geomembrane lining to serve as a water barrier.   k. Remove the surge tank, remaining portions of the penstocks, and all mechanical and electrical equipment from the powerhouse using the left abutment crane and bulldozer. The larger items must be cut down to more manageable sizes for handling purposes. Place items at a suitable point for removal using the right abutment crane, or for hauling directly from the site in trucks across the lowered gravity section. Remove all window glass from the powerhouse. Demolish the powerhouse superstructure and dump an estimated 2,600 yd 3  of reinforced concrete rubble onto the penstock site. Blast the powerhouse substructure concrete (5,000 yd 3 ) into the tailrace basin. This will minimize hauling requirements and provide suitable materials for channel backfill at the site.         Stage Three — Dam and Hydraulic Fill Removal  (See Drawing 1440-D-152)  a. Move the crane from the left abutment across the lowered concrete gravity section to the right channel area. Leave the bulldozer on the left abutment. Remove the temporary ramp fill (from stage two) and excavate the upstream channel (hydraulic fill) materials in the dry to an elevation of 145 feet. Fill materials will mainly consist of sands and gravels, but may include some larger rockfill and the fir mattresses, for an estimated in-place volume of 50,000 yd 3 . Temporary haul roads must be established within the channel for hauling fill materials to the main access road. Also demolish the concrete block between the left and right channels, and dump an estimated 1,900 yd 3  of concrete rubble onto the penstock site.   b. Demolish the remaining portion of the concrete gravity (main dam) section in lifts to an elevation of 90 feet. The excavated surface of the gravity section should remain above the level of the upstream channel fill materials for flood protection purposes, until the channel fill near the dam becomes predominantly rockfill and erosion-resistant. The feasibility design assumes rockfill will be encountered at an elevation of about 145 feet, at which point the gravity section can be removed to the final grade. A 2:1 slope is assumed in the rockfill between elevation of 145 feet and elevation of 90 feet just upstream from the dam, bounded by the existing rock cliffs on both ends. An estimated 14,500 yd 3  of concrete rubble (based on an assumed swell factor of 1.35) will be removed from the dam, to be dumped onto the penstock site using the crane and a skipfor later placement as backfill within the diversion channel.   c. Perform any final shaping or excavation work necessary within the river channel between the damsite and the downstream cofferdam, especially the concrete rubble at the powerhouse site, and possibly the concrete-filled caisson near the toe of the gravity section. Breach the downstream cofferdam and place the rockfill/riprap along the left side of the river channel for future erosion protection. Remove the geomembrane liner.         Stage Four — Final Channel Excavation and Site Cleanup  (see Drawing 1440-D-153)  a. Following the spring runoff period (May and June), excavate the rockfill materials within the original river channel from the damsite to the diversion channel in about 2-foot increments from elevation of 145 to 135 feet, diverting streamflow from the diversion channel to the original river channel. A portion of the excavated materials may have to be stockpiled at the penstock site above the diversion channel for subsequent backfilling of the channel.   b. During the low-flow period (August through October), complete the excavation of channel fill materials along the original river channel and through the upstream landslide area as required to establish the final streambed grade. The total in-place volume of channel fill materials below elevation of 145 feet is estimated to be about 45,000 yd 3  of rockfill (near the dam) and about 45,000 yd 3  of sands and gravels (further upstream).   c. Demolish the intake structure on the left abutment by blasting in lifts, and push the concrete rubble into the diversion channel using the bulldozer. Shape the backfill materials within the diversion channel/north spillway channel/penstock site to the desired contours. Spread stockpiled material (dirt, rocks, etc.) across the left abutment area to a minimum depth of 2 feet over waste concrete materials, and provide desired final, natural-looking contours with slopes of 2:1 or flatter. Place topsoil over the left abutment site as required and seed. Remove the bulldozer from the left abutment area by airlift or other means as necessary.   d. Remove all remaining site buildings (maintenance shop building on right abutment, garage on left abutment), fencing, and other improvements as required.   5. Excavation of channel fill  — As described previously, the channel fill consists primarily of hydraulic fill (sands and gravels) and large rockfill, but includes fir mattresses and a reinforced concrete cap. The channel fill materials may be excavated by mechanical means as discussed in the previous section, much of which to be performed either underwater or in saturated conditions. Significant cost savings may be realized if some of the channel fill materials are permitted to erode downstream, particularly within the approach channel for the diversion channel above elevation of 135 feet, rather than requiring mechanical excavation and removal to land disposal sites. This alternative will be evaluated further during final design, using geologic data additional to that currently available. An estimated potential savings of about $800,000 could be realized if 50,000 yd 3  of sand and gravel could be eroded rather than mechanically excavated and transported to a disposal site.   6. Waste disposal  — Suitable sites for disposal of waste concrete and materials (dirt, rocks, etc.) are being investigated within 10 miles of Elwha Dam. On-site burial of up to 25,000 yd 3  of concrete, including the retention of the north spillway gravity walls, the penstock saddles and thrust blocks, and minor concrete placements, result in an estimated potential savings to the project of about $500,000. The cost estimate assumes all waste concrete removed from the damsite is dumped at an approved disposal site without further handling. Additional costs to crush concrete to an average 1½-inch size for off-site disposal (with any reinforcing steel removed) may range from about $7 to $14 per cubic yard, depending upon the size of the broken fragments. If such crushing is found to be necessary, the costs for removal of Elwha Dam could increase by an estimated $100,000 or more.   The steel penstocks, surge tank, Tainter gates, and slide gates would probably be salvaged for recycling. Hazardous materials would be sent to an approved disposal site. Other items would be salvaged for historical or commercial value, or buried in a landfill.   7. Site restoration  — All waste materials remaining on site would be buried under a minimum of 2 feet of material (dirt, rocks, etc.) and shaped to natural-looking contours. Materials suitable for use as topsoil would be spread over the site and seeded as required. Normal rainfall rates should be sufficient to support revegetation.   Following site restoration, the river channel upstream from the damsite should be able to contain streamflow up to 50,000 cfs below the diversion channel invert at elevation of 135 feet. This flow rate would correspond to greater than a 50-year flood. The seepage potential through the channel backfill on the left abutment would therefore be fairly remote, but not impossible. If necessary, a concrete cutoff wall could be constructed within the diversion channel to provide full protection from channel seepage.         Figure 11. — Elwha Dam, Diversion Channel Discharge Curve   available only in 2nd generation hard copy   B. GLINES CANYON DAM    1. Decommissioning of powerplant  — This would include any work at the Glines Canyon Dam powerplant required in advance of the dam removal contract work, including de-energizing the electrical equipment, removing hazardous materials, rerouting transmission lines, and removing the turbine runner from the main unit to permit no-load releases through the power penstock. Hazardous waste collection and disposal is discussed in Chapter VIII, Section A.   2. Site access and mobilization  — The left (west) abutment of Glines Canyon Dam is accessed by an existing paved, two-lane road (Olympic Hot Springs Road) from U.S. Highway 101. A bridge located downstream from the dam across the Elwha River is suitable for highway loads. One lane of the existing road within the park was lost in March 1995 due to a slope failure along the river, with access limited to the remaining lane. This study assumes permanent repairs will be completed to the access road prior to award of the dam removal contract. Several site-access improvements may be required for about the last 0.2 miles of permanent road up to the left abutment. These include widening (as necessary) to accommodate construction traffic and normal maintenance of the roadway surface and drainage culverts during the contract period. Access roads to the powerhouse and the switchyard are provided from the main access road and are unpaved. Additional improvements to the main access road are discussed in Chapter VIII, Section C.   Access to the right abutment of Glines Canyon Dam is provided by an existing unpaved, single-lane road (Whiskey Bend Road) which branches off from the main access road near the Elwha Ranger Station. Contractor access to the right abutment of the dam is not currently expected to be required.   A temporary haul road may be required along the river channel between the dam and the powerhouse tailrace for removal of waste concrete, rock, and other debris during the low-flow period following dam removal.   Mobilization costs are estimated to represent about 5 percent of the cost of dam removal, plus an additional estimated $160,000 for mobilization of a large ringer crane (which for stability and load distribution uses a circular support pad rather than outriggers) with 300-foot boom to the left abutment. A large crane pad and contractor staging area would be required on the left abutment, to be constructed using materials from the existing earth embankment at the site. The ringer crane will require a level pad approximately 48 feet in diameter (36-foot-diameter ring plus 6 feet of clearance around the periphery). Several large trees must be removed to permit full access of the site using the crane.   Construction power is assumed to be supplied by a single 150 kVA engine-generator, although alternate sources of electric power may be available. The cost of supplying electric power from the local utility (Clallam County Public Utility District) or from Bonneville Power Administration will be investigated during final design.   The current estimate assumes no constraints on construction activities will be necessary for protection of Threatened and Endangered species. Potential nesting sites for the spotted owl and marbled murrelet (both Threatened and Endangered species) exist in the vicinity of the project. Observation of these nesting areas by the Service occurred during the 1995 nesting season (May 1 to August 15) and are planned for the same period in 1996. If these nests are found to be active, ""permits to take"" (issued by the Service) should be investigated in lieu of placing noise limits and other constraints on the construction activities. Estimates of blasting parameters for removal of Glines Canyon Dam were developed by Reclamation for use in modeling environmental noise levels during construction. The results of this modeling are reported in Appendix G.   The NPS may decide to close the Elwha basin to all visitor use during the demolition contract, to minimize operational problems. This would include the closure of campgrounds and restriction of vehicle use. A shuttle service could be operated to transport visitors to upper trailheads and for sightseeing. The cost estimate assumes the contractor’s demolition activities would not be adversely impacted by park visitors.   3. Streamflow diversion  — A series of ungated notches will be excavated within the arch dam section below the draw-down limits of the existing power penstock, to lower the reservoir level for removal of the dam. Details of the proposed diversion plan are provided in the following paragraphs. The discharge capacity of the ungated, 25-foot-wide notches is shown in Figure 12. Average daily discharges are assumed for purposes of estimating reservoir levels and diversion requirements.   The contractor is assumed to begin site mobilization in November. Glines Canyon Dam would be operated for flood control to the maximum possible extent until July of the following year, passing normal inflow through the power penstock (and spillway, if necessary) while using available reservoir storage in Lake Mills to reduce flood peaks. Reservoir releases would be controlled as necessary to facilitate construction of the surface diversion channel at Elwha Dam. Following completion of the surface diversion channel at Elwha Dam, excavation of the arch dam section at Glines Canyon Dam would commence, with the reservoir held at the lowest possible level during the demolition activities.   When the arch dam has been excavated to the reservoir level, a single notch having a bottom width of 25 feet will be excavated at the left abutment to a maximum depth of 15 feet below the reservoir level by controlled blasting. Initial blasting will be confined within the limits of the notch between the downstream face and no closer than 3 feet from the upstream face, with blasting mats used to contain the concrete rubble on the dam crest for removal. The final blasting will remove the upstream face of the notch in four segments, limiting the rate of increase in reservoir outflow to about 1,000 cfs per hour. The peak flows will attenuate quickly as the reservoir level drops. The rate of reservoir drawdown will be dependent upon the inflow and reservoir storage capacity, but should generally permit lowering the reservoir level about 8 feet within two days. Downstream flood warnings will be provided prior to blasting each notch.   Notches (for streamflow diversion) would continue to be excavated from the arch dam section at 7.5-foot increments between elevations of 522.83 and 410.33 feet, alternating between the left and right abutments. Assuming no demolition work would be performed during the three months total from November 15 to December 15 and May 1 to June 30, average inflow during the remaining 9 months of the year would be about 1,300 cfs. Although the construction schedules and cost estimates assume an average notch width of 25 feet and a minimum discharge capacity of 1,400 cfs with 7.5 feet of head, actual notches may be sized according to diversion requirements. Reservoir inflow in excess of the notch capacity would cause the reservoir level to rise and demolition work to be temporarily suspended. Overtopping of the partially-excavated arch dam section during flood flows would not cause damage to the structure or downstream channel.   The reservoir level would drop in 7.5-foot increments at intervals ranging between one week and one month, depending upon the layer elevation and reservoir inflow. Excavation of the lower portion of the arch dam section (including the final two layers and the base of the dam) would be performed during August and September of the second year when streamflow would be at a minimum. Final channel cleanup would be completed by late October.   4. Structure removal  — Each structure at Glines Canyon Dam was evaluated for possible retention, based on anticipated effects on ecosystem and fisheries restoration, historic and cultural mitigation, visitor safety, maintenance costs, demolition costs, esthetics, and opportunities for site interpretation. Structures recommended for removal from the site include the arch dam section, the penstock intake structure/trashrack tower, the surge tank tower, the transformer yard and shed, the left abutment earthfill embankment, and the boat house. Other structures will be retained, with necessary modifications, as described in Section 6 below. The structure removal plan for Glines Canyon Dam consists of four stages as described below, and as depicted on Drawings 1440-D-154 and 1440-D-155.   Removal of the arch dam section is assumed to be performed using both conventional blasting and diamond-wire sawcutting methods, for estimating purposes. Diamond-wire sawcutting will provide smooth surfaces for the concrete structures to be retained on both abutments, facilitate excavation of reinforced portions of the arch dam section, improve control of the excavation grade, provide smooth working surfaces for excavation of each layer, and permit removal of the concrete in large blocks (rather than attempting to confine rubble to the working surface and removing the rubble by loading skips).  Stage One — Diversion Through Penstock, Remove Layers 1-7  (see Drawing 1440-D-155)   a. Draw the reservoir down to its lowest possible level using the spillway and the power penstock. The existing spillway will remain available for the passage of large floods above the spillway crest, elevation of 570.33 feet. The power penstock is assumed to remain available for reservoir releases to at least elevation of 525 feet, below which some air entrainment may be seen as a vortex at the reservoir surface. Remove the log boom as required. Operate for flood control until the surface diversion channel is completed at Elwha Dam.   b. Excavate the earthfill embankment on the left abutment (having an estimated volume of 2,400 yd 3 ) to provide materials for construction of a crane pad (requiring about 150 yd 3 ) and contractor use area on the left abutment above elevation of 600 feet. Embankment materials in excess of those required at the site would be removed.   c. Erect a ringer crane with a 300-foot boom on the left abutment crane pad. Deliver any necessary demolition equipment and materials to the dam. While reservoir releases are limited to the power penstock, drill and blast the concrete apron at the toe of the dam for later removal. An estimated 500 yd 3  of concrete rubble will result from the blasting. The rubble will provide sufficient protection for the dam foundation during future diversions over the dam crest.   d. Following completion of the surface diversion channel at Elwha Dam, begin demolition of the arch dam section in 7.5-foot-high layers (as shown in Drawing 1440-D-155) using diamond-wire sawcutting methods. Make horizontal cuts every 7.5 feet by sawcutting between the thrust block and pier 1 of the gated spillway. Make transverse (upstream-downstream) vertical cuts by sawcutting within reinforced areas of the dam, or by drilling closely-spaced blast holes for pre-splitting unreinforced concrete. Steel reinforcement will be encountered throughout layer No. 1 (elevations of 590.33 to 582.83 feet) and in portions of layers 2 through 7 (elevations of 582.83 to 537.83 feet) near the abutments. Sawcutting rates should average about 7.5 ft 2  per hour, with a continuous operation assumed for each single cut. The horizontal sawcuts will determine the required duration for removal of each layer. Vertical sawcuts will establish smooth surfaces at the thrust block and spillway pier 1 to be retained.   e. Sawcut and/or pre-split the arch dam concrete from layers 1 through 7 into large blocks up to the safe crane capacity for the block location, and within the allowable load limits for hauling from the damsite in trucks. Typical blocks will weigh about 35 tons, with a volume of up to 18 yd 3  each. For the 7.5-foot-high blocks, typical widths and lengths will average 8 feet; however, concrete blocks within reinforced areas of the dam will range up to 14 feet long, since no longitudinal (cross-canyon) saw cuts can be made. One longitudinal, pre-split cut may be made within unreinforced portions of layers 5 through 7. Excavation rates should result in the removal of an average of two concrete blocks (or 36 yd 3 ) per day. The ladder well walls may be excavated with the blocks, or by themselves in advance of the dam removal.   f. Remove any concrete remaining on the bedrock abutments following block removal using a hoe-ram or other methods. Some grouted rock bolts may be required to be installed on the abutments to ensure stability of the remaining rock mass. The cost estimate includes nominal quantities for concrete demolition on abutment contacts (100 yd 3 ) and for 1-inch-diameter grouted rock bolts (ten 20-foot-long bolts).         Stage Two — Diversion Through Notches, Remove Layers 8-12  (see Drawing 1440-D-155)  a. Notches are to be excavated below Layer 7 at 7.5-foot intervals (alternating from left to right abutment) to provide 16 overflow sills between elevations of 522.83 and 410.33 feet for streamflow diversion. Flood flows exceeding the capacity of the notches will overtop the remaining portions of the excavated dam crest, requiring a temporary work shutdown. The notches will be excavated below reservoir levels in stages to depths of 15 feet, to permit as much demolition work as possible to be performed in the dry. Lines of 2-inch-diameter, pre-split holes on 1.5-foot centers were assumed for estimating purposes to be drilled along the inside end of each notch (nearest the ladder well) and about 3 feet inside the upstream face of the dam (near the abutment) to set the limits for production blasting. Production blasts (using 2-inch holes on 4-foot centers for estimating purposes) will be controlled and confined by mats or nets for removal of the resulting concrete rubble from the dam crest, rather than from the river channel below. Breaching of the notches will be performed by blasting the remaining upstream face in segments to control reservoir release rates. The resulting rubble would be washed downstream. Excavation of a typical notch having a bottom width of 25 feet may be performed in four segments at 1-hour intervals to limit the rate of increase in reservoir outflow to about 1,000 cfs per hour. (This would be similar to the maximum hourly rate of increase experienced during passage of the 5-year flood.) Each notch would be designed to lower the reservoir (within 1 or 2 days) to a level required for excavation of the next layer. A 25-foot width would have a discharge capacity of about 1,400 cfs with a 7.5-foot head. Actual notch widths may be dependent upon site conditions, projected inflows, and sediment management objectives. A new notch can be established about every 8 to 16 days, assuming no flood delays.   b. Sawcut and/or pre-split the arch dam concrete in layers 8 through 12 as notch sills 1 through 5 are completed and the reservoir level is lowered. Layer 8 will require a horizontal sawcut at elevation of 530.33 feet from the right abutment to the first notch. Layers 9 through 12 will require horizontal sawcuts between the notches on both abutments. The removal plan assumes one longitudinal pre-split for layers 8 through 10, and two longitudinal pre-splits for layers 11 and 12, with transverse pre-splits as required to produce suitable block sizes for removal by the ringer crane.   c. Upon completion of notch sill 5 to elevation of 492.83 feet, the penstock guard gate can be closed and demolition work can begin on the intake tower and the surge tank. The intake tower and trashracks are to be removed, and a concrete plug is to be constructed at the upstream tunnel portal. The surge tank is also to be removed, with a concrete plug placed around the penstock at the downstream tunnel portal, and a steel plate added to the top of the penstock at the opening for the tee connection. A concrete cap may also be required at the gate shaft.   d. Sediment releases will occur with the blasting of notches in the dam. A winter shutdown to minimize impacts to anadromous fish is assumed in the construction schedule for the 1-month period November 15 to December 15.         Stage Three — Diversion Through Notches, Remove Layers 13-21  (see Drawing 1440-D-155)  a. Sawcut and/or pre-split the arch dam concrete in layers 13 through 17 as notch sills 6 through 10 are completed and the reservoir level is lowered. Layers 13 through 17 will require horizontal sawcuts between the notches on both abutments. The removal plan assumes two longitudinal pre-splits for layers 13 through 17, with transverse pre-splits as required to produce suitable block sizes for removal by the ringer crane.   b. Reservoir sediments are expected to be encountered at the upstream face of the dam for removal of layers 18 through 23. No horizontal sawcutting is assumed below elevation of 462.83 feet. Drill holes were assumed to be located on 4-foot centers for production blasting of the concrete in layers, with blasting mats used to confine the concrete rubble to the dam crest for removal using the ringer crane and a skip. Layers 18 through 21 will be blasted as notch sills 11 through 14 are completed and the reservoir level is lowered.   c. Remove low-level sluiceway trashrack, butterfly valve, and valve operator during demolition of layers 19 and 20. The concrete encasement will be blasted, and the metalwork will be lifted out by the ringer crane for disposal.   d. A summer shutdown to minimize impacts to anadromous fish is assumed in the construction schedule for the 2-month period May 1 to June 30.         Stage Four — Remove Final Layers and Base of Dam  (see Drawing 1440-D-155)  a. Excavation of the final two layers (22 and 23), excavation of the base of the dam to an elevation of 400 feet, and final channel cleanup (including removal of any concrete rubble, boulders, and the tailrace training wall) must be performed during the low-flow period (August through October).   b. Drill holes were assumed to be located on 4-foot centers for production blasting of the concrete in layers 22 and 23, with blasting mats used to confine the concrete rubble to the dam crest for removal using the ringer crane and a skip. Layers 22 and 23 will be blasted as notch sills 15 and 16 are completed and the reservoir level is lowered. Notch sill 16 will be considerably narrower than the other notches, due to the physical dimensions of the canyon near the base of the dam.   c. Vertical and angled drill holes will be required from an elevation of 417.83 feet for production blasting of the base of the dam to the final excavation level (elevation of 400 feet). Angled holes are required for excavation of the sloping downstream face of the arch dam at that elevation, and to remove the concrete below notch sill 16 at elevation of 410.33 feet.   d. Remove as much concrete rubble as practical from the river channel during the low-flow period, including the rubble from all notch excavations in addition to the rubble from the base of the dam. Also remove the tailrace training wall at the powerhouse.   e. Final site cleanup will include removal of the transformer yard equipment, metal shed, and fencing, and shaping and seeding of the construction areas as necessary.         5. Waste disposal  — All waste materials will be removed from the site. Suitable sites within 20 miles of Glines Canyon Dam for disposal of waste concrete and material (dirt, rocks, etc.) are being investigated. The cost estimate assumes waste concrete will be dumped at an approved disposal site without further handling. About 7,000 yd 3  of concrete will be in large blocks, weighing between 26 and 35 tons each. Additional costs to crush all waste concrete to an average 1½-inch size for disposal (with any reinforcing steel removed) may range from about $7 to $14 per cubic yard or more, depending upon the initial size of the waste concrete. If such crushing is found to be necessary, the estimated costs for removal of Glines Canyon Dam could increase by more than $200,000.   Preliminary investigations were made into the potential use of the concrete blocks and rubble for beneficial uses, including shoreline protection and off-shore reefs. Initial indications were for a predominant size of 1 meter (3.3 feet), with a maximum size up to 2 meters (6.6 feet). Further investigations of potential beneficial uses of waste concrete will be made during final design.   The steel trashracks, surge tank, and butterfly valve would probably be salvaged for recycling. Hazardous materials would be sent to an approved disposal site. Other items to be removed would be salvaged for historical or commercial value, or buried in a landfill.   6. Structure retention  — Several structures are proposed to be retained at the site for their historical value and opportunities for interpretation. Retention of the following structures would not place any limitations on restoration of the ecosystem and anadromous fisheries, and could result in a significant cost savings to the project. Each structure retained would require some modifications to minimize future maintenance and/or provide for visitor safety.   Retention of the right abutment thrust block, gravity section, and earthfill embankment (with log flume) would provide an excellent public overlook at the Glines Canyon site accessible from Whiskey Bend Road, and would eliminate the need for contractor access (and disturbance) on the right abutment of the dam. The existing guardrails would be modified by the addition of wire mesh to improve visitor safety, and some additional fencing and signs may be required around the site. An estimated savings of about $500,000 could be realized by the retention of these features.   Retention of the gated spillway structure would provide significant historical mitigation and interpretation opportunities, while providing a public overlook on the left abutment of the dam accessible from the Olympic Hot Springs Road. Long-term maintenance costs would be minimal; however, some modifications would be necessary to provide for visitor safety, such as improved guardrails (addition of wire mesh), permanent covers for the openings in the hoist deck, and measures to prevent visitors from reaching the spillway chutes. The gated spillway could be retained at an estimated savings of about $500,000.   The powerhouse would be retained as an excellent example of early hydropower generation technology. Exhibits could be located on the main floor to describe the various pieces of equipment and how water was used to generate electricity. The large glass windows would be replaced or protected to prevent vandalism, and any hazardous materials would be removed or confined (i.e., asbestos insulation). The roof would be repaired if necessary. A estimated savings of about $1 million could be realized by retention of the powerhouse and equipment.   The steel penstock between the tunnel portal and the powerhouse also offers significant historical mitigation and interpretation opportunities. To be included in an interpretive trail, the wooden stairway on top of the penstock would be replaced by a low maintenance, metal stairway with guardrails, and the stairway and penstock would be painted. The penstock opening at the surge tank location would be permanently sealed with a steel cover plate, and the tunnel portal would be sealed with a concrete plug to prevent visitor access. A estimated savings of about $200,000 could be realized by retention of the penstock.   Retention of the gatehouse, shaft, and footbridge is currently being considered for potential historical mitigation and interpretation opportunities. If retained, the glass windows and door would be removed to prevent vandalism, and the wooden stairway would be replaced with a low maintenance, metal stairway. The guardrails would be modified with wire mesh for improved public safety. All exposed electrical wiring and the wooden power pole would be removed, and openings in the gatehouse floor and at the top of the shaft would be sealed. A modest savings of about $30,000 could be realized by retaining these features.   The two wood-frame residences and the maintenance shed on the left abutment would provide needed office and storage space at the site during the demolition work, and would be retained at least for the duration of the contract. The NPS may decide to retain these structures for ecosystem restoration researchers. A modest savings of about$20,000 could be realized by retaining the structures.   7. Site restoration  — A site restoration plan will be developed for the left abutment to provide natural-looking contours following removal of the earthfill embankment and the crane pad. The river channel between the damsite and the powerhouse contains large boulders and woody debris which will be removed as necessary for fish passage and potential recreational use of the river, if possible. Fencing, guardrails, and warning signs are anticipated to be required around remaining structures on both abutments for public safety. Permanent electric power will be provided to the site for the structures and exterior lighting. Improvements to the Olympic Hot Springs Road are described in Chapter VIII, Section C.               Figure 12. — Glines Canyon Dam, Discharge Curves for 25-Foot-Wide Notches   Available only in 2nd generation hard copy           CHAPTER VIII. ADDITIONAL CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS    A. HAZARDOUS WASTE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL    Hazardous materials identified at the dam sites include asbestos siding and floor tiles in the maintenance shop building at Elwha Dam, asbestos insulation for wiring in both powerhouses, banks of lead-acid batteries in both powerhouses, small quantities of hazardous chemicals, and possible contaminated oil and soils at both sites. Asbestos may also be found in duct insulation, valve or turbine packing, piping or turbine gaskets, and generator brake shoes. Lubricating oils and grease should be removed from mechanical equipment and properly disposed of as one of the first steps of decommissioning. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) may also be present in small quantities at both sites. The Service has prepared a separate report on the proposed collection and disposal of hazardous waste, with an estimated cost to the project of $1.2 million.   Of additional concern is the potential for lead-based paint to have been used for steel coatings at both sites, including penstocks, surge tanks, slide gates, Tainter gates, trashracks, and any painted equipment. Although not currently classified as a hazardous material by the Interior Department, all lead-based paint (if shown to exist) would have to be removed from steel items proposed for recycling. Estimated costs for removal and disposal of lead-based paint could exceed $200,000 if such action is found to be required.         B. REMOVAL OF TRANSMISSION LINES    Existing 69 kV, three-phase transmission lines extend approximately 7 miles from Glines Canyon Dam to Elwha Dam (Line No. 3), approximately 6 miles from Elwha Dam to the Daishowa-America paper mill in Port Angeles, Washington (Line No. 1), and approximately 8 miles from Elwha Dam to the Bonneville Power Administration–City of Port Angeles substation (Line No. 2). Previous estimates included the removal of 14 miles of transmission lines and poles at a cost of $238,000 plus contingencies (1990 dollars). Additional studies are being performed to determine the current project requirements and associated costs for this work.         C. ROAD IMPROVEMENT PLAN    Heavy construction traffic associated with hauling waste materials from both dam sites to designated disposal areas may cause damage to some of the existing roadways in the area. The Dam Removal Task Group was requested to determine the extent of road damage that may occur and appropriate methods of repair.   Primary access to Elwha Dam is along U.S. Highway 101 to State Highway 112. From Highway 112, Elwha Dam is located about one-half mile south on the Lower Elwha Dam Road. The two highways are designed and constructed to accept standard truck traffic. The Lower Dam Road consists of an improved gravel surface, and is almost entirely located on Elwha Dam project lands.   Primary access to Glines Canyon Dam is along U.S. Highway 101 from the east or west, and then south along Olympic Hot Springs Road for about 4.5 miles to the dam. U.S. 101 has been designed and constructed to accept standard truck traffic, including roadway surfaces and bridges.   The Olympic Hot Springs Road has only a bituminous surface treatment (BST), consisting of two coats of a chip material placed over liquid asphalt. The road base of this section of road consists of a thin layer of gravel. The subgrade contains a high percentage of clay. Approximately 3.5 miles of the road to the dam is within Olympic National Park and maintained by the NPS. The initial mile of this road off of U.S. 101 is maintained by Clallam County. The Altaire Bridge has been designed for ""HS 20"" loads and will easily accommodate construction traffic.   The dam removal contractor will be using conventional hauling equipment for removing the waste and salvage materials from the dam sites and transporting them to disposal areas. Based on the current information available on the location of potential disposal sites, the majority of travel will be along the two highways, except for 4.5 miles along the Olympic Hot Springs Road, and 0.5 miles along the Lower Elwha Dam Road. Truck traffic for removal of Glines Canyon Dam may involve up to 3 trips per day over the two-year construction period. Hauling would be performed 5 or 6 days per week during daylight hours along the Olympic Hot Springs Road. Truck traffic for removal of Elwha Dam may involve hauling as many as 8 loads per hour for two 10-hour shifts during the second year. In both cases, the loads would not exceed 80,000 pounds. Typical construction equipment used for hauling would include flat beds, low boys, and dump trucks. The dam removal contractor will be required to make appropriate repairs to the Lower Elwha Dam Road and the Olympic Hot Springs Road to allow for normal use during the two years of construction.   The probable type of equipment to be used for hauling materials, the expected weight of the individual loads, the number of loads, and the condition of the existing roads were the criteria considered for determining the final repairs that may be required following completion of construction activities for dam removal. This analysis indicated the existing state and major county roads are currently adequate to withstand the expected truck traffic. According to the Clallam County Road Department, Olympic Hot Springs Road from U.S. 101 to Glines Canyon Dam was not designed to carry a significant number of heavy truck loads. The clay subgrade becomes very soft and deformable when wet. These conditions will not hold up very well to the volume and weight of the truck traffic during the construction period, and may produce a non-uniform surface grade containing dips and ruts. While the dam removal contractor will be required to make any necessary repairs during construction to accommodate his activities and local traffic, major repairs will be needed following construction.   Two types of roadway repairs were considered. They consisted of either spot patching with resurfacing, and total replacement. The alternative for spot patching, as needed, is difficult to evaluate due to the inability to identify with any confidence the extent of potential damage and the amount of patching that may be required. It is anticipated that dips and ruts will be typical repair requirements, which could involve long sections of the road. The spot patching alternative would include resurfacing of the entire roadway with two layers of bituminous surface treatment. Total replacement includes the removal of the existing roadway surface by pulverization.   The pulverized material would be spread over the subgrade during the regrading process, and compacted in place. Two layers of bituminous surface treatment would be placed over the subgrade, similar to the spot patching alternative. This treatment matches the current roadway surface, and is considered adequate for the normal future traffic expected along this road. The existing roadway has functioned very well under similar traffic patterns.   The total replacement alternative ensures that all potential deficiencies are addressed, and is recommended. The roadway improvements would be performed during the first road construction season following completion of the dam removal activities. Replacement of the entire stretch of road from U.S. 101 to Glines Canyon Dam would take approximately one month. A cost estimate for replacing the entire roadway was prepared by Reclamation’s Technical Service Center. The estimated field cost for performing the work described for this alternative is $480,000. A copy of the construction cost estimate is included in Appendix E.   The Corps (1987) determined that portions of the Olympic Hot Springs Road must be raised for flood protection due to higher stages of the Elwha River. Approximately 1 mile of road within the park may be raised 1.5 feet, and approximately 0.7 mile of road outside the park may be raised by 1.5 to 2.5 feet. These requirements are discussed further in the 1987 Corps report on flood control measures.   The quantity and source of materials required to raise the Olympic Hot Springs Road will be investigated further during final design. Excavation materials from the removal of Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams my be considered to meet this requirement, which could exceed 10,000 yd 3 .           CHAPTER IX. PROJECT SCHEDULE AND ESTIMATED COSTS    A. BASIC ASSUMPTIONS FOR PERFORMING WORK    Basic assumptions were made for performing the demolition work at both dam sites, as follows.   Elwha Dam    1. The powerplant is decommissioned and all hazardous materials are removed from the site by others prior to award of the demolition contract. The turbine runners are removed from the vertical units (3 and 4) to increase the discharge capacity of the 15-foot-diameter penstock and ensure continuous release capability under all operating conditions as required for streamflow diversion.   2. The Eicher fish screen, fish rearing pens, and associated equipment and materials (including the derrick crane) are removed from the site by the owners (EPRI) prior to contract award.  [Note: In the period since these assumptions were formed, it appears the majority of the materials will be left on site. However, the additional cost to remove them is not considered to be a significant addition to the total budget, and the cost estimates in Appendix E have not been changed.]  3. All structures at the site are to be demolished. Burial of some concrete rubble and reinforcing steel will be permitted at the site to minimize project costs.   4. A suitable land disposal site is located within 10 miles of the damsite for excess waste materials (earth and concrete rubble). Waste materials are dumped at the disposal sites without further compaction or reduction in size.   5. Glines Canyon Dam will be retained to provide some flood protection until the left abutment surface diversion channel can be established.   6. Threatened and Endangered species or other environmental concerns which would affect or limit construction activities are not identified. However, to minimize impacts to anadromous fish runs, no construction activities which would introduce additional reservoir sediments to the Elwha River will be performed during the 1-month period from November 15 to December 15 and the 2-month period from May 1 to June 30.   7. Construction and operation of a slurry pipeline at the site would not have a net adverse impact on the demolition activities.         Glines Canyon Dam    1. The powerplant is decommissioned and specific hazardous materials are removed from the site as required prior to award of the demolition contract. The turbine runner is removed to increase the discharge capacity of the power penstock and ensure continuous release capability under all operating conditions as required for streamflow diversion.   2. The dam will be operated for flood control until the diversion channel is completed at Elwha Dam.   3. Only the concrete arch portion of the dam, the intake tower, surge tank, transformer yard, tailrace training wall, log boom, earthfill embankment on the left abutment, boat house, and transmission lines are required to be removed. Other structures at the site on both abutments are to be retained for interpretive purposes and historic mitigation. All waste materials are to be removed from the site.   4. A suitable land disposal site is located within 20 miles of the damsite for waste materials (earth and concrete rubble). Waste materials are dumped at the disposal sites without further compaction or reduction in size.   5. Threatened and Endangered species, or other environmental concerns, are not identified which would affect or limit construction activities, except that no construction activities which would introduce additional reservoir sediments to the Elwha River will be performed during the 1-month period from November 15 to December 15, and during the 2-month period from May 1 to June 30. Sawcutting operations at the dam are assumed to continue around-the-clock for each layer as required.   6. Construction and operation of a slurry pipeline at the site would not have a net adverse impact on the demolition activities.   7. Final improvements required by the NPS for use of the area by the public (such as road repaving, permanent powerlines, interpretation centers and displays) will be included under separate completion contracts.         B. DEVELOPMENT OF CONSTRUCTION LOGIC AND DURATIONS    Construction schedules for removal of Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams were prepared using the software Primavera Project Planner, developed by Primavera Systems, Inc., and are included in Appendix D. Construction activities and sequences were identified using the proposed dam removal plans described in Chapter VIII and the basic assumptions listed above. Activity durations were based on engineering judgement and experience, and were modified as necessary for high flows (based on average streamflow conditions and available discharge capacity). Key assumptions for establishing activity durations include an average diamond-wire sawcutting rate of 180 ft 2  per day for concrete in the arch at Glines Canyon Dam, and an average excavation rate of 1,000 yd 3  per day for the channel fill materials at Elwha Dam. Proposed reservoir drawdown rates for Lake Mills and Lake Aldwell are also important factors affecting slope stability, sediment management, and public safety. Early and late start dates and finish dates were established for all activities based on the assumed durations and sequences. A critical path was identified for activities which could not slip without affecting the overall completion date.   Various contract start dates were assumed and the corresponding schedule impacts were evaluated on a seasonal basis to determine the optimum start date of November 1. Excavation of the diversion channel plug at Elwha Dam, and final excavation within the river channel at Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams, are scheduled for the historic low flow period (August through October) of the first and second year. Planned work stoppage periods are assumed for November 15 to December 15 and for May 1 to June 30 of each year for those activities which would release reservoir sediments to the Elwha River. These periods correspond to historic high flow periods, and are intended to minimize potential adverse impacts to anadromous fish runs (chum in winter and steelhead in summer). All work under the demolition contract should be completed within approximately two years.         C. EFFECTS ON SEDIMENT MANAGEMENT AND WATER QUALITY    Sediment routing models for the Elwha River were developed by the Sediment Management Task Group (Reclamation, March 1996a), based on the current proposed construction schedules for dam removal. The rates of reservoir drawdown resulting from the proposed dam removal plans appear to be compatible with the sediment management objectives, particularly the notching rate at Glines Canyon Dam for lowering Lake Mills. These results were used in  Report of the Water Quality Task Group  (Reclamation, in publication) to confirm the water treatment requirements. See the reports of both task groups for further details.         D. COST ESTIMATES FOR DAM REMOVAL    1. Field costs  — Construction cost estimates have been prepared to a feasibility level for the removal of Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams, and related appurtenant structures as required, and are included in Appendix E. These estimates of field costs are based on computed quantities and on unit prices developed at an April 1995 price level. The cost estimates include contractor mobilization, streamflow diversion provisions, and dam and associated structure removal and disposal, with an unlisted item allowance of 5 percent and an allowance of 20 percent for contract contingencies (unforeseen costs or conditions). The methods assumed for streamflow diversion and structure demolition are detailed in Chapter VII. Cost estimates do not include costs for hazardous waste removal and disposal, powerplant decommissioning, and removal of transmission lines, which have been estimated by others. A project acquisition cost of $29.5 million was previously established by Public Law 102-495.   The estimated field cost for removal and disposal of Elwha Dam and all appurtenant structures is $10.5 million. The estimated field cost for removal and disposal of the arch dam, intake tower, surge tank, left abutment dike, and transformer yard at Glines Canyon Dam is $9.7 million. The total estimated field cost for removal of both dams is therefore $20.2 million. Assuming a two-year construction period beginning in November of the first year, expenditures for dam removal are estimated to range from 36–53 percent the first fiscal year, 47-59 percent the second, and 0–5 percent the third, based on cost-loading the early and late construction schedules discussed in Section B above.   The estimated field cost for removal of both dams is $3.17 million (about 20 percent) higher than the total cost identified in  The Elwha Report , and does not include costs for final design and construction management. This discrepancy is due to larger quantities and/or higher unit prices for many of the individual items of work. For example, the channel fill excavation quantity at Elwha Dam is currently estimated at about 200,000 yd 3 , which is much greater than the 80,000 yd 3  estimate included in  The Elwha Report  (although comparable to the 223,000 yd 3  estimate included in the  Draft Staff Report ). Combined with higher unit prices for excavation and disposal, the cost of removal of the channel fill alone is $1.2 million higher in the current estimate. The estimated cost for removal of the steel penstocks and surge tank at Elwha Dam is nearly $900,000 higher, and the estimated cost of removal of the powerplant equipment is nearly $500,000 higher. Unit prices for excavation and disposal of reinforced concrete structures range from about $160 to $210 in the current estimate, compared to $50 to $75 for  The Elwha Report , increasing total estimated costs by about $1 million. The largest single difference between the two estimates is in the cost of excavation and disposal of the arch dam section at Glines Canyon Dam. The current estimate determined costs for sawcutting, controlled blasting, and hauling of the concrete arch in layers to be about $5.4 million (for 15,200 yd 3 ), compared to about $900,000 (for 11,850 yd 3 ). Some project savings are realized by the retention of selected structures at Glines Canyon Dam (about $2.25 million; see Chapter VII, section B.6). Costs for final design and construction management are discussed below.   2. Design costs  — The total estimated cost for Reclamation’s Technical Service Center to prepare final designs and specifications is $710,500, based on an estimate of 1,155 staff-days and on estimated non-labor costs of $17,500. This represents an engineering design cost of 3.4 percent of the contract cost. Additional costs will be incurred by Reclamation’s Pacific Northwest Regional Office for the collection and preparation of design data.   3. Construction management costs  — Construction management costs for maintenance of a field office for inspection services, and for contract administration and design support during the demolition work, are estimated to represent 15 percent of the contract cost, about $3,150,000. This includes an estimate of 496 staff-days and a total cost of $312,600 for Reclamation’s Technical Service Center for design support, 1.5 percent of the contract cost.        CHAPTER X. CONCLUSIONS          Feasibility-level designs and estimates have been prepared for the removal and/or burial of all structures at Elwha Dam, and for the removal of the arch dam section, intake structure, surge tank, left abutment dike, boathouse, and transformer yard at Glines Canyon Dam. The current studies confirm that dam removal is technically feasible at both sites, and can be safely performed in a manner compatible with sediment management requirements and project objectives. Dam removal activities will require a period of approximately two years to complete, for an estimated total field cost of $20.2 million, including an allowance of 20 percent for contingencies. Design and construction management costs for dam removal would add about 20 percent, or approximately $4 million to the total estimated cost.   Under the proposed dam removal plans, both powerplants would be decommissioned prior to award of the demolition contract, and the turbine runners would be removed from the vertical units at both sites for improved streamflow diversion capacity. Glines Canyon Dam would be operated for flood control until a surface diversion channel is established at Elwha Dam, at which time demolition of both dams would commence.   The removal of Elwha Dam requires the demolition of about 30,000 yd 3  of concrete in the gravity section and appurtenant structures, and the disposal of about 2,500,000 lbs of mechanical and electrical items in the spillways, powerplant, penstocks, and surge tank. An estimated 200,000 yd 3  of sand, gravel, and rockfill must be removed from the channel forebay area to restore the river to its original course. Concrete demolition and diversion channel excavation will be performed by drill-and-blast methods, with much of the concrete and some rockfill remaining on site to provide the final site contours. Waste concrete and channel fill materials in excess of the quantities required at the site will be hauled to a disposal site within 10 miles of the damsite. Mechanical and electrical items will be salvaged for recycling, or disposed of in a landfill. Additional estimated costs for disposal of materials would be incurred if concrete crushing is required (over $100,000) and if lead-based paint must be removed (over $200,000).   The removal of Glines Canyon Dam requires the demolition of about 16,000 yd 3  of concrete in the arch dam and intake structure, and the disposal of about 200,000 lbs of mechanical and electrical items in the sluiceway, transformer yard, and surge tank. Concrete demolition will be performed by a combination of diamond-wire sawcutting and drill-and-blast methods, with all waste materials removed from the site. Waste concrete and earthfill materials will be hauled to a disposal site within 20 miles of the damsite. Mechanical and electrical items will be salvaged for recycling, or disposed of in a landfill. Additional estimated costs for disposal of materials would be incurred if concrete crushing is required (over $200,000).           CHAPTER XI. RECOMMENDATIONS          A. CONTRACTING BY NEGOTIATION    Negotiated procurement is recommended for future contracting of the demolition work, by which proposals would be solicited for selection based on both cost and technical merit. Negotiated procurement is a more flexible approach to contracting than the sealed bidding process, and is used when alternative, innovative approaches to construction are desired. This process allows confidential discussions (negotiations) with offerors within a competitive range of acceptable proposals, prior to best and final offers. Final selection of a proposal is based both on cost and on technical factors (including proposed construction methods, corporate experience, personnel qualifications, and project compliance) using established evaluation criteria. This contracting process has been successfully used by Reclamation for many projects, and should result in the optimum dam removal plan for the lowest overall cost.         B. ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATIONS FOR FINAL DESIGNS    Additional information will be required prior to initiating final designs. This information will be used to refine and evaluate some of the feasibility design assumptions, and to develop designs for features that were not included in the feasibility design. The following items are required to address specific issues at each dam.   Elwha Dam    1. The proposed access to the left abutment of Elwha Dam requires the use of barges or float bridges. An existing trail that passes through public and private lands could be developed into an access road, which would greatly simplify many activities. The feasibility and costs for developing this access should be investigated.   2. The characteristics and volume of the fill material in the forebay area have largely been developed from previous reports. Due to the large volume of this material, and the significant portion of the overall dam removal costs for removing this material, it is important to have a better understanding of the composition of the material to avoid costly surprises during the demolition process. A suitable method of sampling this material at depth needs to be developed for at least two locations within the forebay area.   3. A significant savings could be achieved by allowing up to 50,000 yd 3  of sands and gravel to be eroded naturally by the river during the final stages of excavating the upstream fill materials. An evaluation needs to be made regarding the ability of the river to transport the materials during specified time periods. This volume is small compared to the sediment volumes proposed to be eroded from the upstream reservoirs.   4. The potential exists for seepage to occur through the diversion channel fill material above an elevation of 135 feet for extremely high flows following construction activities. The suitability of fill material along with concrete rubble should be investigated to determine if seepage could be allowed with proper gradation (without experiencing a piping failure), or whether a concrete cutoff wall should be provided within the fill.   5. Some information has already been obtained regarding the bedrock contour along the proposed diversion channel alignment. Since the proposed alignment is dependent on the bedrock elevations, it is important to substantiate the estimated bedrock contours. Seismic-refraction surveys and additional drill holes are proposed to develop this information.   Glines Canyon Dam    1. Geologic mapping of the canyon walls immediately downstream of the dam should be performed. This information would provide a better assessment for the need for rock bolts to ensure long-term stability following dam removal.   2. The retention of several features at Glines Canyon Dam will require more detailed designs for modifications that will result in minimal maintenance and vandalism, and provide for public safety.   General    Several additional activities need to be performed that are common to both dams.   1. Concrete coring and non-destructive testing needs to be performed to determine the relative strength of the concrete. This information is important for perspective contractors for evaluating various demolition alternatives.   2. While much information has already been obtained, additional data and drawings of the existing structures for both dams will be investigated during final design. Revised area and capacity curves will be developed using the latest survey data.   3. Studies have been performed by representatives of the Tribe for locating potential disposal sites that may be available for accepting the various kinds and volume of materials coming from the demolition activities. A list of disposal sites will need to be confirmed during final designs. Potential use of excavated materials to raise the Olympic Hot Springs Road, and recycling opportunities, should also be investigated.   4. The feasibility designs assumed that construction power would be provided by engine generators. The feasibility of using conventional power should be investigated, including an economic comparison of the two alternatives.   5. The impacts of construction activities on Threatened and Endangered species need to be reevaluated during final designs.           REFERENCES   Casagrande, Arthur. September 1961.

The Federal Government, through the Minerals Management Service, issues permits for prelease exploration activities, evaluates resources, leases acreage, and regulates drilling and production activities. This publication provides information about how these oil and gas resources are effectively evaluated. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, passed by Congress in 1953 and amended in 1978, is the basis for the procedures and activities to be discussed here. This publication describes the procedures followed in evaluating offshore resources, beginning with the permitting and collecting of geological and geophysical data and ending with the resource economic and engineering evaluations and analyses for a lease sale. It is a summary of the Minerals Management Service oil and gas Resource Evaluation Program on the Outer Continental Shelf, the results of which are intended to assure the Government receipt of fair market value for these lands. We hope this publication will provide you with a better understanding of the evaluation of oil and gas resources on the Outer Continental Shelf.  iii   Contents Preface . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . iii Acronyms . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . vii Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 Technical and Historical Background . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 OCS Leasing Framework . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 RE Program Overview . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13 Regulation of G&G Data Collection . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14 G&G Data Acquisition and Analysis . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15 Resource Assessment and Estimation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19 Tract Evaluation/Fair Market Value Determination . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23 Reserve Inventory . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24 Technical Information Distribution . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 26 Glossary . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 27 References . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 32 Appendix A: Resource Estimation Methodology . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 33 Appendix B: Fair Market Guidelines . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 36 Appendix C: MONTCAR Methodology . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 42   Figures 1.

In response to public concerns about the ownership and development of offshore resources, Congress, in 1953, enacted two laws that granted certain offshore lands to coastal States and provided a framework for regulating and managing exploration, development, and production of resources under the seabed beyond the area managed by the coastal States. The two acts are as follows: The Submerged Lands Act. The Submerged Lands Act of May 22, 1953, granted the coastal States a belt of submerged lands seaward of their coastlines to a distance of 3 geographical miles. A greater distance from shore (about 3 marine leagues) was granted to Texas and Florida (west coast only), because these States had established jurisdiction over the larger area before achieving statehood. As a result of this Act, natural resources of the seabed beyond those granted to coastal States would be under the jurisdiction of the Federal Government. The Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act and its Amendments. The OCS Lands Act of August 7, 1953 (1) reaffirmed that those lands beyond the 3 geographical mile limit, or more, are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Government and (2) authorized the Secretary of the Interior to grant mineral leases on OCS lands and to provide regulations to carry out the provisions of the Act. The Act was amended on September 18, 1978. The amendments established a policy for managing oil and gas on the OCS and required revision of bidding systems and lease administration, coordination, and consultation with affected State and local governments, development of environmental studies for lease sale areas, and development of a 5-year leasing program. In addition, with regard to resource evaluation, the Secretary is required to assure the receipt of fair market value (FMV) for OCS lands in oil and gas leasing. Other Laws that Govern the OCS. Resource evaluation of the OCS is also subject to the requirements of other Federal laws administered by numerous Federal Departments and Agencies. Among them is the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, which establishes requirements for preparation of environmental assessments and environmental impact statements for major Federal actions that could affect significantly the quality of the human environment. Included in the environmental impact statements are resource estimates and exploration, development, and production scenarios for oil and gas resources.  Regulatory Authority for the Resource Evaluation Program Regulations. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) administers the provisions of the OCS Lands Act, as amended, through regulations found in Title 30 of the Code of   Federal Regulations (CFR). The regulations govern leasing, permitting, collecting of data, and operations on the OCS. With regard to the Resource Evaluation Program, authority has been vested in the Secretary of the Interior under 30 CFR Part 251 to regulate the conduct of prelease geological and geophysical (G&G) exploration for mineral resources on the OCS. Part 251 applies not only to G&G exploration but to scientific research as well. The purpose of these regulations is (1) to prescribe when a permit or the filing of a statement of intent to conduct G&G exploration on the OCS is required and (2) to prescribe operating procedures for conducting exploration, requirements for disclosing data and information, conditions for reimbursing permittees for certain costs, and other conditions under which exploration shall be conducted. Similar regulations addressing prelease prospecting activities can be found in 30 CFR Part 280.  Technical and Historical Background Outer Continental Shelf The term ""continental shelf"" is distinct from the term ""Outer Continental Shelf"", which is a legal term created by Federal statute. There is no scientific definition for the OCS. Legally, the OCS comprises that part of the continental margin adjacent to the United States that remained subject to Federal jurisdiction and control after enactment of the Submerged Lands Act. Under the 1958 Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf, the seaward limit of the shelf is defined as "". . . a depth of 200 meters (656 feet) or, beyond that limit to where the depth of the superjacent waters admits of the exploitation of the natural resources of the said areas."" The submerged seaward extension of a continent is called the continental margin. In most areas, this submerged extension is composed of the gently sloping continental shelf and the steeper gradients of the continental slope. In some areas, an apron of material derived from the continent--the continental rise--extends from the base of the continental slope to the abyssal ocean floor. Figure 1 shows a generalized profile of the continental margin. The contour and extent of the continental shelf vary from one coastal area to another. The shelf is relatively narrow along the Pacific coast, moderately wide along much of the Atlantic coast and the Gulf of Alaska, and broad in the Gulf of Mexico and around western and northwestern Alaska. It is generally defined as a gently sloping submerged marginal zone of the continents extending from the shore outward through shallow waters to a dropoff at the continental slope in deeper waters. Evaluation of oil and gas resources on the Federal OCS currently involves the submerged lands generally 3 geographic miles seaward from a State's coast line to about 200 to 300 nautical miles offshore.  2   Exclusive Economic Zone On March 10, 1983, a Presidential Proclamation established an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the United States of America. The EEZ extends seaward 200 nautical miles from the ""baseline"" (the legal coastline) of the territorial sea of the United States, the Commonwealths of Puerto Rico and Northern Mariana Islands, and other U.S. overseas territories and possessions. The EEZ covers over 3 billion acres subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Within the EEZ, the United States has sovereign rights, to the extent permitted by international law, to explore, exploit, conserve, and manage natural resources, both living and nonliving, of the seabed and subsoil. The Federal Government is authorized by the OCS Lands Act to manage the leasing of all minerals including oil and gas within the EEZ off the 50 States. Figure 2 shows the location of the EEZ.

Profile of the continental margin  3   Figure 2. Exclusive Economic Zone  Petroleum Geology The Resource Evaluation Program addresses the mineral potential of the OCS, predominantly oil and gas, i.e., petroleum. Petroleum is found beneath the surface of the Earth both onshore and on the continental shelf and slope. The key geologic requirements are (1) source rocks -- organic-rich sediments that serve as a source of hydrocarbons, (2) reservoir rocks -- porous and permeable rocks where the hydrocarbons can accumulate, (3) an impermeable capping rock or porosity barrier that serves as a trapping mechanism and prevents the hydrocarbons from escaping, and (4) a favorable thermal history to transform the organics into hydrocarbons. Most scientists believe that the majority of hydrocarbons are associated with rocks that were formed or deposited in a marine environment millions of years ago. Great volumes of organic and inorganic matter accumulated in these marine environments, and, as this material continued to accumulate, pressure was applied from the weight of the overlying sedimentary pile. This pressure, together with the heat of the Earth, probably produced oil and gas from the organic matter. Scientists have proven that organic matter may be transformed into oil and gas by long periods of continuous heat and pressure aided by bacterial action. Gradually, over millions of years, some of the oil and gas migrated into porous and permeable rocks.  4   Oil is not a homogeneous compound. Two primary elements -- hydrogen and carbon -- are combined in complex and various proportions. In crude oils, the amount of hydrogen varies from 10 to 15 percent and carbon from 80 to 89 percent by weight. Oil usually occurs with natural gas and saltwater within porous rocks. Gas is lighter than oil or water and tends to accumulate at the top of any reservoir. Most oil is lighter than water and also accumulates in the upper part of a reservoir, below the gas. Oil also contains minor amounts of other chemicals, such as sulfur and nitrogen, in its natural state or condition. Porous and permeable rocks, such as sandstone or limestone, act as depositories or reservoirs for oil and gas if there is some geologic condition that acts as a seal. If the seal or trap results from the structure of the rock, such as a fold, salt dome intrusion, or fault, it is called a structural trap. If the seal simply resulted from (1) a loss of porosity or permeability of the host rock that prevents further migration of the oil and gas or (2) the halting of the upward movement of hydrocarbons by beds pinching out against impervious cap rock, it is known as a stratigraphic trap. There are many different shapes, sizes, and types of geologic structures or traps that provide reservoirs in which petroleum is found as depicted in figure 3.  Figure 3. Structural and stratigraphic traps. (A.) Structural traps are created when porous rocks are tilted and folded, providing reservoir conditions suitable for the accumulation of petroleum; (B.) A stratigraphic trap is formed by changes in the porosity of a rock formation.  5   Perhaps the simplest means of classifying reservoirs is to group them according to the conditions causing their occurrence, as in the following: Structural Domes and Anticlines -- Reservoirs formed by folding of the rock layers or strata usually have the shape of structural domes or anticlines. These traps were filled by upward migration or movement of oil or gas (or both) through the porous strata or beds to the location of the trap. Here further movement was arrested by a combination of the form of the structure and the seal or cap rock provided by the formation covering the structure. Examples of reservoirs formed by domal structures are located offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and offshore California. Examples of reservoirs formed by anticlinal structure are the Ventura Avenue and Wilmington Oil Fields in California. Fault Traps -- Reservoirs are formed when strata are broken or sheared and offset. This is called faulting. The escape of oil from such a trap is prevented by nonporous rocks that have moved into a position opposite the porous petroleum-bearing formation. The oil is confined in traps of this type because of the tilt of the rock layers and the faulting. Examples of fields of this type exist along fault zones in offshore Texas. Dome and Plug Traps -- Accumulations of oil are found in porous surrounding great plugs or masses of salt or intrusive rock that have lifted the overlying rock layers. Some typical accumulations of this nonporous salt mass that has formed domeshaped traps in overlying porous rocks, are located in the central and western offshore Gulf of formations on or pierced, deformed, or type, illustrating a and surrounding Mexico.  Unconformities -- A type of stratigraphic reservoir is formed as a result of an unconformity. Here the upward movement of oil has been halted by the impermeable cap rock laid down across the cutoff (possibly by water or wind erosion) surfaces of the lower beds. An example of this type of reservoir is the giant East Texas Field. Pinchouts -- Another type of stratigraphic reservoir is one that is sealed in its upper regions by abrupt changes in the amount of connected pore space. This may be caused in the case of sandstones by irregular depositing of sand pinching out into shale at the time the formation was laid down. In these cases, oil is confined within porous parts of the rock by the nonporous parts of the rock surrounding it. A reservoir of this type is found in the East Breaks Block 945 (Diana) Field. Often, however, the trapping mechanism results from a combination of structural and stratigraphic factors.  History of Offshore Petroleum Development The earliest offshore oil production in the United States was developed off Summerland, California, in 1896 (fig. 4). The offshore portion of the field was an extension of an onshore discovery that had been made before 1894. The offshore wells were drilled from wooden piers extending out from the shoreline. In all, more than 400 shallow wells were drilled and completed at a depth of about 600 feet.  6   Courtesy of California Historical Society and American Petroleum Institute Photographic and Film Services.  Figure 4. Summerland Oil Field, California, in the late 1800's  7   The discovery of the Creole Field in 1938 in the Gulf of Mexico, 1  miles from shore in 26 feet of water, marked the petroleum industry's first successful venture into open, unprotected waters. In November 1947, a discovery was made in Ship Shoal Block 32 off the Louisiana coast, 12 miles from shore in water 16 feet deep. This well was the first offshore well to be drilled out of sight of land. It was also the first offshore well drilled from a mobile drilling platform, thus initiating the technology that has subsequently been utilized to drill offshore oil and gas wells in the deeper waters of the United States. As the search for oil and gas moved farther offshore and into deeper waters, industry has continued to expand drilling and production technology. The technology used for exploration and production of petroleum in deeper water illustrates these advancements. Conventional steel-jacketed production platforms stand in over 1,000 feet of water off southern California and in over 1,300 feet of water off the Louisiana coast. In 1983, a compliant guyed-tower production platform was installed in 1,000 feet of water, 110 miles southeast of New Orleans, Louisiana, and an exploration well in the Gulf recently has been drilled in 7,600 feet of water. In addition, offshore technology has seen the development of the tension leg platform, which is a semisubmersible drilling platform held in place by multiple cables anchored to the ocean floor. The tension of the cables makes the platform immune to heave, pitch, and role. In 1984, the drillship Discoverer Seven Seas drilled an exploratory well in over 6,900 feet of water off the coast of New Jersey (fig. 5). Our Nation's energy resources are now being produced in water depths exceeding 5,000 feet using subsea systems. In the often ice-bound waters of the Arctic, drilling units have evolved from the single-use artificial gravel islands to specially designed multiuse caissonretained islands and ice-resistant mobile units of more conventional design.  8   9   Courtesy of Philips Petroleum Co. & American Petroleum Institute  Figure 5.

Section 18 of the OCS Lands Act, which was added by the amendments of 1978, requires the Secretary of the Interior to prepare and maintain an OCS oil and gas leasing program that consists of both a schedule of lease sales for a 5-year period plus policies regarding the size, location, and timing for those sales. The analysis supporting the 5-year program is based on the following factors: C C C existing information concerning the geographical, geological, and ecological characteristics of such regions; the location of such regions with respect to, and the relative needs of, regional and national energy markets; the location of such regions with respect to other uses of the sea and seabed, including fisheries, navigation, existing or proposed sea lanes, potential sites of deep-water ports, and other anticipated uses of the resources and space of the OCS; the interest of potential oil and gas producers in the development of oil and gas resources as indicated by exploration or nomination; laws, goals, and policies of affected States that have been specifically identified by the Governors of such States as relevant matters for the Secretary's consideration; the relative environmental sensitivity and marine productivity of different areas of the OCS; and relevant environmental and predictive information for different areas of the OCS.  C C C C  The schedule is continually being updated and revised within the Department of the Interior. Key considerations in this process are the three objectives of the leasing program: (1) orderly resource development, (2) protection of the environment, and (3) receipt of fair market value from the sale of leases and the production of oil and gas. The following factors influence the areas that are selected for the schedule: C C initial assessments of oil and gas potential as estimated by both the Resource Evaluation Program and industry; environmental resources that might be affected by OCS development;  11   C C  the availability of technology; and the proximity to markets.  For the scheduling of sales, the OCS is divided into sections called ""planning areas."" These planning areas are large, contiguous areas, usually embracing several million acres, designating specific regions of the OCS, i.e., North Atlantic Planning Area, Eastern Gulf of Mexico Planning Area, Navarin Basin (Alaska) Planning Area, and Beaufort Sea (Alaska) Planning Area. Currently the OCS is divided into 26 planning areas (see fig. 6). These planning areas are subdivided into 3-mile by 3-mile blocks.  12   MMS/08/96  Figure 6. Federal Outer Continental Shelf Planning Areas Shaded areas represent those areas removed from . consideration due to Presidential and congressional moratoria.  13   RE Program Overview The RE Program consists of seven major components: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. Regulation of geological and geophysical (G&G) data collection; G&G data acquisition and analyses; Resource assessment; Resource estimation; Tract Evaluation/fair market value determination; Reserves inventory; and Technical information distribution.  These components all play a role in the program responsibilities that encompass all cycles of OCS activities. These responsibilities include the following: C Obtain and analyze proprietary G&G data and information and conduct resource and reserves studies of OCS lands to determine: (1) whether geologic conditions for energy or nonenergy minerals exist; (2) where potential concentrations of resources and reserves are located; (3) the volume of the accumulations; and (4) the economic value of the resources and reserves. Advise Department and Bureau management on matters related to the OCS leasing and regulatory programs and issues from a petroleum geology and resource economic perspective. Collect economic data/conduct studies necessary to support the development of a 5-year leasing program and ensure that the public obtains fair market value from individual lease sales under that program. Publish/make available timely information pertinent to the mineral potential of the OCS to the public, academia, and private industry. Conduct continuing reviews of available bidding systems and specific bidding variables for leasing OCS tracts and their effectiveness in accomplishing the objectives of the OCSLA and Amendments. Improve partnership efforts with coastal States in identifying and evaluating Federal OCS nonenergy mineral resources with a focus on sand for shoreline protection, beach and barrier island restoration, and wetlands protection.  C  C  C C  C  14   C  Provide technical support to the Department of State to develop mechanisms for cooperation with counterpart agencies in foreign countries and respond to invitations to provide technical assistance. Develop procedures and regulations for processing and implementing laws related to offshore exploration and development, such as the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act.  C  Regulation of G&G Data Collection The only positive way of knowing whether an area contains petroleum is to drill one or more wells, but a number of geologic and geophysical techniques have been developed and refined over the years to assist in predicting whether there may be petroleum in an area. With these techniques, attempts are made to infer: (1) whether the requisite geologic conditions for petroleum occurrence exist, (2) where reservoirs are located, and (3) the size of the reservoirs and the probable volumes of petroleum that they may contain. Most of the information used by both the Federal Government and industry to estimate or infer the oil and gas potential of an area is acquired by G&G surveys. A considerable amount of this information is collected by lessees or under prelease exploration permits issued by the MMS to specialized data-collection firms that sell or furnish the information to oil companies and to the DOI. Processing and approval of exploration permits are responsibilities of the Resource Evaluation Program and include: reviewing of applications for permits and agreements for OCS geologic or geophysical scientific research or exploration for mineral resources; issuing permits and agreements, including terms, conditions, and stipulations; monitoring permit activity; and corresponding with prospective permittees; and, basically, ensuring that G&G activities are carried out in an environmentally safe manner. The objective of this component of the Resource Evaluation Program involves the development and implementation of the regulations, rules, and procedures that must be followed by any non-Federal party that collects prelease G&G data and information on the OCS for purposes related to mineral exploration, development, or production. The regulations governing prelease G&G exploration activities for oil, gas, and sulphur are set forth at 30 CFR Part 251 and those governing prospecting for minerals other than oil, gas, and sulphur are at 30 CFR Part 280. They govern the permitting, data acquisition, and release of information by MMS. The regulations prescribe when a permit or a notice is required, operating procedures, and conditions for release of data and information. They also prescribe reimbursement to permittees for reproduction costs of any data and information submitted to MMS. These regulations and associated permit forms are available at the MMS home page on the Internet. The general purpose of the regulations is to ensure that prelease exploration, prospecting, and scientific research operations in Federal waters do not interfere with each other, with lease operations, or with other uses of the area. The regulations also encourage G&G  15   data acquisition while adequately protecting the investment of data gathered and still assuring equal access and competitive balance. Adherence to these regulations will ensure that exploration and research activities will be conducted in an environmentally safe manner. The permits, issued by the Resource Evaluation Regional Supervisors, set forth the specific details for each data-gathering activity, which include the area where the data are collected, the timing of the data-gathering activity, approved equipment and methods, and other similar detailed information relevant to each specific permit. This process is outlined in figure 7. After data have been collected by permittees, the MMS selectively acquires data that are needed to augment the existing database. Industry uses these G&G data to determine the areas having potential for oil and gas production. Oil companies also use these data for preparing bids for lease sales. The MMS also acquires data that have been collected for scientific research activities for which an approved permit or filing of notice is required.  G&G Data Acquisition and Analysis As previously mentioned, the primary source of the G&G data and information used by the Resource Evaluation Program is the oil and gas industry, which conducts exploration, development, and production activities on OCS lands. While the MMS does not perform any direct data-collection activities, it does issue permits to industry for collecting prelease G&G data. Lessees and operators are also required by regulations to provide data from their leases to MMS. The MMS has access to the permitted data and information as a condition set forth in the permit. The MMS selectively obtains copies of data obtained from these activities. Data from prelease permits constitute approximately 90 percent of the MMS database. Permittees and lessees in their normal conduct of business are reimbursed for only the cost of data reproduction. However, if industry has collected data in areas not under MMS jurisdiction, e.g., State waters or adjacent foreign waters, and MMS selects such data, MMS pays the significantly higher ""market price"" for obtaining such data. The extensive amount of data and information acquired by MMS is used by RE geologists, geophysicists, and petroleum engineers to perform a variety of analyses including (1) regional geologic studies to determine major areas of hydrocarbon potential on the OCS, (2) detailed evaluation of individual OCS tracts to determine the potential fair market value of the tract for bid evaluation purposes, and (3) estimation of the known discoveries of oil and gas as well as the development of resource estimates of possible occurrences of oil and gas yet to be discovered.  16   Receipt of application for permit t o conduct (1) either geological o r geophysical exploration for mineral resources or (2) either geological o r geophysical scientific researc h entailing the use of explosives or th e drilling of a deep test well .

Flowchart of Permit and Data Acquisition Process  17   Geophysical Surveys -- Geophysics is the application of the principles of physics at or near the surface of the Earth to determine the geology beneath the surface. In exploration geophysics, energy is transmitted into the Earth, and the recorded reflections provide the subsurface information used to delineate and identify geological structures and prospects. Geophysical surveys on the OCS include common depth point (CDP), gravity, magnetic, high-resolution, and three dimensional (3-D) surveys. C A large percentage of the geophysical data in the MMS inventory is twodimensional (2-D) CDP seismic information. Also known as common midpoint or common reflection point data, it is derived from a common location in the ocean subbottom where sound waves originating from various positions of the seismic (sound) source near the ocean surface are reflected toward the surface. The traces from different seismic profiles corresponding to the same reflection point are mathematically summed (stacked) for reflection points beneath the survey line. Simply, it measures the two-way travel time of an energy pulse from its source at the surface to various formations within the Earth strata and back to the surface. Present-day 2-D acquisitions, using digital recording and processing techniques, have been the basis for many prelease exploration judgments as MMS incorporates and builds its 3-D database. Magnetic surveys measure the magnetic field or its vertical component at a series of different locations over an area of interest. Aeromagnetic data consist of magnetic measurements made from an aircraft, and they offer measurements of larger areas. Magnetic and aeromagnetic acquisitions delineate anomalies caused by the changes in physical properties of the subsurface that lie beneath a thick layer of sediments. Gravity surveys produce measurements of the gravitational field at a series of different locations over an area of interest. The objective in exploration work is to map density differences that may indicate different rock types. Gravity data usually are displayed as anomaly maps. High-resolution surveys provide analysis of the shallow layers and identify potentially hazardous conditions such as surface faulting, potential slope failure areas, or shallow gas accumulations. In addition, these data are used to identify potential cultural and archaeological resources and are used in the assessment of nonenergy mineral resources. The evolution of 3-D seismic data and information, in conjunction with interactive computer workstations, has made it possible to more closely define and assess the potential for oil and gas occurrence on the OCS, especially with regard to subsalt prospects. The 3-D information is used to delineate, in greater detail than that of traditional 2-D information, subsurface geologic conditions associated with the occurrence of natural gas and oil. The products of a 3-D survey are three-dimensional data volumes (somewhat like cubes) as opposed to two-dimensional data  C  C  C  C  18   C  slices of the subbottom. As a result, displays are used to determine structures and stratigraphy, delineate faults, tie wells to each other, and correlate seismic data with well logs. A 3-D representation of the subsurface yields superior resolution of seismic indicators, accuracy of data location, and the ability to obtain seismic cross sections oriented in any direction desired. Geological and engineering information is also enhanced by 3-D visualization, and economic analyses are also improved. This use directly results in a better ability to do the following: S Determine fair market value for the OCS tracts being offered for lease; Assess undiscovered amounts of natural gas and oil; Quantify reserves of natural gas and oil on the OCS; and Perform postlease comparative analyses of company submitted bids for acceptance or rejection.  S S S  Workstations are essential to fully take advantage of the 3-D information as the use of it has become more sophisticated, evolving from a data tool to delineate reservoirs for development and production wells to that of an exploration tool. Most importantly, it allows for the tight integration and visualization of geophysical and geological data as well as a quick and accurate analysis of quantitative vs. qualitative parameters. Geological Surveys -- Geological surveying on the OCS consists of bottom sampling, shallow coring, and deep stratigraphic tests. These data are useful in determining the general geology of an area and whether the right types of rocks exist for petroleum formation and accumulation. C Bottom samples are obtained by dropping a weighted tube to the ocean floor and recovering it with an attached wire line. Depending upon the nature of the ocean floor, penetration is normally limited to a few tens of feet. Bottom samples can also be obtained from dredging. Shallow coring is performed by conventional rotary drilling equipment to obtain a near-surface sample of the rocks of the seabed. Choice of location is carefully controlled to avoid any shallow (geological and manmade) hazards, for example, faults or environmentally sensitive areas. Penetration is limited to 50 feet of consolidated rock. In any planning area, deep stratigraphic test wells, commonly known as continental offshore stratigraphic test (COST) wells, can be drilled to determine the geological character of rock strata. The location of such wells is carefully controlled by a permit issued by the MMS. These tests, which may be more than 20,000 feet deep, provide information that can be used by the Government and industry to evaluate tracts to be offered in a lease sale. Basically, an operator sets up a consortium of other  C  C  19   companies where drilling costs are shared. The wells are drilled in accordance with MMS regulations. All stratigraphic tests must be completed 60 days before the sale and the information is released to the public 10 years after completion of the well or 60 calendar days after the issuance of the first oil and gas lease within 50 miles (80.5 km) of the well site. A discussion of the cost well program is described by Dellagiarino (1991). The primary objective of the acquisition and analysis of G&G data is the development of maps identifying areas favorable for the accumulation of hydrocarbons. This is done by incorporating the data acquired through G&G surveys plus analyzing technical and scientific data and information to develop a basic knowledge of the geologic history of an area and its effects on hydrocarbon or strategic/critical minerals generation, distribution, and accumulation within the planning area.  Resource Assessment and Estimation The objective of this component of the RE program is to identify geologic plays on the OCS that offer the highest potential for natural gas and oil and development and production as well as nonenergy minerals. Following the identification of geologic plays, a thorough analysis of the play's hydrocarbon potential occurs. An assessment of the play's undiscovered resource potential, and its economic viability, is made using state-of-the-art computer-based geologic models. This will focus on the necessary studies to identify both environmental and operational constraints as well as assist in the consideration of eventual leasing decisions. The relative success of this component requires access to and use of a broad array of G&G data, information, and studies. Long lead times are often required to identify and determine whether geologic conditions exist for accumulations of minerals, whether a basin may be oil- or gas-prone, and determining the presence of reservoir rocks, source rocks, and traps necessary for natural gas and oil accumulation. The results of this work are subject to change and are updated as new data and information are generated and acquired. In the early stages, this component will focus on regional areas, but as more data and information are acquired, the focus shifts to sale- and prospect-specific areas to be offered for lease, or which are related to a specific issue, (i.e., moratoria, marine sanctuaries, quantitative analysis of legislative proposal, etc.). This information provides the basis for geological reports and associated maps that describe the geology, probability of hydrocarbon occurrence, resource potential, and potential shallow geologic hazards of the planning area. The geological reports include information concerning the regional geology and petroleum geology. The data, information, and analyses are used in the leasing process as input to the EIS as well as to other MMS and departmental decision and option documents. The maps and information also provide support for decisions made by the DOI.  20   Resource assessment work involves the study and analysis of the geology and geologic history of an area; the regional stratigraph y and geologic trends; major structural features; exploration history; study of source rocks, reservoir rocks, seals and trapping mechanism ; and, the identificati on of the most prospective portions of a planning area in terms of hydrocarbo n potential. This latter step serves as a complemen tary  process to industry interest in individual sales and aids in defining the final area identified for study in the sale-specific EIS. As previously mentioned, assessment activities range from large scale (i.e., regional or OCS-wide) to sale-specific, i.e., individual prospects. Once a sale area has been identified, the emphasis of the RE Program shifts to more detailed mapping and analyses needed to estimate the resource potential of individual prospects within the area offered for sale. These prospect-specific data, maps, and analyses are also used to determine parameters for postsale bid analyses. Since its formation in 1982, the MMS has completed systematic assessments of Federal OCS undiscovered oil and natural gas resources. These ""National"" assessments are the results of a multiyear effort by the DOI's MMS to assess the undiscovered crude oil and natural gas resources of the Nation's OCS areas. These studies were performed concurrently with an effort by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to assess the undiscovered oil and natural gas resources of the onshore areas of the United States and the adjacent waters within the boundaries of the coastal States. The current assessment estimates the undiscovered conventionally recoverable oil and natural gas resources located outside of known oil and gas fields on the OCS. The assessment considers recent geophysical, geological, technological, and economic information and uses a play analysis approach of resource appraisal. Areas assessed by MMS are depicted in figures 8, 9, 10, and 11. The MMS RE Program focuses upon developing estimates of the possible amounts of undiscovered natural gas and oil that may exist under Federal waters. The estimates are developed using complex computer models and methodologies that incorporate specific geologic information, mathematical and statistical analyses, risk and probability theories, and a variety of assumptions pertaining to economic scenarios, petroleum engineering data, and a variety of additional technical assumptions. Resource estimates can address vast areas, such as the Gulf of Mexico, offshore Alaska, or the entire OCS, but are also made for smaller areas, such as a particular lease sale or deferral option. The estimation process requires that estimates be developed for conventionally recoverable natural gas and oil quantities that may exist but are yet to be discovered, as well as estimates for those resources that may be economically viable for exploration, development, and production under varying economic scenarios (see Appendix A). For many OCS planning areas, estimates of undiscovered resources on tracts currently leased are estimated separately from those on unleased lands. All of these must be periodically revised as economic scenarios and the lease inventory changes in each planning area. Resource estimates must also be developed to support critical analyses of potential impacts of policy options, legislative proposals, EIS's, and industry activities affecting OCS natural gas and oil activities--both current and future.  21   Figure 10.

No explicit consideration for economic viability was implied in the estimation of the undiscovered conventionally recoverable resources. The estimates of undiscovered conventionally recoverable resources are presented as a range of values corresponding to different probabilities of occurrence. Undiscovered economically recoverable resources are the portion of undiscovered conventionally recoverable resources that can be explored, developed, and commercially produced at given cost and price considerations using present or reasonably foreseeable technology. The estimates of economically recoverable resources are presented as a range of resource values corresponding to different resource prices. The available methods of estimating oil and natural gas resources for an area are many and differ significantly. The MMS has two primary methods: (1) number and size assessment and (2) subjective methods. Number and size assessment models require information on the number and size of accumulations discovered in a region. Consequently, discovery process models provide reliable results only in mature areas with a significant number of discoveries. The subjective methods rely less on historical records of exploration efforts and discovery records and more on descriptive geologic characteristics of a province, basin, or play. The quantities of undiscovered oil and natural gas are then estimated by quantifying volumetric reservoir variables and estimating the number of accumulations expected to exist. In both methods, a thorough analysis of the subjective probabilities (risks) of occurrence of variables leading to the formation, migration, trapping, and preservation of hydrocarbons at a play, basin, or province level is critical. The Petroleum Exploration and Resource Evaluation System (PETRIMES), a probabilistic play analysis model, developed by the Geological Survey of Canada, was chosen by MMS to be the basic platform for the present assessment of undiscovered conventionally recoverable resources. Most of the resource assessment models currently used by industry and other government agencies provide estimated resources in aggregated numbers representing total resources as a distribution. However, to support MMS planning and decisionmaking related to OCS exploration and development, a knowledge of the potential number and size of undiscovered pools is essential. The PETRIMES attributes include the assessment and reporting of the: C C C number of pools/accumulations that remain to be discovered; size range of the undiscovered pools/accumulations; reservoir characteristics of the undiscovered pools/accumulations;  23   C C  pool size distributions that relate to the geologic model; and resource data in a manner suitable for economic analyses.  The PETRIMES, however, was designed to assess a single-commodity play, such as an oil play or a natural gas play. Because many OCS plays are mixed plays containing both oil and natural gas pools and because a separate estimation of both liquid (condensates and oil) and natural gas (associated natural gas and nonassociated natural gas) phases is required for an accurate economic evaluation, the MMS modified PETRIMES for OCS resource estimation. The modified version is called the Geologic Resource Assessment Program (GRASP). Likewise, MMS modified the Probabilistic Resource Estimates Offshore (PRESTO) model, used in previous MMS assessments, to accept the GRASP outputs for the number and sizes of pools to determine the economically recoverable resources at the geologic basin. As an improvement, estimates are made for economically recoverable resources over a range of specific fixed prices. These results are then reported as a continuous price-supply curve depicting the resultant price-resource relationships for geologic basins, provinces, or other areas being studied.  Tract Evaluation/Fair Market Value Determination Tract evaluation analyses estimate economic values for rights to mineral resources on individual OCS tracts. The MMS uses the values to determine if the high bids received for leases on tracts represent Fair Market Value (FMV) as mandated by the OCSLA (see Appendix B for guidelines). Immediately after a lease sale at which bids are read publicly, MMS begins the process of determining whether a bid can be accepted and a lease issued. Acceptance of a bid is based on a two-phase process. Phase 1 of the process is conducted on a tract-by-tract basis and is normally completed fairly early following the bid opening. It is designed to accept those high bids where the competitive market can be relied upon to assure receipt of FMV or where Government data indicate the tract does not contain an viable prospect. Those high bids not accepted in Phase 1 receive further evaluation in Phase 2. For those high bids, MMS geologists, geophysicists, and petroleum engineers prepare detailed estimates of the economic value of oil and gas resources on each tract in Phase 2. The high bids are then compared to Government estimates of value. Most analyses are undertaken based upon data available at the time of the sale; however, additional geophysical and geological data may be obtained after the sale at the discretion of the Regional Director. Generally, the Regional Director must accept or reject all bids within 90 days after the date on which they are opened. Any bid not accepted within 90 days is rejected. Companies have 15 days to appeal any rejection. The reader is referred to Appendix B for a complete discussion of Phase 1 and Phase 2.  24   The resource economic value of tracts offered for lease is determined by calculating the amount of economically recoverable resources, estimating recovery factors, production profiles, exploration and development costs, operating costs, revenue streams, and performing a discounted cash-flow analysis. The MMS uses a computer simulation model to perform this task. The model also incorporated geologic and economic risking. The computer model uses the MONTE CARLO or range-of-values technique of handling calculations with uncertain input data. The MMS refers to this as the MONTCAR methodology (see Appendix C). It provides a means to handle a series of subjective judgments about each variable. The burden of expressing the uncertainty is transferred from one or two individuals to the many experts in the various disciplines involved in the evaluation. As with other models, research is constantly being done to refine the methodology and procedures involved with MONTCAR. After completing the evaluations and analyses for a specific lease sale, the prospect-specific analyses are incorporated into the regional maps and analyses, and the process is repeated for the next sale.  Reserve Inventory ""Reserves"" are that portion of an identified oil or gas resource that can be extracted using current technology. The RE Program develops independent estimates of original amounts of natural gas and oil in discovered fields by conducting field reserve studies on the OCS and periodically revises the estimates of remaining natural gas and oil to reflect new discoveries or development information and annual production. The reserves inventory component of the RE Program assigns new producible leases to fields, establishes field limits and develops independent estimates of amounts of natural gas and oil (reserves and resources) associated with known fields by conducting field studies and reviews of fields, sands and reservoirs. A field is an area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on, or related to, the same general geological structural feature and/or stratigraphic trapping condition. Hydrocarbons (gas and oil) estimated on the basis of geologic knowledge to exist outside of known accumulations are undiscovered resources. Hydrocarbons whose location and quantity are known or estimated from specific geologic evidence are discovered resources. Reserves are quantities of hydrocarbons that are anticipated to be recovered from known accumulations from a given date forward. All reserve estimates involve some degree of uncertainty, depending on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available and the interpretation of the data. The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either unproved or proved. Unproved reserves are the quantities of hydrocarbons that can be estimated with some certainty to be potentially recoverable from known reservoirs, assuming future economic conditions and technological developments. Proved reserves are the quantities of hydrocarbons that can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be commercially recoverable from known reservoirs and under current economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations.  25   Field naming and reserves accountability are dependent on the drilling and development phases of fields. When a lease is qualified as producible based on a new discovery well, the field limits associated with the new lease are defined through geophysical mapping using computer workstations and software. The new lease is either assigned to an existing field or becomes a new field discovery in the unproved category. When a field is in the unproved category, geophysical mapping and limited well data are the basis for defining reservoir limits and the associated reserve estimate. These estimates are reevaluated once a field is moved into the proved category and more data become available. Well logs, well field data, seismic data, and production data are continuously analyzed throughout the productive life of the field to improve the accuracy of the reserve estimate. As a producing field nears the end of its productive life (depletion), the proved reserve estimate approaches zero, but the field may have a resource estimates associated with undrilled and/or untested traps. The primary benefit of the RE Program reserve estimates activity, however, is that the detailed geological, geophysical, and engineering information necessary to estimate these amounts of natural gas and oil is also used in performing other RE Program functions in areas with known fields -- including tract evaluation, resource estimation, resource assessment, future production projections, and numerous specific field performance studies. Studies of unproven fields are continuing, especially in light of royalty reduction efforts, since any royalty rate reductions may help these fields become economically viable to develop and produce. The interim geologic information and engineering reviews supporting the reserves estimation function produce vital information for other OCS program activities as well as Royalty Management Program functions. Cooperative efforts with the Energy Information Administration (EIA) of the Department of Energy allows EIA to use MMS estimates to verify reporting standards and procedures by natural gas and oil companies and as critical input to their macroeconomic modeling efforts. Geologic maps and/or reserves estimates are prepared for active and depleted proved fields and unproved fields. Future workloads include (1) mapping and evaluating new fields; (2) evaluating discoveries that have not yet qualified as fields; (3) providing detailed analog field studies in support of lease sale prospect evaluations; (4) placing new producible leases in fields and determining the field limit; (5) maintaining the reserves inventory database by adding new completions to existing fields; and (6) enhancing the National Assessment as new pay sands in fields are identified. Geologic studies of proved and unproved fields continue at a consistent level attempting to reflect the discovery of new fields both in deepwater portions as well as the new discoveries on the shelf. The work associated with this effort is vital to the evaluation of exploration and production incentives and legislation considered by Congress and the Department. The MMS continues various cooperative reserve studies of offshore proved fields. As development activities related to offshore projects in frontier areas progress, MMS will become more involved with detailed geologic modeling and reserves estimation for those projected fields.  Technical Information Distribution 26   The RE Program develops important technical information regarding the hydrocarbon resources on the Federal OCS that may be useful to industry, Federal and State agencies, and the general public. An objective of the OCSLA is that such nonproprietary data and information be made available in a timely manner to assist States, local governments, industry, and the general public to participate in policy and planning decisions related to management of OCS resources. In taking steps to address the need to make information available, the RE Program has traditionally prepared OCS reports on the geology of OCS planning areas, certain offshore wells, G&G data acquisition, the deep stratigraphic test (COST) wells, and production projections for the OCS. Publicly available reports and information are available on the Internet at http://www.mms.gov. Products disseminated through the RE Program include: C Offshore Northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) Oil and Gas Atlas Series: The goal of the atlas is the classification and organization of offshore Gulf of Mexico reservoirs into plays based upon geologic and engineering attributes covering two volumes.

Resource Estimation Methodology Estimating Undiscovered Conventionally Recoverable Resources The general methodology of assessing oil and natural gas resources for the three types of plays using GRASP is similar. A simplified diagram of the assessment process is presented in figure A-1. The basic steps are listed below. 1. Compile play data. 2. Generate pool size distribution from probabilistic distributions of volumetric reservoir parameters. 3. Generate a number of pools distribution. 4. Determine individual oil, natural gas, and mixed pool sizes by rank. 5. Establish individual pool size rank conditional to discovery data. 6. Generate play potential resources distribution.  Figure A-1. Sample Price-Supply Curve  Legend For Column Results Bbbl = billion barrels BOE = barrels of oil equivalent Mcf = thousand cubic feet Tcf = trillion cubic feet  34   In recognition of the differences in the extent of data and information available among the OCS areas (attributable mostly to the degree of past exploration and development activities), some variances in the use of GRASP modules and procedures were incorporated. The frontier and conceptual plays, in which available data are sparse and good analogs are not identified, are analyzed through the subjective method using GRASP. In this method, individual distributions of input variables are subjectively prepared and, through GRASP, ranked pool size distributions are generated. Most plays in the Alaska OCS and the Pacific OCS were analyzed this way. In the case of frontier plays for which the assessors feel confident that an analog exists, such as in the Atlantic OCS, the analyst can generate a pool size distribution from the statistical parameters of the appropriately scaled ranked pool size distribution of the analog plays and can estimate the play resources using GRASP. For established plays, such as those in the Gulf of Mexico and in southern California where significant amounts of pool data are available from discovered fields, a pool size distribution curve for a play can be generated from the distribution of discovered pools. The estimates of undiscovered oil and natural gas resources attributed to basins, provinces, regions, or other areas are derived by statistically aggregating the play-level resource distributions of the plays of that area.  Estimating Undiscovered Economically Recoverable Resources Generally, the field-size distributions (generated by GRASP) and geologic risk factors are the basic geologic inputs into the PRESTO model. The costs of exploration, development, and transportation, as well as tariffs based upon logical exploration, development, production, and transportation scenarios, were estimated for each OCS region, province, basin, or other operational subarea where activities, costs, or other circumstances warranted. Estimates of economically recoverable resources are then derived for a specific price by (1) subjecting the distributions to multiple computer iterations simulating the drilling of the hydrocarbon accumulations associated with the areas; (2) determining which fields and sizes are simulated to be discovered on each iteration; and (3) determining a discounted-cash-flow analysis for the area's resources using specified economic parameters. The resources that would exceed the economic hurdles are then totaled and become one data point on the price-supply curve. The process is repeated for numerous prices, and a continuous distribution curve is then generated. The Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic, and the Pacific contain stacked plays (i.e., plays overlie other plays at different depths). In determining the economic viability of such plays, assessors needed to consider the concurrent exploration, development, and production of possible pools in these plays. Otherwise, the estimates would be overly conservative. The current estimates of undiscovered economically recoverable OCS oil and natural gas resources were developed using the following assumptions: C C Fixed prices (no real price changes) 12-percent discount rate (after tax rate-of-return)  35   C C C C  12.5-percent or 16.7-percent royalty rate 35-percent tax rate 3-percent inflation rate Cost of exploration, development, and transportation, and tariffs with their associated development scheduling scenarios for each OCS region and portions of regions when conditions warrant Natural gas prices related to oil prices at 66 percent of the oil-energy equivalent  C  36   Appendix B. Fair Market Guidelines Summary of MMS Procedures for Determining Bid Adequacy at Offshore Oil Lease Sales: Effective August 1997 with Sale 168 The MMS has modified its existing bid adequacy procedures for ensuring receipt of fair market value on OCS oil and gas leases. In Phase 1 these procedures establish a new number of bids rule for acceptance of selected tracts. In Phase 2 these procedures expand the scope of tract evaluation; replace the geometric average evaluation of tract with a revised arithmetic average measure of the tract; eliminate the one-eighth rule for anomalous bids; and clarify the treatment of tracts identified as having unusual bidding patterns. These changes were made following a review of bidding activity in OCS sales. The new number of bids rule relies more on market-determined factors to ensure receipt of fair market value. This new rule, along with expansion of evaluation procedures beyond only tract-specific assessments, will allow for earlier acceptance on tracts that would be accepted later in the evaluation process. The revised average measure is designed to generate a better estimate of tract value when all bids fall below the Government's original estimate of tract value. The stricter screening rules associated with the revised average measure eliminate the need for the one-eighth rule. The Regional Director's expanded authority to handle documented instances of unusual bidding patterns provides flexibility to modify certain acceptance rules and allows for a decision to reject the high bid on identified tracts. The following set of bid adequacy procedures incorporates the most recent changes. During the bid review process, MMS conducts evaluations in a two-phased process for bid adequacy determination. In Phase 1 we review the bid for legal sufficiency1 and anomalies2 to establish the set of qualified bids3 to be evaluated. (1) Phase 1 partitions the tracts receiving bids into three general categories: C Those tracts that the MMS identifies as being nonviable4 based on adequate data and maps;  Legal bids are those bids that comply with MMS regulations (30 CFR 256) and the Notice of Sale. Any illegal high bid will be returned to the bidder. Anomalous bids include all but the highest bid submitted for a tract by the same company, parent or subsidiary (bidding alone or jointly). Such bids are excluded when applying the number of bids rule or any bid adequacy measure. 3 4 2  1  Qualified bids are those bids that are legal and not anomalous.  Nonviable tracts or prospects are those geographic or geologic configurations of hydrocarbons whose risk weighted most probable resource size is below the minimum economic field size for the relevant cost regime and anticipated future prices. The risk used is below the lowest level anticipated for any tract or prospect in the same cost regime.  37   C C  Those tracts where competitive market forces can be relied upon to assure fair market value; and Those tracts where opportunities for strategic underbidding, information asymmetry, collusion, and other noncompetitive practices are greatest and where the Government has the most detailed and reliable data.  Based on these categories, four Phase 1 rules are applied to all tracts receiving bids: C Pass directly to Phase 2 for further evaluation all tracts that require additional information to make a determination on viability or tract type and all drainage and development tracts. Accept the highest qualified bid on confirmed and wildcat tracts receiving three or more qualified bids where the third highest such bid on the tract is at least 50 percent of the highest qualified bid. Pass to Phase 2 confirmed and wildcat tracts receiving either one or two qualified bids, or three or more qualified bids where the third highest such bid is less than 50 percent of the highest qualified bid. Accept the highest qualified bid on confirmed and wildcat tracts determined to be nonviable.  C  C  C  In assuring the integrity of the bidding process, the Regional Director may identify an unusual bidding pattern5 at any time during the bid review process, but before a tract is accepted. If the finding is documented, the Regional Director has discretionary authority, after consultation with the Solicitor, to pass those tracts so identified to Phase 2 for further analysis. The Regional Director may eliminate all but the highest of the unusual bids from consideration when applying any bid adequacy rule, may choose not to apply a bid adequacy rule, or may reject the tract's highest qualified bid. Phase 1 procedures are generally completed fairly early following the bid opening. (2) Phase 2 applies criteria designed to resolve bid adequacy assessments by analyzing, partitioning, and evaluating tracts in two steps: C C Further mapping and/or analysis is done to review, modify, and finalize viability determinations and tract classifications. Tracts identified as being viable must undergo an evaluation to determine if fair market value has been received.  Within the context of our bid adequacy procedures, the term ""unusual bidding patterns"" typically refers to a situation in which there is an excessive amount of coincident bidding by different companies on a set of tracts in a sale. Other forms of unusual bidding patterns exist as well, and generally involve anti-competitive practices, e.g., when there is an uncommon absence of competition among companies active in a sale on a set of prospective tracts.  5  38   After completing these two steps, the following rules and procedures are used in Phase 2. C C Accept the highest qualified bid on all tracts determined to be nonviable. Accept newly classified confirmed and wildcat tracts having three or more qualified bids where the third highest such bid is at least 50 percent of the highest qualified bid. Determine whether any categorical fair market evaluation technique(s) will be used. If so: S S Evaluate, define and identify the appropriate threshold measure(s). Accept all tracts whose individual cash flow values, if estimated by MMS and used in the bid adequacy procedures, would result in satisfaction of the threshold categorical requirements.  C  C  Conduct a full-scale evaluation, which could include the use of MONTCAR6, on all remaining tracts7 passed to Phase 2 and still awaiting an acceptance or rejection decision. Compare the highest qualified bid on each of these remaining tracts to two measures of bid adequacy: the Mean Range of Values (MROV)8 and the Adjusted Delayed Value (ADV).9 S Accept the highest qualified bid for those tracts where such a bid equals or exceeds the tract's ADV. Reject the highest qualified bid on drainage and development tracts receiving three or more qualified bids where such a bid is less than one-sixth of the tract's MROV.  S  MONTCAR is a probabilistic, cash flow computer simulation model designed to conduct a resourceeconomic evaluation that results in an estimate of the expected net present value of a tract (or prospect) along with other measures. (A description of MONTCAR is provided in Appendix C.) These include tracts not accepted by a categorical rule that are classified as drainage and development tracts and those classified as confirmed and wildcat tracts that are viable and received (a) one or two qualified bids, or (b) three or more qualified bids where the third highest such bid is less than 50 percent of the highest qualified bid. The MROV is a dollar measure of a tract's expected net present private value, given that the tract is leased in the current sale, allowing for exploration and economic risk, and including tax consequences including depletion of the cash bonus. The ADV is the minimum of the MROV and the Delayed MROV (DMROV). The DMROV is a measure used to determine the size of the high bid needed in the current sale to equalize it with the discounted sum of the bonus and royalties expected in the next sale, less the forgone royalties from the current sale. The bonus for the next sale is computed as the MROV associated with the delay in leasing under the projected economic, engineering, and geological conditions, including drainage. If the high bid exceeds the DMROV, then the leasing receipts from the current sale are expected to be greater than those from the next sale, even in cases where the MROV exceeds the high bid. 9 8 7  6  39   S  Reject the highest qualified bid on drainage and development tracts receiving one or two qualified bids and on confirmed and wildcat tracts receiving only one qualified bid where the high bid is less than the tract's ADV.  C  Select from the outstanding tracts10 those (a) drainage and development tracts having three or more qualified bids with the third highest such bid being at least 25 percent of the highest qualified bid and (b) confirmed and wildcat tracts having two or more qualified bids with the second highest such bid being at least 25 percent of the highest qualified bid. Compare the highest qualified bid on each of these selected, outstanding tracts to the tract's Revised Arithmetic Measure (RAM).11 For all these tracts: S Accept the highest qualified bid where such a bid equals or exceed the tract's RAM. Reject the highest qualified bid where such a bid is less than the tract's RAM.  S C  Reject the highest qualified bid on all leftover tracts, i.e., those that were in the ""outstanding"" set above but not selected for comparison to the RAM.  In some cases where the high bid is less than the MROV, the present value of Government receipts may be larger if the high bid is accepted rather than rejected. This can be the case because (1) reoffering a rejected tract results in a delay in receiving bonuses and future royalties and (2) during the interval between the current sale and reoffering, some of the tract's resources may be drained to an adjacent tract. These elements are accounted for in the DMROV, which is computed as follows: 1. Using a model such as MONTCAR, an MROV along with royalty receipts (in present value terms) is estimated at the time of the next sale, when the tract is assumed to be reoffered if its high bid is rejected in the current sale. 2. The calculation of the MROV and royalties from the next sale reflect adjustments in prices, costs, and drainage during the time interval between sales. 3. Royalties (in present value terms) are estimated under the assumption that the tract's high bid is accepted in the current sale.  These consist of those tracts having a highest qualified bid that does not exceed the MROV or the ADV, and are either (a) drainage or development tracts receiving three or more qualified bids with the highest such bid exceeding one-sixth of the tract's MROV, or (b) confirmed and wildcat tracts that are viable and receive two or more qualified bids. The RAM is the arithmetic average of the MROV and all qualified bids on the tract that are equal to at least 25 percent of the high bid. 11  10  40   4. The DMROV is computed as the difference between the discounted sum of the MROV and royalties from the next sale, and the royalties from the current sale. Under the input assumptions used, a tract whose high bid is below the MROV but exceeds the DMROV will generate a greater amount of leasing receipts if it is accepted in the current sale rather than rejected and reoffered in the next sale. The Phase 2 bid adequacy determinations are normally completed sequentially over a period ranging between 21 and 90 days after the sale. The total evaluation period can be extended, if needed, at the Regional Director's discretion (61 FR 34730, July 3, 1996).  Definitions Used by MMS in Bid Adequacy Procedures Adjusted Delayed Value (ADV): The minimum of the MROV and the DMROV. Anomalous Bids: All but the highest bid submitted for a tract by the same company--parent or subsidiary (bidding alone or jointly). Confirmed Tract: A previously leased tract having a well(s) that encountered hydrocarbons and may have produced. It contains some oil and/or gas resources whose volume may or may not be known. Delayed Mean Range of Values (DMROV): A measure of the current sale's high bid needed to ensure that leasing receipts from this sale will exceed those in a subsequent sale if the high bid is rejected and the tract reoffered. Development Tract: A tract that has nearby productive (past or currently capable) wells with indicated hydrocarbons and which is not interpreted to have a productive reservoir extending under the tract. There should be evidence supporting the interpretation that at least part of the tract is on the same general structure as the proven productive well. Drainage Tract: A tract that has a nearby well that is capable of producing oil or gas, and the tract could incur drainage if and when such a well is placed on production. The reservoir, from which the nearby well is capable of producing, is interpreted to extend under the drainage tract to some extent. Legal Bids: Those bids on a tract that comply with MMS regulations and the Notice of Sale. Mean Range of Values (MROV): A dollar measure of the MMS estimate of a tract's expected net present private value, given that the tract is leased in the current sale. Nonviable Tract/Prospect: A tract or prospect is that geographic or geologic configuration of hydrocarbons whose risk weighted most probable resource size is below the minimum economic field size for the relevant cost regime and anticipated future prices. The risk used is below the lowest level anticipated for any tract or prospect in the same cost regime.  41   Qualified Bids: The bids on a tract that are legal bids and not anomalous. Revised Arithmetic Average Measure (RAM): The arithmetic average of the MROV and all qualified bids on the tract that are equal to at least 25 percent of the high bid. Viable Tract/Prospect: A tract or prospect having a resource level (obtained by using most probable inputs from ranges of values for appropriate parameters) that exceeds the minimum economic field size for that particular cost regime. Wildcat Tract: A tract that has neither nearby productive (past or currently capable) wells nor is interpreted to have a productive reservoir extending under the tract. It has high risk in addition to sparse well control.  42   Appendix C. MONTCAR Methodology Determination of the resource economic value of a tract offered for lease involves calculating the amount of economically recoverable resources, estimating recovery factors, production profiles, exploration and development costs, operating costs, and performing a discounted cash-flow analysis. The MMS uses a computer simulation model to determine the resource economic value of certain OCS tracts offered for lease by the Federal Government. The computer model utilizes the MONTE CARLO or range-of-values technique of handling calculations with uncertain input data. It provides a means to handle a series of subjective judgments about each individual variable. The burden of expressing the uncertainty is transferred from one or two individuals to the many experts in the various disciplines involved in the evaluation. This method explicitly recognizes the probabilistic nature of all variables affecting the evaluation and calculates a large number of possible outcomes based upon random samples from input probability distributions. Much of the geologic and engineering data (e.g., areal extent and thickness of the hydrocarbon pay zone, porosity, initial water saturation, recovery factors, production rates, product prices, costs, etc.) used to evaluate a tract is known with varying degrees of uncertainty. Providing a single number for the resource economic value of a tract is somewhat misleading since it provides no insight as to the relative uncertainty involved. The MONTE CARLO technique provides a range of resource economic values (net present worth (NPW)) for the tract with the probability of each value occurring being a direct consequence of the data uncertainty. The logic of the MONTE CARLO simulation method can be described as a four-step process. Step 1. Estimate the range and distribution of possible values of each variable that will affect the ultimate outcome of the venture. This requires judgments from geophysicists, geologists, paleontologists, stratigraphers, economists, and engineers. The most critical step in the process is quantifying the uncertainty involved through the use of these probability distributions. The amount of data concerning the prospect in question, the amount of information about the trend within which a prospect is located, and the experience of the scientists making the evaluation will dictate the type and shape of the probability distribution curves for each variable. Step 2. Select, at random, one value from the distribution of each variable. Compute the tract value using this combination of selected values. This determines one point in the final distribution of possible tract values. Select, at random, a second value from the distribution of each of the variables. Again compute the resulting tract value. This is the second point in the distribution of possible tract values. The random selection is statistically done in such a way that, if a large number of random selections are made (1,000 or more), the distribution of the randomly selected values closely resembles the distribution that was read in.  43   Step 3. Repeat the process 1,000 or more times, each time with a set of values selected at random from the distribution of each variable. Enough combinations of variables should be considered to adequately describe the shape and range of the distribution of tract values. For each trial (1 of the 1,000 or more repetitions) the tracts Net Present Worth (NPW) is determined from the combination of sample outcomes from each variable. Step 4. The means of the productive and dry NPW distributions are determined, the probability of hydrocarbons being present, and factors for bonus write-off and depletion are applied to determine the expected (risked) NPW of the tract. This is the mean of the range of values (MROV) commonly referred to as the Government's reservation price. A distribution of the MROV is also developed. The program also calculates what the expected NPW would be today if a tract was not leased until a later date, taking into account differences in income and excise tax payments and royalty or profit share payments; this is called the delayed MROV (DMROV). The method in effect constitutes a shift of emphasis regarding subjective judgments. Instead of requiring a single judgment about how a series of variables will interact collectively, a series of judgments are made on how each individual variable will occur.  44   The Department of the Interior Mission As the Nation's principal conservation agency, the Department of the Interior has responsibility for most of our nationally owned public lands and natural resources. This includes fostering sound use of our land and water resources; protecting our fish, wildlife, and biological diversity; preserving the environmental and cultural values of our national parks and historical places; and providing for the enjoyment of life through outdoor recreation. The Department assesses our energy and mineral resources and works to ensure that their development is in the best interests of all our people by encouraging stewardship and citizen participation in their care. The Department also has a major responsibility for American Indian reservation communities and for people who live in island territories under U.S. administration.  The Minerals Management Service Mission As a bureau of the Department of the Interior, the Minerals Management Service's (MMS) primary responsibilities are to manage the mineral resources located on the Nation's Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), collect revenue from the Federal OCS and onshore Federal and Indian lands, and distribute those revenues. Moreover, in working to meet its responsibilities, the Offshore Minerals Management Program administers the OCS competitive leasing program and oversees the safe and environmentally sound exploration and production of our Nation's offshore natural gas, oil and other mineral resources. The MMS Royalty Management Program meets its responsibilities by ensuring the efficient, timely and accurate collection and disbursement of revenue from mineral leasing and production due to Indian tribes and allottees, States and the U.S. Treasury. The MMS strives to fulfill its responsibilities through the general guiding principles of: (1) being responsive to the public's concerns and interests by maintaining a dialogue with all potentially affected parties and (2) carrying out its programs with an emphasis on working to enhance the quality of life for all Americans by lending MMS assistance and expertise to economic development and environmental protection."

NUCLEAR FUEL            Atoms are made up of three major particles:  protons, neutrons and electrons.     The most common fissionable atom is an isotope (the specific member of the atom's    family) of uranium known as uranium-235 (U-235 or U 235 ), which is    the fuel used in most types of nuclear reactors today.  Although uranium    is quite common, about 100 times more common than silver, U-235 is relatively    rare.   Most U.S. uranium is mined, in the Western United States.     Once uranium is mined the U-235 must be extracted and processed before it can    be used as a fuel.  In its final usable state, the nuclear fuel will be    in the form of a pellet roughly one-inch-long, which can generate approximately    the same amount of electricity as one ton of coal.                            TYPE OF REACTORS            Just as there are different approaches to designing and building airplanes    and automobiles, engineers have developed different types of nuclear power plants.     Two types are used in the United States: boiling-water reactors (BWRs), and    pressurized-water reactors (PWRs).  In the BWR, the water heated by the reactor core turns directly into steam    in the reactor vessel and is then used to power the turbine-generator.     In a PWR, the water passing through the reactor core is kept under pressure    so that it does not turn to steam at all -- it remains liquid.   Steam    to drive the turbine is generated in a separate piece of equipment called a    steam generator.  A steam generator is a giant cylinder with thousands    of tubes in it through which the hot radioactive water can flow.  Outside    the tubes in the steam generator,  nonradioactive water (or clean water)    boils and eventually turns to steam.  The clean water may come from one    of several sources: oceans, lakes or rivers.  The radioactive water flows    back to the reactor core, where it is reheated, only to flow back to the steam    generator.  Roughly seventy percent of the reactors operating in the U.S.    are PWR.  Nuclear reactors are basically machines that contain and control chain reactions,    while releasing heat at a controlled rate.  In electric power plants, the    reactors supply the heat to turn water into steam, which drives the turbine-generators.     The electricity is shipped or distributed through transmission lines to homes,    schools, hospitals, factories, office buildings, rail systems and other customers.           The reactor core is composed of four main elements:      THE FUEL .  Nuclear fuel consists of pellets of enriched uranium    dioxide encased in 12-foot long pencil-thick metal tubes, called fuel rods.      These fuel rods are bundled to form fuel assemblies.  A nuclear plant can    operate continuously for up to 2 years.  To run this long, a reactor must    have as many as 100 to 300 fuel assemblies.     THE CONTROL RODS .  The control rods contain material that regulates      the rate of the chain reaction.  If they are pulled out of the core,      the reaction speeds up.  If they are inserted, the reaction slows down.    THE COOLANT . A coolant, usually water, is pumped through the reactor      to carry away the heat produced by the fissioning of the fuel.  This      is comparable to the water in the cooling system of a car, which carries away      the heat built up in the engine.  In a reactor, as much as 330,000 gallons      of water flow through the reactor core every minute to carry away the heat.    THE MODERATOR .  A moderator, water, slows down the speed at which      atoms travel. This reduction in speed actually increases the opportunity to      split, thereby releasing energy.    Although engineering designs are quite complex, these four elements -- the fuel,  the control rods, the coolant and the moderator -- are the basic components of  a nuclear reactor.               ENVIRONMENT            Like all industrial processes, nuclear power generation has by-product wastes:    radioactive waste and hot water.  Because nuclear generated electricity    does not emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, nuclear power plants in the    U.S. prevent about as much greenhouse has emissions as taking 5 billion cars    off our streets and highways.  Radioactive wastes are the principal environmental concern for nuclear power.     Most nuclear waste is low-level nuclear waste.  It is ordinary trash, tools,    protective clothing, wiping cloths and disposable items that have been contaminated    with small amounts of radioactive dust or particles.  These materials are    subject to special regulation that govern their storage so they will not come    in contact with the outside environment.  On the other hand the irradiated fuel assemblies are highly radioactive and    must be stored in specially designed pools resembling large swimming pools (water    cools the fuel and acts as a radiation shield) or in specially designed dry    storage containers.  The older and less radioactive fuel is kept in the    dry storage facility. It is sealed in special concrete reinforced containers.     The United States Department of Energy's long range plan is for this spent fuel    to be stored deep in the earth in a geologic repository, at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.  Currently, all spent (used) fuel is stored    at the power plant at which it was used.

GX001-31-3094388	Nuclear          Energy           What is nuclear          energy, and how does it work?           TVA Nuclear          operates two different types of nuclear power plants, one using pressurized          water and the other boiling water. Sequoyah and Watts Bar Nuclear Plants          are based on a pressurized water reactor, and Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant          has a boiling water reactor.           Pressurized              water reactor diagram            Boiling water reactor diagram           A nuclear plant works            in much the same way that a TVA dam or fossil-fuel plant does, in that            large turbine blades are used to operate a generator to produce electricity.            At a hydroelectric dam, the force of the falling water spins the turbine            blades, while at a coal-fired or nuclear plant, the force of steam spins            the blades. A nuclear plant, however, uses uranium instead of coal as            a fuel to make steam.         The uranium is formed          into ceramic pellets and placed in metal tubes called fuel rods. In TVA’s          pressurized water reactors, about 51,000 fuel rods are placed in the reactor          vessel to make up the core—the part of the plant that produces heat.         When a uranium atom          splits in the process called nuclear fission, it gives off energy in the          form of heat. To regulate the heat-producing process, control rods and          borated water are used. The borated water speeds up or slows down the          fission process, and the control rods shut down the reaction when they’re          inserted between the fuel rods.         The water is heated          to about 304 degrees Celsius (580 degrees Fahrenheit). It’s kept          under high pressure to prevent it from boiling as it travels to tubes          inside four steam generators.         A secondary source          of water passes around the outside of the tubes in the steam generators.          The heat from the water inside the tubes is transferred to the secondary          source of water, which boils and turns to steam. The steam formed in the          generators is piped into the main turbine, where the force of the steam          turns the turbine blades. The turbine is connected to an electric generator          by a rotating shaft. As the turbine blades begin to spin, a magnet inside          the generator also turns, and that produces electricity.         Once the steam has          been used to drive the main turbine, the low-energy steam is converted          back to water by circulating around tubes (which carry cool water from          an adjacent lake) in a large boxlike structure called a condenser. The          condensed steam, now water, is pumped to the steam generators to repeat          the cycle. The water in the condenser tubes picks up heat from the steam          passing around the outside of the tubes. This heated water may be passed          through a 140-meter-high (459-foot) cooling tower before being returned          to the lake or reused in the plant. The three water systems are separated          from each other to ensure that radioactive water does not mix with nonradioactive.         In the boiling water          reactor design used at the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant, steam is produced          in the reactor core instead of in the steam generators. The turbine and          generator work to make electricity just as they do in a pressurized-water          nuclear plant or in a coal-fired plant.                      How safe is nuclear power?          The safety and health of the public and TVA employees are the first consideration          and top priority in the operation of TVA nuclear plants. Not only are          the plants designed to be safe and reliable, but TVA employees maintain          them to ensure they will operate as designed.            Maintaining a reliable          and efficient plant and a highly trained work force makes it unlikely          that a radiological incident will happen. Nevertheless, emergency preparedness          is an important part of TVA’s nuclear program. Emergency planners          work closely with federal, state, and local agencies to develop, maintain,          and practice emergency preparedness procedures. Drills are held throughout          the year to practice and coordinate the activities that allow TVA to ensure          the protection of the public and its employees.         TVA has installed            sirens within a 10-mile radius of nuclear plants to notify residents           promptly          in the event of an incident, and alert them to tune to their emergency            broadcast stations (see information, above  right). The sirens may           also be used to warn area residents          of tornadoes and other natural disasters.           Sources of radiation                                 What is radiation?          Radiation is energy emitted as invisible particles, waves, or rays. Radioactive          atoms produce radiation as they disintegrate. Everyone is exposed to small          amounts of radiation each day. Air, water, food, and sunshine are a few          sources of natural background radiation. Radiation also comes from other          sources, such as color televisions and medical x-rays.           People are concerned          about radiation exposure because it can alter or damage the human cell          structure. That is why nuclear power plants are carefully monitored and          employees are trained to limit their exposure to a level that is as low          as reasonably achievable.         The containment building,          the reactor vessel, the fuel assemblies, and several other barriers are          designed to contain radiation and protect plant workers and the public          living near a nuclear plant from any exposure to elevated levels of radiation.         Repeated surveys          around TVA’s operating nuclear plants have shown no detectable increase          in radiation levels over normal background levels.                                                     Generating Plants         Download       a color brochure about  TVA’s nuclear plants  that             explains how they work and includes data on each plant (PDF file,       278 kb).

The agency succeeded the Atomic Energy      Commission, which previously had responsibility for both developing and regulating      nuclear activities. Federal research and development work for all energy sources,      as well as nuclear weapons production, is now conducted by the U.S. Department      of Energy.      Under its responsibility to protect public health and safety, the NRC has      three principal regulatory functions:       (1) establish standards and regulations; (2) issue licenses for nuclear facilities      and users of nuclear materials; and       (3) inspect facilities and users of nuclear materials to ensure compliance      with the requirements. These regulatory functions relate to both nuclear power      plants and to other uses of nuclear materials -- like nuclear medicine programs      at hospitals, academic activities at educational institutions, research work,      and such industrial applications as gauges and testing equipment.      The NRC places a high priority on keeping the public informed of its work.      The agency maintains a current website and a public document room in Rockville,      Maryland (NRC headquarters) as well as holds       public hearings, public meetings in local areas and at NRC offices, and discussions      with individuals and organizations.      WHY REGULATE ?      The nuclear industry is strictly regulated because of the potential hazards      involved in using radioactive materials. These radioactive materials give      off radiation, which can be hazardous to people if they are exposed to it      in significant amounts. The extent of the risk depends on the type and amount      of radiation emitted by the radioactive material, the distance between the      source of the radiation and a person, and the length of time a person is exposed      to the radiation.      The risks can be lessened by reducing any or all of these factors. The hazard      is less if there is a shielding material like lead or concrete to block some      of the radiation, if a person moves farther from the radiation source, or      if the exposure time is reduced.       If radioactive materials are properly handled and regulated, they do not      pose a significant risk to the public or to workers.      Radioactivity from natural sources is present throughout the world. People      are continuously exposed to low-level radiation from radioactive materials      in the earth and from cosmic rays from space. Exposure to natural radiation      can be affected by geography as well as lifestyle. For example, radiation      levels are higher in the mountains, and travel by airplane contributes additional      exposure because of increased cosmic radiation at high altitudes. Most people      also receive some radiation exposure from medical and dental x-rays and other      medical procedures.      The NRC's regulatory program establishes limits for radiation exposure to      workers and the general public as a result of the various uses of radioactive      materials licensed by the NRC. In addition, the NRC requires users to take      steps to keep exposures well below the limits.      NRC ORGANIZATION      The NRC is headed by a five-member Commission. The Commissioners are appointed      to 5-year terms by the President of the United States with confirmation by      the Senate. A Chairman is designated by the President.      The NRC staff numbers approximately 3,000 with a budget of about $500 million.      Roughly two-thirds of the NRC employees work in the agency's headquarters      in Rockville, Maryland. The remainder are located primarily in four regional      offices (see map on opposite page) or at resident inspector offices at each      commercial nuclear power plant and some fuel cycle facilities.      NRC REGULATIONS      The NRC sets the rules that users of radioactive materials must follow.      These rules are intended to protect the persons using the radioactive materials      and the general public from the potential hazards of radioactivity. Many NRC      regulations have been established or changed, as necessary, based on the recommendations      of the NRC staff. Members of the public and interested organizations can also      request changes in regulations. The views of the public, of the industry being      regulated, and of other interested parties are usually solicited before new      rules or changes are adopted.      REGULATORY RESEARCH      As part of its regulatory program, the NRC conducts an extensive research      program to provide independent information and expertise to support its safety      decisionmaking and to assess potential technical issues. This NRC research      is performed by Government laboratories, universities, and other research      institutions. Topics of inquiry include such subjects as the durability and      integrity of reactor components, the impact of natural phenomena like earthquakes      and tornadoes on nuclear facilities, radioactive waste disposal technology,      and the way workers react to instruments and systems in nuclear facilities.           LICENSES      Any organization or individual intending to possess or use radioactive materials      must obtain a license. The use of very small amounts of radioactive materials      -- like the tiny radiation source inside many smoke detectors -- is exempt      from licensing or is authorized by a general license, which does not require      active control to assure safety. However, for the manufacturing of these and      similar items, a specific license involving regulatory control is required.      The NRC licenses all commercial nuclear fuel facilities involved in the      processing and fabrication of uranium ore into reactor fuel. Licenses for      over 100 commercial nuclear power plants and their operators are issued also      by the NRC. Licenses for other uses of radioactive materials are issued either      by the NRC or by State Governments under NRC-approved regulatory programs.      About 5,000 licenses for radioactive materials are under the jurisdiction      of the NRC, and about 15,500 are under the jurisdiction of those States known      as Agreement States that regulate certain radioactive materials under agreements      with the NRC.      States also have regulatory jurisdiction over certain radioactive substances      that occur naturally (primarily radium and radon) or are produced by machines      called particle accelerators.      The NRC or State license specifies the types and quantities of radioactive      materials that may be possessed and used, as well as any specific restrictions      on their use. Typically, licenses describe the location of use, the training      and qualifications of workers, specific procedures for using the materials,      and any special safety precautions required. The license holder must follow      the specific license requirements as well as the more general NRC regulations.      POWER PLANT LICENSES      In the past, nuclear power plants required two licenses -- a construction      permit, which allowed the facility to be built, and an operating license,      which permitted operation of the facility once it was completed.      In 1989 the NRC adopted a streamlined licensing process that encourages      the use of standardized and pre-approved designs for any future plant proposals      and provides for the issuance of a combined construction permit and operating      license. Another feature of the streamlined process is possible early approval      of sites for nuclear plants. This combined licensing process provides for      the early resolution of virtually all issues before construction begins. This      combined license also incorporates a program of tests, inspections, and related      acceptance criteria that are necessary and sufficient to show that the plant      has been properly built. These criteria must be met before operation can begin.      This process provides for public hearings on the certification of the standard      design. It also provides for public hearings on the site approval and on the      issuance of a combined construction permit and operating license. As the plant      nears completion, a public hearing could be held if a significant question      exists on whether the criteria of the combined license have been met.      The licenses for nuclear power plants are issued for a 40-year period. Licenses      for currently operating plants will begin to expire soon after 2000. The NRC      has developed a process for extending licenses for an additional 20 years.      License renewals have been approved for a handful of reactors and more requests      for license extensions are in the pipeline.       Licenses for nuclear power plants can be amended and updated as the result      of operating experiences at that plant or at other plants. When necessary,      the NRC can impose new regulations or require changes in operating procedures      or equipment to improve the safety of nuclear power plant operations.      In addition to licensing the facility, the NRC also licenses the individuals      who operate the controls of the reactor. Licenses fall into two categories      -- reactor operator and senior reactor operator. The second category is necessary      for supervisory positions. Before operator licenses are issued, individuals      must complete an extensive training program conducted by the utility and pass      license examinations administered by NRC examiners. Once licensed, the operators      continue to receive training and are periodically tested to show they remain      qualified to operate the plant.      INSPECTIONS      The NRC periodically inspects all facilities it licenses to ensure that      their activities meet NRC regulations and the terms of their licenses. These      inspections vary in scope and frequency according to the relative hazard of      the authorized activities. Throughout the construction period and operating      life of a nuclear power plant, for example, numerous inspections are conducted      each year. A small medical or research facility, using limited quantities      of radioactive materials, might be inspected every few years.      For nuclear power plants and certain fuel cycle facilities, the NRC inspection      program includes the work of NRC resident inspectors, who are stationed at      the site on a full-time basis; inspections by specialists based in regional      offices and NRC headquarters; and special team inspections made up of personnel      from the regional offices and from NRC headquarters. Normal inspections consist      of examination of a sample of the work being performed by a utility or facility      owner. If evidence of problems is found, the inspector will focus       on that work area in more detail.      The core of the NRC inspection program for nuclear power plants is carried      out by the resident inspectors; at least two inspectors are assigned to each      site.      The inspection specialists, based in regional offices, review plant security,      emergency planning, radiation protection, environmental monitoring, periodic      testing of plant equipment and systems, fire protection, construction activities,      and other more specialized areas.      During the course of a year, NRC specialists may conduct 10 to 25 routine      inspections at each nuclear power plant and several inspections at fuel facilities,      depending on the activities at the facilities and problems that may occur.      The special team inspections may focus on a specific activity, like maintenance      or security, or a team may be sent to the facility to look at a specific operating      problem or accident.      All inspections and the findings by the inspectors are documented in inspection      reports. These reports are sent to the facility to inform the utility of the      findings. Inspection reports are also maintained for public review at its      Public Document Room in Rockville, Maryland, near Washington, D.C. (Certain      sensitive information --       principally on nuclear facility security -- may be withheld from public disclosure.)      When the inspections uncover violations of NRC requirements, the agency      has a range of enforcement actions. The basic action is issuance of a notice      of violation, which requires the licensee to correct the problem and take      steps to prevent a recurrence of the violation. The licensee's response must      be acceptable to the NRC.      For more serious violations or repetitive ones, the NRC may fine utilities      and other licensees up to $120,000 a day for each violation.      If serious questions exist about the safety of NRC-licensed activities,      the NRC may issue orders requiring that licensed activities be halted or an      individual be removed from work involving NRC-licensed materials. NRC orders      also may modify, suspend, or revoke a license.      Licensed activities, if halted, may not be resumed until the safety and      management problems are corrected and the NRC approves the resumption of work.      A licensee or individual who chooses to contest a fine or an order has the      right to a hearing before the NRC.      The performance of each operating nuclear power station is evaluated quarterly      using the findings of NRC inspections and performance indicators--data which      monitors the effectiveness of plant safety systems and procedures. Once a      year, the NRC prepares a more extensive performance report for each plant      and discusses the assessment with the licensee in a meeting open to the public.      The plant assessments, inspection reports, and other evaluation documents      are made available at www.nrc.gov/ras/ on NRC's web site.      On occasion, the NRC receives allegations of wrongdoing involving misconduct      by licensees or their contractors. Allegations of possible criminal activities      are handled by the professional investigative staff of the NRC Office of Investigations.      These investigations may result in civil enforcement action or criminal prosecution      against licensees, individuals, or others.      THE NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE      The nuclear fuel cycle (shown below) begins with the milling of uranium      ore extracted from the earth at uranium mines to produce uranium concentrate      called ""yellowcake."" The yellowcake is converted into uranium hexafluoride      gas at a special facility and loaded into cylinders. The cylinders are sent      to a gaseous diffusion plant, where uranium is enriched for use as reactor      fuel. The enriched uranium is then converted into oxide powder, fabricated      into fuel pellets (each about the size of a fingertip), which are loaded into      metal fuel rods about 12 feet long and bundled into reactor fuel assemblies      at a fuel fabrication facility. Assemblies are then transported to nuclear      power plants, non-power research reactor facilities, and naval propulsion      reactors for use as fuel.      Eight major fuel fabrication and production facilities are licensed to operate      in the United States and two enrichment facilities are regulated by the NRC.      Because they handle extremely hazardous material, these facilities must take      special precautions to prevent theft, diversion by terrorists, and dangerous      exposures by workers and the public to nuclear material. The NRC licenses      and regularly inspects these plants to ensure that they are safely operated.      HOW A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT WORKS      Power plants change one form of energy into another. Electrical generating      plants convert heat, the energy of wind or falling water, or solar energy      into electricity.      A nuclear power plant is one of those plants that converts heat into electricity.      Other types of heat-conversion plants burn coal, oil, or gas for a heat source      that is used to produce electricity.      The heat -- no matter what the source -- is normally used to heat water      to the boiling point and produce steam. This steam is then carried by pipes      to a turbine -- which has a series of fan blades on a shaft. The force of      the steam pushes against the blades, turning the turbine.      The turbine is connected to a generator. As the turbine shaft spins, the      generator turns and produces electricity. This electricity is then carried      by wires to the homes, businesses, and institutions where the electricity      is used.      Electricity is one of the few forms of energy that can easily be moved from      one place to another. Electrical energy can be produced in large quantities      at one location and transported by wires to many different places.      We can see coal, oil, or gas burning -- and we know from experience that      it produces heat. This is the sort of energy many people use to heat their      homes. Some furnaces heat air, which is blown through ducts into each room;      others heat water, which is piped throughout the house into radiators where      the water gives off some of the heat it absorbed from the burning fuel.      Nuclear energy -- as it is used in a nuclear power plant -- cannot be seen.      There is no burning of fuel in the usual sense. Rather, energy is given off      by the nuclear fuel as certain types of atoms split into pieces. This energy      is in the form of fast-moving particles and invisible radiation. As the particles      and radiation move through the fuel and surrounding water, the energy is converted      into heat.      The heat is the useful energy resulting from the splitting of atoms. The      radiation energy itself can be hazardous and requires special precautions      to protect people and the environment.      To understand this process let's look at a nuclear reactor -- which is a      large water-filled vessel containing the nuclear fuel. Water in the reactor      is heated by the nuclear reaction -- and the heat is carried off to spin the      turbine.      URANIUM FUEL      The fuel of a nuclear plant is uranium, but only a certain type of uranium      atom can be easily split to produce energy. This type of uranium atom -- called      uranium-235 -- is less than 1 percent of uranium as it is mined. To make fuel      for reactors, the uranium ore is purified and then processed to increase the      percentage of uranium-235 up to 5 percent of the uranium. This percentage      is enough for a continuous splitting of uranium atoms -- but much less than      the percentage necessary for a nuclear weapon, which requires almost 100-percent      pure uranium-235. The low percentage of uranium-235 in reactor fuel is one      of the reasons a plant can never explode like an atomic bomb.       To increase the percentage of uranium-235, a process called gaseous diffusion      is used. This process heats natural uranium to form a gas, and then separates      the lighter molecules of uranium-235 from the heavier molecules of uranium-238      (another version of uranium), by forcing them through a membrane with tiny      openings. Because the uranium-235 is lighter, it moves through the membrane      more easily, and the two gases can then be separated, increasing the concentration      of uranium 235, and ""enriching"" the fuel.      When a uranium-235 atom splits --or ""fissions,"" to use the technical term      -- it gives off energy in the form of radiation and also as fast-moving pieces      of the original atom. One of these pieces, which is called a neutron, can      collide with another uranium-235 atom and cause it to split, too. A continuing      series of these atomic splits, each triggering another one, is called a chain      reaction.      Uranium-235 will split, or ""fission,"" spontaneously, but these spontaneous      atomic splits aren't frequent or reliable enough to use as an energy source.      The pieces fly away too fast and don't cause the fission of another atom.      The pieces need to be slowed down so that they can collide with another uranium-235      atom and continue the chain reaction.      Several types of materials can be used to slow down the atomic particles,      but most nuclear power plants (including all of those now operating in the      United States) use water as the ""moderator"" -- the material that slows down      the particles to allow the chain reaction to continue.      To control the chain reaction, reactors have control rods which can be inserted      into the reactor to absorb the neutrons as they are given off, thus slowing      or stopping the chain reaction.      TWO REACTOR TYPES      Two main types of reactors are in operation in the United States -- the      pressurized water reactor (PWR) and the boiling water reactor (BWR). About      two-thirds of the reactors are PWRs, and one-third are BWRs.      The PWR is a two-stage system that keeps the water in the reactor under      high pressure so that it does not boil. Piping carries this heated water to      large cylinders called steam generators. The heated reactor water flows through      thousands of tubes in the steam generator. The tubes are surrounded by a secondary      water supply that boils and produces steam, which is carried away by pipes      to spin the turbine generator.      The reactor cooling water then returns to the reactor to be reheated and      circulated back to the steam generator, again in a continuous loop.      The BWR is a single-stage system that allows the water in the reactor to      boil and produce steam, which is then piped directly to the turbine generator.      In both types of reactors, once the steam loses its energy in spinning the      turbine, it flows into a condenser. Because not all the heat energy in the      steam can be converted into electricity, the leftover heat must be carried      away by cooling water pumped through the condenser. The condenser contains      thousands of tubes carrying cool water, which causes the steam to condense      back to water. The water is collected in the condenser and pumped back to      be reheated, either in the reactor itself for a BWR or in the PWR steam generator.      The condenser cooling water is drawn from a lake, river, or ocean. This      water does not actually pass through the reactor, but only through the condenser      tubes to cool the steam after it goes through the turbine. There is no contact      between the condenser cooling water and the reactor cooling water or the reactor      components themselves.      This outside cooling water, heated as it passes through the condenser, is      returned to the source lake, river, or ocean. Many nuclear plants as well      as other types of power plants or industrial facilities use cooling towers,      cooling lakes or ponds, or other techniques to reduce the effects of heated      water discharged directly back into the river, lake, or ocean. With cooling      towers, the water, once cooled, is usually pumped back into the condenser      to be used again to carry off heat. Only a small portion of the water is returned      to the natural water source.      Once the steam is produced, the process and equipment used to generate electricity      are similar in nuclear power plants and fossil-fueled power plants. Fossil-fueled      plants also discharge heated water to the environment or use cooling towers      or other means to cool the water from the condenser.      RADIOACTIVE BYPRODUCTS      Because the fission reaction produces radioactive materials, which can be      hazardous, nuclear power plants are equipped with safety systems to protect      workers, the public, and the environment.      Radioactive materials require careful use because they produce radiation      -- a form of energy that can damage human cells and, depending on the amount      and duration of the exposure, can potentially cause cancer over long periods      of time. A person can be exposed to radiation in two ways. Internal exposures      occur if a radioactive material is inhaled or ingested and remains deposited      in the body. External exposures can result from a person being close to a      radioactive material without adequate shielding.      In the reactor, most of these hazardous radioactive substances -- called      fission byproducts -- are trapped in the fuel pellets themselves or in the      sealed metal tubes holding the fuel. Small amounts of these radioactive fission      byproducts, principally gases, however, become mixed with the water passing      through the reactor. Other impurities in the water are also made radioactive      as they pass through the reactor. The water is processed and filtered to remove      these radioactive impurities and then returned to the reactor cooling system.      Minute quantities of radioactive gases and liquids are ultimately released      to the environment under controlled and monitored conditions during normal      plant operations.      Radioactive materials lose their radioactive properties over time. Some      are short-lived and become nonradioactive forms in seconds or minutes. Other      radioactive elements take much longer to lose their radioactivity. This process      is called radioactive decay.      The NRC has established limits for the release of radioactivity during routine      operations. These limits are based on guidelines set by the Environmental      Protection Agency and by national and international standard-setting groups.      Although the effects of very low levels of radiation are difficult to detect,      the NRC limits are based on the conservative assumption that radiation exposures      to members of the public should only be a small fraction of what they receive      from natural environmental radiation.      Experience has shown that nuclear plants typically release only a small      portion of the NRC limits during normal operations. A person spending a full      year at a nuclear plant boundary would receive an additional radiation exposure      of less than 1 percent of the radiation exposure everyone receives from naturally      occurring radiation. (Natural environmental radiation exposures average 300      millirems per year.) Year-round exposure at the plant boundary is an additional      1 to 2 millirems or less.      The NRC also sets limits for radiation exposure to individuals working at      nuclear plants and other facilities using radioactive materials. Because these      individuals receive the radiation exposure as part of their employment and      because they receive special training on radiation protection, the occupational      limits are higher than those permitted for the general public. Radiation workers      must wear devices to measure the radiation to which they are exposed.      The environmental impact of routine operations at a nuclear plant is very      small. But because of the radioactivity remaining in the reactor fuel, the      plant must have effective safety systems to prevent an accident that would      lead to a large amount of that radioactivity being released from the plant.      The likelihood of such an accident is remote, but the possibility that one      could occur leads to special care in design, construction, and operation of      nuclear power plants.      REACTOR SAFETY SYSTEMS       A nuclear power plant is equipped with four major types of safety systems      to prevent accidents and reduce their effects if one should occur:            A system to quickly shut down a reactor and stop the fission chain reaction.       Numerous systems to control reactor pressure and to continue cooling the       reactor fuel -- that is, to carry away the heat that continues to be generated       even after the reactor is shut down.       Electrical, control, and instrument systems for safety systems and for       monitoring reactor conditions.       System of barriers to contain radioactivity if it should escape from the       reactor fuel in an accident.           SHUTDOWN SYSTEMS       Each reactor has a system to insert the control rods into the reactor core      within seconds to stop the fission reaction. This immediate shutdown -- called      a reactor ""scram"" or reactor ""trip"" -- can be triggered by a reactor operator      or by automatic controls that protect the reactor from any unusual conditions      in the plant.      COOLING AND PRESSURE - CONTROL SYSTEMS      When a reactor is operating, the heat energy from the fission reaction is      carried off in the cooling water. That energy is used as steam to spin the      turbine generator, making electricity. A reactor shutdown stops the fission      reaction, but heat is still generated by the radioactive fission byproducts,      which have built up in the reactor fuel. Much less heat is created than when      the reactor is operating, but the heat is still sufficient to damage the fuel      if it is not cooled. As time passes after the reactor shutdown, the amount      of heat produced in the fuel in the reactor core decreases. Continued cooling      of the fuel remains necessary, however. Both normal cooling systems and emergency      cooling systems are available. Each system has at least two parallel parts      so that if one fails, the other part would still be available to continue      to cool the reactor.      The emergency core cooling system (ECCS) consists of pumps and valves and      pipes that are independent of the normal cooling system. The ECCS contains      equipment that can pump at high pressure to inject water into the reactor      when the pressure inside is at the high levels maintained during operation.      In addition, low pressure systems pump water at lower pressures, such as those      that might occur if a cooling water pipe broke and allowed pressure inside      the reactor to drop.      The reactor systems also contain valves that can be opened to reduce pressure      by releasing steam. These relief valves open automatically if pressure gets      too high in the reactor system. Some of the valves can be opened using controls      in the reactor control room. These pressure-      reduction systems can also be used to reduce reactor pressure so that the      low pressure cooling systems can function.       SAFETY SYSTEM POWER      Most of the safety systems are powered by electricity, although some pumps      use steam to drive them in order to have an alternative source of power. Because      of this reliance on electrical power, nuclear plants are required to have      multiple sources of electricity.      A nuclear plant uses a portion of the power it generates to run plant equipment.      A plant also must have at least two connections to the utility's electrical      distribution system so that it can immediately shift to offsite power sources      if a shutdown occurs. Should there be a failure in the offsite power connections,      each plant has emergency diesel generators with sufficient capacity to supply      electricity to the critical safety systems.      The control and instrument systems normally use direct current (DC) electricity,      the kind of power found in batteries. For these systems, large banks of batteries      provide DC power if there is an interruption in the normal sources of electricity.      CONTAINING RADIOACTIVITY      Nuclear power plants have three principal barriers to prevent the release      of radioactivity -- the sealed fuel rods, the reactor vessel and associated      components, and the structure housing the reactor, called the reactor containment.      A serious reactor accident could damage the fuel rods, which form the first      barrier, if adequate cooling does not occur. Overheated fuel rods could leak      or break apart and eventually melt. Possible damage to the reactor cooling      system piping could breach the second barrier.      Even with the failure of these first two barriers, the reactor containment      is designed to hold radioactive material that might otherwise be released      to the outside environment. One type of reactor containment is a large cylinder-shaped      building made out of reinforced concrete with a steel lining. It is designed      to withstand the pressures that might build up inside as steam and gases escape      from the reactor during an accident. Another type of containment, called a      pressure suppression containment, has a large water-filled pool to cool the      steam and reduce the pressure buildup in the containment.      The NRC requires that the reactor containment be periodically tested to      show it meets requirements to prevent leakage from inside the structure.      Although reactor containments were designed to cope with many types of serious      reactor accidents, they may not withstand the conditions that result from      an extremely unlikely accident in which all cooling capability is lost in      the reactor. Under these circumstances, the energy produced by the radioactivity      remaining in the fuel could cause the fuel to melt. Melting of the fuel could      eventually lead to a pressure buildup in the containment that could cause      radioactive gases to leak through seals and gaskets around the containment.      The molten fuel could also damage the concrete base of the containment, leading      to a possible release of radioactivity. Even in these cases, however, most      of the long-term hazardous radioactive material would remain inside the containment      structure.      In the only major commercial power reactor accident in the United States,      the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, there was extensive fuel damage. Radioactive      gases and contaminated cooling water filled the containment. Although some      radioactivity was released to the atmosphere by an indirect route, the containment      itself performed as designed and kept the radioactivity safely bottled up      inside. The effectiveness of the containment was the major factor in preventing      the release of large amounts of radioactive materials to the environment.      In 1986 a much more serious accident occurred at Chornobyl in the former      Soviet Union. The reactor was very different from those used in the United      States. The plant had no containment system like that of U.S. plants. The      Chornobyl accident severely damaged the reactor core, releasing large quantities      of radioactivity to the environment. Radioactive material was deposited in      nearby countries, and radioactivity was detectable at very low levels in the      United States.      WHAT IF?      Although a major reactor accident is unlikely and each plant is equipped      with safety systems to prevent or cope with an accident, additional measures      help protect public heath and safety.      The first is special training given to the reactor operators in the handling      of emergency situations. One of the lessons learned as a result of the Three      Mile Island accident was that reactor operators needed to practice how they      would handle emergencies. Detailed emergency operating procedures have been      prepared and the operators have been trained to use them. In addition, most      nuclear power plants use computer-based simulators for training in both routine      and abnormal situations. These simulators are laid out just like the plant's      control room with all of the controls and instrumentation. Computers let the      operators practice dealing with emergencies as they occur in the simulator's      control room.      The Three Mile Island accident also pointed out the need for improved planning      by Federal, State, and local governments to deal with possible reactor accidents.      The NRC now requires that emergency plans be prepared for evacuation or other      actions to protect the residents in the vicinity of nuclear plants. These      plans usually cover an area about 10 miles in all directions around each nuclear      plant. The utility has its own emergency plan to notify government officials      of a possible emergency and to provide them with information and recommendations.      State and local governments have detailed plans for sheltering and evacuation      of residents if necessary. Federal emergency plans include Federal personnel,      equipment, and resources needed to respond to a nuclear power plant accident.      The NRC would closely follow the handling of an accident by a utility and      investigate the causes of the accident.      These emergency plans are tested through emergency exercises that simulate      a serious reactor accident. Utility personnel and government officials follow      their emergency plans in gathering information, consulting with each other,      and issuing instructions to the public. These emergency exercises sometimes      include small-scale evacuation drills for schools, nursing homes, and other      institutions.      The NRC must determine that there is reasonable assurance that evacuation      or other steps can be taken to protect area residents in the event of a major      reactor accident. To make this determination, the NRC reviews the utility's      plans, conducts inspections, and considers the assessment of State and local      planning by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.      NUCLEAR INSURANCE      Congress has established a system of ""no-fault"" insurance to provide liability      coverage in the event of a major reactor accident. This insurance program,      initiated under the Price-Anderson Act, combines commercial insurance and      self-insurance by the nuclear industry. Large nuclear plants are required      to have the maximum amount of liability insurance that is commercially available,      currently $200 million. In addition, each licensed reactor is liable for a      $75.5 million assessment to provide funds in the event of a major accident      at a plant in the United States. (No reactor would be assessed more than $10      million in any one year.)       With over 100 commercial nuclear power plants in the United States, the      combination of commercial insurance and industry self-insurance exceeds $8      billion. This is the total liability limit for an accident under the Price-Anderson      Act and no claims are required to be paid in excess of this amount. Congress,      however, will consider the need for providing an additional source of funds      should $8 billion prove inadequate.      The Price-Anderson Act provides for liability insurance coverage for actual      damages incurred by anyone affected by a major reactor accident. Besides the      coverage for offsite public liability claims, the NRC requires that utilities      maintain $1 billion in onsite property damage insurance to provide funds to      deal with cleanup of the reactor site after an accident.      RADIOACTIVE WASTE DISPOSAL      During normal operations, a nuclear power plant generates two types of radioactive      wastes -- high-level waste, which consists of used fuel (usually called spent      fuel), and low-level wastes, which include contaminated equipment, filters,      maintenance materials, and resins used in purifying water for the reactor      cooling system. Other users of radioactive materials also generate low-level      wastes.      Each type of waste is handled differently.      HIGH-LEVEL WASTE      Typically, the spent fuel from nuclear power plants is stored in water-filled      pools at each reactor site and at one storage facility in Illinois. However,      several utilities have begun using dry cask storage pending final disposal.      In this way, spent fuel is stored in heavy metal or concrete containers placed      on concrete pads adjacent to the reactor facility. From one-fourth to one-third      of the reactor fuel is removed and replaced during refueling. Reactors are      normally refueled every 12 to 18 months.      Spent fuel is highly radioactive because it contains the fission byproducts      that were created while the reactor was operating. One characteristic of radioactive      material is that it decays or loses its radioactivity at a set rate. Each      radioactive component has a different rate of decay called its half-life --      the time it takes the material to lose half of its radioactivity. Some fission      byproducts have a half-life of a few seconds; others have half-lives of hundreds      or thousands of years.      When fuel is first removed from the reactor, the short-lived radioactive      materials are still present. But over time, these substances decay, leaving      the longer-lived materials as the principal substances for disposal. These      materials include cobalt-60 (5-year half-life), cesium-137 (30-year half-life),      and plutonium-239 (24,400-year half-life).      Special procedures are needed in the handling of the spent fuel, since the      radiation levels can be very dangerous without proper shielding. The water      in the spent fuel storage pool provides cooling and adequate shielding from      the radiation to protect workers in a nuclear plant. Concrete and steel in      dry casks provide adequate protection, too.      Although most of the spent fuel remains stored at individual plants, some      spent fuel has been shipped to offsite interim storage facilities. One offsite      storage facility operates in Illinois. These shipments have used heavily shielded      shipping containers designed to withstand the conditions that might occur      during a shipping accident. Spent fuel has been shipped by rail and by truck.      The NRC certifies each shipping container that meets Federal requirements,      and the Department of Transportation sets the rules for actual transportation      of the spent fuel.      Some of the components in spent fuel remain hazardous for a long time. Permanent      disposal of spent fuel, therefore, requires a disposal facility that provides      reasonable assurance that the waste will remain isolated for thousands of      years.      The Department of Energy (DOE) is developing plans for a permanent disposal      facility for spent fuel from nuclear power plants as well as for the high-level      waste produced by the Nation's nuclear weapons production activities.       Congress has directed DOE to focus on a proposed site at Yucca Mountain      in southern Nevada for this waste disposal facility. Site studies are still      under way to determine if the site is adequate for long-term disposal of the      high-level waste.      DOE would design, build, and operate the facility, and the NRC would regulate      it. The NRC must approve the site and design for the facility and must inspect      it during construction and operation.      Although some nuclear plants have adequate capacity to store the spent fuel      they generate until a DOE site is available for disposal, other plants, particularly      the older ones, may soon run out of storage space in their spent fuel pools.      DOE and the nuclear industry are considering various options to store additional      spent fuel, including dry storage, construction of additional offsite interim      storage facilities, and techniques for storing more fuel in the existing spent      fuel storage pools.       LOW-LEVEL WASTE      Low-level radioactive waste, whether from a nuclear power plant or from      other users of radioactive material, is shipped to licensed commercial disposal      facilities where it is packaged and placed in burial trenches and covered      with soil. Less than half of the waste volume is from nuclear power plants;      the remainder is generated by hospitals, research institutes, and other users      of radioactive materials.       In 1980 Congress mandated that each State be responsible for assuring the      availability of disposal capacity for commercial low-level waste produced      in the State. States could provide for disposal either individually or as      a group by joining together in a regional agreement. The individual States      or State groups are in the process of selecting new burial sites or, in some      cases, will use the facilities that have been operating.       TRANSPORTATION      About 3 million packages of radioactive materials are shipped each year      in the United States -- by highway, rail, air, and water. Regulating the safety      of these shipments is the joint responsibility of the U.S. Department of Transportation      (DOT) and the NRC.      The Federal regulatory system protects transport workers and the public      by setting performance standards for the packages and by setting limits on      the radioactive contents and radiation levels for packages and vehicles. Information      on radioactive shipments is provided by package marking and labeling, vehicle      placards, and shipping papers describing the materials.      DOT has regulatory jurisdiction over radioactive shipments while the material      is in transit. DOT also establishes shipping categories, sets the standards      for labeling of radioactive shipments, and establishes criteria for packages      used for smaller quantities of radioactive materials. The NRC, which licenses      the organizations shipping and receiving the radioactive materials, assures      that its licensees comply with the DOT shipping requirements. The NRC also      establishes the requirements for the design and manufacture of packages for      larger quantities of radioactive materials.      Typical of small-quantity shipments --using packages meeting DOT requirements--are      radioactive materials for medical diagnostic tests and therapy.      These shipments constitute the major portion of all shipments of radioactive      materials each year. For these shipments, packaging (classified as ""Type A"")      is used that is expected to withstand the rigors of normal transportation      without incurring any damage.      The packages for larger quantities of radioactive materials are designed      to withstand accident conditions without releasing their contents. These packages,      designated as ""Type B,"" are used for shipping industrial irradiators, medical      radiation therapy devices, and some radioactive wastes. The accident evaluation      criteria for these packages include impact, puncture, heat, and submersion      in water.      A specialized Type B package is the spent fuel shipping cask, which is used      to transport used fuel from nuclear reactors. These large shipping casks are      carried on trucks or rail cars. Like all Type B packages, they are sealed      to prevent leakage and heavily shielded to minimize the radiation levels.      The NRC also imposes security requirements on shipments of spent fuel and      on shipments of larger quantities of highly enriched uranium or plutonium.      These security measures include route evaluation, escort personnel and vehicles,      communications capabilities, and emergency plans.      State governments are notified in advance of spent fuel shipments and those      large-quantity shipments of radioactive waste requiring Type B packages.      The regulatory system for transportation of radioactive materials has been      successful in minimizing the safety impact from accidents involving the shipments.      Few accidents have occurred involving shipments of radioactive materials (averaging      less than 50 out of 3 million packages shipped annually). Only a small number      of those accidents have involved any release of the radioactive contents.      In these instances, radioactive contamination has been generally minor with      no public safety consequences.      DECOMMISSIONING      Decommissioning is the term used for ending the operation of a nuclear facility.      Nuclear power plants are licensed for a term of 40 years. Some plants may      be closed before that time elapses; others may seek an extension of the license      period.       Several nuclear power plants have been decommissioned, and some others are      undergoing decommissioning. The NRC has adopted extensive regulations for      dealing with the technical and financial issues associated with decommissioning.      These regulations apply to nuclear power plants and to other facilities      that handle radioactive materials in forms that may require cleanup procedures      when the facility is closed. Careful radiation surveys must also be performed      before the site can be released for other uses.      During the operating life of a nuclear power plant, many plant components      associated with the reactor become radioactive, either through contamination      or as a result of the radiation from the fission reaction. Therefore, care      is needed in the handling of decommissioning work, and contaminated materials      have to be shipped to a low-level radioactive waste disposal site for burial.      The NRC has identified two principal plans for decommissioning a nuclear      power plant -- immediate dismantling or safe storage for a period of 30 to      50 years followed by dismantling. A third option, called entombment, may also      be available in some cases. This would involve sealing off radioactive components      with concrete and steel. Entombment would require less maintenance and fewer      security provisions than the storage option.      The storage and entombment methods allow for a reduction in the levels of      radioactivity over time. NRC studies have shown that after 50 years, the volume      of radioactively contaminated material would be reduced to one-tenth of the      original volume as a result of radioactive decay. Delay in dismantling a plant      would also result in lower radiation exposures to the workers involved.      Cost estimates for decommissioning a large nuclear plant are $300 million      or more, plus the cost of demolition of non-contaminated materials. The NRC      decommissioning rules require utilities to establish funds to pay for the      future decommissioning of their plants.      Similar financial procedures are also required for other types of nuclear      facilities, including plants that prepare fuel for nuclear power plants or      process radioactive materials.      Some facilities that previously used nuclear materials in processing or      manufacturing activities require special management attention to ensure proper      remediation. The NRC developed a Site Decommissioning Management Plan to compel      timely cleanup of certain unusual and difficult sites, particularly those      with a lot of soil contamination or with old, contaminated buildings. Remediation      can usually be completed in four years. Afterwards, the site can be used safely      for any purpose.

Reference         ""The Harnessed Atom,"" Teacher's Edition, U.S. Department of          Energy.         Top           Lesson Plan         Greeting...         Increasingly, our country has become a nation of electricity users. We          depend on an abundant affordable supply of energy to power the many machines          we use in our complex society. Can you imagine what it would be like not          having electricity in your home? About one-third of our energy resources          are used to produce electricity.         Electricity can be produced in many ways -- most of which you already          know about. Today, we're going to talk about one of those ways -- nuclear          fission. In America, nuclear energy plants are the second largest source          of electricity after coal -producing approximately 21 percent of our electricity.          There is something I want all of you to be aware of and that is the purpose          of a nuclear power plant is to produce electricity.         Accordingly, while nuclear power plants have many similarities to other          types of electricity generating plants, there are some significant differences.         With the exception of solar, wind, and hydroelectric plants all others          including nuclear convert water to steam which spins the propeller like          blades of a turbine which spins the shaft of a generator. Inside the generator          coils of wire and magnetic fields interact to create electricity.           [ Turbine/Generator ]         The energy needed to boil water into steam is produced in one of two          ways -- by burning coal, oil, or gas (fossil fuels) in a furnace or by          splitting certain          atoms of uranium in a nuclear energy plant. Nothing is burned or exploded          in a nuclear energy plant. Rather, the uranium fuel generates heat through          a process called fission.         What Is Fission? Where Does it Take Place?         Uranium is an element that can be found in the crust of the earth. This          element, quite abundant in many areas of the world, is naturally radioactive.          Certain isotopes of uranium can be used as fuel in a nuclear power plant.          The uranium is formed into ceramic pellets about the size of the end of          your finger.  [ Reactor          Fuel Assembly ]  These pellets are inserted into long, vertical          tubes (fuel rods) within the reactor. The reactor is the heart of the          nuclear power plant. Basically, it is a machine that heats water.         A reactor has four main parts: 1) the uranium fuel assemblies, 2) the          control rods, 3) the coolant/moderator, and 4) the pressure vessel. The          fuel assemblies, control rods, and coolant/moderator make up what is known          as the reactor core. The core is surrounded by the pressure vessel.             [ Franklin's          Core ]         We also have to understand that uranium cannot just be thrown into a          reactor the way we shovel coal into a furnace. The fuel rods, containing          the uranium, are carefully bound together into fuel assemblies, each of          which contains about 240 rods. The assemblies hold the rods apart so that          when they are submerged into the reactor core, water can flow between          them.         When the uranium atom splits, it releases energy and two          or more neutrons from its nucleus. These neutrons can then hit the nuclei          of other uranium atoms causing them to fission. The sequence of one fission          triggering others, and those triggering still more, is called a chain          reaction. When the atoms split, they release energy in the form of heat.           [ Chain reaction ]  The heat is          transferred from the reactor core to the steam generator. Here, it's converted          to high pressure steam which turns the turbine in the electric generator.          [ Turbine/Generator ]         This next transparency shows the basic design of the nuclear          fuel steam plant and its various components. [ Nuclear          Power Plant ]         In the past few minutes I've introduced several new terms.          Let me explain what each means in the energy generating process. First,          control rods. What are they? How are they used?         The control rods slide up and down in between the fuel assemblies          in the reactor core. They control or regulate the speed of the nuclear          reaction by absorbing neutrons. Here's how it works. When the control          rods absorb neutrons, fewer neutrons hit the uranium atoms thus slowing          down the chain reaction.         On the other hand, when the core temperature goes down,          the control rods are slowly lifted out of the core, and fewer neutrons          are absorbed. Therefore, more neutrons are available to cause fission.          This releases more heat energy.         Just as there are many different types of houses and cars,          there are different types of nuclear power plants that generate electricity.          The two basic types being used in the United States are the  Boiling          Water Reactor (BWR)  and the  Pressurized          Water Reactor (PWR) . These power plants are often referred to as light          water reactors.         Top         [Pass out Activities          4 -   Boiling Water Reactor (BWR)            & 5 -   Pressurized Water          Reactor (PWR)   -- Students can label components of each type          reactor during the discussion]           Boiling Water Reactor (BWR)         The boiling water reactor operates in essentially the same          way as a fossil-fuel generating plant. Neither of these types of power          plants have a steam generator. Instead, water in the BWR boils inside          the pressure vessel and the steam water mixture is produced when very          pure water (reactor coolant) moves upward through the core absorbing heat.          The water boils and produces steam. When the steam rises to the top of          the pressure vessel, water droplets are removed, the steam is sent to          the turbine generator to turn the turbine. [ BWR          schematic ]         Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR)         The pressurized water reactor differs from the BWR in that          the steam to run the turbine is produced in a steam generator. Water boils          at 212°F or 100°C. If a lid is tightly placed over a pot of boiling          water (a pressure cooker), the pressure inside the pot will increase because          the steam cannot escape. As the pressure increases, so does the temperature          of the water in the pot. In the PWR plant, a pressurizer unit keeps the          water that is flowing through the reactor vessel under very high pressure          to prevent it from boiling. The hot water then flows into the steam generator          where it is converted to steam. The steam passes through the turbine which          produces electricity. About two thirds of the reactor power plants in          the U.S. are of the PWR type.

Criteria for including reactors          are: 1) participation in the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's certification          or pre-certification programs or 2) inclusion under the international          Generation IV International Forum (GIF) program for longer-term reactor          development. The U.S. Department of Energy is among the sponsors of the          GIF program. While no detailed technical description of particular reactor          designs is included, such descriptions and schematics are available elsewhere          and, when practical, are hyperlinked in the text. Reactor vendors who          put forward new designs anticipate that their designs will meet commercial          market needs including an affordable, competitive construction cost and          the usually low operating costs of commercial nuclear reactors. Such views          are not assessed, though a section does identify public discussion of          efforts by the nuclear industry and the U.S. government to improve the          industry's competitive position. 1                           Existing          Reactor Designs and Design Categories            There are now 104 fully licensed          nuclear power reactors in the United States though only 103 are now operational. 2           Because each of these reactors is fully licensed and meets national safety          standards, a potential builder might replicate any of these designs for          future construction. This is less likely, however, because existing, operable          reactors in the United States were licensed during or before the 1970s.          Technology has progressed and any future construction should incorporate          more advanced designs that better meet today's commercial criteria.         There are four possible exceptions          to the preceding statement. Four reactors in the United States were partially          built and still possess valid construction licenses. These reactors are          WNP-1 (Washington State), Watt's Bar 2 (Tennessee), and Bellefonte 1 and          2 (Atlanta). Moreover, these four construction licenses have recently          been extended to approximately the end of the present decade. Construction          on each unit was halted over a decade and a half ago. Builders of these          units, subject to the rules of their licenses, have the right to resume          construction on their reactors, units that were designed during the 1970s          or earlier. Whether the construction will resume and whether former designs          will be continued remains to be determined.         All existing commercial nuclear          reactors in the United States fall into two broad categories, pressurized          water reactor (PWR) and boiling water reactor (BWR). Because both types          of reactors are cooled and moderated 3           with ordinary ""light"" water, the two designs are often grouped          collectively as light water reactors (LWR). LWRs generate power through          steam turbines similar to those used for most power generated by burning          coal or fuel oil. Light water reactors have so far proven to be the most          commercially popular reactor design worldwide though there are notable          exceptions. 4           There are several available websites that discuss existing reactors in          the United States. These include  http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/nuclear/page/nuc_reactors/reactsum.html .          Information on international operating reactors is available at  http://www.iaea.org/programmes/a2 .         PWRs use nuclear-fission to          heat water under pressure within the reactor. This water is then sent          to a heat exchanger (called a ""steam generator"" in PWRs) where          steam is produced to drive an electric generator. The water used as a          coolant in the reactor and the water used to provide steam to the electric          turbines exists in separate closed loops that involve no discharges to          the environment. Of the 104 operable reactors in the United States, 69          are PWRs. Westinghouse, Babcock and Wilcox, and Combustion Engineering          designed the units operating in the U.S. After these reactors were built,          Westinghouse and Combustion Engineering nuclear assets were combined with          British Nuclear Fuels Limited to form Westinghouse BNFL. The French-German          firm Framatome ANP has acquired many of Babcock and Wilcox's nuclear technology          rights, though portions of the original Babcock and Wilcox firm still          exist and also possess some technology rights as well. Other major makers          of PWR reactors including Framatome ANP and the Russian Atomstroyexport          have not yet sold their reactors in the U.S. A schematic diagram of a          PWR can be found at           http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/nuclear/page/nuc_reactors/pwr.html .         The remaining 35 operable          commercial nuclear reactors in the United States are BWRs. BWRs allow          heat from the reactor core to boil the coolant water directly into the          steam (i.e. no heat transfer) that is used to generate electricity. General          Electric built all boiling water reactors now operational in the United          States. Framatome ANP and Westinghouse BNFL have each designed BWRs though          these have not yet been sold in the United States. A schematic diagram          of a BWR can be found at  http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/nuclear/page/nuc_reactors/bwr.html .         Although no LWR projects have          been initiated in the United States since the 1970s, the overall performance          record of the existing fleet has been reasonably successful. Some 111          LWRs have entered service in the U.S. since 1969. 5           Only seven of those since 1969 have been permanently shut down. The average          annual capacity factor for nuclear reactors in the United States was over          90 percent in 2002. Average operating costs, as reported by the Federal          Energy Regulatory Commission, are slightly lower for LWRs than for operating          coal-fired plants and considerably below operating costs for gas-fired          plants. 6         There have been attempts to          operate additional classes of reactors in the United States, though most          examples were prototypes and were not commercial successes. Perhaps the          most famous example was the Fort Saint Vrain reactor that operated between          1974 and 1989. It was a high temperature gas-cooled reactor or HTGR. Other          HTGRs operated elsewhere notably in Germany. HTGRs, of which there are          many sub-categories, continue to stimulate interest with small prototypes          now operating in China and Japan and additional HTGR designs promoted          by firms in South Africa, the United States, the Netherlands, and France.          HTGRs use a gas- recently helium has been preferred- to generate electricity.          In some cases the turbine is run directly by the gas, in other cases steam          or alternative hot gases are produced in a heat exchanger to generate          the power. HTGRs are distinguished from other gas-cooled reactors by the          higher temperatures attained within the reactor. Such higher temperatures          might permit the reactor to be used as an industrial heat source in addition          to generating electricity. Advocates of HTGR designs hold that HTGR's          have high safety, low costs, and an ability to supply power to smaller          markets .         Commercial reactor designs          that operate outside of the United States include fast breeder reactors          (FBRs), pressurized heavy water reactors (PHWRs), and gas-cooled reactors          (GCRs). FBRs have received only very limited market support, though ""commercial""          units operate in Russia and France, and prototypes exist in other areas,          notably Japan and India. ""Breeder"" or ""fast"" reactors          have advantages because U-235 is the only naturally occurring uranium          isotope that is directly suitable for commercial energy production. U-235          is only 0.7 percent of natural uranium. 7           Most of natural uranium is the U-238 isotope that is not directly usable          as a reactor fuel. During the course of any reactor operation a portion          of the U-238 in the fuel is converted to plutonium, primarily the useful          Pu-239 isotope, which provides much of the energy used in nuclear power          production. The bulk of the U-238 content in an LWR is not converted to          plutonium and the unconverted U-238 does not contribute significantly          to power generation. A breeder reactor converts more U-238 to usable fuels          than the reactor consumes, though any unused fuel would have to be ""reprocessed""          before some of the plutonium and the remaining U-238 would again be usable.          FBRs have, so far, proven to be more expensive to build and operate than          LWRs. It is not yet clear whether this is due to the fact that most FBRs          have been prototypes or if this reflects underlying costs. The plutonium          content of the reprocessed fuel also raises concerns over weapons proliferation.          Many early FBR designs were prone to system failures, though same, notably          the BN-600 unit in Russia, have operated over extended periods. Proponents          of advanced reactor designs believe that some commercial FBR designs could          be deployed prior to most other advanced, but untested commercial designs. 8         PHWRs have been promoted primarily        in Canada and India, with additional commercial operating units in several        other nations including South Korea, China, Romania, and Argentina. Canadian        designed PHWRs are often called ""CANDU"" reactors. 9         Siemens, ABB, and Indian firms have also built commercial PHWR reactors.        Commercial heavy water reactors now in operation use heavy water as moderators        and coolants. No successful effort has been made to license PHWRs in the        United States. PHWRs have proven to be popular in several countries because        they usually use less expensive natural (not enriched) uranium fuels and        can be built and operated at competitive costs. PHWRs have often been preferred        by nations wishing to develop an indigenous fuel cycle without expensive        enrichment facilities. Proliferation issues related to the continuous process        of refueling PHWRs have raised some concerns . 10          The term gas-cooled reactor          (GCR) can be used ambiguously . HTGRs, for example, are clearly a subset          of GCRs that operate at higher temperatures. As used here, GCRs are ""Magnox""          reactors designed and built in the United Kingdom since the 1950s and          the derivative, advanced gas-cooled reactor (ACR), also operated in the          United Kingdom. Similar reactors have been built in France, Sweden, and          Japan. No traditional GCR design has operated commercially in the United          States. Existing GCR designs have not been commercially successful outside          of the United Kingdom. Commercial GCRs 11           in the United Kingdom have operated longer than commercial reactors anywhere          else in the world. Like the PHWRs, the original GCR designs use natural          uranium fuels, though newer designs use slightly enriched fuels and are          not confined to uranium.  12         Other potential designs for          commercial reactors abound. They have not been widely considered in recent          history in the United States. There is some experience with additional          concepts elsewhere.                     N ew          Designs            1. Certified          Designs         Following statutory requirements,          the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has set up a process by which          reactor designs might be certified prior to any actual construction plans.          The certification process seeks to reduce site development time by resolving          common design issues prior to construction. Design certification is an          optional process and may occur simultaneously with site licensing.

Any new reactor built in the          United States over the next decade or so would probably use designs either          recently certified by the NRC or that will be certified by the NRC in          the near future. The re-creation of older designs is popular overseas          and cannot be ruled out in the United States. Presently there are three          certified new reactor designs in the United States: the System 80+, the          Advanced Boiling Water Reactors (ABWR), and the AP600. These designs are          sometimes called Advanced Light Water Reactors (ALWR) because they incorporate          more advanced safety concepts than the reactors previously offered by          vendors.                   System 80+  (Westinghouse BNFL): The System 80+ reactor          is a PWR that was designed by Combustion Engineering and by its successor          owners ABB and Westinghouse BNFL. The NRC has certified the System 80+          for the U.S. market, at Westinghouse BNFL no longer actively promotes          the design for domestic sale. The System 80+ has provided the basis for          the APR1400 that has been developed in Korea for future deployment. Information          on the System 80+ reactor can be found on  http://www.nei.org/index.asp?catnum=3&catid=703           and  http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/designs/sys80/sys80.html .                            ABWR  (General Electric, Toshiba, Hitachi): Of the three          NRC- certified ALWR designs only the ABWR has been deployed. Two ABWRs          are operating in Japan, and four are under construction, two each in Taiwan          and Japan. While the ABWR design is usually associated in the United States          with General Electric, the two units now being built in Japan are products          of Toshiba and Hitachi. General Electric, Toshiba, and Hitachi have shown          an interest in building ABWRs in the U.S. There are many variations in          ABWR design with the most frequently mentioned capacities in the 1250-1500          MWe range. Smaller and larger designs exist depending on vendor. Vendors          now claim costs for the ABWR that have attracted some customer interest.          Information on the ABWR can be found at  http://www.nei.org/doc.asp?docid=110 ,           http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/designs/abwr/abwr.html ,          and  http://www.gepower.com/dhtml/corporate/en_us/assets/nuclear/prod/abwr_power_plant.jsp/ .                            AP600  (Westinghouse BNFL): The AP600 is a PWR designed          by Westinghouse BNFL and certified by the NRC. The AP600, while based          on previous reactor designs, has innovative passive safety features that          permit a greatly simplified reactor design. The AP600 has been bid overseas          but has never been built. Westinghouse has recently de-emphasized the          AP600 in favor of the larger, though potentially less expensive AP1000          design. Information on the AP600 can be found at  http://www.ap600.westinghouse.com/           and at  http://www.nei.org/index.asp?catnum=3&catid=704 .                  The initial ALWR reactors          as a group have been praised for their improvements in reactor safety          and simplicity, but construction costs on a per kilowatt of capacity basis          might be a barrier to commercial success in the U.S. The ABWR design however          has many variations and continues to be promoted in the U.S. by several          vendors.         2. Undergoing          Certification         Only one reactor design is          presently undergoing certification with the NRC, although this situation          could change shortly as additional designs move from ""pre-certification""          to actual ""certification"". The process of certification can          take several years, and depends heavily on what design is proposed and          supported by potential vendors and buyers.                 AP1000  (Westinghouse BNFL): Quite often when a reactor          is named, its name includes digits such as the ""1000"" in the          AP1000. This usually indicates the initial electricity generating capacity          of the design, in this case 1000 MWe. Seldom do do the digits mean the          present capacity of the design. The most recent AP1000 now has 1117 MWe          capacity. The AP1000 is an enlargement of the initial AP600, designed          to increase the reactor's target output by over 80 percent without significantly          increasing the total cost of building the reactor. Operating costs are          anticipated to be less than the AP600. While Westinghouse BNFL owns rights          to several other designs, the AP1000 is the principal product that the          company now promotes in the United States. The AP1000 is a PWR with innovative,          passive safety features and a much simplified design that is intended          to cut the material and construction costs of the plant. Information on          the AP1000 can be found at  http://www.ap1000.westinghouse.com/           and at  http://www.nei.org/doc.asp?docid=770 .          Information related to NRC certification for the AP1000 can be found at           http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-licensing/license-reviews/ap1000.html .                          3. Undergoing          Pre-Certification            While pre-certification is          a technical concept within the NRC regulatory environment, the process          can mean many things to potential reactor manufacturers. Concepts such          as the ESBWR, the SWR-1000, and the ACR-700 appear to be much further          along toward potential deployment than, say, the IRIS and GT-MHR designs. 13           Pre-certification, however, represents a vendor's intention to proceed          toward commercialization in the U.S. and perhaps globally. Pre-certification          is a less expensive stage of the overall certification process, because          actual certification procedures are much more complex.                  ESBWR  (General Electric): The ESBWR 14           is a new simplified BWR design being promoted by General Electric. It          constitutes an evolution and merging of several earlier design ideas including          the ABWR and some other designs that are no longer being actively pursued          by GE. The intent of the new design, which includes new passive safety          features, is to cut construction and operating costs significantly from          the ABWR design. GE is investing heavily in the ESBWR though the design          might not be available for deployment for several years. Information related          to certification of the ESBWR can be found at  http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-licensing/license-reviews/esbwr.html .                          Siedewasser Reaktor             (SWR-1000) (Framatome ANP): The SWR-1000   is          a Framatome ANP design for an advanced BWR. Framatome ANP was created          through the merger of the French nuclear vendor Framatome and the nuclear          power assets of the German firm Siemens. The SWR-1000 was originally designed          by Siemens and has been bid for a proposed reactor in Finland. Framatome          ANP has also recently begun SWR-1000 pre-certification with the NRC. Literature          on the design emphasizes the reactor's passive safety features. Information          on the SWR1000 can be found on  http://www.de.framatome-anp.com/anp/e/foa/anp/products/s112.htm .          Information related to certification of the SWR-1000 can be found at  http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-licensing/license-reviews/swr-1000.html .                   ACR-700  (Atomic          Energy of Canada Limited): AECL's ""Advanced CANDU Reactor"" ACR-700 15           has been developed over a lengthy period of time and is considered an          evolution from AECL's internationally successful CANDU line of PHWRs.          CANDU reactors have been more of a commercial success than any other line          of power reactors other than the LWRs. One of the innovations in the ACR-700,          compared to earlier CANDU designs, is that heavy water is used only as          a moderator in the reactor. Light water is used as the coolant. Earlier          CANDU designs used heavy water both as a moderator and as a coolant. This          change makes it debatable whether the ACR-700 is a PHWR, a PWR, or a hybrid          between the two designs. This AECL has aggressively marketed the ACR-700          offering low prices, short construction periods, and favorable financial          terms. As is the case for most non-LWR reactors, most U.S. utilities,          nuclear engineers, and regulators have only limited working familiarity          with the design. Information on the ACR-700 can be found on  http://www.aecltechnologies.com/Content/ACR/default.htm            and  http://www.aecl.ca/index.asp .          Information related to certification of the ACR-700 can be found at  http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-licensing/license-reviews/acr-700.html .                  P ebble-bed Modular          Reactor      (PBMR) (Eskom): The PBMR, which uses helium          for heat transfer, is part of the HTGR family of reactors and thus a product          of a lengthy history of research, notably in Germany, but has been promoted          by the South African utility Eskom. Eskom continues to partner in the          design with BNFL and formerly included the U.S. utility Exelon among its          investors. Exelon later pulled out of the project, primarily because it          felt that reactor development was not part of its main business activities.          This led to delays in the NRC certification process. Recently Eskom has          received approval to build a prototype PBMR in South Africa. Certification          procedures in the U.S. were never abandoned although the process has slowed.          At around 165 MWe the PBMR is one of the smallest reactors now being proposed          for the market. This is considered a marketing advantage because new small          units require less capital investments than larger new units. Small size          has been viewed as a regulatory disadvantage because most licensing regulations          (at least formerly) required separate licenses for each unit at a site.          If each PBMR module at a site were licensed separately, more regulatory          activity would be required. Fuels used in the PBMR would be more highly          enriched uranium than is presently used in LWR designs. Details regarding          the PBMR design can be found on  http://www.pbmr.com/ .          Information related to certification of the PBMR can be found at  http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-licensing/license-reviews/pbmr.html .                   G as-turbine          Modular Helium Reactor   (GT-MHR)           (General Atomic): The GT-MHR is an HTGR design that has been developed          primarily under the lead of the U.S. firm, General Atomics. The most advanced          plans for GT-MHR development relate to building reactors in Russia to          assist in the ""burn up"" of surplus plutonium supplies. Parallel          plans for commercial power reactors would use uranium based-fuels enriched          to as high as 19.9 percent U-235 content. This would keep the fuel below          the 20 percent enrichment level that defines highly enriched uranium.          In initial designs, the conversion of the energy in the heated helium          coolant to electricity would be directly in a gas turbine. There has been          concern regarding untested aspects of this technology as it applies to          the GT-MHR. This has led some potential sponsors to propose less risky          heat transfer mechanisms to generate electricity. The U.S. utility, Entergy,          has participated in GT-MHR development and has used the name ""Freedom          Reactor"" for the design. Because coolant temperatures arising from          HTGR reactors are much higher than from LWRs the design is viewed as a          potential commercial heat source. There has been particular attention          to the design's potential in a non-polluting method to produce hydrogen.

Information related to certification of          the GT-MHR can be found at           http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-licensing/license-reviews/gt-mhr.html .                   International          Reactor Innovative & Secure  (IRIS) (Westinghouse BNFL):          Westinghouse BNFL has promoted the  IRIS           reactor design as a significant simplification and innovation in          PWR design. The reactor would be smaller than most operating PWRs and          would be much simplified. The IRIS reactor includes features designs that          are intended to avoid loss of coolant accidents. Research has continued          for some time on the design and pre-certification is in process. The IRIS          is viewed as not ready for development during the present decade, but          may show potential during the next decade. IRIS has a targeted 2015 completion          date. Information on the IRIS can be found on  http://www.nei.org/index.asp?catnum=3&catid=712           and through  http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-licensing/new-licensing-files/ml030780800.pdf .          Information related to certification of the IRIS can be found at  http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-licensing/license-reviews/iris.html .                              4. Anticipated            for Possible Pre-Certification           Two designs, the European            Pressurized Water Reactor (EPR) and the ACR-1000, have not been submitted            for pre-certification in the United States. Because of the attention            that the designs are now receiving, they are described below.                     EPR  (Framatome ANP): Framatome ANP has not decided            if it will market its EPR in the United States. The EPR is a rather            conventional PWR unit though components have been simplified and considerable            emphasis is put on reactor safety. The design was bid on a project in            Finland during 2003. Additionally, the French utility Electricite de            France (EdF) has proposed building an EPR at Penly in France. The French            government is now determining whether to build this prototype. Nuclear            power already constitutes over 75 percent of France's power supply;            therefore building a new reactor in France might lead to decommissioning            an existing reactor to make room in the market for the base load power            provided by an EPR. Not building a prototype might affect the eventual            long-term marketability of the EPR. The proposed size of the reactor            would be around 1500 MWe though earlier designs were as large as 1750            MWe.                       ACR-1000  (Atomic Energy of Canada Limited): While AECL            is promoting its ACR-700 design, an ACR-1000 is being designed as well.            If the scale economies attributed by Westinghouse BNFL to its AP series            and to GE's ABWR are valid, one might anticipate parallel, cost-lowering            results for the ACR series. Advertised costs for the ACR-700 are already            as low as any design proposed for the near term. Promised construction            times of three years would set modern records for larger reactors. Information            on the ACR-1000 can be found on  http://www.aecl.ca/index.asp .             5. Generation            IV Concepts                       The U.S. Department of Energy            participates in the Generation IV International Forum (GIF), an association            of ten nations that seek to develop a new generation of commercial nuclear            reactor designs before 2030. Criteria for inclusion of a reactor design            for consideration by the GIF group include:                  1.          Sustainable energy (extended fuel availability, positive environmental          impact)                 2. Competitive energy (low costs,          short construction times)                 3. Safe and reliable systems          (inherent safety features, public confidence in nuclear energy safety)                 4. Proliferation resistance          (does not add unduly to unsecured nuclear material) and physical            protection;          (secure from terrorist attacks)            During 2002, GIF members            agreed to concentrate their efforts and funds on six concept designs            that they seek to become commercially viable between 2015 and 2025.            There is thus some leeway between the 2030 target for the GIF program            and the targets for individual concepts. Individual GIF participant            nations are free to pursue any technology they chose, therefore not            all concepts are goals for the United States.            The GIF group, along with            the U.S. Department of Energy's Nuclear Energy Research Advisory Committee            (NERAC), has published ""A Technological Roadmap for Generation            IV Nuclear Energy Systems"" (December 2002) which summarizes plans            and designs for Generation IV projects. This is accessible through  http://www.nuclear.gov/             and describes each design in some detail including reactor schematics.            Each design is evolutionary; thus while the following descriptions involve            comparisons, these analogies should be interpreted with caution.                                 Gas-cooled Fast Reactor  (GFR): The GFR uses helium            coolant directly to a gas turbine generator to produce electricity.            This parallels PBMR and original GT-MHR designs. The primary difference            from these designs is that the GFR would be a ""fast"", or breeder            reactor. One favored aspect of the design is that it would minimize            the production of many undesirable spent fuel waste streams. The reference            design size is targeted to be 288 MWe with a deployment target date            of 2025. In addition to producing electricity the design might be used            as a process heat source in the production of hydrogen.                                Lead-cooled Fast Reactor  (LFR): So far, most breeder            reactors have used molten metal technologies for their coolants. Many            FBRs have used molten sodium, a metal with which there is considerable            experience but which has sometimes been difficult to handle.The            LFR uses molten lead or a lead-bismuth alloy as its coolant. One design            favored in the Generation IV would result in long periods between refuelings,            15-20 years. Similar designs have been investigated in Russia. Target            ranges for the reactor would be 50-150 MWe. That would be rather small            by historic nuclear standards, but might meet localized market needs.            Designs as large as 1200 MWe have been suggested. Initial targeted deployment            would be in 2025. Proposed designs would favor electricity production            though proponents consider the production of process heat at LFR units            as possible. One design in this family of reactors is described on  http://www.coe.berkeley.edu/labnotes/1002/reactor.html .                       Molten Salt Reactor  (MSR): The MSR involves a circulating            liquid of sodium, zirconium, and uranium fluorides as a reactor fuel.            The MSR has been presented as providing a comparatively thorough fuel            burn, safe operation, and proliferation resistance. The initial reference            design would be 1000 MWe with a deployment target date of 2025. The            design could use a wide variety of fuel cycles. Temperatures for electricity            production would not be as hot as for some other advanced reactors but            some process heat potential exists. Versions of the MSR have been around            for some time but never were implemented for commercial uses. During            2003, the MSR was removed from the Gen IV program because it was seen            as too distant into the future for inclusion within the  Gen            IV schedule.                               Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor  (SFR): Sodium-cooled fast            reactors have been the most popular design for breeder reactors. Designs            have been proposed under the ""Technological Roadmap"" ranging            from 150 to 1700 MWe. Molten metal technology is no longer ""new""            but several early SFR prototypes had difficulty obtaining sustained            operation. The BN-600 in Russia has been regarded as highly reliable.            Design supporters believe that the SFR promises superior fuel management            characteristics. The target deployment date of 2015 reflects the considerable            research that the design has already received. Earlier prototypes have            already been built in France, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia,            and the United States since as early as 1951. Initial deployment would            probably focus on electricity due to comparatively low ""outlet            temperatures"" for the design. Sodium cooled reactors are discussed            at  http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/~gav/almr/01.intro.html .                                Supercritical-water-cooled Reactor  (SCWR): The SCWR            design is to be the next step in LWR development and has been proposed            with alternatives that evolve from the BWR and PWR. SCWRs would operate            at higher temperatures and thermal efficiencies than present LWRs. The            reference plant would be 1700 MWe, above the upper end of present LWR            designs. The deployment target date is 2025. Most research on the design            has been in Japan. Designers intend the SCWR to be much less expensive            to build than today's LWR units though some of the economies appear            to be shared by units now undergoing certification. Operating cost savings            are also anticipated.                      Very-high-temperature Reactor  (VHTR): The VHTR is an            evolution from the HTGR family of reactors but would operate at even            higher temperatures than designs now undergoing pre-certification. In            contrast with the GFR, the VHTR would not be a breeder reactor, thus            it would produce less potentially usable fuel than it consumes. In addition            to generating electricity, the design would provide process heat that            could be used in industrial activities including hydrogen production            and desalinization. Electricity generation targets have not yet been            set. Deployment is targeted for 2020, earlier than all but one Generation            IV design. This reflects earlier experience with parallel designs. Electricity            generation would involve a heat exchanger rather than direct processing            through a turbine. A VHTR is discussed at  http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/designs/mhtgr/mhtgr.html .              Each GIF project involves            new or untested concepts in reactor design. It would be surprising if            every design concept met the program's initial targets. The research            involved in the program has the potential to contribute to the understanding            of alternative types of commercial nuclear power and process heat even            if individual projects do not meet expectations .                     6. Outlook                      Efficiency            Issues             A primary source of doubt            regarding the potential of nuclear power, at least in the U.S., has            been whether the recent technology has been too expensive to compete            in the commercial marketplace. There have been relatively few orders            for new nuclear power plants during the last two decades, not just in            the United States and Canada, but also in Western Europe (outside of            France). Interest in new nuclear power units has recently focused on            Asia and to a lesser extent in Eastern Europe. Reactor vendors have            not ignored the message that their product has recently involved high            construction costs and long construction periods. Vendors are attempting            to position their product with promises of lower prices, shorter construction            times, and specified financial arrangements. Most competitors are now            offering fixed and historically low prices for their designs, though            such prices are often confined to those parts of construction that the            vendors actually control, the ""nuclear island"" that they designed.           Concerns regarding construction            costs for new nuclear power plants contrast sharply with the comparatively            low cost of operating commercial reactor designs. Overall operating            costs for nuclear power plants, as reported by the Federal Energy Regulatory            Commission (FERC), have been roughly the same as and more recently slightly            less than operating costs for coal-fired plants for about two decades.            Such operating costs are considerably below the costs of operating a            gas-fired generation unit. Moreover, the fuel cost component of operating            a nuclear power plant is particularly low. This operating cost advantage            has given existing nuclear power units a favored position in the provision            of base load electric power. Nuclear plant designers hope to take advantage            of such low operating costs in positioning their new designs. Estimates            of the capital and operating cost of new power generation units can            be found on Figure 70 and Table 8 of the  Annual            Energy Outlook .           The following publications            summarize efforts and procedures to make new nuclear power plants commercially            attractive.                                   ""Strategies for competitive nuclear power plants (TECDOC-1123)""              International Atomic Energy Agency  (November 1999), website:               http://www.iaea.org/worldatom            .             ""A Roadmap to Deploy New Nuclear Power Plants in the United              States by 2010,"" United States Department of Energy Office of              Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology and its Nuclear Energy Research              Advisory Committee Subcommittee on Generation IV Technology Planning              (October 31,  2001), website:  http://www.nuclear.gov/                          Scully Capital, ""Final Draft, Business Case for Nuclear              Power Plants, Bringing Public and Private Resources Together for Nuclear              Energy"" (July 2002) (available through United States Department              of   Energy Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology,              website:  http://www.nuclear.gov/                         ""A Technology Roadmap for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems              (GIF-002-00)"" U.S. DOE Nuclear  Energy Research Advisory              Committee and Generation IV International Forum (December  2002),               website:  http://www.nuclear.gov/                                              Summary            and Potential           There are early signs that            the nature of the nuclear reactor market might be changing. Finland            is presently evaluating bids for a ""fifth nuclear reactor"".            Four bids were received from three vendors: General Electric (ABWR),            Framatome ANP (SWR-1000 and EPR), and Atomstroyexport (VVER-1000). This            is one of the few recent cases of truly competitive international bidding            for new reactor construction. There is no guarantee that the reactor            will actually be built until an order is issued and contracts are signed.           More recently Bulgaria has            discussed building a new nuclear reactor at Belene. Belene was originally            to be a Russian-designed VVER-1000 unit using equipment already owned            by and located in Bulgaria. More recently, competitive submissions from            several vendors for alternative, newer designs have been considered.            It is unclear if the original design plan for Belene will move forward            or if new designs will be slated.           The United States is funding            a program called Nuclear Power 2010 that seeks to build at least two            nuclear power reactors by 2010. Supporting this has been proposed Federal            energy legislation. Meeting the 2010 target would be a challenging task            and the proposed legislation is still being debated .             1 A            large number of reactor designs have been excluded from the discussion.            These include reactors promoted overseas by nations such as Russia,            India, Argentina, Korea, Canada, and China, as well as numerous smaller            or even portable reactors that are being examined worldwide, including            in the United States. Also excluded is the International Atomic Energy            Agency's International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel            Programs (INPRO) that covers territory similar to the GIF program in            addition to other promising designs. GIF designs have been more heavily            promoted within the United States.              2 The            one that is not operational, Brown's Ferry 1, has been shut down since            1985, but has not given up its operating license. The plant's owner-operator,            the Tennessee Valley Authority, intends to restart the reactor in 2007.             3 The            terms ""cooled"" and ""moderated"" are important because            they define reactor categories. Cooling in a reactor refers to the process            and medium by which heat is transferred from the reactor core to the            steam supply cycle of the nuclear power plant. ""Moderating""            is a concept unique to nuclear power. A moderator controls the rate            of the nuclear power reaction and thus the amount of heat that is generated.            In a light water reactor ordinary water serves both functions. Light            water contains the same isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen as naturally            occurring water. Heavy water contains a different, heavier isotope of            hydrogen known as deuterium. Beyond the point that these conditions            define reactor types, this will not matter in the discussion of existing            reactors. It does matter for the group that will be discussed under            ""Generation 4"" reactors.             4 Exceptions            include Canada, the United Kingdom, India, and part of Russia's industry.             5             Prior to 1969, some smaller commercial reactors were placed in service.            All have been retired.             6             This is based on Utility Data Institute/Resource Data Internationl Compilations            of FERC Form 1 data.                 7 The            discussion here does not directly address ""enrichment"" the            process by which the U-235 content of nuclear fuel is increased .             8 This            latter statement is based on ""A Technology Roadmap for Generation            IV Nuclear Energy Systems"".             9 Canada            has an interesting and unique nuclear power history which is covered            by the book, Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, Canada Enters the            Nuclear Age.             10 Inspectors            of nuclear power plants have a preference for plants such as the LWRs            that are refueled in batches rather than the continuous fueling of PHWRs.            Batch refueling is more easily monitored and occurs at intervals of            one to two years.             11              Not the ACRs.             12             Most designs of PHWRs also use natural uranium fuels. However, variations            in fuel type are possible at any PHWR with plutonium and thorium fuel            content subject to particular interest and experimentation.             13             This sentence is a good example of the acronyms that overwhelm the nuclear            steam supply system (NSSS) industry. Several of these acronyms no longer            have any meaning in ""words"" while others have only limited            actual meaning. They are defined below when possible.             14             The term ESBWR has sometimes been identified with ""European Simplified            Boiling Water Reactor"". GE publicly denies that the initials have            any meaning.             15             ACR is usually read to mean ""Advanced CANDU Reactor"".

The structure of the bedding remains in some slate deposits as visible bands running across the cleavage. Known as ribbons, these bands may be either weaker or harder than the surrounding slate. Slate's durability as roofing is due to its high strength, low porosity and low absorption rate. Specific mineral components are responsible for the various colors: carbon (black), hematite (red and purple), chlorite and ferrous iron oxide (green). Other minerals, considered impurities (calcite and iron sulfides), are slowly transformed by weathering into gypsum, which expands and causes the slate to delaminate.  Quarrying Until the 1870s the quarrying of slate changed little from what is illustrated by Diderot in the Pictorial Encyclopedia of Science Art and Technology of 1762. Blocks were separated from the floor of the quarry using picks, wedges, prybars and gunpowder, taking maximum advantage of the natural seams in the rock. Windlasses and simple cranes employed man or horse power to lift blocks of slate from the pit. With the Industrial Revolution came mechanical drills and steam-powered stone channeling machines and hoists. Waste associated with blasting was reduced and efficiency increased. Subsequent advances were marked by the introduction of the wire saw in 1926 and the diamond belt saw in 1988.  Slate has been used as a roofing material in Europe for hundreds of years, with surviving examples dating to the 8th century. From the 17th to the 19th centuries, most of the roofing slate used in America was imported from North Wales, where slate quarrying was a major industry. Although the first commercial slate quarry in the United States was opened in 1785 in Peach Bottom, Pennsylvania, the industry was limited and local until the second half of the 19th century. At that time the industry grew and matured in response to a growing population, advancements in quarrying technology, an expanding rail system, and the immigration of Welsh slate workers to America. The United States became a slate exporter after the Civil War, as quarries opened in Vermont, New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. Architectural styles of this period emphasized prominent roof lines and decorative patterns, details that were well suited to the varied  Front elevation of a dwelling published in Supplement to Bicknell's Village Builder. A specification for one of the designs included this direction for the French roof: ""Slate the sides of the roof with slate 5 x 12 inches, cornered as shown on elevation, nailed with galvanized nails; all hips and valleys to be flashed with tin in the best manner.""

Properties such as nonflammability, durability, minimal maintenance costs, and aesthetic value made slate all the more desirable. Its primary drawback was its weight, making shipping costly and requiring substantial roof framing. The Vendor Slate Co. had ten quarries in Pennsylvania, Vermont and New York in 1929. (Sweet's Architectural Catalogue, 1929. Courtesy of The Sweet's Group, The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.) [click image for larger view]  Between 1897 and 1914 production peaked. Later use of slate often employed different thicknesses and colors, and unevenly cut or aligned butts to produce picturesque effects suitable for English revival styles popular in the early 20th century. After 1915 widespread use of slate roofing declined in the United States, due in part to a lack of skilled labor, but more importantly, due to the development of modern, mass produced materials such as asphalt shingles, which seemed the more economical alternative. A slate is typically attached to wooden sheathing with two nails driven through prepunched holes, though as with tile, it may be wired or screwed to steel angles on a steel framed roof. At the end of the19th century asphalt saturated felt laid over the wood sheathing became a standard part of most slate roof installations. Slate is installed with an overlap that depends on the slope of the roof and requires a minimum pitch (generally 4 inches of rise per 12 inches of run) to effectively shed water. Particularly in coastal areas slate can be found laid in mortar, providing extra protection against wind driven rain.  ""Not all that glitters is gold. Not all that looks like slate is good slate."" claims the Bangor Slate Co. of Easton, Pennsylvania. They issued this certificate in 1906 emphasizing the source of slate as an indication of quality.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This              report gives a brief overview of the U.S. textile industry, with an              emphasis on efforts to incorporate pollution prevention and clean              technologies into its manufacturing operations. This report is not              intended to be a comprehensive industry guide or study. Rather, it              can be used as guidance material for those seeking general              information about the industry and its use of technologies and              processes that reduce or prevent pollution. The textile              industry has a long history in the United States, dating back to the              onset of the Industrial Revolution. Despite competition from textile              producers in South America and Asia, which have lower costs and              lower wages, textile remains one of the largest, most diverse, and              most dynamic segments of the U.S. manufacturing sector. In 1992 the              industry produced a record US$70 billion in shipments and employed              an estimated 630,000 people. The industry maintains its strength by              focusing on production of high-quality, high-value luxury items;              launching campaigns to encourage consumers to buy products made in              the United States; modernizing mills with state-of-the-art              manufacturing technology, and adopting  "" just in time ""  manufacturing strategies that permit              the industry to respond quickly to changing consumer              demands. For many years, the textile industry has realized              the benefit of incorporating clean technologies into its              manufacturing operations, and several industry leaders have formed              alliances to further these goals. The term  "" clean technologies ""  is defined as               "" manufacturing processes or product technologies that reduce              pollution or waste, energy use, or material use in comparison to the              technologies that they replace. ""                 Key resources used by the industry include the              following: Water.  Textile manufacturing is one of the              largest industrial users of process water in the United States.              Approximately 20 gallons (160 pounds) of water are needed to produce              one pound of textile product. Water is used extensively throughout              textile-processing operations, and consumption varies widely among              the unit processes. Fiber Resources.  Fibers used              include both natural and man-made fibers. Cotton is the most              important natural fiber used to make textiles in the United States,              followed by wool. In recent years, man-made fibers such as nylon,              polyester, and acetate have replaced cotton as the primary raw              material used in textile production, accounting for 68 percent of              total fiber consumption in 1989. Both natural and man-made              fibers contain impurities such as metals, lubricants, and other              residues that contribute to pollution in mill effluent.  Key              environmental issues for the U.S. industry include the              following: Water.  Primary pollutants of concern are              biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD),              color, metals, and electrolytes (salt). About half of the mills in              the United States discharge effluent that exhibits some degree of              aquatic toxicity, which is a major concern for the industry.              Reduction of water use is also an important goal. Air.               The textile industry is a relatively minor source of hazardous              air pollutants (HAPs) compared with other manufacturing industries,              but air emissions have been identified as the second greatest              pollution problem (after aqueous effluent). Because many different              commodity and specialty chemicals are used to manufacture textiles,              characterization and management of air emissions for textile mills              is a challenging responsibility. Emissions of concern include              volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from coating, drying, and curing              operations; particulates, nitrous oxides, and sulfur dioxide from              boiler operation; and emissions from bulk storage tanks for              commodity and specialty chemicals, spills, solvent-based cleaning,              wastewater treatment plant operation, and warehouses used to store              finished fabric. Solid Waste.  Solid waste is the              largest waste stream produced (by volume) following aqueous              effluent. Wastes generated include fiber wastes (reworkable and              nonreworkable), packaging wastes, selvage, trimmings, and sludge              from wastewater treatment. Chemical Releases.  Chemical              releases from the textile industry are not well quantified, and data              on releases, particularly air emissions, are not readily available.              Most estimates are based on mass-balance calculations rather than              direct measurement. The industry is coming together to develop ways              to identify and quantify releases. Currently, there is no              specific regulatory mandate driving clean technology implementation.              Existing regulations for effluent and air emissions, however, are              becoming increasingly stringent and more rigorously enforced, which              is prompting the industry to develop alternative methods for the              management of process wastes. Clean technologies discussed in              this report that are generally being adopted by the industry include              the following:                                 Pad-batch dyeing.  A  "" cold-dyeing ""  method that uses padders                to press dyes into fabric, followed by storage of the fabric to                allow dye to react.                  Low-bath-ratio dyeing.  Use of a lower than                standard weight of water per weight of goods for batch                dyeing.                  Low salt/high fixation dyeing.  Use of dyes                that have a higher degree of fixation on the fabric and that                require less salt for fixing                  Dyebath reuse.  Replenishment and reuse of                dyebath fluid to extend life of bath up to 25 times.                  Continuous dyeing for knits.

Use of                membrane filtration or another process to capture, recover, and                reuse synthetic size chemicals.                  Countercurrent washing.  A multistage                washing strategy that saves water consumption by introducing fresh                water only at the final wash stage and by recirculating this water                successively through each of the previous wash stages.                  Low add-on finishing.  Use of special                equipment to apply a low volume of finish chemicals to                fabric.                  Mechanical finishing.  Use of mechanical                rather than chemical methods to perform finishing functions such                as shaping, shrinkage reduction, and softening.                  Waste reclamation systems for spinning.                 Use of special equipment to capture and reuse spinning wastes,                which otherwise would be discarded.                 Emerging technologies that have been demonstrated on              a pilot scale and may have full-scale implementation in the future              include the following:                                 Direct dyebath monitoring and control systems.                 Control strategy that adjusts the dyeing process in real time                to account and correct for uncontrollable parameters.                  Real-time adaptive control systems.                 Control strategy to adjust dyeing or other processing steps in                real time to account and correct for uncontrollable                parameters.                  Ink-jet printing.  Droplets of dye solution                are directed onto fabric to form a pattern, eliminating                photographic screen making and color mix kitchen                activities.                  Supercritical fluid dyeing.  Uses carbon                dioxide (CO 2 ) as the fluid medium on disperse-dyed                synthetics, eliminating aqueous effluent.                  Ultrasound dyeing.  Uses ultrasound waves                to impart dyes to fabric, eliminating aqueous effluent.                  Radio frequency drying.  Uses radio waves                rather than ovens to dry yarn or fabric.                 Both industry and government recognize that the              potential cost savings that can be realized through implementation              of clean technology is significant. Current annual resource              utilization by the industry includes:                                 133 billion gallons of water consumed, of which                53 billion gallons are treated at a cost of US$146 million                  237 million pounds of knit fabric wasted, at a                loss of US$474 million to the industry                  30 percent of reactive dyes discharged in                wastewater, with a lost value of US$66 million                  742 million pounds of salt consumed.                              Implementation of pollution prevention and clean              technology will thus allow the industry to synthesize its goals of              product quality, cost savings, increased profitability, and              environmental stewardship.

INDUSTRY              BACKGROUND 2.1              Description and History The textile industry              has a long history in the United States, dating back to the onset of              the Industrial Revolution in the 1790s. Despite strong competition              from lower-wage, nondomestic textile producers, the industry remains              one of the largest, most diverse, and most dynamic segments of the              U.S. manufacturing sector. The industry has maintained a competitive              position by specializing in high-value luxury items, launching              successful campaigns to encourage consumers to buy domestically made              products, modernizing old mills with the newest technology, and              adopting quick-response and  "" just in time ""  manufacturing strategies that permit              the industry to respond rapidly to changing demands, particularly in              the apparel and home furnishings markets.               2.2 Industry Demographics There are              more than 6,000 textile establishments in the United States. The              industry consists of a diverse, fragmented group of facilities that              range from small, family-owned and -operated facilities that              typically use older, traditional manufacturing techniques to huge              integrated mills that operate the most up-to-date machinery and              production equipment.  Economies of scale in textile              manufacturing are significant and limit entry of new mills into the              market. The cost of building a new, state-of-the-art fiber plant is              estimated at approximately US$100 million. Compared to the global              industry, the United States has built few entirely new textile mills              during the past two decades. Instead, state-of-the-art equipment is              installed as part of planned capital expansions and              retrofits. In 1992 the textile industry produced a record              US$70 billion in shipments, and employment was about 630,000.              Annually, the industry spends 4% B 6% of sales on capital expansion and              modernization and reportedly spends about US$25 million per year on              pollution and safety controls for its mills. Textile              establishments prepare and transform fibers into yarn, thread, or              webbing, convert the yarn into fabric or related products, and dye              and finish these materials at various stages of production. Many              textile facilities also produce final products for consumption              (e.g., thread, yarn, bolt fabric, towels, and sheets), whereas the              rest produce transitional products for use by other textile              establishments and by establishments classified in the apparel or              other industries. The facilities fall into the following major              categories, in order of most numerous to least numerous:                                 Knitting mills                  Miscellaneous textile products                  Broadloom mills (for cotton, wool, and man-made                fibers, including silk)                  Textile finishing (including dyeing)                  Yarn and thread mills                  Carpet and rug mills                  Narrow fabric mills                 Because of the complexity and economics of              converting raw fiber material into finished apparel and nonapparel              textile products, most textile mills specialize. One notable              exception are mills that combine spinning and weaving operations;              there are about 300 such mills in the United States. Still, these              mills do not normally conduct their own finishing operations. Nearly              700 textile finishing and dyeing mills perform these              steps. In the United States, it is uncommon for apparel              customers to purchase a  "" package ""  of finished goods from a single              supplier or source. Rather, the customer may buy fabric from one              source, order trim from a second source, and contract with a third              source to have garments cut and sewn. U.S. customers find it most              cost-effective to do business in this manner, which is reflected in              the historically fragmented nature of the textile              industry. The industry is geographically concentrated in the              south and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States because these              areas were originally the primary cotton-growing regions of the              country. A considerable amount of fabric finishing and dyeing takes              place in the northeastern United States.  Production of              man-made fibers is highly concentrated among a small number of              chemical companies. The U.S. man-made fiber industry consists of              more than 100 companies operating about 150 plants, but only a              handful are major producers. The top six companies C DuPont, Hoescht Celanese,              BASF, Allied-Signal, Monsanto, and Amoco C account for 80% of the production of              man-made fibers in the United States. Approximately 60% of producers              specialize in olefin fiber production, and the remaining market              segments are controlled by a small number of firms. For instance,              three firms account for all U.S. production of acrylic, modacrylic,              and rayon, whereas two firms account for all U.S. production of              acetate fiber and spandex. Table 1  provides a brief              listing of some of the major companies and organizations associated              with the U.S. industry. This list is not intended to be exhaustive              but rather provides a short overview of industry players, which              include textile mills, man-made fiber manufacturers, equipment and              chemical suppliers, dyestuff manufacturers, process design and              consulting engineers, professional trade associations, and research              institutions.

In the United              States, approximately 20 gallons (160 pounds) of water are used to              make one pound of textile product. Water is used extensively              throughout textile processing operations, and consumption varies              widely among the unit processes. Water use can also vary widely              among similar operations, depending on the type of equipment used.              Dyeing and fabric preparation are among the most water-intensive              processes in textile production. Reducing water consumption use is a              foremost goal of the U.S. industry. Fiber              Resources Fiber resources used by the industry              include natural fibers (e.g., cotton, wool, and linen) and man-made              fibers (e.g., nylon, acetate, and rayon). Cotton is the most              important natural fiber used to make textiles in the United States,              followed by wool. Cotton is relatively easy to produce domestically              and is suitable for a wide variety of finished products, including              apparel and home furnishings. In recent years, man-made              fibers have replaced cotton as the primary raw material used in              textile production. In 1989 man-made fiber accounted for 68% (8.8              billion pounds) of the total mill fiber consumption of 12.9 billion              pounds. Man-made fibers include purely synthetic materials derived              from petrochemicals (e.g., nylon and polyester) and regenerative              cellulosic materials manufactured from wood fibers (e.g., rayon and              acetate). Both natural and man-made fibers contain impurities              that contribute to pollution in mill effluent. Impurities found in              natural fibers include agricultural residues, natural waxes and              oils, pesticides, and metals. Some of these impurities are inherent              in the raw material, whereas others are a result of harvesting and              processing. Many of the impurities present in man-made fibers, such              as metals and hydrocarbons, are applied intentionally as part of              spin finishes to improve the physical properties and workability of              the fibers. These finishes are typically removed before final              processing and thus contribute to pollution in the              effluent.                 2.4 Waste Streams of              Concern Textile manufacturing produces              aqueous, air, and solid waste streams that must be managed,              recovered, treated, and/or disposed of.  Table 2  presents a              list of the aqueous and air waste streams produced and their              associated contaminants of concern for several textile processes.               Table 3  provides a listing of solid wastes generated during              textile processing. Aqueous effluent from textile mills has              been identified as the primary pollution problem for the industry.              Effluent includes aqueous discharges from fiber preparation, fabric              preparation, dyeing, finishing, and other operations. Because of the              large volume of water used in manufacturing C about 20 gallons (160 pounds) used per              pound of product made C most mills operate their own wastewater treatment or              pretreatment plants to remove biochemical oxygen demand (BOD),              chemical oxygen demand (COD), and other contaminants from effluent              prior to discharge to receiving waters or a publicly owned treatment              works (POTW). Of particular concern are  dyes,  which are often              sources of metals, salt, and color in effluent;  sizes,  which              have high BOD and COD levels; and  surfactants,  which are              strongly linked to aquatic toxicity. Although the textile              industry is a relatively minor source of HAPs compared with other              manufacturing industries, air emissions have been identified as the              second greatest pollution problem (after aqueous effluent) for the              industry. Because many different types of commodity and specialty              chemicals are used to manufacture textiles, characterization and              management of air emissions for textile mills is a challenging              responsibility. Emissions comprise both point sources              and fugitive emissions. Point sources include high-temperature              coating, drying, and curing ovens, which emit volatile organic              compounds (VOCs); boilers, which are a source of particulates,              nitrous oxides, and sulfur dioxide; and bulk storage tanks for              commodity and specialty chemicals. Fugitive air emissions result              from spills, solvent-based cleaning, wastewater treatment plant              operation, and warehouses used to store finished fabric. Solid waste is the largest waste stream produced (by              volume) following aqueous effluent. The quantity of solid waste              generated depends on the size and type of textile operation, the              nature of the waste, and the efficiency of the machinery used. Not              surprisingly, solid waste generation varies widely among mills.              According to a 1994 survey conducted by the American Textile              Manufacturers Institute (ATMI), total monthly solid waste generation              for the 290 facilities surveyed was more than 51,000 tons per month.               Table 3  shows a list of common solid wastes produced during              textile manufacturing.

The industry shows a trend toward increased              recycling of solid waste. The 1994 survey showed that 65% of solid              waste produced by textile mills was recycled rather than landfilled,              compared with 23% in 1989. Although the industry is making concerted              efforts to recycle and reduce fiber and packaging wastes in              particular, solid wastes are of relatively less concern in the              United States compared to aqueous effluent and air              emissions. Chemical Releases Many              different types of commodity and specialty chemicals are used during              textile production, which makes sampling, analysis, treatment, and              prevention of chemical releases C particularly air emissions C  complex. Although there is              much speculation about the types and quantities of chemicals              released to the environment during textile manufacturing, there are              few data about actual releases and these data are not readily              available. Most published data for air emissions are based on              mass-balance calculations rather than direct measurements. Efforts              are under way to establish reliable emission factors for textile              mills, but no reliable set of factors is currently              available.               3. ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AND              REGULATIONS The textile industry              is subject to U.S. environmental regulations for effluent, air              emissions, and solid wastes.`Effluent guidelines have been in place              for the textile industry since 1974. These guidelines fall under the              purview of the Clean Water Act (CWA), which is intended to restore              and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the              nation's surface waters. Under the CWA, the National Pollutant              Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program controls direct              discharges of effluent into navigable waters. Permits are issued              either by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or a state              environmental agency and require regular and periodic              characterization, measurement, and monitoring of effluent and its              contents. Many mills in the United States hold NPDES permits because              they discharge large volumes of effluent to streams and rivers.              Parameters often regulated by NPDES permits in the textile industry              include BOD, COD, total suspended solids (TSS), temperature, and              aquatic toxicity.               The industry is also subject to specific provisions              of the Clean Air Act (CAA), which is designed to protect and enhance              the nation's air resources to protect public health and welfare. The              CAA establishes limits for air pollutants such as carbon monoxide,              nitrous oxides, sulfur oxides, and particulate matter. A few              mills may also generate waste streams that are subject to              regulations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA),              which outlines requirements for the identification, treatment,              storage, and disposal of hazardous wastes. Most textile operations              produce little or no hazardous waste as part of their routine              operations, but about 10% B 20% of mills are classified as hazardous              waste generators because of the volume of solvents they produce by              dry-cleaning fabrics and by maintaining and cleaning manufacturing              equipment. Chemicals of Concern The              textile industry is chemical intensive; wastewater from textile              processing contains bath residues from preparation, dyeing,              finishing, application of sizing  (a process sometimes called               slashing ) and other operations. Reduction of chemical usage,              and substitution of less harmful chemicals for traditional ones, is              a primary goal of the industry. The following describes some of the              more commonly used chemicals and the environmental impacts of each              of them. Sizing Sizes are applied to              fibers in a process sometimes to improve the strength and bending              behavior of fibers during fabric weaving. Size serves no long-term              purpose for the fabric, which is treated (or  "" desized "" ) after weaving to remove              sizing chemicals. The three main classes of sizes are  natural              sizes or starch,  derived from corn or potatoes, which accounts              for two-thirds of size chemicals by weight used in the United              States,  synthetic sizes  such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA),              which accounts for most of the remaining use of sizes, and               semisynthetic sizes ,  which blend starch with synthetic              products. The U.S. industry consumes an estimated 200 million              pounds per year of size chemicals, more than 90% of which is              disposed of in aqueous effluent. This makes size chemical disposal              one of the largest industrial waste streams in the United States.              Starch sizes contribute large amounts of BOD and COD to effluent              streams. BOD from starch sizes is sometimes as high as 600,000 parts              per million (ppm). Synthetic sizes, which are not as biodegradable              as starches, can pass through conventional wastewater treatment              systems and are often linked to aquatic toxicity in receiving              waters. Dyeing Most dyes used in the              United States are synthetic and are manufactured from coal-tar and              petroleum-based intermediaries. Dyeing operations are of primary              environmental concern for the U.S. industry because:                                 Dyeing is a water-intensive process.                  Large amounts of salt are often needed to improve                dye fixation on the textile material.                  Many dyes contain heavy metals (e.g., chromium                and copper) as either a dye component or as a contaminant.                  Unfixed dye releases high doses of color to mill                effluent, as well as salt and metals.                 Color in effluent from textile dyeing and printing              is being increasingly regulated and is widely recognized as a              compliance problem within the industry. Effluent from most dyeing              operations has a dark reddish-brown hue that is readily apparent to              the naked eye when discharged to receiving waters. Extremely high              doses of color, which are rare, can interrupt photosynthesis and              lower the dissolved oxygen content of receiving waters, which may              lead to algae blooms and fish kills. Color, however, is primarily an              aesthetic pollutant   that is easily targeted as a              nuisance problem for textile effluent, whereas salt and metals in              dye house effluent are sometimes linked to aquatic              toxicity. Surfactants Surfactants and              related compounds, such as detergents, emulsifiers, and dispersants,              are used in the formulation of chemicals used for almost every              textile process. Of all the chemical specialties used in the              industry, surfactants are the primary contributors to aquatic              toxicity in effluent. To a lesser extent, they also contribute to              the effluent BOD load. The degree of treatability by conventional              wastewater treatment varies among surfactants. Those that are              relatively more treatable tend to have high BOD levels, whereas              less-treatable surfactants are the ones that pass through and are              linked to aquatic toxicity. Foaming can also result when surfactants              that pass through the treatment system are released to receiving              waters. Coatings and Finishes Several              types of chemical specialties are applied to textiles as coatings              and finishes during spinning, weaving, finishing, and/or knitting.              These chemicals contribute various types of organic and inorganic              pollutants to water and air during normal application and subsequent              washing or removal steps. Many coatings and finishes used to make               "" performance              fabrics ""C those              that are waterproof, water resistant, soil repellant, flame              retardant, wrinkle resistant, and the like C are of particular concern because their              ingredients are typically guarded as trade secrets, which makes              characterization of emissions and pollutants from these processes              difficult.               4. CLEAN TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENTS This section provides a brief description of clean              technologies and pollution prevention techniques used by the U.S.              textile industry. These technologies vary in their acceptance and              adoption by industry, which will also be discussed.  "" Clean              technologies ""               are defined as  "" manufacturing processes or product technologies that reduce              pollution or waste, energy use, or material use in comparison to the              technologies that they replace. ""   The              technologies described in this section are:                                 Pad-batch dyeing                  Low bath ratio dyeing                  Low salt/high fixation dyeing                  Dyebath reuse                  Continuous dyeing for knits                  Automated color mix kitchen                  Automated chemical dosing                  Transfer printing                  Laser engraving of printing screens                  Surfactant substitution                  Recovery of synthetic sizes                  Countercurrent washing                  Low add-on finishing                  Mechanical finishing                  Waste reclamation systems for spinning                                Technology Adoption and              Implementation It is important to note that              relatively few large, new textile mills have been built in the              United States in the past two decades. Instead, mills have been              updated via expansions and retrofits. As for other U.S. industries,              textile mills must constantly balance their own quality requirements              and customer demands with consideration of the environmental impacts              of their operations.  Technologies and processes that can prevent              pollution while reducing costs and maintaining or even improving              product quality are the ones most likely to be adopted by the              industry.  These issues and tradeoffs are discussed in the              context of each technology, where applicable.               4.1 Pad-Batch Dyeing Description.               This  "" cold              dyeing ""  method              is most appropriate for cellulosic fabrics (e.g., cotton and              cotton/polyester blends). Fabric is saturated with dye paste and              passed through a padder that forces the dyestuff inside the fabric,              while simultaneously absorbing excess dye solution. The fabric is              then stored or  "" batched ""               on rolls or in boxes for several hours, during which the dyestuff              reacts with the fibers and penetrates the fabric, resulting in even,              consistent color. This method requires fiber-reactive dyes that are              highly reactive at normal ambient temperatures and works best when              ambient temperatures are relatively steady or can be              controlled. Benefits.  Pad-batch dyeing offers several              benefits over traditional batch dyeing:                                 No salt or chemical specialty agents are needed                in the dye.                  More efficient use of dye leaves less color in                dye house effluent.                  Water and energy consumption is low or                nonexistent.                  Energy consumption is reduced by up to 70                percent.                  Use of dyestuffs are reduced.                  Dye quality is more consistent, although                sensitive to ambient temperature fluctuations.                  Process is applicable to both woven and knit                fabrics.                  Equipment is simple, flexible, and                inexpensive.                 Status of Use in the United States.  Dye              houses employ this technique when it is suitable for the fabrics              they are dyeing. The low cost of adopting this technology makes it              attractive to both small and large dye houses.  4.2 Low Bath Ratio Dyeing Description.  This batch dyeing process uses a              lower than standard weight of water per unit weight of fabric or              fiber dyed. Several new types of jet and package dyeing machines              offer low bath ratio dyeing (in the range of 3:1 to 5:1 for weight              of dye liquid per weight of material dyed, compared with a typical              value of 12:1). Ultra low liquor ratio (ULLR) machines offer the              lowest bath ratios. Benefits.  Low bath ratio dyeing              conserves water, energy, dyestuffs, and auxiliary dye components              such as salt. Dyes used in these machines must have a high degree of              solubility, good leveling, good washing off, and very good               "" right the              first time ""  dye              performance. Status of Use in the United States.               Reduced bath ratio dyeing has become increasingly popular among              mills that actively practice pollution prevention and energy              conservation. Low bath ratio concepts, particularly ULLR, however,              cannot be retrofitted to existing equipment, nor is reduction of              water volume in dye baths sufficient to ensure high-quality dyeing.              Given the long life of dyeing equipment, the high capital cost of              installing new low bath ratio machines generally discourages              replacement of existing equipment. 4.3 Low Salt/High Fixation              Dyeing Description.  Almost all of the              large dye manufacturers offer at least a small range of products              that require less salt addition and have a higher degree of fixation              compared to their traditional dye lines. Benefits.  Use              of these dyes reduces the quantity of salt and the amount of color              contained in dye house effluent and reduces color problems as well.              These dyes are best used with continuous rather than batch dyeing              processes. Status of Use in the United States.  Mills              select the dyes they use based on quality, customer requirements,              and cost-competitiveness. If low salt/high fixation dyes prove              cost-competitive and if apparel and home furnishings dyed with these              products prove popular, mills will move toward increased use of              these dyes. It is expected that these dyes will increase in              popularity as the industry attempts to minimize the impact of              textile dyeing. 4.4 Dyebath              Reuse Description.  In this process,              exhausted hot dye baths are analyzed for residual color content,              replenished as necessary, and reused to dye additional batches of              fabric. Dye baths can be reused from 5 to 25 times if the process is              properly controlled and if the dyes used are appropriate for the              fabric to be dyed. Generally speaking, acid, basic, direct, and              disperse dyes are most amenable to reuse, whereas vat, sulfur, and              fiber-reactive dye baths are least amenable. Benefits.               Dyebath reuse offers several advantages:                                 Reduced consumption (and subsequent discharge) of                dyestuffs and auxiliary chemicals                  Reduced water and energy consumption                  Reduced effluent volume.                 Status of Use in the United States.  If              quality standards for finished products are high, dyebath reuse is              not favored because there is a higher risk of shade variation due to              fabric impurities and bath impurities (e.g., surfactants and salt)              that build up over time. Reuse also requires advance scheduling,              which limits its use for small lots and  "" just in time ""  manufacturing. Dye houses, however, use              this technique when it is suitable for the quality requirements of              the fabrics they are dyeing and when it is              cost-effective. 4.5 Continuous              Dyeing for Knits Description.               Conventional continuous dyeing ranges have typically been limited to              nonknit fabrics because of their inherently high tension. Several              equipment manufacturers have recently begun offering              lower-than-standard tension or tensionless continuous dyeing              machines that do not pull or stretch fabric out of shape. Individual              equipment vary in design and capacity. Benefits.               Continuous processes have several advantages over batch              dyeing:                                 They use less process water.                  Dyes having high fixation are typically used,                which require less salt and leave less color in the spent dyebath                for discharge.                 Status of Use in the United States.               Continuous dyeing is gaining popularity in the United States with              both knit and nonknit fabrics. 4.6 Automated Color Mix              Kitchen Description.  Colors are mixed              and batched by computer-controlled machinery rather than by mill              workers. Machinery is also available for dye dispensing of powder or              liquid dyes in batch or continuous houses. Similar systems are              available to improve speed and accuracy in color matching while              mixing. In some cases, these systems connect directly to              intermediate bulk containers (IBCs) for              chemicals. Benefits.  Automated mix kitchens offer              several advantages:                                 Reduction of human error, spills, leaks, and                overuse of dyes                  Shorter runs for continuous dyeing are more                economical.                 Capital investments for automated equipment may be              substantial, but savings realized by reduced waste generation should              be figured into the payback period for investment. Status              of Use in the United States.  The United States is beginning to              invest in automated mix kitchens for use in sophisticated dyeing and              printing operations. 4.7              Automated Chemical Dosing Description.  Automated dosing systems meter              chemicals into the dye process according to a specific dosing              strategy that has been predetermined by the mill, based on product              and dye specifications. The dosing strategy is computer controlled              and can be adjusted continually to account for changes in product              standards, fabric quality, and the like. Benefits.               Automated dosing reduces human error, spills, leaks, and overuse of              chemicals. Capital investments for automated equipment may be              substantial, but savings realized from reduced chemical use, fewer              spills, and a higher percentage of  "" right the first time ""  dyeing should be figured              into the payback period for investment. Status of Use in              the United States.  Automated dosing systems are gaining              popularity in the United States, particularly during retrofits of              existing facilities. 4.8              Transfer Printing Description.  Dye is              printed onto a paper substrate, which is laid onto the fabric to be              printed. Temperature and pressure are applied to the paper              substrate, which transfers the dye to the fabric by sublimation.              Most transfer printing is done on polyester or high              polyester B content blends with disperse dyes and, less frequently,              solvent dyes. Benefits.  Transfer printing offers              several benefits:                                 Dyestuff consumption is lower.                  Energy requirements for printing are reduced.                                 Little to no printing effluent is                generated.                  No washing or after-treatment is required.                   Color changeovers are instantaneous.                  Equipment is inexpensive.                  Short runs are easy to manufacture.                  Printing of paper is more efficient.                              Status of Use in the United States.  Transfer              printing is the newest, fastest-growing printing method in the              United States. This method, however, has limitations:                                 Limited to volatile dyes                  Does not work on natural fibers                  Does not work on knits because dye penetration                into the fabric is limited.                 4.9 Laser Engraving of Printing Screens Description.  Laser engraving allows for direct              digital scanning or on-screen design of prints. This technique              avoids the use of photographic processes in screen making for              printing. Benefits.  Laser engraving offers several              benefits:               No toxic photographic residues, which typically              contain silver, are generated.                                 Screen quality is improved.                  Screen changes are simpler.                  Small lots are easier to manufacture.                              Status of Use in the United States.  Several              laser printing systems have been installed in the past several years              in the United States. 4.10              Surfactant Substitution Description.               Surfactants, which are used in formulating virtually all chemical              specialties used by the textile industry, are one of the primary              causes of aquatic toxicity, foaming, and, to a lesser extent, BOD in              mill effluent. Because of the many different types of surfactants              available, selecting the correct one for a particular function              requires good understanding of performance and pollution issues. The              wide variety of surfactants available facilitates selection of              less-polluting alternatives. For instance, cationic surfactants are              rarely used in the United States because they exhibit extremely high              aquatic toxicity, and alkylphenol (AP) has been replaced by linear              alcohol ethoxylate (LAE), which is more biodegradable and exhibits              lower toxicity. Benefits.  Despite the higher BOD              values of biodegradable surfactants, they are generally preferred              over those that pass through treatment because they exhibit a lower              degree of aquatic toxicity and are less likely to foam on discharge              to receiving waters. Status of Use in the United              States.  The industry is actively researching and substituting              less harmful surfactants, as well as other chemicals such as sizes,              in all areas of textile processing. Unfortunately, information about              surfactant performance and pollution issues is often unavailable to              the person selecting these products, which makes selection of               "" least-impact ""  surfactants difficult. 4.11 Recovery of Synthetic              Sizes Description.  Synthetic sizes,              such as PVA, can be used in place of starch for many textile              products. Unlike starch, which degrades during desizing, recovery              and reuse of synthetic sizes is technically feasible. Recovery of              PVA is usually accomplished by membrane              filtration. Benefits.  Recovery of synthetic size saves              on purchase costs and use and reduces BOD and COD in mill effluent.               Status of Use in the United States.  Some U.S. mills              have used and recovered synthetic sizes in their preparation and              finishing operations for more than 25 years. Size recovery, however,              is not widely practiced in the industry. PVA and other synthetic              sizes are generally not biodegradable by typical wastewater              treatment practices; unrecovered size chemicals may pass through              conventional treatment systems and can cause foaming and aquatic              toxicity in receiving waters. The cost for equipment needed for size              recovery is prohibitively high, as are shipping costs for              concentrate solutions. Also, most U.S. mills prefer to use starch              size because it is less costly than synthetic size and gives a              softer  "" hand ""  to              the fabrics treated. Although high-BOD starches are not recoverable,              they are treatable by conventional wastewater treatment. Industry              must weigh both the costs and benefits of using nonrecoverable,              high-BOD starch sizes and using recoverable synthetic              sizes. 4.12 Countercurrent              Washing Description.  This technique              is used in multistage washing operations, on the principle that              fresh, clean water need not be used for all washing steps,              particularly during the early wash stages when the fabric is               "" dirtiest. ""  In countercurrent washing, clean water is used only during              the final wash stage. This wash water is circulated for successive              reuse in each of the previous stages until reaching the first stage,              after which it is discharged for treatment. In this manner, the              cleanest water is used to wash fabric during the last stage when it              is  "" cleanest ""  and the most contaminated water is used for gross washing              operations during the first stage. An important variant of              the countercurrent principle is the  "" horizonal ""  or  "" inclined ""  washer. Fabric enters the bottom of the              machine and exits through the top. Wash water is introduced from the              top down, causing a water flow within the machinery that is              inherently countercurrent in nature. Countercurrent washing is              useful after continuous dyeing, printing, desizing, scouring, and              bleaching. Benefits.  Countercurrent washing can reduce              water usage by 50% B 80%, depending on the throughput and number of washing              stages. Status of Use in the United States.               Countercurrent washing is widely practiced in the textile industry.              Equipment and machinery are readily available, and existing              equipment can be retrofitted. 4.13 Low Add-On Finishing Description.  Several types of machines can apply a              low volume of finish solution to the fabric. Some popular methods              and machinery used for low add-on finishing include hydroextraction,              vacuum extraction, sprays, foams, and kiss              rolls. Benefits.  Low add-on finishing has several              benefits:                                 Reduced energy requirements                  Reduced chemical usage                  Prevention of leaching or transport of chemicals                from fiber interiors to fabric surface, thus improving fastness                and softness of finished goods.                 Status of Use in the United States.  Low              add-on methods are used by U.S. mills when the final product can              meet performance specifications, and when capital costs for new              equipment can be recovered within a reasonable time frame. Although              capital costs can be substantial, this equipment is usually              purchased by mills during upgrades and expansions. 4.14 Mechanical Finishing Description.  Mechanical methods can be used to              perform many of the same finishing functions as chemical methods,              including stabilization, shrinkage reduction, optical finishing, and              softening. Benefits.  The primary benefit of mechanical              finishing is elimination of the use of finishing chemicals, thereby              saving costs on chemical purchase, chemical disposal, and wastewater              treatment. Status of Use in the United States.  Energy              requirements for mechanical finishing are generally higher, which              must be considered when choosing between chemical and mechanical              methods. The costs and benefits of using mechanical compared with              chemical finishing need to be quantified to aid in decision making.              Often, performance specifications for the finished product dictate              the type of finishing required. 4.15 Waste Reclamation Systems for              Spinning Description.  Special equipment is used to remove,              separate, and collect impurities, trash, and tangled fiber masses              from cotton stock. In the past, this nonreworkable waste was              discarded during the spinning operation.  Benefits.               Reclamation systems allow for efficient capture and collection of              spinning wastes, which can be sold for use in padded mailing              envelopes, compressed into dense fuel pellets for boilers, or reused              in other applications. Status of Use in the United              States.  The industry is adopting these reclamation systems as              part of a concerted effort to reuse process wastes.               5. FUTURE              TRENDS There are several              apparent trends and research and development activities ongoing              within the textile industry in the areas of pollution prevention and              clean technology implementation. Regulatory Incentives Although there              are no industry-specific mandates driving clean technology              implementation for textiles, increased stringency and more rigorous              enforcement of existing regulations for effluent and air emissions              will prompt mills and finishers to adopt new processes and develop              alternative methods for managing process              wastes. Emerging Technologies Several              clean technologies and processes have proved effective on a pilot              scale but are not yet ready for full-scale implementation. These              include:                                 Direct dyebath monitoring and control                systems.  A control strategy that adjusts the dyeing process in                real time to account and correct for uncontrollable parameters.                                 Real-time adaptive control systems.                 Control strategy to adjust dyeing or other processing steps in                real time to account and correct for uncontrollable                parameters.                  Ink-jet printing.  Droplets of dye solution                are directed onto fabric to form a pattern, eliminating                photographic screen making and color mix kitchen                activities.                  Supercritical fluid dyeing.  Uses carbon                dioxide (CO 2 ) as the fluid medium on disperse-dyed                synthetics, eliminating aqueous effluent.                  Ultrasound dyeing.  Uses ultrasound waves                to impart dyes to fabric, eliminating aqueous effluent.                  Radio frequency drying.  Uses radio waves                rather than ovens to dry yarn or fabric.                 Full-scale implementation of these technologies is              at least 5 B 10              years away. Chemical Specialties and Dye              Composition In future years, information about the              composition and environmental effects of chemical specialties and              dyes will not be shared as readily by manufacturers, who are feeling              increasingly compelled to protect proprietary information to remain              competitive. This trend is becoming apparent despite the widespread              knowledge that mills need this information to make informed              decisions about the products they use. In particular, dyes are              expected to become much more proprietary, with an associated lack of              needed information available to the user. The color index (CI), a              dual classification system that groups dyes according to chemical              structure and application class, has historically been a standard              means of identification for textile dyes. Based on the CI, a dye              house could make inferences about the possible environmental effects              of dye use. Use of the CI system is waning, however, due to loss of              support from dye manufacturers The trend toward nondisclosure              will make evaluation of clean technology and pollution prevention              techniques for producing textiles even more challenging. Industry,              however, is working together to identify ways to overcome this              barrier. Solid Waste Reduction Mills              will continue to look at ways to reduce solid waste generation, to              use less packaging or packaging that is reusable (such as IBCs for              chemical storage), to reuse reworkable fiber, to find new markets              for nonreworkable and hard fiber waste, and to train and educate              workers to reduce selvage, cuttings, and trim waste. Reduction of              solid waste generation coupled with strategies to reuse or sell              wastes has widespread economic appeal due to cost savings and cost              recovery realized by these efforts. This is particularly true of the              carpet and rug industry, in which significant cost savings can be              realized by even incremental reductions in solid waste              generation.               Mechanical versus Chemical              Finishing Mills will increasingly consider using              mechanical methods for fabric finishing. Mechanical finishing can be              used to perform many of the same functions as chemical finishing,              including stabilization, shrinkage reduction, optical finishing, and              softening. The costs and benefits of using mechanical compared with              chemical finishing will be further quantified to aid in decision              making. Chemical Substitutions Mills              will continue to research the use of more-benign chemicals in all              areas of textile processing, including sizing, dyeing, and              finishing. Ancillary operations such as solvent-based dry cleaning              and maintenance and operation of machinery will also be targeted as              a focus area for chemical substitution. The large size and              fragmented nature of the U.S. textile industry creates special              challenges for implementation of clean technology. Yet, the              industry, buoyed by strong performance and cooperative alliances              intended to prevent pollution, recognizes that the potential cost              savings that can be realized by implementing clean technology is              significant. Current annual resource utilization by the industry              includes:                                 133 billion gallons of water consumed, of which                53 billion gallons are treated at a cost of US$146 million                  237 million pounds of knit fabric wasted, at a                loss of US$474 million to the industry                  30% of reactive dyes discharged in wastewater,                with a lost value of US$66 million                  742 million pounds of salt consumed.                              Implementation of pollution prevention and clean              technology will thus allow the industry to synthesize its goals of              product quality, cost savings, increased profitability, and              environmental stewardship.

Decommissioning         [  Prev  |  Next  |  Table of Contents  ]      7.1 Introduction      [  Prev  |  Next  |  Table of Contents  ]    Decommissioning is defined as the safe removal of a nuclear facility from service and the reduction of residual radioactivity to a level that permits release of the property for unrestricted use and termination of the license (10 CFR Part 50.82). Decommissioning must occur because a licensee is not permitted to abandon a facility after ceasing operation. Decommissioning activities do not include the removal of spent fuel, which is considered to be an operational activity; the storage of spent fuel, which is addressed in the Waste Confidence Rule (10 CFR Part 51.23); or the removal and disposal of nonradioactive structures and materials beyond that necessary to terminate the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) license. Disposal of the nonradioactive hazardous waste that is not necessary for NRC license termination is not considered part of the decommissioning process for which NRC is responsible.    The purpose of this chapter is to determine whether license renewal of nuclear power plants would change the impacts of decommissioning to such an extent that those impacts would need to be assessed and mitigative measures considered as part of the environmental review for license renewal. Current licenses allow nuclear power plants to operate for as long as 40 years. License renewal would extend the period of operation by as much as 20 years. This chapter addresses incremental impacts of decommissioning after a 20-year license renewal compared with operating for 40 years.    The following potential impacts are addressed: radiation exposures to workers and the public, socioeconomic effects, waste management impacts, air and water quality impacts, and ecological impacts. The principal impacts of decommissioning are expected to result from radiation exposures to workers and from disposal of radioactive materials. Decommissioning is expected to have only minor radiological impacts on the public (primarily as a result of transporting radioactive waste). Socioeconomic impacts of decommissioning would result from the demands on, and contributions to, the community by the workers employed to decommission a power plant. As shown in this chapter, the air quality, water quality, and ecological impacts of decommissioning are all expected to be substantially smaller than those of power plant construction or operation because the level of activity and the releases to the environment are all expected to be smaller during decommissioning than during construction and operation. The effect of license renewal on the costs of decommissioning are also examined because the costs of decommissioning continues to be a public concern; however, no category conclusion is reached because the impact of license renewal on decommissioning cost is not a consideration in the environmental review and the decision to renew a license.    The impacts resulting from decommissioning at 40 years (baseline) are taken from NUREG-0586, the two source documents NUREG/CR-0130 and NUREG/CR-0672, and updates to those source documents such as draft reports NUREG/CR-5884 and NUREG/CR-6174. The same methods used in those documents were used to project the impacts of decommissioning after 60 years of operation. Where the source documents did not address a potential impact, other available data and staff members' professional judgments were used to assess the potential for impacts to change as a result of extended operation. The analysis in this chapter is based on large ""reference"" pressurized-water reactor (PWR) and boiling-water reactor (BWR) nuclear power plants; consequently, the impacts of decommissioning all U.S. nuclear power plants that reach the end of their operating lives without a serious accident should be encompassed by those described here. The changes in impacts resulting from the extended operation and in the environment at the time of decommissioning were considered. [The discussion is built around a ""reference"" PWR identified by NUREG/CR-0130, the 1175-MW Trojan Nuclear Plant at Rainier, Oregon, and a ""reference"" BWR, the 1155-MW(e) Washington Public Power Supply System Nuclear Project 2, which was being built near Richland, Washington (NUREG/CR-0672).]      7.2 The Decommissioning Process      [  Prev  |  Next  |  Table of Contents  ]    This section describes the locations of radioactive materials in nuclear power plants, notes the three commonly discussed decommissioning methods, summarizes experience to date with decommissioning nuclear power plants, and provides information on the wastes generated during decommissioning. Except as noted, the information for this section is from NUREG-0586.    7.2.1 Nuclear Power Plants    Nuclear power plants in the United States use two types of nuclear reactors (Chapter 2); the most common type is the PWR. Most of the 118 licensed power reactors in the United States are PWRs. The other type is the BWR. The locations of radioactive components in these two types of power plants are described briefly to aid the reader's understanding of decommissioning.    7.2.1.1 Pressurized-Water Reactors    Buildings or structures associated with a typical large PWR ( Figure 7.1 ) include (1) the heavily reinforced concrete containment building, which houses the pressure vessel, the steam generators, and the pressurizer system; (2) the turbine building, which contains the turbines and the generator; (3) the cooling water system, which may include the cooling tower and other components; (4) the fuel building, which contains fresh and spent fuel, fuel handling facilities, the spent-fuel storage pool and its cooling system, and the solid radioactive waste system; (5) the auxiliary building, which contains the liquid radioactive waste treatment systems, the filter and ion exchanger vaults, the gaseous radioactive waste treatment system, and the ventilation systems for the containment, fuel, and auxiliary buildings; (6) the control building, which houses the reactor control room and personnel facilities; (7) water intake structures; (8) the administration building; and (9) other structures such as warehouses and nonradioactive shops.    The major radioactive components encountered in decommissioning are associated with the reactor itself--the primary coolant loop, the steam generators, the radioactive waste handling systems, and the concrete biological shield that surrounds the pressure vessel. The reactor core, pressure vessel, steam generators, and piping between the reactor and steam generators are highly radioactive. Because some primary-to-secondary leakage is     Figure 7.1 Typical pressurized-water reactor generating station layout.  Adapted from NUREG/CR-0130.    impossible to avoid, the secondary loop, including the turbines, is slightly contaminated. Because of leakage and blowdown, the cooling water is very slightly contaminated. Much equipment in the auxiliary building is contaminated, as is the spent-fuel storage pool and its associated equipment.    7.2.1.2 Boiling-Water Reactors    Buildings and structures associated with a typical large BWR ( Figure 7.2 ) include (1) the reactor building, which houses the reactor pressure vessel, the containment structure, the biological shield, the spent-fuel pool, and fuel handling equipment; (2) the turbine building, which houses the     Figure 7.2 Site layout on a typical boiling-water reactor power plant.  Adapted from NUREG-0672.    turbine and electric generator; (3) the radioactive waste and control building, which houses the solid, liquid, and gaseous radioactive waste treatment systems and the main control room; (4) the cooling system; (5) water intake structures and pump houses; (6) the service building, which houses the makeup water treatment system, machine shops, and offices; and (7) other minor structures.     The major sources of radiation in decommissioning a BWR are associated with the reactor itself, the containment structure, the concrete biological shield, the primary coolant loop, the turbines, and the radioactive waste handling systems. The reactor building, the turbine generator building, and the radioactive waste building are the only buildings containing radioactive materials. The reactor core and its pressure vessel are highly contaminated, as is the piping to the turbines. The turbines are also contaminated, but the cooling towers and associated piping are not. Much equipment in the radioactive waste building is contaminated, as is the spent-fuel pool in the reactor building.   7.2.2 Decommissioning Methods    In the NRC's original decommissioning studies (NUREG/CR-0130 for PWRs and NUREG/CR-0672 for BWRs), three alternatives were defined: DECON (decontamination/dismantlement as rapidly after reactor shutdown as possible to achieve termination of the nuclear license); SAFSTOR (a period of safe storage of the stabilized and defueled facility followed by final decontamination/dismantlement and license termination); and ENTOMB (immediate removal of the highly activated reactor vessel internals for disposal and relocation of the remainder of the radioactively contaminated materials to the reactor containment building, which is then sealed. With sufficient time, the radioactivity on the entombed materials will have decayed to levels that permit termination of the nuclear license). However, because current regulations require decommissioning to be complete within 60 years, ENTOMB may not be a viable option.    Changes in the industrial and regulatory situation in the United States since the late 1970s have forced revisions to the scenarios of the NRC's original decommissioning alternatives. The most recently revised decommissioning scenarios are described for PWRs in NUREG/CR-5884 and for BWRs in NUREG/CR-6174. There are two principal changes in the revised scenarios. One is the delay of major decommissioning actions for at least 5 to 7 years following reactor shutdown because of a Department of Energy (DOE) requirement to cool the spent fuel in the reactor pool to avoid cladding failures in dry storage. The other is the assumption that decommissioning will be complete within 60 years, as required by current regulations. This delay results in an increase in decommissioning costs during the short safe storage period while the spent fuel pool continues to operate. Changes in cumulative occupational radiation doses also result from the decommissioning scenario changes.    The basic concept of the three alternatives remains unchanged. However, because of the accumulated inventory of spent fuel in the reactor storage pool and the requirement for at least 5 years of storage for the spent fuel before transfer to DOE for disposal, the timing and steps in the process for each alternative have been adjusted to reflect present conditions and possibilities. For the DECON alternative, it is assumed that the owner has strong incentives to decontaminate and dismantle the retired reactor facility as promptly as possible [i.e., future availability and cost of low-level radioactive waste (LLW) disposal and the need to reuse or dispose of the site, necessitating transfer of the stored spent fuel from the pool to a dry storage facility on the reactor site]. Although continued storage of spent fuel in the pool would be acceptable, the modified Part 50 license could not be terminated until the pool was emptied. It is also assumed that an acceptable dry transfer system would be available to remove the spent fuel from the dry storage facility and place it into licensed transport casks when the time came for DOE to accept the spent fuel for disposal. Similar assumptions are made for the SAFSTOR and ENTOMB alternatives for convenience of analysis, even though extended use of the spent fuel pool might be more cost-effective for SAFSTOR.    7.2.2.1 DECON    DECON is the decommissioning method in which the equipment, structures, and portions of the facility and site containing radioactive contaminants are removed or decontaminated to a level that permits the property to be released for unrestricted use shortly after cessation of operations. It is the only decommissioning alternative that leads to termination of the facility license and release of the facility and site for unrestricted use shortly after cessation of facility operations. DECON activities are expected to require about 9 years for large light-water reactors; less time should be required for smaller facilities.    Because DECON operations are expected to be completed within a few years following shutdown, radiation exposures to workers generally are higher than for decommissioning methods that allow for radioactive decay by delaying or extending the work over a longer period. DECON also requires larger commitments of money and commercial waste disposal site space than do other decommissioning methods. The principal advantage of DECON is that the site is available for unrestricted use promptly.     Nonradioactive equipment and structures need not be dismantled or removed for termination of the NRC license and release for unrestricted use. Once the facility's radioactive structures are decontaminated to levels permitting unrestricted use of the facility, nonradioactive facilities may either be put to some other use or demolished at the owner's discretion. [NRC has issued proposed amendments to 10 CFR Part 20 containing radiological criteria for decommissioning of NRC-licensed nuclear facilities (FR 59, 43200, August 22, 1994). Currently, NRC uses, on a case-by-case basis, criteria and practices contained in Regulatory Guide 1.86 and in a letter to Stanford University from J. Miller, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, NRC, dated April 21, 1982.]    DECON, as defined by NUREG/CR-5884 and NUREG/CR-6174, comprises four distinct periods of effort: (1) preshutdown planning/engineering and regulatory reviews, (2) plant deactivation and preparation for storage (no dismantling activities are conducted during this period that would affect the safe operation of the spent fuel pool), (3) plant safe storage with concurrent operations in the spent-fuel pool until the pool inventory is zero, and (4) decontamination and dismantlement of the radioactive portions of the plant, leading to license termination. Because of the delays in development of the federal waste management system, it may be necessary to continue operation of a dry fuel storage facility on the reactor site after the reactor systems have been dismantled and the reactor nuclear license terminated. However, these latter storage costs are considered operations costs under 10 CFR 50.54(b)(b) and are not considered part of decommissioning.    7.2.2.2 SAFSTOR    SAFSTOR is the decommissioning method in which the nuclear facility is placed and maintained in a condition that allows the safe storage of radioactive components of the nuclear plant and subsequent decontamination to levels that permit release for unrestricted use. SAFSTOR was initially conceived of as having three successive stages: (1) a short period of preparation for safe storage (expected to be up to 2 years after final reactor shutdown); (2) a variable safe storage period of continuing care consisting of security, surveillance, and maintenance during which much of the reactor's radioactivity decays; and finally, (3) a relatively short period of decontamination (NUREG-0586). In NUREG/CR-5884 and NUREG/CR-6174, SAFSTOR is described as five distinct periods of effort, with the initial three periods identical to those of DECON. The fourth period is extended safe storage (50 years) with no fuel in the reactor storage pool, and the fifth period is decontamination and dismantlement of the radioactive portions of the plant.    The radioactive or contaminated material must be decontaminated or removed, packaged, and disposed of at a regulated disposal facility. After it has been determined that residual radioactivity is at acceptable levels, the license will be terminated and the facility can be released for unrestricted use. After termination of the NRC license, disassembly or demolition of nonradioactive facilities would be performed at the owner's discretion.    SAFSTOR may be used as a means of satisfying requirements for protection of the public while minimizing the initial commitments of time, money, radiation exposure, and waste disposal capacity. SAFSTOR may also have some advantage where there are other operational nuclear facilities at the same site or where a shortage of radioactive waste disposal capacity occurs. The disadvantages of SAFSTOR are that the site is unavailable for other uses for an extended time; maintenance, security, and surveillance are required until the final decontamination is complete; and few, if any, personnel familiar with the facility are available at the time of decontamination (up to 60 years after plant shutdown).    7.2.2.3 ENTOMB    ENTOMB is the alternative in which radioactive contaminants are encased in a long-lasting material, such as concrete. The entombed structure is maintained and surveillance is performed until the radioactivity decays to a level permitting release of the property for unrestricted use. ENTOMB also comprises five distinct periods of effort, with the initial three periods identical to those of DECON (NUREG/CR-5884 and NUREG/CR-6174). The fourth period is preparation for entombment, when all of the radioactive materials are consolidated within the containment building and entombed. The fifth period is entombed storage for an extended time, between 60 and 300 years.    ENTOMB is intended for use where the residual radioactivity will decay to levels permitting unrestricted release of the facility within reasonable time periods (100 years). However, a few radioactive isotopes produced in nuclear reactors have long half-life periods (Section 7.3.1) that prevent the release of the facilities for unrestricted use within the foreseeable lifetime of any man-made structure. ENTOMB would be a viable alternative only for facilities where radioactive isotopes would be expected to decay to safe levels within the expected lifetime of the entombment structure. This condition likely would not pertain to nuclear power reactors. In addition, the use of the ENTOMB alternative contributes to problems associated with increased numbers of sites dedicated to ""interim"" storage of radioactive materials for long periods of time.   7.2.3 Decommissioning Experience    U.S. commercial nuclear power reactors that have been shut down through 1992 are listed in Table 7.1. An additional 24 reactors have been or are being decommissioned in France, West Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Japan (Gaunt et al. 1990).    7.2.4 Inventory and Disposition of Radioactive Materials      Table 7.1 U.S. commercial nuclear power reactors formerly licensed to operate        Unit/location   Construction type a /MW(t)   Operating license issued/shut down   Decommissioning alternative selected/current status        Bonus b  Punta Higuera, PR   BWR/50    04/02/64  06/01/68   ENTOMB  ENTOMB        Carolina Virginia Tube Reactor c  Parr, SC   PTHW/65    11/27/62  01/01/67   SAFSTOR  SAFSTOR      Dresden 1  Morris, IL   BWR/700    09/28/59  10/31/78   SAFSTOR  SAFSTOR      Elk River b  Elk River, MN   BWR/58    11/06/62  02/01/68   DECON  DECON completed      Fermi 1  Lagoona Beach, MI   SCF/200    05/10/63  09/22/72   SAFSTOR  SAFSTOR      Fort St. Vrain  Platteville, CO   HTG/842    12/21/73  08/18/89   DECON  DECON in progress      GE Vallecitos Boiling Water Reactor  Pleasanton, CA   BWR/50    08/31/57  12/09/63   SAFSTOR  SAFSTOR      Hallam b  Hallam, NE   SCGM/256    01/02/62  09/01/64   ENTOMB  ENTOMB      Humboldt Bay 3  Eureka, CA   BWR/200    08/28/62  07/02/76   SAFSTOR  SAFSTOR      Indian Point 1  Buchanan, NY   PWR/615    03/26/62  10/31/74   SAFSTOR  NRC review      La Crosse  Genoa, WI   BWR/165    07/03/67  04/30/87   SAFSTOR  SAFSTOR      Pathfinder  Sioux Falls, SD   BWR/190    03/12/64  09/16/67   SAFSTOR  DECON in progress      Peach Bottom 1  Peach Bottom, PA   HTG/115    01/24/66  10/31/74   SAFSTOR  SAFSTOR      Piqua b  Piqua, OH   OCM/46    08/23/62  01/01/66   ENTOMB  ENTOMB      Rancho Seco  Herald, CA   PWR/2772    08/16/74  06/07/89   SAFSTOR  NRC review      San Onofre 1  San Clemente, CA   PWR/1347    03/27/67  11/30/92   SAFSTOR d      Shippingport b  Shippingport, PA   PWR/236    N/A  82   DECON  DECON completed        Shoreham  Wading River, NY   BWR/2436    04/21/89  06/28/89   DECON  DECON in progress      Three Mile Island 2  Londonderry Township, PA   PWR/2770    02/08/78  03/28/79   e      Trojan  Portland, OR   PWR/3411    11/21/75  11/09/92   f      Yankee-Rowe  Franklin County, MA   PWR/600    12/24/63  10/01/91   g    a BWR = boiling-water reactor; HTG = high-temperature gas-cooled; OCM = organically cooled and moderated; PTHW = pressure tube, heavy water cooled and moderated; PWR = pressurized-water reactor; SCF = sodium cooled, fast; SCGM = sodium cooled, graphite moderated.   b Atomic Energy Commission/Department of Energy owned; not regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.   c Holds by-product license from state of South Carolina.   d San Onofre 1 decommissioning plan was due to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in November 1994.   e Three Mile Island 2 has been placed in a monitored storage mode.

Radioactive materials can be classified as activated or radioactively contaminated materials. Materials become activated when they have been exposed to (irradiated by) high levels of neutron radiation (such as in a reactor). When normal (stable) atoms in a material absorb neutrons, they become unstable (radioactive) and subsequently emit energy in the form of radiation. Radioactive contamination is radioactive material in the form of fine particles, liquids, or gases that are deposited on the surface of, or mixed with, materials that otherwise are not radioactive. Contaminated materials can generally be decontaminated to various degrees by several techniques. These techniques range from simply washing with soap and water to sandblasting contaminated surfaces. Decontamination techniques for liquids and gases include filtration and chemical ion exchange. Activated materials cannot be decontaminated; they remain radioactive until the radioactive constituents decay to stable isotopes.     Reactor components are generally both activated and contaminated. The principal activated components of a power plant are the reactor internals and the biological shield. Other reactor system components, such as the primary and possibly the secondary coolant loops, the turbines in BWRs, and the radioactive waste handling systems, are not activated but are highly contaminated by the contaminated fluids they contain. The major source of contamination in reactor coolant is the plant corrosion and wear material suspended in the coolant that becomes activated as it passes through the reactor core. Surface contamination can also be found in areas of the plant where leaks from contaminated systems have occurred.    The inventory of radionuclides for PWRs and BWRs is slightly different. A typical large PWR would have a radioactivity level of about 4.8 million Ci (1Ci = 3.7 x 10 10  Bq) in the major reactor components, 4800 Ci of radioactive corrosion products in the primary coolant system, and 1200 Ci of radioactivity in the concrete biological shield at the time of shutdown (NUREG/CR-0130). A typical large BWR would have a radioactivity level of about 6.3 million Ci in the major reactor components, 8600 Ci of radioactive corrosion products in the primary coolant system, and 1000 Ci of radioactivity in the concrete biological shield at the time of shutdown (NUREG/CR-0672).    The principal radioactive isotopes from irradiated steel and concrete, with their modes of decay and their half-lives, are listed in Table 7.2. By the end of 40 years of operation, the radionuclides with half-lives of less than about 5 years are at equilibrium, because their rates of decay equal their rates of generation. No matter how much longer a power plant is operated, the concentration of short-half-life radionuclides will not increase. The longer-lived radionuclides are generated much faster than they decay; thus their concentrations increase approximately in proportion to the reactor operating time.  Figure 7.3  illustrates the buildup of some important radionuclides as a function of nuclear plant operating life.    Radioactive isotopes that are mainly beta emitters or that have very short half-lives do not contribute significantly to the personnel radiation dose associated with decommissioning. Because beta radiation is weakly penetrating, it can be shielded easily and presents a hazard mainly if ingested or inhaled by operations personnel. Isotopes with very short half-life periods can be allowed to decay to insignificant levels before decommissioning operations begin.    At the time of decommissioning, radioactive materials are found in the reactor building, the auxiliary building, and the fuel building (Section 7.2.1). Immediately after operations are terminated, these parts of the plant are highly radioactive because of short-lived activation products. The highest levels of radioactivity subside very quickly as short-lived radionuclides decay and progressively longer-lived radionuclides dominate the overall radioactivity. After about a year,  60 Co dominates the radiation dose to workers. After about 100 years,  94 Nb dominates the radiation dose to workers or persons in the vicinity ( Figure 7.4 ). For all practical purposes, the radiation dose to workers will not decrease further because  94 Nb has a 20,000-year half-life. Because  60 Co and  94 Nb dominate the radiation dose during the time of decommissioning, their characteristics affect the decommissioning process.

Figure 7.4  Time dependence of radioactivity and dose rate in a boiling-water reactor core shroud after 40 years of operation.  Source:  NUREG/CR-0672.    Both  60 Co and  94 Nb are activation products--isotopes created when neutrons from nuclear fission convert nonradioactive elements ( 59 Co and  93 Nb) in the structural components of the plant into radioactiveisotopes. An important difference is that  94 Nb in the steel reactor vessel and components, formed by activation of  93 Nb, is not subject to corrosion and movement throughout the primary system to the extent that  60 Co is. Consequently, equipment in the reactor containment building that is not exposed to high neutron fluxes and parts of the fuel and auxiliary buildings may be highly contaminated with  60 Co but only slightly so with  94 Nb.     Extending operations to 60 years would not increase the shutdown radioactivity level of either a PWR or BWR to any appreciable extent. This is because most of the radioactivity at shutdown results from short-half-life radionuclides, such as  60 Co, that are already in equilibrium by the time 40 years of operations have transpired. The only change in radioactive inventory resulting from the additional 20 years of operations is the further accumulation of long-half-life radionuclides such as  63 Ni and  94 Nb, but these long-half-life radionuclides produce only a small fraction of the total radioactivity at shutdown. Of the long-half-life radionuclides,  63 Ni contributes most at shutdown but composes less than 3 percent of the total radioactivity. Twenty additional years of operation would increase its contribution to about 4 percent of total shutdown radioactivity. Because  63 Ni is a beta emitter, it contributes only a very small part of the dose to workers or the public. Gamma-emitting  94 Nb is the most important long-half-life radionuclide with regard to producing external radiation exposure. Based on  Figure 7.4 , it can be determined that at shutdown  94 Nb contributes less than 0.001 percent of the total potential dose. Even though 20 additional years of operation would increase the amount of  94 Nb by 50 percent, it would not increase its contribution to the dose much above 0.001 percent.    7.2.5 Waste Generated During Decommissioning    This section summarizes the quantities and types of radioactive waste and emissions generated in decommissioning after 40 and 60 years of operation, respectively. Because the demolition and disposal of nonradioactive parts of nuclear facilities are not considered part of decommissioning, almost all waste generated during decommissioning is radioactive. Although the demolition and disposal of the nonradioactive parts may continue during and after decommissioning, these activities are not regulated by NRC. The impacts of radioactive wastes and emissions are described in Section 7.3. This section does not take into account volume reduction or aggressive processing that could allow release for unrestricted use.    7.2.5.1 Atmospheric Emissions    As shown in Table 7.3, the total atmospheric releases for decommissioning are less than 100 mCi, whereas normal operations average about 3000 Ci/year. Atmospheric releases are expected to consist largely of dust, aerosols, and smokelike particulates produced during the dismantling and handling of reactor components. These releases were estimated by assuming that the airborne concentrations of radionuclides will be a fraction of the contamination level on and in the radioactive components (NUREG/CR-0130 and NUREG/CR-0672). Because the radioactive inventory would be nearly unchanged by operations during a 20-year license renewal term, no difference exists between the base case and 20 years of additional operation.    Table 7.3 Airborne radioactive releases resulting from decommissioning typical pressurized-water reactors (PWRs) and boiling-water reactors (BWRs) with normal operating releases, base case (40 years of operation) a             DECON  (mCi)   SAFSTOR  (mCi)   ENTOMB  (mCi)   Normal operations  (Ci/year)      PWR   0.86 b   0.003 b   NA c   2,600 d      BWR   87 e   0.21d d   2.25 d   3,400 d    a Decommissioning releases are for 40 years of operation.

Decommissioning is assumed to last 5 years.    7.2.5.2 Liquid Effluents    No estimates of liquid waste releases are available for decommissioning nuclear power plants. However, liquids will be produced by decontamination procedures (e.g., some cutting operations and possibly some chemical decontamination procedures) and by disposal of plant fluids (e.g., cooling water and water from fuel storage pools). Filtration and ion exchange methods will be used to decontaminate liquids, as would be done during normal operations. Some liquid effluents may be contaminated with chelating agents and may require further processing. These methods are expected to keep waterborne effluents of most radionuclides within the values of normal operations. Tritium ( 3 H) is the only radioactive isotope that cannot be removed from waste water by these means.    Tritium is found principally in the primary coolant-loop water. Tritium cannot be removed from water except by extraordinary means and is normally discharged to a surface water body. Normal  3 H discharges from PWRs range from a few hundred to a few thousand curies per year. BWR  3 H discharges are generally only about 10 percent as high as  3 H discharges from PWRs. About 500 Ci of  3 H can be found in PWR primary coolant-loop water. Discharge of the entire volume of primary coolant-loop water over a period of 1 to 5 years after shutdown would be feasible without exceeding normal operating period discharge rates. The amounts or characteristics of liquid effluents discharged during decommissioning would not be changed by operation during a 20-year license renewal term. Discharge of primary coolant water during normal operations limits the accumulation of  3 H in the primary coolant loop; thus  3 H is in equilibrium in the primary coolant water well before 40 years of operation.     7.2.5.3 Solid Waste    Table 7.4 summarizes the quantities of LLW generated by decommissioning of large PWRs and BWRs. The table shows that the largest amount of LLW is generated by the DECON method and the least is generated by the SAFSTOR method. The quantities listed for the ENTOMB method do not include the volume of the entombing structure or the wastes within.

The decommissioning waste volumes for all three methods of decommissioning also would not be affected by extending the volume of radioactive materials would not increase. (Operational waste quantities would continue, but they do not affect the amount of decommissioning waste.) An additional 20 years of operation would slightly affect the waste characteristics. As discussed in Section 7.2.4, the quantity of long-lived activation products such as  94 Nb would continue to increase, essentially in proportion to the additional operational time. As a result, the long-half-life radionuclides in the waste would increase by 50 percent if the plants were operated an additional 20 years. However, as explained earlier, these long-lived radionuclides contribute only a small fraction of the shutdown radioactivity level.      7.3 Decommissioning Impacts and Changes Resulting from Life Extension        [  Prev  |  Next  |  Table of Contents  ]    Estimated decommissioning impacts for 40 years of operation--the base case (taken primarily from NUREG-0586, NUREG/CR-0130, and NUREG/CR-0672)--and the change in impacts caused by continued operations for an additional 20 years under license renewal are reported for each impact area in the following sections. These impacts are estimated for PWRs and BWRs. The per-reactor impacts of decommissioning at multiple-reactor sites are not expected to be significantly different from those at single-reactor sites. [The impacts would be smaller at multiple reactor sites if the reactor decommissionings were staggered and if LLW were stored on the site (NUREG-0586)].   7.3.1 Radiation Dose    The estimated occupational and public radiation doses resulting from the three decommissioning methods after 40 years of operation (base case) are summarized in this section. Occupational dose estimates were presented in draft reports NUREG/CR-5884 and NUREG/CR-6174. These reports do not provide estimates of doses to the public. The Atomic Energy Act requires the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to promulgate, inspect, and enforce standards that provide an adequate level of protection of the public health and safety and the environment. These responsibilities, singly and in the aggregate, provide a margin of safety. For the purposes of assessing radiological impacts, the Commission has concluded that impacts are of small significance if doses and releases do not exceed permissible levels in the Commission's regulations.    7.3.1.1 Occupational Dose    For both PWRs and BWRs, there are substantial differences among the occupational radiation doses for the decommissioning methods (Table 7.5). The DECON method has the highest doses, followed by ENTOMB and then SAFSTOR. Although extending operations 20 years would increase the doses from  94 Nb and other less-important long-half-life radionuclides, these doses would not have any appreciable effect on the occupational dose because short-lived radionuclides (primarily  60 Co) are the principal sources of worker exposure. For each decommissioning method, the bulk of the dose comes during activities in the first few years after termination of plant operations (period four begins less than 5 years after terminating operations for DECON), when the radioactivity level of  60 Co is still significant. At the end of 60 years of SAFSTOR, the dose rate would have decayed to about 0.01 percent of the dose rate at the end of operations, at which time  94 Nb would contribute only about 2 percent of the total ( Figure 7.4 ).    An additional 20 years of operation before 60 years of SAFSTOR would increase the amount of  94 Nb by approximately 50 percent. During period 5, occupational exposures from SAFSTOR activities would be no more than 10 person-rem. (Section E.A.3 of Appendix E discusses the International System units used in measuring radioactivity and radiation dose. The contribution from  94 Nb would be less than 0.2 person-rem. The increase in dose during decommissioning after 20 additional years of operation would be no more than about 0.1 person-rem.    Although total doses to the decommissioning workforce may increase slightly as a result of an additional 20 years of plant operation, the exposure of individual workers will be maintained well below the existing regulatory limits of 10 CRF Part 20. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that radiological impacts to the decontamination workforce as a result of license renewal is of small significance.    The potential increase in total dose to the decommissioning work force may be mitigated by programs that are responsive to 10 CFR 20.1101(b), which requires that ""The licensee shall use, to the extent practicable, procedures and engineering controls based upon sound radiation protection principles to achieve occupational doses and doses to members of the public that are as low as is reasonably achievable (ALARA)."" The ongoing ALARA programs within the industry already employ measures that would be considered for mitigating the generation or the accumulation of long-lived activation products during 20 additional years of operation. Two examples of mitigation measures that are already in use are (1) replacing components using cobalt alloys with those using low-cobalt or cobalt-free alloys and (2) full system decontamination (e.g., see Moore 1995). No additional mitigation measures warranted. This is a Category 1 issue.

Furthermore, the dose is almost exclusively caused by shipment of  60 Co and shorter-lived radionuclides; for truck shipments, the SAFSTOR 100-years alternative shows negligible dose to the public. Because only the quantities of long-lived radionuclides would increase if plants were operated an additional 20 years, only the dose caused by the long-lived radionuclides would increase. Because the dose to the public from long-lived radionuclides after 40 years of operation is negligible (see the SAFSTOR 100-years alternative in Table 7.6), an increase of 50 percent of this negligible amount would still remain a negligible dose (less than 0.1 person-rem).

Decommissioning exposures after 60 years would be identical, except as noted. Draft reports NUREG/CR-5884 and    NUREG/CR-6174 do not provide updates for this information.    b NA means not applicable and neg means negligible.    c Decommissioning after 60 years of operation would increase occupational and public exposure during    (1) decontamination and (2) decontamination truck shipments by only negligible amounts.    d Ranges are for removing or leaving internal components or leaving them in place. The higher exposures are associated with removing the internals.    Note: To convert person-rem to person-sievert, multiply by 0.01.      The negligible public radiation exposures for SAFSTOR preparation, continuing care, and decontamination (Table 7.6) include exposures from atmospheric and liquid releases during routine decommissioning operations. There are no historical records of significant releases during decommissioning, and no reliable estimates can be made of the probability and consequences of such events. However, the probability and consequences of such releases are not expected to be different for decommissioning a base case facility versus decommissioning a facility that has had 20 years of additional operation.    Extending reactor operating life from 40 to 60 years is expected to increase the concentration of long-half-life radionuclides in the facility by up to 50 percent. By the end of the initial 40 years of operation, the radionuclides with half-lives of less than about 5 years are at equilibrium because their rates of decay equal their rates of generation. The release of radioactivity to the atmosphere during decontamination is negligibly small and primarily involves short-lived nuclides. Public exposure even with the increased concentration of long-lived nuclides would remain negligible. The exposure of individual members of the public will be maintained well below existing regulatory limits. Accordingly, the staff concludes that the contribution of license renewal to radiological impacts from decontamination is of small significance. As discussed in Section 7.3.1.1, measures that can reduce possible dose levels to the public are available and are being employed in pursuit of ALARA.    Radiation doses (public and occupational) from decommissioning that are attributable to license renewal are a Category 1 issue.   7.3.2 Waste Management Impacts    An operating 1000-MW(e) reactor generates about 38 m 3  (1300 ft 3 ) of spent fuel and about 52,000 m 3  (1,800,000 ft 3 ) of LLW over its 40-year life (NUREG-0586, pp. 2-21). (LLW is defined in Chapter 6.) The reference PWR and BWR are about 15 percent larger, so they would be expected to generate about 15 percent more waste than a 1000-MW(e) plant. As shown by Table 7.4, decommissioning either type of plant after 40 years of operation (base case) would generate less than 15,000 m 3  (530,000 ft 3 ) of LLW for DECON or short-term SAFSTOR and less than 1,200 m 3  (42,000 ft 3 ) of LLW for SAFSTOR of 50 years or longer. These waste volumes include spent chelating agent used to decontaminate liquids. The 15,000 m 3  (530,000 ft 3 ) of decommissioning LLW is about 25 percent, and 1,200 m 3  (42,000 ft 3 ) is only about 2 percent, of the LLW generated by 40 years of operations. None of these estimates of waste volume includes waste generation during refurbishment.     Extending operations by 20 years would not increase decommissioning waste volumes, so the ratio of decommissioning waste volume to operating waste volume would be even lower. After 60 years of operation, decommissioning LLW would be less than about 20 percent of the operational LLW. If SAFSTOR were used, the decommissioning LLW would be only about 1 percent of the LLW generated by operations.     While the volume of decommissioning waste will not increase with 20 years of additional operating time, the concentration of long-half-life radionuclides will increase. LLW is classified by 10 CFR Part 61 into three waste classes denoted A, B, and C and a category of LLW designated ""greater than Class C"" (GTCC). Classes A and B are wastes that are contaminated with relatively short-half-life radionuclides and may be safely disposed of near the earth's surface because they will decay to a nonhazardous condition within about 100 years. Class C waste can be disposed of at a moderate depth or near the earth's surface with engineered barriers to prevent inadvertent intrusion into the wastes. GTCC waste cannot safely be disposed of near the earth's surface (Section 6.2.2.2; 10 CFR Part 61.7).    Table 7.7 gives the estimated decommissioning LLW breakdown (DECON scenario) for the base case by waste class per 10 CFR Part 61. Items classified as C and GTCC consist of highly activated metal located in the high-flux neutron field. For the PWR, the GTCC items include the lower core barrel, the thermal shields, the core shroud, and the lower grid plate. The class C items are the upper grid plate and the lower support column. The class B wastes consist of spent resins used during decommissioning, part of the combustible contaminated wastes, and part of the cylindrical pressure vessel wall. The only GTCC wastes from a BWR are the core shroud and top fuel guide. BWR class C wastes are from the control rods and in-core instrumentation, jet pump assemblies, and the top fuel guide. The class B wastes are from the steam separator assembly, the reactor vessel wall, and portions of the clean-up wastes.          Table 7.7 Decommissioning waste volumes for reference pressurized-water reactor (PWR) and boiling-water reactor (BWR) after 40 years of operation a          Class A   Class B/C   GTCC b      PWR   6,797 m 3   184 m 3   11 m 3        BWR   13,903 m 3   372 m 3   6.9 m 3       a DECON decommissioning method. Other methods would have smaller volumes of Class A and B wastes; Class C and GTCC wastes volumes would not change for other methods. A plant that has operated 60 years would have essentially the same waste volumes and classifications.   b GTCC = greater than Class C.    Source:  NUREG/CR-5884 and NUREG/CR-6174.    Note: 1 m 3  _ 35.3 ft 3 .       The radionuclides of most importance for determining the classification of these LLWs are those that have relatively long half-life periods, such as  59 Ni and  94 Nb. These are also the radionuclides that accumulate in proportion with the length of reactor operation. The estimates in Table 7.7 are made for a plant that has operated 40 years. A plant that has operated 60 years would have essentially the same decommissioning waste volumes and classifications. Because the radionuclide concentration differences among waste classes are large (factors of 10 or more) and because the concentrations of radionuclides increase by no more than 50 percent, few components would be advanced to a higher classification by an additional 20 years of operations. Because the decommissioning waste volumes and classifications are essentially unchanged by an additional 20 years of plant operation, the Commission finds that the environmental impacts of decommissioning waste due to license renewal are of small significance. Measures employed within the context of ALARA, as discussed in Section 7.3.1.1, have the potential to reduce slightly the volume of LLW generated by decommissioning. The impact on decommissioning waste management attributable to license renewal is a Category 1 issue.   7.3.3 Air Quality Impacts    Air quality impacts of decommissioning are expected to be negligible. No major land disturbance for construction laydown or temporary waste storage areas is anticipated. The principal air quality impacts would result from motor vehicles operated by workers for transportation on-site and for movement of people and materials to and from the site. Most decommissioning activities would be conducted inside the containment, the auxiliary building, and the fuel-handling buildings. Because there would be a possibility of airborne releases of radioactivity within these buildings during decommissioning, releases to the ambient environment would be controlled. These impacts would be much smaller than those associated with construction or demolition of the facilities on-site and would not change with 20 additional years of operation. License renewal and an additional 20 years of reactor operation will have no impact on air quality during decommissioning; thus the impact of license renewal on decommissioning air quality impacts is of small significance for all plants. Because license renewal does not affect the level of air pollution during decommissioning, there is no need for the consideration of mitigation as part of the license renewal environmental review. The impact of decommissioning on air quality attributable to license renewal is a Category 1 issue.   7.3.4 Water Quality Impacts    The principal water quality impacts expected from decommissioning are those associated with sanitary sewer operations. Because the decommissioning work force is likely to be smaller than those of construction and certain operational activities (see Section 7.3.7), no increase in water quality impacts is expected. Soil erosion and chemical spills associated with increased site activities during decommissioning have the potential to degrade water quality, but such effects are readily controllable. The potential for significant water quality impacts from erosion or spills is no greater if decommissioning occurs after a 20-year license renewal instead of after the original 40 years of operation. Measures to minimize occupational and public radiation exposure will also protect water quality. License renewal and an additional 20 years of reactor operation will have no impact on water quality during decommissioning; thus the impact is of small significance. Because license renewal does not affect water quality impacts during decommissioning, there is no need for the consideration of mitigation as part of the license renewal environmental review. The impact of decommissioning on water quality impacts attributable to license renewal is a Category 1 issue.   7.3.5 Ecological Impacts    Terrestrial biota impacts, if any, would be associated with land disturbance for laydown or temporary waste storage areas, and no such land disturbance is anticipated. No direct impacts to aquatic biota are expected from routine decommissioning activities. Measures employed to protect water quality will also prevent toxic effects to aquatic organisms from liquid effluents. Therefore, the ecological impacts associated with decommissioning are not expected to vary with the length of time the plant is operated. Decommissioning after a 20-year license renewal would have the same ecological impacts, if any, as decommissioning after 40 years of operation; thus the impact is of small significance. Because license renewal does not affect ecological impacts during decommissioning, there is no need for the consideration of mitigation as part of the license renewal environmental review. The impact of decommissioning on ecological resources attributable to license renewal is a Category 1 issue.   7.3.6 Economic Impacts    In general, the nature of the activities and the elements of the costs associated with decommissioning are well understood, and the necessary skills and equipment should be readily available when needed. Table 7.8 lists percentage estimates of total costs for decommissioning large PWR and BWR reactors by the DECON method.    A 1991 national survey had estimates that averaged $218 million per 1000 MW for a PWR reactor and $283 million per 1000 MW for a BWR. The standard deviation was $74 million for PWRs and $144 million for BWRs. For both types of reactors, the range for plus and minus one standard deviation was $131 million to $350 million (OTA-E-575). These varying estimates reflect the uncertainty of projecting costs well into the future. Additionally, the unique aspects of a plant's design and operating history can affect decommissioning costs (e.g., Three Mile Island Unit 2 and Fort St. Vrain).    The largest cost category is ""undistributed""; the largest component of this cost is utility support staff. The timing of decommissioning could influence disposal costs depending on the price of disposal services. The current trend is steeply increasing cost per units of radioactive waste disposal. If this trend continues over the long run, then one effect of license renewal could be to increase decommissioning costs. However, disposal costs should stabilize by the time that most existing plants would be eligible for license renewal. If this is the case, license renewal would have a minimal effect on the undiscounted costs of decommissioning after a 20-year extended operation period, compared with after 40 years of operation.    For the cost estimates included in Table 7.8, doubling the cost per cubic foot of waste disposal would increase total decommissioning costs by about 13 percent for PWRs and 20 percent for BWRs. The assumed rate charged for disposal would have to increase by a factor of about 6 to double the total cost of decommissioning. If the rate of disposal costs turns out to be significantly more than has been assumed in decommissioning cost estimates, there would tend to be significantly more attention devoted to volume reduction; thus, total cost of disposal would tend to increase less than the proportional increase in the rate charged per cubic foot (NUREG/CR-5884, vol. 1, pp. 3.56, 3.57, and NUREG/CR-6174, vol. 1, p. 3.55).    The timing of decommissioning could also affect costs if progress in robotics technology reduces costs and worker radiation exposure. This progress would affect a relatively small part of the decommissioning process and thus is unlikely to reduce the total cost of decommissioning significantly; however, it could result in substantial dose reductions.

Most of the undistributed costs are for staffing.   h At 3 percent discount rate.   i The decommissioning costs have been discounted at a rate of 3 percent real (assumes no inflation). At this rate, delaying decommissioning by the 20-year period of license renewal saves about 45 percent of the decommissioning cost; however, present value total costs have been figured at 2.5 years from final plant shutdown, resulting in savings from license renewal of about 40 percent.    Source:  Tables 3.1 and 4.1 and pp. 3.59, 4.13, and 5.13 of NUREG/CR-5884, Vol. 1; Tables 3.1 and 4.1 and pp. 3.58, 4.12, and 5.11 of NUREG/CR-6174, Vol. 1.    The preceding sections show that there is no reason to expect the physical requirements of decommissioning to be materially different when comparing the base case to a 20-year extended operation period. The undiscounted economic costs, although uncertain, should also be relatively stable and thus unaffected by license renewal. However, because of financial considerations, the timing of decommissioning costs is important. To compare costs of activities that occur at different times, it is necessary to discount these costs to a common point in time. This is accomplished through present worth calculations, which account for the real opportunity cost or time value of money. Delaying decommissioning will allow any funds accumulated for this purpose to earn a return over the additional 20 years of license renewal and thus to reduce the present value of the decommissioning costs. The reduction in the present value is a function of the delay (license renewal period) and the time value of money, so the present value would be reduced by the same amount even if no fund were established and decommissioning were financed with borrowed money at the end of the plant operations. Regardless of how it is financed, the present value of delaying decommissioning costs will result in significant financial cost savings if a positive real discount rate is assumed.    Because total decommissioning costs are uncertain, the amount of financial savings that results from delaying decommissioning is also uncertain. Higher-than-expected decommissioning costs would result in higher cost savings resulting from delaying these costs, and vice versa. At a 3 percent real (i.e., above general inflation) discount rate, the present value savings associated with license renewal is about 40 percent of decommissioning costs (Table 7.8). Real cost increases, which might occur for waste disposal costs, could reduce the cost advantage of license renewal, but waste disposal costs are expected to stabilize before the current licenses of most plants expire. The impact of license renewal on decommissioning costs is not a consideration in the environmental review and decision whether to renew a license.   7.3.7 Socioeconomic Impacts    Socioeconomic impacts associated with decommissioning will be induced by the net change in the labor force as incoming decommissioning workers replace emigrating operations workers. The nature of these impacts will depend on the vitality of local economic activity at the time of decommissioning.    One of the difficulties of attempting to evaluate the socioeconomic impacts of decommissioning in year 40 of a plant's life compared with decommissioning in year 60 relates to the uncertainties about the size of the work force required. The largest nuclear power plant decommissioned to date has been the 150-MW(e) Shippingport Station (Section 7.2.3), which required an average work force during the peak year of approximately 230 workers (DOE/SSDP-0081); this work force was larger than the estimated work forces for very large power plants examined in studies prepared before the Shippingport experience (NUREG/CR-0130, Table 9.1-1; NUREG/CR-0672, Table 9.1-3). Because more-recent manpower estimates for large nuclear power plants are not available, the actual work force required in the future might be substantially larger than currently expected.    If the decommissioning process requires a smaller work force than the on-site operating staff and if the local economy is stable or declining, the result could be economic hardships, including declining property values and business activity, and problems for local government as it adjusts to lower levels of tax revenues. However, even this reduced work force will tend to mitigate temporarily the full adverse socioeconomic effects of terminating operations.    If there is a net reduction in the community work force but the economy is growing, the adverse impacts of this ongoing growth (e.g., housing shortages and school overcrowding) could be reduced.    If the decommissioning work force were substantially larger than the operational work force, the result could be increased demand for housing and public services but also increased tax revenues and higher real estate values. If the economy is characterized by decline, decommissioning could temporarily reverse the adverse economic effects.    In a stable economy, a net increase in the community work force could lead to some shortages in housing and public services, as well as to the higher tax revenues and real estate values mentioned previously. In a growing economy, decommissioning could act as an exacerbating factor to the ongoing shortages that already might exist.    Although the staff cannot project with certainty either the size of the required decommissioning work force or the state of the local economy at the time of decommissioning, the staff has assumed that the baseline conditions will be negligibly different in year 40, compared with year 60. Therefore, the staff expects that the socioeconomic impacts of decommissioning would be essentially similar whether that action were taken in year 60 or in year 40. The impact of license renewal on the socioeconomic impacts of decommissioning are of small significance. Because license renewal does not affect the socioeconomic impacts that will occur at the time of decommissioning, there is no need for the consideration of mitigation as part of the license renewal environmental review. The impact of decommissioning on socioeconomic resources attributable to license renewal is a Category 1 issue.      7.4 Conclusions      [  Prev  |  Next  |  Table of Contents  ]    The physical requirements and attendant effects of decommissioning nuclear power plants after a 20-year license renewal are not expected to differ from those of decommissioning at the end of 40 years of operation. Decommissioning after a 20-year license renewal would increase the occupational dose no more than 0.1 person-rem (compared with 7,000 to 14,000 person-rem for DECON decommissioning at 40 years) and the public dose by a negligible amount (Section 7.3.1). License renewal would not increase to any appreciable extent the quantity or classification of LLW generated by decommissioning (Section 7.3.2). Air quality, water quality, and ecological impacts of decommissioning would not change as a result of license renewal (Sections 7.3.3, 7.3.4, and 7.3.5). There is considerable uncertainty about the cost of decommissioning; however, while license renewal would not be expected to change the ultimate cost of decommissioning, it would reduce the present value of the cost (Section 7.3.6). The socioeconomic effects of decommissioning will depend on the magnitude of the decommissioning effort, the size of the community, and the other economic activities at the time, but the impacts will not be increased by decommissioning at the end of a 20-year license renewal instead of at the end of 40 years of operation (Section 7.3.7). Incremental radiation doses, waste management, air quality, water quality, ecological, and socioeconomic impacts of decommissioning due to operations during a 20-year license renewal term would be of small significance. No mitigation measures beyond those provided by ALARA are warranted within the context of the license renewal process. The impacts of license renewal on radiation doses, waste management, air quality, water quality, ecological resources, and socioeconomics impacts from decommissioning are Category 1 issues.      7.5 References      [  Prev  |  Next  |  Table of Contents  ]    DOE/EP-0093,  Energy Technology Characterizations Handbook,  Environmental Pollution and Control Factors, U.S. Department of Energy, Washington, D.C., March 1983.

Preparation, also known as pretreatment, consists of a series of various treatment and rinsing steps critical to obtaining good results in subsequent textile finishing processes. In preparation, the mill removes natural impurities or processing chemicals that interfere with dyeing, printing and finishing.    Typical  preparation treatments include desizing, scouring and bleaching. Preparation steps can also include processes, such as singeing and mercerizing, designed to chemically or physically alter the fabric. For instance, the mercerizing stage chemically treats the fabric to increase fiber strength and dye affinity, or ability to pick up dyes. This, in turn, increases the longevity of fabric finishes applied during finishing. Many of the pollutants from preparation result from the removal of previously applied processing chemicals and agricultural residues. These chemical residues can be passed on to subsequent stages with improper preparation.    Most mills can use the same preparation equipment for the entire range of products they produce. In most cases, facilities favor continuous rather than batch preparation processes for economic and pollution control reasons. A number of mills, however, prepare goods, particularly knits, batchwise on dyeing machines to simplify scheduling and handling. Sometimes, facilities operate batchwise to reduce high capital costs required for high productivity and the complexity of storing and tracking goods through continuous wet processing operations.   Because preparation is relatively uniform across most of a mill's production, preparation is usually the highest-volume process in a mill and hence an important area for pollution prevention. If fabrics contained no contamination upon arrival for wet processing, preparation processes would be unnecessary, eliminating about half the pollution outputs from wet processing and a significant amount of wastewater. The primary pollutant from preparation is wastewater containing alkalinity, BOD, COD and relatively small amounts of other contaminants such as metals and surfactants. There are many preparation techniques.

GX023-70-8025583	"Slate   Slate is a fine grained crystalline rock metamorphosed from bedded deposits of clay and silt. It can be worked into shingles readily because it has two lines of breakability: cleavage and grain. These occur generally at right angles to each other and are independent of the original bedding planes. The structure of    Front  elevation of a dwelling published in  Supplement to Bicknell's Village Builder . A specification for one of the designs included this direction for the French roof: ""Slate the sides of the roof with slate 5 x 12 inches, cornered as shown on elevation, nailed with galvanized nails; all hips and valleys to be flashed with tin in the best manner."" (Courtesy of The Athenaeum of Philadelphia)   the bedding remains in some slate deposits as visible bands running across the cleavage. Known as ribbons, these bands may be either weaker or harder than the surrounding slate. Slate's durability as roofing is due to its high strength, low porosity and low absorption rate. Specific mineral components are responsible for the various colors: carbon (black), hematite (red and purple), chlorite and ferrous iron oxide (green). Other minerals, considered impurities (calcite and iron sulfides), are slowly transformed by weathering into gypsum, which expands and causes the slate to delaminate.     Slate has been used as a roofing material in Europe for hundreds of years, with surviving examples dating to the 8th century. From the 17th to the 19th centuries, most of the roofing slate used in America was imported from North Wales, where slate quarrying was a major industry. Although the first commercial slate quarry in the United States      The Vendor Slate Co. had ten quarries in Pennsylvania, Vermont and New York in 1929. ( Sweet's Architectural Catalogue , 1929. Courtesy of The Sweet's Group, The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.) [click image for larger view]    was opened in 1785 in Peach Bottom, Pennsylvania, the industry was limited and local until the second half of the 19th century. At that time the industry grew and matured in response to a growing population, advancements in quarrying technology, an expanding rail system, and the immigration of Welsh slate workers to America.    The United States became a slate exporter after the Civil War, as quarries opened in Vermont, New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. Architectural styles of this period emphasized prominent roof lines and decorative patterns, details that were well suited to the varied colors and shapes available in slate. Properties such as nonflammability, durability, minimal maintenance costs, and aesthetic value made slate all the more desirable. Its primary drawback was its weight, making shipping costly and requiring substantial roof framing.    Between 1897 and 1914 production peaked. Later use of slate often employed different thicknesses and colors, and unevenly cut or aligned butts to produce picturesque effects suitable for English revival styles popular in the early 20th century. After 1915 widespread use of slate roofing declined in the United States, due in part to a lack of skilled labor, but more importantly, due to the development of modern, mass produced materials such as asphalt shingles, which seemed the more economical alternative.      ""Not all that glitters is gold. Not all that looks like slate is good slate."" claims the Bangor Slate Co. of Easton, Pennsylvania. They issued this certificate in 1906 emphasizing the source of slate as an indication of quality. [click image for larger view]     A slate is typically attached to wooden sheathing with two nails driven through prepunched holes, though as with tile, it may be wired or screwed to steel angles on a steel framed roof. At the end of the19th century asphalt saturated felt laid over the wood sheathing became a standard part of most slate roof installations. Slate is installed with an overlap that depends on the slope of the roof and requires a minimum pitch (generally  4 inches of rise per 12 inches of run) to effectively shed water. Particularly in coastal areas slate can be found laid in mortar, providing extra protection against wind driven rain.    Today slate continues to be quarried domestically as well as being imported from Europe, China and South America.            Quarrying     Until the 1870s the quarrying of slate changed little from what is illustrated by Diderot in the  Pictorial Encyclopedia of Science Art and Technology  of 1762. Blocks were separated from the floor of the quarry using picks, wedges, prybars and gunpowder, taking maximum advantage of the natural seams in the rock. Windlasses and simple cranes employed man or horse power to lift blocks of slate from the pit. With the Industrial Revolution came mechanical drills and steam-powered stone channeling machines and hoists. Waste associated with blasting was reduced and efficiency increased. Subsequent advances were marked by the introduction of the wire saw in 1926 and the diamond belt saw in 1988.     Mineralogie, Ardoises D'Anjou. Travail de la Carrierre Ouverte et Outils.

GX262-91-15926735	water efficiency Industry Specific Processes TEXTILES * Water Consumption in Textiles Water is used extensively throughout textile processing operations. Almost all dyes, specialty chemicals, and finishing chemicals are applied to textile substrates from water baths. In addition, most fabric preparation steps, including desizing, scouring, bleaching, and mercerizing, use aqueous systems. The amount of water used varies widely in the industr y, depending on specific processes operated at the mill, equipment used, and prevailing management philosophy concerning water use. Reducing water consumption in textile processing is important for furthering pollution prevention efforts, due in part because excess water use dilutes pollutants and adds to the eff luent load. Mills that currently use excessive quantities of water can achieve large gains from pollution prevention.

A walk-through audit can uncover water waste in the form of: n n n n n Hoses left running. Broken or missing valves. Excessive water use in washing operations. Leaks from pipes, joints, valves, and pumps. Cooling water or wash boxes left running when machiner y is shut down. n Defective toilets and water coolers. In addition, many less obvious causes of water waste exist. These causes are presented below by subcategor y, unit process, and machine type.  These dat a ser ve as a good benchmark for determining whether water use in a particular mill is excessive.  Unit Process  Water consumption varies greatly among unit processes, as indicated in Figure 2. Certain dyeing processes and print after-washing are among the more intensive unit processes. Within the dye categor y, cer tain unit processes are par ticularly low in water consumption (e.g., pad-batch).  Machine Type  Subcategory  Textile operations var y greatly in water consumption. Figure 1 summarizes the water consumption of various types of operations. Wool and felted fabrics processes are more water intensive than other processing subcategories such as wovens, knits, stock, and carpet. Water use can var y widely between similar operations as well. For example, knit mills average 10 gallons of water per pound of production, yet water use ranges from a low of 2.5 gallons to a high of 45.2 gallons. 2  Dif ferent types of processing machiner y use dif ferent amounts of water, par ticularly in relation to the bath ratio in dyeing processes (the ratio of the mass of water in an exhaust dyebath to the mass of fabric). Washing fabric consumes greater quantities of water than dyeing. Water consumption of a batch processing machine depends on its bath ratio and also on mechanical factors such as agitation, mixing, bath and fabric turnover rate (called contact), turbulence and other mechanical considerations, as well as physical f low characteristics involved in washing operations. These factors all affect washing efficiency. In general, heating, wash, and dyebaths constitute the major portion of energy consumed in dyeing. Therefore, low bath-ratio dyeing equipment not only   FIGURE 2  Water Consumption by Unit Process Processing Subcategory Yarn & fabric forming Slashing Preparation Singeing Desizing Scouring Continuous bleaching Mercerizing Dyeing Beam Beck Jet Jig Paddle Skein Stock Pad-batch Package Continuous bleaching Indigo dyeing Printing Print afterwashing Finishing Chemical Mechanical Water Consumption, gal/lb of production Nil 0.06 to 0.94 Nil 0.3 to 2.4 2.3 to 5.1 0.3 to 14.9 0.12 20 28 24 12 35 30 20 2 22 20 1 to 6 3 13.2 0.6 Nil  conser ves water but also saves energy, in addition to reducing steam use and air pollution from boilers. Low-bath-ratio dyeing machines conser ve chemicals as well as water and also achieve higher fixation efficiency. But the washing efficiency of some types of low-bath-ratio dyeing machines, such as jigs, is inherently poor; therefore, a correlation between bath ratio and total water use is not always exact.  Process Water Conservation Washing Washing and rinsing operations are two of the most common operations in textile manufacturing that have significant potential for pollution prevention. Many processes involve washing and rinsing stages, and optimizing wash processes can conser ve 3   signif icant amounts of water. In some cases, careful auditing and implementation of controls can achieve wastewater reductions of up to 70 percent. The washing and rinsing stages of preparation typically require more water than the other stages (e.g., bleaching, dyeing). Several typical washing and rinsing processes include: n Drop and fill batch washing. n Over f low batch washing. n Continuous washing (countercurrent, horizontal, or inclined washers).

(See Figure 3.) Washing stages accounted for 9,900 gallons per hour, or 90 percent of the total. The application of the following simple, low-technology methods of water conser vation reduced water use: n Properly regulating f lows: 300 gallons per hour savings. n Counter f lowing bleach to scour: 3,000 gallons per hour savings. n Counter f lowing scour to desize: 3,000 gallons per hour savings.  blowdown). Comparison of several methods of washing after bleaching shows the benefits of countercurrent wash methods, see Figure 31. Methods five and six, which implement countercurrent washing, produce savings of 26 and 53 percent compared with the standard drop/fill method. These results are based on comparisons of washing processes that would produce the same degree of reduction of fabric impurities using computer models. Countercurrent washing processes require the addition of holding tanks and pumps. The capital cost of setting up such a reuse system typically is less than $50,000 and generates estimated savings of $95,000 annually. In many cases, reducing wastewater also reduces the need for expensive waste treatment systems.  The total water savings without process modification was 150,000 million gallons per day, or 55 percent of water use. A process modification such as a combined one-stage bleach and scour also would save 6,200 gallons of water per hour, or an additional 150,000 million gallons per day, along with energy savings.  Reusing Wash Water  Drop-Fill Versus Overflow Washing  In the drop/fill method of batch washing, spent wash water is drained and the machine is refilled with a fresh wash bath. The fabric or other substrate in the machine retains much of the previous bath, perhaps as much as 350 percent owg. This percentage can be reduced by mechanical means (e.g., extraction, 4  Many strategies can be applied for reusing wash water. Three of the most common strategies are countercurrent w ashing, reducing carr yover, and reusing wash water for cleaning purposes.  Countercurrent Washing  The countercurrent washing method is relatively straightfor ward and inexpensive to use in multi-stage washing processes. Basically, the least contaminated   FIGURE 4  Water Use in Batch Washing Process Description 1 Standard - 3 step drop/fill 2 Reduced bath - seven step drop/fill 3 Continuous overflow 4 Continuous overflow reduced bath 5 Three-step drop/fill, reuse bath 2 6 Three-step, reuse baths 2 and 3 1:8 0.75 -53.7 Bath Ratio Water Use, gal/lbs % Change from Standard  1:8 1:5 1:8 1:5 1:8  1.62 1.26 2.38 1.49 1.19  ---22.2 46.9 -8 -26.5  water from the final wash is reused for the next-to-last wash and so on until the water reaches the first wash stage, after which it is discharged. This technique is useful for washing after continuous dyeing, printing, desizing, scouring, or bleaching. An important variant of the countercurrent principle is horizontal or inclined washers. Horizontal or inclined washing is more efficient because of the inherent countercurrent nature of water f low within the process. The mechanical construction of an inclined or horizontal countercurrent washer has to be much better than a traditional ver tical washer, ho w e v e r. Sloppy roll settings, weak or undersized rolls, unevenness, bends, bows, biases, bearing play, or other misalignments within the machine are much more important in a horizontal or inclined washer because the weight of water pressing down on the fabric can cause it to sag, balloon, or stretch. If properly constructed and maintained, horizontal or inclined washers can produce high-quality fabrics while saving money and water.  Reducing Carryover  Because the purpose of washing is to reduce the amount of impurities in the substrate, as much water as possible must be removed between sequential washing steps in multistage washing operations. Water cont aining cont aminants that is not removed is carried over into the next step, contributing to washing inefficiency. Proper draining in batch drop/fill washing and proper extraction between steps in the continuous washing process are important. Often, 350 percent owg is carried over in typical drop/fill procedures. This amount can be reduced in some batch machines (e.g., yarn package dyeing, stock dyeing) by using compressed air or vacuum blowdown between washing steps. In continuous washing operations, squeeze rolls or vacuum extractors typically extract water between steps. Equipment employing vacuum technology to reduce dragout and carr yover of chemical solutions with cloth, stock, or yarn is used to increase washing efficiency in multistage washing operations. 5   In one case histor y, a processor installed vacuum slots after each wash box in an existing multistage continuous washing line and was able to reduce the number of boxes from eight to three . Wash boxes with built-in vacuum extractors are available for purchase, as well as washers for prints that combine successive spray and vacuum slots without any bath for the fabric to pass through. Because the fabric is never submerged, bleeding, marking off, and staining of grounds is minimized, and water use decreases. Another washer configuration with internal recycling capabilities is the ver tical counterf low washer, which sprays recirculated water onto the fabric and uses rollers to squeeze waste through the fabric into a sump, here it is filtered and recirculated. The filter is unique, consisting of continuous loops of polyester fabric that rotate continuously and are cleaned of filtrate at one end with a spray of clean water. This construction allows for maximum removal of suspended solids from water before discharge or reuse in another process. High-efficiency washing with low water use results. Energy use decreases greatly because less water must be heated.  in excessive cleanup. Poor scheduling and mix planning also can require excessive cleanup and lead to unnecessar y cleaning of equipment like machines and mix tanks. Leaks and spills should be reported and repaired promptly. Equipment maintenance, especially maintenance of washing equipment, is essential. Inappropriate work practices waste significant amounts of water, and good procedures and training are important. When operations are controlled manually, an operations audit checklist is helpful for operator reference, training, and retraining. In one case histor y, a knitting mill experienced excessive water use on beck dyeing machines. A study of operating practices revealed that each operator was filling the machines to a different level. Some operators filled the becks to a depth of 16 inches, others as much as 24 inches. Also, the amount of water used for washing varied. Some operators used an over f low procedure, and others used drop/fill or half baths (repeatedly draining half of the bath, then refilling it). Inspection of the written procedures showed that the fill step simply said fill. The wash step simply said wash. Without training and without a specific operating procedure, operators were left to determine water use on their own. This case may seem extreme, but even the best mills, which have well-documented production procedures, often do not have documented cleaning procedures. Cleaning operations that contribute large amounts of pollution to the total waste stream include machine cleaning, screen and squeegee cleaning, and drum washing.  Reuse for Cleaning Purposes  In many types of operations, washwater can be reused for cleaning purposes. In printing, cleanup activities can be per formed with used washwater, including: n n n n Backgray blanket washing Screen and squeegee cleaning Color shop cleanup Equipment and facility cleaning  A typical preparation department may also reuse wash water as follows: n n n n n Reuse scour rinses for desizing Reuse mercerizer washwater for scouring Reuse bleach washwater for scouring Reuse water-jet loom washwater for desizing Recycle kier drains to saturator  Engineering Controls  Work Practices  Workers can greatly inf luence water use. Sloppy chemical handling and poor housekeeping can result 6  Ever y mill should have moveable water meters that can be installed on individual machines to document water use and evaluate improvements. In practice, mills rarely measure water use but rely on manufacturers claims concerning equipment and water use. The manufacturers estimates are useful starting points for evaluating water consumption, but the actual performance of equipment depends on the chemical system used and the substrate. Therefore, water use is situation-specific and should be measured on-site for accurate results. The water meters should be regularly maintained and calibrated.   Other important engineering controls, some of which have been discussed in other sections of this chapter, include: n Flow control on washers n Flow control on cooling water (use minimum necessar y) n Countercurrent washing n High extraction to reduce dragout n Recycle and reuse n Detection and repair of leaks n Detection and repair of defective toilets and water coolers Machiner y should be inspected and improved where possible to facilitate cleaning and to reduce susceptibility to fouling. Bath ratios sometimes can be reduced by using displacers that result in lower chemical requirements for pH control as well as lower water use.  Processing Bath Reuse  Wa t er from many pr ocesses can be r enovat ed fo r reuse by a variety of methods. Several research ef for ts are under way. In a fe w operations, up to 50 percent of the treated wastewater is recycled directly back from the ef f luent t o the raw-water intake system with no adverse effects on production. In some cases, specific types of wastewater can be recycled within a process or department. Examples are dyebath reuse, bleach bath reuse, final rinse reuse as a loading bath for the next lot, washwater reuse, countercurrent washing, and reuse for other purposes.  Bleach Bath Reuse  Process Changes Pad-Batch Dyeing In pad-batch dyeing, prepared fabric is padded with a solution of fiber reactive dyestuff and alkali, then stored (or batched) on rolls or in boxes and covered with plastic film to prevent evaporation of water or absorption of carbon dioxide from the air. The fabric then is batched for two to 12 hour s. Washing can be done on whatever equipment is available in the mill. Pad-batch dyeing of fe rs sever al significant advantages, primarily cost and waste reduction, simplicity, and speed. Production of between 75 and 150 yards per minute, depending on the construction and weight of the goods involved, is common. Also, pad-batch dyeing is f l exible compared with a continuous range. Either wovens or knits can be dyed in many constructions. Frequent changes of shade present no problems because reactives remain water soluble, making cleanup easy. This method of dyeing is useful when ver satility is required. Water use typically decreases from 17 gallons per pound to 1.5 gallons per pound, a reduction of more than 90 percent.  Cotton and cotton blend preparation (e.g., desizing, scouring, bleaching) are performed using continuous or batch processes and usually are the largest water consumers in a mill. Continuous processes are much easier to adapt to wastewater recycling/reuse because the wastestream is continuous, shows fairly constant characteristics, and usually is easy to segregate from other waste streams. Waste-stream reuse in a typical bleach unit for polyester/cotton and 100-percent cotton fabrics would include: n Recycling J-box and kier drain wastewater to saturators n Using countercurrent washing n Recycling continuous scour washwater to batch scouring n Recycling washer water to back gray blanket washing n Recycling washer water to screen and squeegee cleaning n Recycling washer water to color shop cleanup n Recycling washer water to equipment and facility cleaning n Reusing scour rinses for desizing n Reusing mercerizer washwater for scouring Preparation chemicals (including optical brighteners and tints), however, must be selected in such a way that reuse does not create quality problems such as spotting. 7   Batch scouring and bleaching are less easy to adapt to recycling of waste streams because streams occur intermittently, drains generally go into pits and are not easily segregated, and batch preparation steps frequently are combined. With appropriate holding tanks, however, bleach bath reuse can be practiced in a similar manner to dyebath reuse, and several pieces of equipment are now available that have the necessar y holding t anks. The spent bleach bath contains all of the alkali and heat necessar y for the next bleaching operation. Peroxide and chelates must be added to reconstitute the bath. Like dyebath reuse, the number of reuse cycles in bleach bath reuse is limited by impurity buildup. The main impurities are metals, such as iron, that can interfere with the bleaching reaction. New types of rope bleaching units for knits featuring six to 12-stage jet transpor t systems have made continuous bleaching of most knit styles possible. These units were introduced in the late 1970s and typically produce 40 pounds per minute of knit fabric or more than one million pounds per month based on a three-shift, six-day operation. These machines have become ver y popular with large knit processors  because of their f lexibility and ability to conser ve energy, water, and chemicals. They also have complete built-in countercurrent capabilities. These units are being promoted for use in af ter washing fiber reactive and other types of dyes (e.g., after padbatch dyeing) in addition to use as continuous knit preparation ranges.  Final Rinse Reuse as Loading Bath for Next Lot  One simple technique that saves water and, in some cases, BOD loading is to reuse the final bath from one dyeing cycle to load the next lot. This technique works well in situations where the same shade is being repeated or where the dyeing machine is fairly clean. A good example of this technique is acid dyeing of nylon hosier y. The final bath usually contains an emulsified softener that exhausts onto the substrate, leaving the emulsifier in the bath. This technique can ser ve as the wetting agent for loading the next batch, thus saving the water, heat, and wetting agent and associated BOD.

In 2001, the estimated value1 of nonfuel raw mineral production for Tennessee was $708 million, based upon preliminary U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) data. This was about a 5% decrease from that of 20002 and followed a 2.6% increase from 1999 to 2000. Tennessee was 21st in rank (20th in 2000) among the 50 States in total nonfuel mineral production value, of which the State accounted for nearly 2% of the U.S. total. Crushed stone has been Tennessee's leading mineral commodity, by value, for more than 25 years, except for 1981 when zinc was first. In 2001, crushed stone accounted for about one-half of the State's total nonfuel mineral production value. Zinc was the second leading nonfuel mineral, followed by portland cement, construction sand and gravel, and ball clay. In 2000, these rankings were the same, but zinc, with an increase of more than $35 million compared with that of 1999, had the greatest affect on the State's nonfuel mineral economy. Portland cement and industrial sand and gravel were up about $2 million each and lime was up $1million. The largest decreases in value occurred for crushed stone, down $11 million; construction sand and gravel, down $6.1 million; and fuller 's earth, down slightly more than $3 million (table 1). All other changes were small relative to these. Compared with USGS estimates of the quantities produced in the 50 States in 2001, Tennessee remained the leading gemstone and ball-clay-producing State, 2d in zinc, 3d of 3 barite-producing States, 8th in fuller 's earth, 10th in industrial sand and gravel, and a significant producer of crushed stone, portland cement, and lime (descending order of value). Primary aluminum and raw steel were produced in Tennessee but were processed from materials obtained from other domestic and foreign sources. The State rose in rank to eighth from ninth in the production of primary aluminum. The terms ""nonfuel mineral production"" and related ""values"" encompass variations in meaning, depending upon the minerals or mineral products. Production may be measured by mine shipments, mineral commodity sales, or marketable production (including consumption by producers) as is applicable to the individual mineral commodity. All 2001 USGS mineral production data published in this chapter are preliminary estimates as of August 2002 and are expected to change. For some mineral commodities, such as construction sand and gravel, crushed stone, and portland cement, estimates are updated periodically.

Data for 2001 are preliminary and are expected to change; related rankings may also change. TENNESSEE--2001 1  The Tennessee Division of Geology provided the following narrative information.3 By the end of 2001, a total of 326 nonfuel mineral operations had permits to mine in 82 counties across the State. Ball clay was mined in Carroll, Weakly, Henry, and Gibson Counties in northwest Tennessee by Old Hickory Clay Co., H. C. Spinks Co., Unimin Corp. (United Clays Inc.), Gleason Brick Co., and Kentucky-Tennessee Clay Co. Unimin's Carroll County mine also produced kaolinite. General Shale Products Corp. operated eight shale mines in Washington, Sullivan, Knox, and Anderson Counties in northeast Tennessee to supply its brick production plants. Additional shale mining occurred in Hamilton and Marion Counties in southeast Tennessee. Fuller 's earth was mined in Hardeman County by Moltan Co. and in Henry County by American Colloid Co. Construction sand and gravel was produced at 91 sites located in 30 counties and operated by 63 different companies. Companies operating five or more sites included Ford Construction Co., Memphis Stone and Gravel Co., and Standard Construction Co. in District 1 (west Tennessee) and Bradley Stone and Sand Inc. in the eastern part of District 2 (middle Tennessee). The crushed stone industry produces limestone and dolomite at 151 active quarries and underground mines located primarily in District 2 (middle Tennessee) and District 3 (east Tennessee). Crushed limestone and dolomite was produced in 66 counties by 48 different companies and 18 county highway departments. The top three producers were Vulcan Materials Co., which operated 39 quarries in 29 counties; Rogers Group Inc., which operated 31 quarries in 27 counties; and Asarco Inc. (American Limestone Co.), which operated 9 quarries in 5 counties. Crushed granite and quartzite were produced in three quarries in Johnson County. Holston Limestone was quarried for dimension stone in Blount County by Tennessee Marble Co. and Tennessee Valley Marble Inc. Quartzitic sandstone was quarried on the Cumberland Plateau for dimension sandstone, flagstone, and ashlar. Six companies operated seven quarries in Cumberland, Bledsoe, Rhea, and Morgan Counties. Tennessee's gem industry is located in Benton County. American Shell Co. and Tennessee Shell Co. harvested mollusk shells from the Tennessee River for seeds in the cultured pearl industry. American Pearl Co. runs the only freshwater pearl farm in the United States, which cultivates approximately 250,000 mussels each season. In other industrial minerals, Yates Construction Co. operated two industrial-grade open pit barite mines in McMinn County. Gypsum was produced from Tennessee Valley Authority 3 Peter Lemiszki, Chief Geologist with the Tennessee Division of Geology in Knoxville, authored the text of the State mineral industry information submitted by that agency..  45.1   byproducts at the Allied Custom Gypsum plant in Stewart County. Industrial sand was mined in Hawkins County by Short Mountain Silica Co. and in Benton County by Unimin Corp. Bowater Southern Paper Corp. in McMinn County produced high-calcium quicklime, and Global Stone Tenn-Luttrell Inc. in Union County produced high-calcium quicklime and hydrated lime. In the metals sectors, ASARCO Incorporated operated the Coy, Immel, and Young Mines in Jefferson and Knox Counties. Because of sluggish market conditions, zinc mining and processing operations were suspended in mid-November 2001. A total of 360 workers were laid off, but a small staff remained to continue processing agricultural lime from existing production byproducts and for care and maintenance. The Coy and Young Mines also produced a small amount of lead.  Pasminco Ltd. operated mines at Clinch Valley (mine and mill) (Grainger County) and Gordonsville (Smith County) and an electrolytic zinc plant in Clarksville (Montgomery County). The Clarksville zinc plant produced primary cadmium as a byproduct during roasting and leaching of the zinc concentrate. The mines at and near Gordonsville, the Cumberland, Elmwood, and Gordonsville Mines, are all connected underground and hoist ore through one shaft. The first two are close together and are the oldest; the newer Cumberland Mine is 11 kilometers away and mills ore from the other two mines. These mines have produced some of the highest grade zinc concentrate in the world and are among the largest sources of germanium. The mines also produced agricultural limestone, crushed stone, and masonry sand.

GX016-07-8515982	"PNL-10717    Part 1 of 2   A Review of Information Useful for Managing Aging in Nuclear Power Plants               4 Reactor Coolant Pressure Boundary       The reactor coolant pressure boundary (RCPB) is defined in 10 CFR 50.2 as  those pressure-containing components, such as pressure vessels, piping, pumps, and valves, which are :      (1)  Part of the reactor coolant system, or       (2)  Connected to the reactor coolant system, up to and including any and all of the following :      (a)  The outermost containment isolation valve in system piping which penetrates primary reactor containment,       (b)  The second of two valves normally closed during normal reactor operation in system piping which does not         penetrate primary reactor containment,         (c)  The reactor coolant system safety and relief valves .         For BWRs, the reactor coolant system extends to and includes the outermost containment isolation valve in the main steam and feedwater piping .       The entire RCPB is composed of leaktight components to ensure that all radioactivity is confined inside the boundary.       The designation of NRC Quality Group A is exclusively reserved for components that are part of the RCPB; these must meet the requirements for ASME Class 1 components as set forth in Section III of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, except where specifically exempted by the provisions of 10 CFR 50.55a.       This chapter is devoted to a review of aging degradation of RCPB components; individual sections address aging of PWR piping, valves, and fittings; BWR piping, valves, and fittings; coolant pumps; steam generator tubes (PWR); and pressurizers (PWR). Aging degradation of BWR and PWR pressure vessels (including inlet and outlet nozzles) is reviewed in Chapter 2.       Cast austenitic-ferritic (duplex)  stainless steel (SS) loses some tensile ductility (becomes more brittle) but gains ultimate and yield strength, when aged at elevated temperatures; this process, which is known as thermal embrittlement, also increases the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature (DBTT) of duplex SSs. These changes are slow at normal  LWR coolant temperatures; however, there is concern that, if the piping is subjected to a thermal or mechanical shock when it is operating at a temperature below the DBTT, it may suffer a catastrophic failure by brittle fracture.       Chopra (1994) provides the most recent information on thermal embrittlement of cast SS components of the RCPB.           4.1 PWR Piping, Valves, and Fittings       This section addresses the aging degradation of carbon steel and SS components that comprise the PWR  coolant pressure boundary (CPB). The review covers piping, pipe fittings, and pressure-containing components of in-line and pressure relief valves in the  reactor coolant (RC),  chemical and volume control (CVC),  residual heat removal/low-pressure safety injection (RHR/LPSI), and  high-pressure safety injection (HPSI) systems, and the safety injection tank/core flood sub-system. The reactor coolant piping contains the high-pressure water that circulates through the reactor core to remove the heat generated by the fission process. The heated water exits from the reactor vessel and passes through the coolant loop piping to the  steam generators (SGs). Here it gives up heat to the feedwater to generate steam for the turbine generator. The cycle is completed when the water is pumped by the  reactor coolant pumps (RCPs) back to the reactor vessel. The  Nuclear Steam Supply System (NSSS) of a PWR plant consists of a reactor and 2, 3, or 4 closed coolant loops connected parallel to the reactor vessel, each loop containing 1 or 2 RCPs and a SG. The number of loops and the number of RCPs per loop is dependent on the specific plant and the NSSS vendor design. Figure 4.1 shows the layout for a typical two-loop Combustion Engineering plant. The system is contained entirely within the containment building. The main RC piping in Westinghouse plants is primarily made of cast SS, while  Babcock and Wilcox (B&W) uses carbon steel with weld-deposited SS cladding, and  Combustion Engineering (CE) uses carbon steel with roll-bonded SS cladding (Shah and MacDonald 1993, p. 150).       The CVC system controls the volume, purity, and boric acid content of the reactor coolant. The CVC system also provides seal injection water for the reactor coolant pumps. A bypass stream of reactor coolant is continuously purified to control the purity of the reactor coolant and the boric acid concentration. In B&W and CE units, the CVC system also supplies the emergency boration function.       The RHR/LPSI system performs several functions during the various states of reactor operation. Its primary functions are to remove heat from the reactor core during normal shutdown and to provide injection cooling of the core during a  loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA), and post-LOCA conditions. The RHR/LPSI system generally consists of two trains; however, one Westinghouse plant uses three trains. Each train of the two-train design has a 100% capacity and is redundant to the other train. The three-train-designed plant requires two of the three trains to operate in order to accomplish its function. Each train consists of a pump and a heat exchanger with their associated valves. The pumps can be aligned to draw suction from the borated refueling water storage tank, the containment sump, or a hot leg (or legs) of the RC system.       Figure 4.2 shows a diagram of the HPSI system; the system is designed to operate during small LOCAs when reactor coolant pressure has not been significantly reduced. In this circumstance, the HPSI system injects borated water into the reactor coolant system to provide cooling to limit core damage and fission product release and to ensure an adequate shutdown margin. The HPSI system has two or three redundant trains, depending on the NSSS vendor. A typical train consists of a high-head pump that draws suction from the refueling water storage tank and discharges to the cold legs of the RC system.       The safety injection tank/core flood subsystem is a passive system that requires no external signal or power source to operate. It is designed to rapidly inject cooling water into the reactor vessel when vessel pressure is reduced by a LOCA; check valves prevent activation until pressure falls below a predetermined level, then nitrogen gas pressure provides the driving force for coolant injection. [The point of connection to the cold legs or directly into the reactor pressure vessel depends on the NSSS vendor. Both Westinghouse and CE units have cold leg connections; in B&W units the connections are to the LPI/CFT penetration into the reactor vessel.]                    Figure  4.1 Typical two-loop Combustion Engineering reactor coolant system (Cloud and Server 1987)           4.1.1 Aging Degradation Concerns and Mechanisms       Aging degradation concerns and mechanisms for PWR coolant piping are summarized in Table 4.1. The primary mechanisms of concern are thermal embrittlement and fatigue. The reactor coolant piping, valves, and fittings of a number of plants use cast SSs. Although no problems have been reported, there have been two areas of concern for the long-term fracture integrity of cast SS components. These are (i) the substantial loss of fracture toughness caused by thermal aging                 Figure  4.2 Diagram of a PWR high pressure injection system (Blahnik et al. 1992)         Table  4.1 Aging Degradation Concerns and Mechanisms for PWR CPB Piping, Valves, and Fittings                Components        Materials        Aging Concerns        Aging Mechanisms        References a          RC, CVC, RHR/LPSI, and HPSI piping and valves    Cast SS    Increase in ductile-to-brittle transition temperature    Thermal embrittlement    pp. 161-172        Shielded metal-arc welds in austenitic SS        Carbon steel with austenitic SS cladding; Austenitic SS; Cast SS    Crack initiation and growth    Thermal and mechanical fatigue    pp. 157-161        Safety and relief valve flanges and bolts    Steel    Leakage    Boric acid corrosion; Wear    Notice 86-108; Generic Letter 88-05              Bolts and nuts    Steel    Leakage    Stress relaxation; corrosion        Crack initiation and growth    Stress corrosion cracking    Bulletin 89-02; Notice 94-55        Integral supports    Steel    Loss of support    Fatigue    pp. 157-161        a Unless otherwise noted, the references are to pages of Shah and MacDonald (1993).                 of cast materials, and (ii) the difficulty of using ultrasonic methods to detect cracks in these materials because of their coarse grained microstructures. These factors lead to possible catastrophic fractures due to large flaws dating from either fabrication or from yet unknown forms of service degradation. Should these flaws go undetected for long periods of time, they could propagate and rupture the component if the fracture toughness eventually decreased to a critical level or if the stresses increased above normal levels during a severe accident event such as an earthquake. The thermal embrittlement degradation mechanism causes a loss in tensile ductility (decrease in residual elongation) and increases the  DBTT when cast SS is aged at elevated temperatures. The consequence of this factor is a possible failure by brittle fracture (as opposed to ductile rupture) should the piping be subjected to thermal or mechanical shock when operating at a temperature below the DBTT.       Welds generally have a lower initial fracture toughness than the base metal before thermal exposure due to the presence of inclusions or flaws. Generally, the failure is controlled more by the inclusions than by the aging mechanism. However it appears that there may be a synergistic interaction between the embrittled ferrite phase and inclusions in the shielded metal arc welds that could result in potential problems.       Stress corrosion cracking, corrosion, and erosion/corrosion have not been, and are not expected to become, mechanisms of concern for the internal surfaces of components considered in this section (Shah and MacDonald 1993, pp. 172-173); however, leakage of coolant onto hot external surfaces has resulted in boric acid corrosion; for susceptible material, it could also result in external stress corrosion cracking.       Piping systems in older plants were designed to the Power Piping Code, which did not specifically require fatigue usage evaluation. Furthermore, on-line monitoring of cyclic loading on the piping was not implemented in many plants. Therefore the fatigue evaluations are either non-existent or inaccurate because of inadequate data. Cumulative fatigue usage evaluations per the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code require that usage factors be calculated for the maximum stress range and for progressively smaller stress ranges and then summed. The largest stress ranges are typically produced by combinations of pressure and thermal transient conditions occurring at different times in the operating history of the plant. Thus the accuracy of the resulting cumulative usage factors is a complex function of the accuracy of the operating history, including normal temperature and pressure cycles, vibratory loads, and stresses imposed by abnormal occurrences (such as water hammer, stratified flow, and seismic events). The fatigue design criterion in the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code is intended to ensure that safety margins used to design and license the plants are maintained, and the breach of primary pressure boundary is not seriously compromised by fatigue. This criterion requires that the cumulative fatigue usage be below unity. An increase in the value of the cumulative usage factor to values over unity (due to long-term aging) would indicate the likelihood of initiation of fatigue cracks, which would then grow due to the cyclic loadings causing a fatigue failure.       The original design of the RCPB piping has proven to be adequate to the extent that there have been no failures or reported occurrence of cracking that was attributed to fatigue of RCPB piping. However, this does not guarantee that fatigue damage will continue to be a non-problem for RCPB piping. In general, most of the actual transients including normal shutdowns and scrams result in significantly slower rates of temperature change than specified in the original plant design basis for the RCPB piping. Therefore these transients do not contribute significantly to the overall fatigue damage. However, the fatigue damage in RCPB piping systems can be significantly increased by changes in loading conditions not anticipated in the design phase: flow- and equipment-induced vibrations, stratified flow conditions, and water or steam hammer events. In addition to producing fatigue damage, severe water or steam hammer events have resulted in deformation and cracking of FW piping and pipe support structures.       There have been several instances of corrosion of RCPB components where leakage of primary water resulted in the concentration of boric acid; some of these incidents were reviewed in Notice 86-108, and additional information was provided in Generic Letter 88-05.       Instances of stress corrosion cracking of valve bolting were reviewed in Bulletin 89-02; more recently, SSC of power-operated relief valves has been reported (Notice 94-55). Similar problems have been reported in regard to bolting of reactor coolant pumps (see Section 4.3); in all cases, these degraded components were made of SSs that are very susceptible to SCC.           4.1.2 Managing Aging Degradation       A summary of options for managing aging degradation of PWR coolant piping is provided in Table 4.2.       Accurate records, regarding the number, type, and severity of transients that cause fatigue damage, should be maintained and analyzed to estimate remaining fatigue life of the piping. Piping system design, operating procedures, and maintenance practices should be critically examined with the aim of reducing the number and severity of fatigue-producing transients. For example, piping layout should minimize the potential for water hammer or thermal stratification to occur; the causes of flow-induced and mechanical vibrations should be identified and corrected, if possible. Reliability-centered maintenance practices should be instituted to reduce the number and severity of thermal cycles associated with equipment-related shutdowns.       The data needed to determine up-to-date usage factors can in most cases be retrieved from the available records. Detailed data searches need to be completed for individual plants throughout their prior history in order to define the actual transient loading conditions which produce fatigue damage. Although the design Stress Report can potentially identify critical locations in terms of fatigue usages, the calculation of stress ranges for the purpose of updating usages should incorporate changes in the transient conditions and differences in the mechanical constraints in the system in relation to the original design.         Table  4.2 Managing Aging Degradation of PWR CPB Piping, Valves, and Fittings                Components        Materials        Aging Mechanisms        Management Options        References          RC, CVC, RHR/LPSI, and HPSI piping and valves    Cast SS    Thermal embrittlement    Analysis of plant operating records; metallurgical examinations    ASME Section XI, Subsection IWB and Table IWB-2500-1        Shielded metal-arc welds in austenitic SS         Carbon steel with austenitic SS cladding; Austenitic SS; Cast SS    Thermal and mechanical fatigue    Ultrasonic examination; Radiographic examination        Safety and relief valve flanges and bolts    Steel    Boric acid corrosion    Wear    Visual examination; Ultrasonic examination; Repair; Replacement    ASME Section XI, Subsection IWB and Table IWB-2500-1        Bolts and nuts    Steel    Stress relaxation; corrosion; Stress corrosion cracking    Visual examination; Ultrasonic examination, Replacement        Integral supports    Steel    Fatigue    Analysis of plant operating records                   4.2  BWR Piping, Valves, and Fittings        This section addresses aging degradation of carbon steel and SS components that comprise the RCPB of BWRs. The review covers piping, pipe fittings, and pressure-containing components of in-line and pressure relief valves in the recirculation,  main steam (MS),  feedwater (FW),  reactor core isolation cooling (RCIC),  residual heat removal/low-pressure coolant injection (RHR/LPCI),  high-pressure coolant injection (HPCI),  high-pressure core spray (HPCS), and  low-pressure core spray (LPCS) systems. Aging degradation of pressure vessels and the pressure-containing components of the recirculation pumps, which are also part of the RCPB, is addressed in Chapter 2 and Section 4.3, respectively.        The BWR recirculation system pumps reactor coolant through the core. This is accomplished by two recirculation loops that are external to the reactor vessel but inside the containment. A constant flow rate is maintained by either variable speed pumps (BWR-3 and BWR-4 designs) or a flow control valve (BWR-5 and BWR-6 designs). A typical recirculation loop (in newer BWRs) contains four  motor-operated valves (MOVs) and one hydraulically operated valve, a recirculation pump, and twelve jet pumps (Big Rock Point, Nine Mile Point-1, and Oyster Creek-1 do not have jet pumps). The jet pumps are not part of the RCPB but are addressed in Section 3.2, BWR Internals.       Figure 4.3 shows a simplified schematic of a typical BWR main steam system. The MS system transports steam from the RPV to the turbine generator. Depending on the design, two to four steam lines may be used.       The pressure-containing components of the main steam system up to the  main steam isolation valves (MSIV) are part of the RCPB; these include the main steam lines, the pressure relief valves, and the MSIVs, which are usually pneumatically actuated.        The condensate from the turbines is returned to the RPV by the FW system, forming a closed loop during normal operation. Each FW line contains two check valves that provide containment isolation and are part of the RCPB. The RCIC system provides makeup water to the RPV during shutdown and when the vessel is isolated from the main condenser. The RCIC system's primary source of water is the condensate storage tank. The secondary source is the suppression pool. Valves may also be aligned to provide water from the RHR/LPCI system. A steam turbine-driven pump draws suction from these three sources and discharges through a shutoff valve into the reactor vessel. Steam to operate the turbine is generated in the reactor vessel by decay heat in the reactor core. The RHR/LPCI, HPCI, HPCS, and LPCS are emergency core cooling systems that are designed to mitigate the consequences of postulated emergency situations that could result in core damage and the release of fission products to the environment.       The RHR/LPCI system performs several functions during the various states of reactor operation. Its primary function is to remove heat from the reactor core during normal shutdown (shutdown cooling mode), LOCA, and post-LOCA conditions (coolant injection mode). Figures 4.4 and 4.5 show the flow paths for these two modes of operation. The RHR/LPCI system may also assist in containment heat removal and containment spray operations.       The BWR-1 to BWR-5 designs use a HPCI system to maintain coolant inventory while the pressure is above that at which the RHR/LPCI or LPCS systems can operate. Water from the condensate storage tank or the suppression pool is pumped through a series of check valves into the FW line to the RPV.                 Figure  4.3 Simplified schematic of BWR main steam system (Ware, Shah, and Buescher 1989)                 Figure  4.4 Flow path during operation of RHR system in shutdown cooling mode (Lofaro et al. 1989)            Figure  4.5 Flow path during operation of RHR system in coolant injection mode (Lofaro et al. 1989)       In the BWR-6 design, a HPCS system replaces the HPCI system of the older designs. Makeup water is discharged through spray nozzles onto the reactor core, rather than through the FW lines.       The function of the LPCS system is to help prevent fuel damage in the event a LOCA occurs that might uncover the reactor core. The system contains a single independent pump that draws suction from the suppression pool and discharges through a series of check valves into the low-pressure spray sparger over the reactor core.       Because of the number of different BWR product lines and variations between plants, this discussion does not describe all the features of each plant. In general, all the equivalent systems described above are included in the aging management of BWRs. For instance, the BWR-2 design incorporated the Emergency Feedwater and Core Spray systems. The BWR-3 design added LPCI. Each generation added or replaced systems that perform the ECCS functions. The equivalent piping/valves/fittings are to be considered for management of aging. All of the functions of the RHR system including Shutdown Cooling and Containment Spray, whether a part of RHR or not, should be subject to a comprehensive aging management program.           4.2.1 Aging Degradation Concerns and Mechanisms       Aging degradation concerns and mechanisms for BWR CPB piping, valves, and fittings are summarized in Table 4.3. All piping and pipe fittings are either carbon steel or austenitic SS; cast pipe or pipe fittings were not used in BWR CPB systems.            Table 4.3 Aging Degradation Concerns and Mechanisms  for BWR CPB Piping, Valves, and Fittings                Components        Materials        Aging Concerns        Aging Mechanisms        References a          MS and FW pipe and in-line valves    Carbon steel    Wall thinning    Erosion-corrosion    p. 680; Notice 92-35; Notice 93-21        MS, FW,RCIC, RHR/LPCI, HPCI, HPCS, and LPCS pipe and in-line valves    Carbon steel    Crack initiation and growth    Fatigue due to thermal transients, vibration, and pressure    pp. 805-811; Notice 91-38; Notice 92-50        Recirculation, RHR/LPCI, HPCS, and LPCS pipe and valves    Austenitic SS; Cast SS valves    Crack initiation and growth    Intergranular stress corrosion cracking    pp. 679-680; Bulletin 83-02        Crack initiation and growth    Transgranular stress corrosion cracking    p. 680        Recirculation, RHR/LPCI, HPCS, and LPCS valves    Cast SS    Crack initiation and growth    Thermal fatigue    pp. 805-811        Increase in ductile-to-brittle transition temperature    Thermal embrittlement    pp. 680-681        Valve flanges    Steel    Leakage    Wear        Nuts and bolts    Carbon steel    Leakage    Stress relaxation             Integral supports    Steel    Crack initiation and growth    Thermal and mechanical fatigue        a Unless otherwise noted, the references are to pages of Shah and MacDonald (1993).                 Wall thinning due to erosion-corrosion has been a major problem for carbon steel pipe in the MS and FW systems (Notice 92-35, Notice 93-21). A small section of FW piping in LaSalle Unit 1 also developed leaks due to localized erosion; however, this occurrence was due to a design deficiency and should not be of concern at other plants.       Carbon steel piping is also susceptible to degradation from fatigue, primarily due to thermal stratification and flow-induced vibrations. In particular, thermal stratification resulted in several instances of fatigue cracks developing in FW piping; the history of these incidents is outlined in Notice 91-38. Thermal fatigue has also resulted in cracking of cast steel valve bodies (Notice 92-50).       Intergranular stress corrosion cracking (IGSCC) of wrought austenitic SS has been a recurring problem for BWRs (Bulletin 83-02). Changes in water chemistry, thermal and mechanical treatments to eliminate tensile stress at sensitized surfaces, and replacement of BWR piping with steels that are less susceptible to IGSCC, as recommended by Hazelton and Koo (1988), have eliminated most of the concern. However, the potential still exists for IGSCC to occur under some circumstances, and there is some question as to whether the rate of crack growth is independent of the incubation period.       Transgranular stress corrosion cracking (TGSCC) has not yet been a problem for operating plants; however, laboratory results show that it can be initiated by coolant impurities, and once started, the cracks continue to grow, even in Type 316NG. Therefore, maintaining high water purity is a good preventive practice.        Thermal embrittlement or IGSCC has not caused problems for cast SS valve bodies used in BWR CPB systems. However, the local ferrite content can vary over a large range (Bogie et al. 1992) that includes the potential for localized regions with increased ferrite content to undergo an increase in the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature, while other regions with decreased ferrite content develop IGSCC (Lapides 1991).       Leakage due to wear of valve flanges or stress relaxation in nuts and bolts can result in leakage of the primary reactor coolant; if molybdenum disulfide is present as a lubricant, hydrogen sulfide can be produced and result in stress corrosion cracking of the bolting.           4.2.2 Managing Aging Degradation       The options for managing aging degradation of BWR coolant piping are summarized in Table 4.4.         Table  4.4 Managing Aging Degradation in BWR CPB Piping, Valves, and Fittings                Components        Materials        Aging Mechanisms        Management Options        References a          MS and FW pipe    Carbon steel    Erosion-corrosion    Ultrasonic examinations; Radiography    pp. 815-818; Wu 1989, Appendix A        MS and FW in-line valves    Carbon steel    Erosion-corrosion    Visual examination    ASME Section XI        MS, FW,RCIC, RHR/LPCI, HPCI, HPCS, and LPCS pipe and in-line valves    Carbon steel    Fatigue due to thermal transients, vibration, and pressure    Analysis of records of transients; Minimize transients; Ultrasonic examinations    pp. 815-818        Recirculation, RHR/LPCI, HPCS, and LPCS pipe and valves          Austenitic SS; Cast SS valves          Intergranular stress corrosion cracking    Materials-related remedies; Stress-related remedies; Hydrogen water chemistry; Temporary repairs; Replacement; Ultrasonic examination (b)    pp. 691-712; Hazelton and Koo 1988; Generic Letter 88-01        Transgranular stress corrosion cracking    Hydrogen water chemistry; impurity control; Ultrasonic examination    pp. 714-715              Recirculation, RHR/LPCI, HPCS, and LPCS valves          Cast SS          Thermal fatigue    Analysis of plant operating records        Thermal embrittlement    Analysis of plant operating records; Test specimens    pp. 680-681        Valve flanges    Steel    Wear    Visual examination; Repair; Replacement    ASME Section XI, Table IWB-2500-1                    Nuts and bolts    Carbon steel    Stress relaxation    Visual examination; Ultrasonic examination; Replacement        Integral supports    Steel    Thermal and mechanical fatigue    Analysis of plant operating records        a Unless otherwise noted, the references are to pages of Shah and MacDonald (1993).    b Ultrasonic not effective for cast SS valves.            Shah and MacDonald (1993) have extensively reviewed the options (countermeasures) for managing aging degradation due to IGSCC in BWR CPB piping. These options include materials-related remedies, such as solution heat treating and application of a corrosion-resistant coating (which can be done in the field); various stress-related remedies that reduce the tensile stresses in the heat-affected zones of welds; the application of hydrogen water chemistry to reduce the electrochemical potential that drives IGSCC; temporary repair actions; and replacement of degraded piping. Hazelton and Koo (1988) provide the technical basis for NRC guidance and recommendations for controlling IGSCC, detecting and evaluating pipe cracks, repair methods, and replacement of deteriorated piping. The NRC position is formally set forth in Generic Letter 88-01.        Accurate records, regarding the number, type, and severity of transients that cause fatigue damage, should be maintained and analyzed to estimate the remaining fatigue life of the piping. Piping system design, operating procedures, and maintenance practices should be critically examined with the aim of reducing the number and severity of fatigue-producing transients. For example, piping layout should minimize the potential for water hammer or thermal stratification to occur; the causes of flow-induced and mechanical vibrations should be identified and corrected, if possible; reliability-centered maintenance practices can reduce the number and severity of thermal cycles associated with equipment-related shutdowns.       The data needed to determine up-to-date usage factors can in most cases be retrieved from the available records. Detailed data searches need to be completed for individual plants throughout their prior history in order to define the actual transient loading conditions which produce fatigue damage. Although the design Stress Report can potentially identify critical locations in terms of fatigue usage, the calculation of stress ranges for the purpose of updating fatigue usage should incorporate changes in the transient conditions and differences in the mechanical constraints in the system in relation to the original design.       Replacement of carbon steel piping components with low alloy or low carbon grade austenitic SS has been used successfully to mitigate erosion-corrosion.       The initiation of TGSCC can be prevented by the application of hydrogen water chemistry and the strict control of impurities.       The effects of thermal embrittlement and IGSCC on cast SS components can be predicted if plant operating records have been maintained in sufficient detail; Chopra (1994) reviewed the fracture properties of thermally-aged cast SSs and derived correlations that can be used to predict Charpy-impact energy and fracture toughness from known material information, time, and service temperature. Chopra and Shack (1994) present the correlations and procedures recommended by Chopra (1994) in a concise, easy-to-use form. Examination of test specimens from cast SS components (such as valve bodies and piping elbows) can be used to confirm predictions.           4.3  Reactor Coolant Pumps       The reactor coolant pumps circulate the primary coolant water through the reactor coolant system. All of the pumps are of the single stage, single suction, centrifugal design, with the motor mounted above the pump. The three general types of coolant pumps are illustrated in Figures 4.6, 4.7, and 4.8. All BWR recirculation pumps are known as Type C, while PWR primary coolant pumps are either Type E or Type F. The major design difference is that Type F pumps have thicker walls than Types C or E; additional detail on pump design is given in Chapter 10, Light-Water Reactor Coolant       Figure  4.6 BWR Type C reactor coolant pump (Jaske and Shah 1990)            Figure  4.7 PWR Type E reactor coolant pump (Jaske and Shah 1990)            Figure  4.8 PWR Type F reactor coolant pump (Jaske and Shah 1990)       Pumps, of Shah and MacDonald (1993). In general, Combustion Engineering plants use Type E pumps, Westinghouse plants use Westinghouse-manufactured Type F pumps, while Babcock and Wilcox plants may use either Type E or Type F pumps; Drahos, Server, and Beaudoin (1989) provide a comprehensive listing of the type of pump used in each U.S. nuclear plant. Subcomponents that are part of the RCPB are the pump casing, cover, nozzles, seal flange, seal-cooling heat exchanger, and the closure studs and nuts.       Type F pump casings have high residual stresses at the welds and low stresses in the base metal; Types C and E have high residual stresses in both the welds and in the base metal. There is a potential for cracks to develop at the interior surface of the pump body under the combined effects of residual stresses and fatigue; however, design of the pump bodies is generally considered to be very conservative from a fatigue standpoint.           4.3.1 Aging Degradation Concerns and Mechanisms       The aging degradation concerns and mechanisms for those components of the reactor coolant pumps that are part of the RCPB are summarized in Table 4.5.         Table  4.5 Aging Degradation Concerns and Mechanisms for Reactor Coolant Pumps                Components        Materials        Aging Concerns        Aging Mechanisms        References a          Pump casing; Cover         Cast SS    Increase in ductile-to-brittle transition temperature    Thermal embrittlement    pp. 355-356        Cast SS;    Carbon steel with SS cladding    Cracking at positions having high residual stress (Types C and E pump casings)    Thermal and mechanical fatigue    pp. 356-360        Crack initiation and growth in Type C (BWR) pump casings    Intergranular stress corrosion cracking    pp. 360-361        Wastage (PWR only)    Boric acid corrosion    p. 360        Heat exchanger    Steel    Cracking at positions having high residual stress (Types C and E pump casings)    Thermal fatigue             Seal flange    Steel    Leakage    Wear        Closure studs and nuts          Low-alloy steel          Leakage    Stress relaxation        Bolting failure    Boric acid corrosion (PWR pumps only); Stress corrosion cracking    p. 360;    Notice 90-68        a Unless otherwise noted, the references are to pages of Shah and MacDonald (1993).            The casings and covers of reactor coolant pumps are fabricated from either static-cast SS or carbon steel that is internally clad with SS. Cast SS pump sections are joined by welding with ferrite-controlled filler material. Cast austenitic-ferritic (duplex) SS loses ductility (becomes more brittle), but also gains strength, when aged at elevated temperatures. The mechanism that produces these changes, which occurs slowly at normal LWR coolant temperatures, is referred to as thermal embrittlement. Thermal embrittlement results in an increase in the DBTT of duplex SSs. The primary concern is that, if the pump casing is subjected to a thermal or mechanical shock when it is operating at a temperature below the DBTT, it may fail by brittle fracture, instead of yielding in a ductile mode.       Cast SS pump casings are susceptible to IGSCC in BWRs if the ferrite content is low. The local ferrite content can vary over a large range (Bogie, Alexander, and Kirk 1992); thus, it is possible that localized regions may be deficient in ferrite content. Indeed, Lapides (1991) reported the occurrence of localized IGSCC under normal BWR conditions. Type C pump casings receive a full solution anneal; this heat treatment reduces sensitization of heat-affected zones near the welds. However, if repair welding is later performed, the weld zones may also be susceptible to IGSCC.       Closure studs bolt the coolant pump cover to the casing. In PWRs, if the gasket leaks, the reactor coolant can cause boric acid corrosion of the closure studs, which are made of low-alloy steel; there have also been instances where this leakage has resulted in stress corrosion cracking (SCC) of bolts that were fabricated of Alloy A-286, an alloy that is particularly susceptible to SSC (Notice 90-68).       Coolant pump internals are susceptible to high-cycle mechanical and thermal fatigue. Failure of the pump internals will not compromise the integrity of the pressure boundary, but broken pieces could be carried into the RPV and cause damage to the reactor internals.           4.3.2 Managing Aging Degradation        Options for managing aging degradation of reactor coolant pumps are summarized in Table 4.6.         Table  4.6 Managing Aging Degradation of Reactor Coolant Pumps                Components        Materials        Aging Mechanisms        Management Options        References          Pump casing; Cover         Cast SS    Thermal embrittlement    Visual examination    Shah and MacDonald 1993, pp. 362-365;     Guy 1990;     ASME Section XI, Table IWB-2500-1        Cast SS;     Carbon steel with SS cladding    Fatigue        Intergranular stress corrosion cracking        Boric acid corrosion        Heat exchanger    Steel    Thermal fatigue        Seal flange    Steel    Wear    Visual examination; Repair    ASME Section XI, Table IWB-2500-1        Closure studs and nuts          Low-alloy steel          Stress relaxation    Visual examination;    Ultrasonic examination;    Replacement              (PWR) Boric acid corrosion; SCC            Conventional ultrasonic inspection techniques are not capable of reliably detecting cracks in the pump bodies and internals, because of the large grain size and the elastic anisotropy caused by different grain structures in the casings. Likewise, current radiographic techniques have not proven reliable for detecting cracks in the casing welds, and vibration monitoring techniques have not been capable of detecting high-cycle fatigue cracks early enough to avoid unscheduled outages. Thus, visual examination of exterior and interior surfaces during routinely scheduled inspections remains the most reliable method for detecting cracks in these components. Chopra and Shack (1994) present the correlations and procedures recommended by Chopra (1994) in a concise, easy-to-use form. Egan et al. (1987) reviewed inservice inspection techniques, and Jeong and Ammirato (1988) reviewed the use of ultrasonic techniques for the examination of welds in cast SS pump bodies.       Closure studs can be visually inspected; however, the ultrasonic cylindrically guided wave technique is capable of reliably detecting (but not sizing) both corrosion wastage and flaws that are well below the critical crack size (Light, Joshi, and Liu 1986; Liu 1993).           4.4  Steam Generator (PWR)       This section addresses the aging degradation of Alloy 600 tubes in PWR steam generators.       In PWRs, the hot primary coolant water is circulated through the steam generator tubes and heats the secondary-system water to make steam that drives the turbine generators. Figures 4.9 and 4.10 show the two types of steam generators in use for PWR plants. Westinghouse and Combustion Engineering plants use  recirculating steam generators (RSG), which generally convert about 25% of the secondary water to steam during each pass through the generators; the remainder of the water is recirculated. Babcox and Wilcox plants use  once-through steam generators (OTSG) from which only steam exits on the secondary side.        The design of the steam generators confines radionuclides from neutron activation or damaged fuel within the RCPB during normal operation. However, if a tube leaks the flow is from the primary side to the secondary side, and rupture of a tube could cause the release of radioactivity to the environment. Moreover, the sudden failure of several tubes could result in depressurization of the RCPB.       Except for recently manufactured steam generators, all tubing was made from nickel-based Alloy 600. However, as discussed by Shah and MacDonald (1993, pp. 252-255), differences in processing details and manufacturing methodologies that were employed by the different manufacturers (and, even by the same manufacturer at different periods) can significantly affect the response of the material to a given environment. Moreover, the fact that some of these differences may still be held as trade secrets complicates the task of generalizing variables that are of universal importance to an understanding of the material's behavior.           4.4.1 Aging Degradation Concerns and Mechanisms       The aging degradation concerns and mechanisms for PWR steam generator tubes are summarized in Table 4.7.       Primary water stress corrosion cracking (PWSCC) has been observed only in Westinghouse RSGs. However, most of the affected steam generator tubes had been given a relatively low-temperature mill-anneal; tubing used in Combustion            Figure  4.9 Schematic of recirculating steam generator with problem areas indicated (Malhotra 1987)       Engineering and Babcox and Wilcox SGs was given a higher-temperature mill-anneal, which makes them more resistant to PWSCC; however, PWSCC may become of increasing importance as the plants continue to age. Stress corrosion cracking also occurred on the primary side of OTSGs in Three Mile Island, Unit 1; however, this is believed to have been caused by contamination of the primary-side water (Shah and MacDonald 1993, pp. 288-289).              Figure  4.10 Schematic of once-through steam generator with problem areas indicated (Malhotra 1987)         There are two principal types of intergranular corrosion that occur on the secondary-water side of PWR steam generators,  intergranular attack (IGA) and IGSCC. Both high-temperature and low-temperature mill-annealed tubes have been affected by these mechanisms; however, to date, intergranular corrosion has not been a problem for thermally treated tubes.         Table  4.7 Aging Degradation Concerns and Mechanisms for the Steam Generator Tubes                Degradation Sites        Aging Concerns        Aging Mechanisms        References a          Primary side of steam generator tubes    Crack initiation and growth    Primary water stress corrosion cracking; Denting    pp. 271-276        Secondary side of steam generator tubes                Crack initiation and growth    Intergranular corrosion    pp. 276-279        Leakage through tube walls    Pitting    pp. 279-281        Leakage through tube walls; Reduction in fatigue strength    Fretting    pp. 283-286        U-bend regions of RSG tubes    Tube rupture    High-cycle fatigue    pp. 281-283        Secondary side of OTSG tubes          Tube wall thinning    Erosion-corrosion    p. 287        Through wall cracking    Corrosion fatigue    p. 287        a Unless otherwise noted, the references are to pages of Shah and MacDonald (1993).                 Denting is the plastic deformation of tubes resulting from the buildup of carbon steel support plate corrosion products (magnetite) in tube-to-tube support plate annuli. The buildup of nonprotective corrosion product oxides, consisting mainly of iron oxide (magnetite), leads directly to tube distortion at the support plate intersections and to distortion and cracking of the support plates. The tube distortions at the support plate intersections have resulted in numerous instances of tube leaks caused by stress corrosion cracks initiated primarily from the inside (primary side) surface of the dented tube.       Unlike most degradation mechanisms, denting usually affects large numbers of tubes at approximately the same time. The buildup and expansion of corrosion products occurs over an extended period of time, but deformation of the tubes occurs in a short period of time. The primary concern is that even small dents can induce large tensile stresses in the tubes and initiate IGSCC or PWSCC during subsequent operation.       Pitting is another SG tube aging mechanism. Once initiated, pitting can rapidly spread and result in through-wall penetration within a few operating cycles, resulting in transfer of radionuclides to the secondary-water system. This is not, however, considered a significant safety hazard because leakage is detected long before catastrophic failure could occur.       Fretting has caused operational problems for many plants with RSGs. The fretting (wear) is caused by mechanical vibration, and results in thinning of tube walls where they contact parts of the support structure. There are concerns that vibration and wear will result in the initiation and growth of fatigue cracks; however, there have been no fretting-fatigue failures to date. Only a few incidents of fretting and wear have occurred with Babcox & Wilcox OTSG tubes, and the mechanism is not considered to be of serious concern for OTSGs.       Several PWRs have experienced reactor coolant system leakage due to cracked (and failed) steam generator primary manway stud bolts. The failure of these low alloy steel bolts has been attributed to accelerated stress corrosion cracking. The cracks occur when boric acid and/or lithium hydroxide leaks past the manway gasket and interacts with the studs' molybdenum disulfide lubricant. At Maine Yankee, five of twenty primary manway studs were found to be cracked. Six other studs had completely failed. At another facility, two bolts failed while being detensioned, and a third was found to have a crack extending through about 90% of its diameter.       High-cycle fatigue has caused tube ruptures in RSGs at two plants. Such ruptures are serious because of the challenge to safety systems and the release of radioisotopes from the RCPB. However, high-cycle fatigue does not appear to be a general problem for PWR steam generators.       Erosion-corrosion has been a minor problem for a few plants with OTSGs, but the tube-wall thinning has been localized and has not lead to tube rupture. Likewise, corrosion fatigue has occurred only at a few plants having OTSGs. Therefore, neither mechanism is considered to be of serious concern.       Wastage was a problem for RSGs of plants that used phosphate water chemistry control. This method is no longer in use at U.S. nuclear plants; thus, wastage is not currently an issue of concern. One other potential concern is corrosion or fatigue cracking of welds in the steam generator shell.           4.4.2 Managing Aging Degradation       Options for managing aging degradation of PWR steam generator tubes are summarized in Table 4.8.  EPRI has funded the development of techniques for inservice inspection of steam generator tubing (Thompson and Elsley 1983).       Various techniques are available for reducing stresses on the interior (primary side) of steam generator tubes; these techniques, which include shot peening, retropeening, stress relieving by thermal treatment, and reducing the hot-leg   temperature, may significantly delay the onset of PWSCC. Plugging, sleeving, or replacing the affected tubes are the only effective repair methods. Lowenstein et al. (1991) have reviewed life assessment procedures for the steam generator tubes.         Table  4.8 Managing Aging Degradation of PWR Steam Generator Tubes                Degradation Sites        Aging Mechanisms        Management Options        References a          Primary side of steam generator tubes    Primary water stress corrosion cracking; Denting    Control of water chemistry; Various measures to reduce stresses; Inservice inspection    pp. 315-316      (b)        Secondary side of steam generator tubes    Intergranular corrosion    Control of water chemistry; Elimination of copper-bearing alloys; Chemical additives; Cleaning; Inservice inspection    pp. 311-315      (b)        Denting        Pitting        Fretting    Options are dependent on design; Inservice inspection    pp. 281-286      (b)        U-bend regions of RSG tubes    High-cycle fatigue        Secondary side of OTSG tubes          Erosion-corrosion    Plant specific; Inservice inspection    p. 287      (b)        Corrosion fatigue        a Unless otherwise noted, the references are to pages of Shah and MacDonald (1993).    b ASME Section XI, Table IWB-25004, Category B-Q.              Control of secondary water chemistry is the first line of defense against aging degradation of steam generator tubing. Extending the life of steam generators involves stringent controls on impurities (primarily chloride, iron, and copper ions) and oxygen in the secondary-side water and preventing buildup of sludge. Loss of control of water chemistry can result in significant degradation in a short period of time. Condenser leakages, resin releases from condensate polishers, and the introduction of chlorine-containing inorganics through makeup-water sources have been major contributors to the loss of water chemistry control. It has been demonstrated that certain chemical additives (e.g., boric acid and morpholine) will reduce IGA, SCC, and denting of tubes. Effects of these additives on other plant components are not well known. The guidelines established by EPRI (Wood 1993), for continuous monitoring and control of water chemistry, should be followed to reduce impurities in the secondary water.       Denting, fretting wear, and erosion-corrosion of the tubes are generally detectable during normal inservice inspection, before leakage occurs. Localized pitting and cracking (due to fretting-fatigue, stress corrosion, and some forms of intergranular attack) are more difficult to detect before leaks develop. Behravesh (1992) sets forth excellent guidelines and recommendations for inservice examinations of steam generators.       The root causes of fretting are dependent on specific design features of the steam generators; consequently, the most effective management options are also design dependent. In most cases, degradatimillon appears to be limited to a specific region (for a specific design), and plugging of the affected tubes may be an effective remedy.       Occurrences of erosion-corrosion and corrosion fatigue have been limited to a few OTSGs, and management options appear to be plant specific.        Replacement of existing steam generators with those built of more corrosion resistant alloys (such as Alloy 690) is becoming a viable alternative to avoid increasing maintenance costs, outages, or deratings. Twenty-five steam generators have been replaced at eight U.S. PWRs, making replacement less of an unknown in terms of cost, schedule, and personnel exposure (Sperber, Nelson, and Jordan 1989a, 1989b). Replacement steam generators are expected to have a longer life because of improved designs and materials. The design improvements include elimination of crevices, lower residual stresses, and improved access for secondary-side lancing and chemical cleaning. The improved materials include thermally treated Alloy 600, mill-annealed Alloy 690, and thermally treated Alloy 690 for the tubes and ferritic SS for the tube-support structures.           4.5  Pressurizer (PWR)       Figure 4.11 shows a simplified schematic of a pressurizer and the associated piping and valves. This section addresses aging degradation of the PWR pressurizer, including the associated surge and spray lines, nozzles, safe-ends, and spray heads. The primary purpose of the pressurizer is to control the reactor coolant pressure and prevent steam generation in any other part of the PWR CPB. The pressurizer is connected to the piping between the reactor vessel outlet and the steam generator inlet (hot leg). Pressure is controlled by altering the saturation temperature and pressure of the steam and water inside the pressurizer. Condensing the steam volume by spraying cooler water into it has the net effect of reducing            Figure  4.11 Simplified schematic of a pressurizer system (Siegel and Bakr 1989)         system pressure. Increasing the steam temperature by using electric heaters to heat the water volume has the effect of increasing system pressure. A system of pressure relief valves is provided to prevent overpressurizing the reactor coolant system.           4.5.1 Aging Degradation Concerns and Mechanisms       The aging degradation concerns and mechanisms for the PWR pressurizers and associated components are summarized in Table 4.9.       The primary concerns regarding the pressurizer vessel are low-cycle fatigue due to plant operational, thermal, and pressure transients and high-cycle thermal fatigue caused by rapid temperature changes. The rapid changes are caused by the impingement of spray on the pressurizer walls, movement of the liquid at the steam-water interface, and water level changes caused by insurges, outsurges, and heater actuation. Cracking through the cladding can expose the base metal (low-alloy or carbon steel) to corrosion.       Surge and spray piping can be subjected to flow stratification which results in a severe circumferential temperature gradient leading to high thermal stresses. This causes significant fatigue damage and plastic deformation (Bulletin 88-11). The interface between the hot and cold layer also oscillates leading to high cycle fatigue in surge and spray piping and nozzles.        Table  4.9 Aging Degradation Concerns and Mechanisms for PWR Pressurizers                Components        Materials        Aging Concerns        Aging Mechanisms        References a          Pressurizer vessel    Low-alloy or carbon steel with austenitic or Alloy 600 cladding; Cast SS    Loss of material     Boric acid corrosion             Crack initiation and growth    Fatigue; Stress corrosion cracking    pp. 390-393        Surge and spray lines;     Nozzles    SS; SS clad carbon- or low-alloy steel; Cast SS    Crack initiation and growth    Fatigue, possibly corrosion assisted    pp. 390-393        Spray head    Forged or cast SS; Alloy 600    Loss of spray capability    Erosion, Thermal embrittlement, Fatigue    pp. 399-400        Heater sheaths; Instrument penetrations    SS; Alloy 600    Leakage    Intergranular stress corrosion cracking, Boric acid corrosion    pp. 393-397; Notice 90-10        Manway bolts    Low-alloy steel    Bolt breakage; Leakage    Stress corrosion cracking; Stress relaxation    pp. 397-399        a Unless otherwise noted, the references are to pages of Shah and MacDonald (1993).                 Stress corrosion cracking and wear of pressurizer heater sheaths and sleeves has caused leaking of the primary coolant and loss or reduction of the spray pattern. Leaking of primary coolant can lead to stress corrosion cracking of manway bolts and corrosion of low-alloy steel in nearby components.       Leaking through the gaskets under the manhole covers subjects the bolts to a corrosive environment.           4.5.2 Managing Aging Degradation       The methods for managing aging degradation of PWR pressurizers are summarized in Table 4.10.       Analysis of fatigue life at critical locations should be performed, if adequate records have been maintained. Inservice inspection, using ultrasonic and visual techniques, is critical to ensuring that degradation of the pressurizer vessel will not limit economic life of the plant.       Leakage of coolant through heater sheaths, instrument penetrations, or manway cover gaskets should be controlled as it can result in corrosion and SCC of other components of the pressurizer system.       Molybdenum disulfide lubricant should be avoided in any location where it could be exposed to steam.          Table  4.10 Managing Aging Degradation of PWR Pressurizers                Components        Materials        Aging Mechanisms        Management Options        References          Pressurizer vessel    Low-alloy or carbon steel with austenitic or Alloy 600 cladding; Cast SS    Boric acid corrosion; Fatigue; Stress corrosion cracking     Inservice inspection; Analysis of plant records    Shah and MacDonald 1993, pp. 401-406;     ASME Section XI, Table IWB-2500-1        Surge and spray lines; Nozzles    SS; SS clad carbon- or low-alloy steel; Cast SS    Fatigue, possibly corrosion assisted        Spray head    Forged or cast SS; Alloy 600    Erosion; Thermal embrittlement; Fatigue        Heater sheaths; Instrument penetrations    SS; Alloy 600    Intergranular stress corrosion cracking; Boric acid corrosion        Manway bolts    Low-alloy steel    Stress corrosion cracking; Stress relaxation    Ultrasonic examination; Control leakage; Lubricants; Reduce preload stress    Shah and MacDonald 1993, pp. 397-399                   4.6  References       10 CFR 50.2, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, ""Definitions.""

It is hoped that teachers will use these activities as a basis for planning an experience that exposes students to knowledge and skills common to Housing, Interiors and Furnishings. This course will: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. Examine housing needs and choices for individuals and families Analyze components of housing design and construction Analyze components of interior space and planning Analyze the components of a safe and attractive environment Analyze career paths within the housing, interiors, and furnishings industry Demonstrate design and presentation skills  What does a Typical Classroom Look Like? Because this course emphasizes full-class participation, teamwork, and individual projects and/or study, there should be enough room for tables, chairs, equipment, and lab stations. Accommodations should be made for work stations with electrical outlets. There should be enough storage space to contain resources, display activities, materials, software, and unfinished projects. Both reusable and consumable instructional materials are generally used in this experience. If there is not enough money in the school budget to purchase materials, equipment, and books, outside funding and/or in-kind services may be required. Some teachers may need to develop classroom materials themselves. If so, adequate time for developing the materials should be allowed. Equipment might include an overhead projector, computers, videos/VCR's, camcorders, microcomputer courseware, and video courseware. Special locks or other security precautions may need to be taken to protect equipment. The teacher is the instructional facilitator and the manager of the classroom environment and resources. He/she helps students identify instructional goals and creative activities, moves about the classroom observing and giving assistance, and works with other teachers to plan and deliver the curriculum. The students are active rather than passive learners. They do individual and group work. They develop skills through hands-on activities, test theories, and relate and/or apply what they learn. The classroom is always alive with activity, sounds, and conversation. The purpose of this curriculum is to help students to make connections. The one condition that makes this happen is teachers planning and teaching together. Teachers can work together to integrate the curriculum.  Housing, Interiors, Furnishings: Activity/Resource Guide - 8/99  Page 1   At least one teacher on the team is vocationally certified in Family and Consumer Sciences. The teachers should regularly attend in-service activities and conferences to update and upgrade teaching and content knowledge. Internships for the instructors are recommended to keep current in business and industry techniques.  Housing, Interiors, Furnishings: Activity/Resource Guide - 8/99  Page 2   Sample Activities In addition to other activities and lessons, the following activities can be used as supplements to the curriculum framework to teach the competencies. These activities may be used as written or adapted to meet the needs and abilities of individual students. Teachers should consider other combinations and activities.

The space must have be enclosed by at least four sides. Some examples are a closet, a grocery cart, a tree, a small storage space, etc. Be creative, but be careful. Make sure you choose a space that you can move in and out of easily. Once you have selected your space take note of the activity within the space. What are the sights, smells, tastes (if any), and sounds? How does it make you feel? Are there any unusual or interesting textures?

Other fabrics may be used if so desired. SUPPLIES: Each lab group will need a pair of tweezers (to hold the fabric when being flame tested), a container of water, and a candle inserted in a beaker full of sand. PROCEDURES: 1. Describe the characteristics of the fabric swatch, how to care for the fabric, household uses, and the average cost. You may need to look up some of this information. 2. Cut a small piece from the fabric swatch to be flame tested. 3. Holding the fabric piece with the tweezers, place it in the candle flame. Observe what occurs. What was the flame like? Did it smoke? What was the odor? Were ashes produced? If so, describe them. 4. Record the results in the appropriate box on the fabric cards. 5. Attach the unburned portion of your swatch to the fabric card in the designated space.  TEACHER'S NOTE: Other experiments may be conducted such as the application of heat, rather than an open flame (using an iron) or the effects of chemicals (such as acetate) when applied to these fabrics.

Their dyes work well and do not wash out.  Tie dyeing is a craft that dates back to ancient times in China, Japan, and India. It become popular in America among the ""hippie"" generation during the 60's. The 90's somewhat a repeat of the 60's, has made tie dyeing popular again. The intent of tie dyeing in interior design is not necessarily to be a ""flower child,"" but rather to see others combine and experience a method of dyeing techniques. Dye may come from a natural source such as onion skin, beets, roots, etc. These give a muted natural color. Contemporary commercial dyes, like RIT dye will give more vibrant colors and offer a wider selection, but still are less vibrant than spray dyes that can be purchased in many categories. Natural fabrics generally dye best. Cotton is the most readily available, but silk is best for a more dedicate, intricate design. Nylon also dyes well. Light-weight fabrics tend to produce better results. You can experiment with techniques, but every design is unique and considered a work of art. It might be fun to first dye a pair of socks, then move on to a T-shirt or a broomstick skirt of matching outfit. I T-shirt, men's cotton boxers, and a pair of socks are other favorites.  Techniques Designs are created by ""tying off"" an area of fabric. The idea is to dye part of the fabric while protecting other areas to create a design. The most common method is simply scrunching a handful of fabric together and wrapping it with an elastic. Wherever the elastic is placed, the fabric will remain the original color, creating a burst of color surrounded by a line of the original color of the article. This design can be altered by placing a coin or stone inside the fabric before wrapping with the elastic. There are many, many ways to tie the fabric. Try using tape on both sides of the garment to create lettering or stripes. Designs may also be hand-stitched into the fabric, gathered together lightly and covered with plastic before dyeing to create specific designs such as hearts, stars, etc.  Housing, Interiors, Furnishings: Activity/Resource Guide - 8/99  Page 32   Bath Dyeing Prepare dye according to package directions. Place fabric in bath. Immerse all areas you desire to be dyed completely at least 10-15 minutes. Do not leave in longer than one hour. For more intense colors use hot water, allow the article to remain in the dye for long periods of time, or add salt (1-2 cups per package). Natural dyes work best when heated in a pot on top o ft he stove and stirred. Agitation will give uniform results. Too little agitation results in splotchy spots, desirable if you want a marble or acidwash effect. Remove the fabric from the dye bath. DO NOT remove the elastics. Allow the project to dry on a well-protected surface for several hours, turning every hour for the first 4-5 hours and every 6 hours for the next 24 hours to avoid dark ridges from forming where the dye evaporates.  Using More Than One Color If a second color is desired, remove the article from the first dye bath, rinse in cool water until the water runs clear. Remove the ties and tie again in a new design. Place in the second color. Remove and rinse again. Remove the ties and dry on a hanger. The dye will continue to migrate until the cloth is dry. For a more distinct design, remove ties only after the garment is completely dry.  Setting the Dye Heat set the dye by pressing with a hot iron, or by drying in a clothes dryer for about 20 minutes.  Care of the Finished Article To clean the garment after use, wash separately in cool water and mild detergent.  Spray Dyeing Most craft stores stock dye in spray bottles ready for immediate application. Any dye may be placed in a bottle and used as a spray, but the colors will not be as vibrant as commercial spray dyes. When spray dyeing, wear old clothing and cover an 8 - 10 foot area with plastic. Tie off the article and wet it for a muted, blended look. Spray thoroughly, spread open the folds (wear plastic gloves) and spray inside without removing the elastics, to ensure uniform dyeing. Turn and spray the other side of the article. If using more than one color, be careful to clean work areas before and after spraying the wet article.  Housing, Interiors, Furnishings: Activity/Resource Guide - 8/99  Page 33   Some designs can be created with spray dye that won't work using the bath method. A favorite is to twist the article starting at the center into a tight ball, then securing with three large elastics crisscrossing to create six areas. Spray each area a different color or alternate 2 or 3 colors. Spray the back of the article with corresponding colors. Another popular design is to create the illusion of a sunflower. Simply tie a small portion of the fabric for the flower center, followed by a larger section for the petals, followed by an even larger section for the leaves. Spray each section separately, being careful of the over spray. Spray dyeing may also be done on a dry garment. Simply place the article on a 3-5 foot plastic covered area. Twist or fold a design into the article you desire to dye and spray with the dye in the designated areas. When using more than one color, straighten the article and fold or twist into a new design, then spray. Continue this process until all the desired colors have been applied to the fabric. Hang in a protected area for 1-2 hours. Colors sprayed onto dry fabric will be more vibrant and will not migrate into other colors. Allow the project to dry on a well-protected surface for several hours, turning every hour for the first 45 hours and every 6 hours for the next 24 hours to avoid dark ridges from forming where the dye evaporates.  Housing, Interiors, Furnishings: Activity/Resource Guide - 8/99  Page 34   Stenciling on Fabric Stenciling is an easy, inexpensive technique for decorating any flat surface: fabric, floors, walls. Stenciling is fun because it allows creation of designs tailored to you and your home. By using your own creativity, it ensures an original design. Any natural fiber, except wool and cotton blends, may be stenciled. Before stenciling, was the fabric to remove the sizing, then dry and press. MATERIALS: Stencil pattern or plastic sheets to make your own stencil Utility knife (X-acto) Glass Pencil Black marking pen Masking tape Brushes or sponges to apply paint Textile paints Plate to hold paint Spoon or palette knife to mix paints Paper towels Fabric Iron MAKING A STENCIL: 1. Transfer the design of your choice to a plastic stencil sheet (available at craft stores). You will need a sheet for each color to be used in your design. 2. Cut the designs in the plastic sheets using a sharp utility knife (X-acto). Place the stencils on glass for a better cutting surface. 3. Mark the fabric with the design to ensure the stencil will be placed correctly. 4. Tape the precut stencil to the fabric and begin painting. Dip the brush in the paint and wipe off any excess paint. Apply with dabbing strokes. Start at the edge and work toward the center. 5. Before lifting the stencil, make sure all areas have been covered. Lift the stencil straight up from the cloth. 6. LET THE PAINT DRY COMPLETELY. 7. Repeat this process for other colors you wish to use. ALLOW DRYING TIME BETWEEN EACH COLOR. 8. After letting the pain dry completely, heat seal the paint by ironing both sides for three minutes.

Below are some personality descriptions based on color preferences. While this information should not be taken too seriously, it is fun to consider. Use this information to determine your client's personality. color. PINK If your favorite color is pink, you are probably laid back and carefree. You may be somewhat sheltered and innocent, or you wish you were. Words that describe you are shy, romantic, and feminine. You are gentle, almost to the point of being weak. You have a calming effect on those around you and people who need a friend seek you out. RED If your favorite color is red, you want to be part of the action and are quite impulsive. Outspoken, quick-tempered and intense are words that describe your personality. In a crowd you are dynamic and noticeable. If you're not careful, you can become overbearing. You are emotional, exciting, and athletic. You give your opinion whether others will agree with you or not. Life for you must be lived to the fullest. YELLOW If you favorite color is yellow, you are intellectual and drawn toward the new and modern. High-spirited, cheerful, and idealistic best describe your personality. You are vivacious, extroverted and comedic. You have strong opinions and can be stubborn. You live by high standards and give sound advice. ORANGE If your favorite color is orange, you are unique. You are friendly and get along well with others. You radiate warmth and inspire those you are with. You tend to be social and are drawn to groups of people. You are the hearth of the home and grateful for family and friends. BLUE If blue is your favorite color, you are cautious, conservative, and sensitive to the needs of others. Your basic need for harmony often thrusts you into the roll of peacemaker. Words that best describe you are business-like, calm, and capable. You are a loyal, trustworthy friend, but expressing your emotions in a relationship is difficult for you.  Housing, Interiors, Furnishings: Activity/Resource Guide - 8/99  Page 39   GREEN If your favorite color is green, you are fresh, friendly, and natural. You are persistent, well balanced, and stable. The environment is important in your life and you like things basic to the point of being simple. As a friend, you are frank, sensitive, affectionate, and loyal. BLUE/GREEN If your favorite color is blue/green, you are sensitive and need loving care and adoration from others, but you maintain your independence. Showing emotion is difficult for you and others perceive you as self-centered. You have excellent taste and a mature outlook. PURPLE If you like purple, you are creative! You consider yourself unique and set yourself apart from others. You are an artist at heart. Scheduling mundane tasks bore you. You can frequently be found day-dreaming and would actually prefer fantasy over reality. While you seek cultural events and luxury, you do not put yourself out to serve humanity. Many inventors claim purple as their favorite color. BROWN If you like brown, you are likely to be seen as stable and unchanging. You are self-disciplined, conscientious, and dependable. You like the rugged outdoors and the ultra natural. You are warm, comfortable, intimate, and accepting. BLACK If you like black, you are sophisticated, mysterious, and dramatic. You are dignified and keep to yourself. You may be unhappy with how things are, but aren't quite certain how you can change existing circumstances. A young child who chooses black exclusively may be depressed. WHITE If you like white, you expect to be happy most of the time. Your personality is light, good, and pure. You have a sense of innocence about you. You seek perfection and expect others to dot he same, which sometimes makes you appear cold.  Housing, Interiors, Furnishings: Activity/Resource Guide - 8/99  Page 40   Think of all the cliche!s you've heard regarding color: red as blood, feeling blue, in the pink, pure white, etc. Colors can have a significant impact on the way we feel. The impact a color has on the way we feel and act is known as the psychology of color. Colors have always played an important role in society. The imperial color of China is yellow because it has a religious significance. In Greece and Rome, red was believed to have protective powers. Long ago, purple was restricted for use by nobility. Youth in detention homes were found to respond more positively when walls that had been painted dull were changed to bright colors. Athletic directors paint their teams' dressing rooms in bright red and orange and the visitors' dressing rooms in pale blues. A meat market in Chicago lost a lot of business when it was painted a bright yellow color, giving the meat a purplish look. Sales zoomed when the walls were repainted bluish green, making the meat look fresh. A study reported by German auto maker Daimler-Benz showed people can spot a white car 12 times more quickly than a black one, especially at night. Red is difficult to see at twilight and in fog. Browns, grays, dark green, black, and dark blues are least visible of all. Colors are often associated with feelings. Orange exciting, exotic Yellow joy, warmth, inspiration Green freshness, security, jealousy, camouflage Black weight and solidity, space, theatrical, mysterious, strength White goodness, purity Red love, courage, rage, joy, cheerfulness Blue calm, soothing, orderliness Violet luxury, depth of feeling, sensual Although most people have a personal preference for color(s), those colors may or may not work in all situations. When working as an interior designer, the client's (not the designer's) desire to use specific colors will be the controlling factor.  Housing, Interiors, Furnishings: Activity/Resource Guide - 8/99  Page 41   Activity: 9  Presentation Techniques Interior perspective are drawings of a room inside a home, which include backgrounds, furnishings, and accessories planned for the finished project. When color, shades, shadows, pattern, and texture, are added to an interior perspective drawing, it is known as a rendering. Presentation floor plans present not only the layout of rooms in a home, but may include traffic patterns, appliances, and furniture arrangement. Color may also be added to define areas. A presentation election represents sides of a room, but displays no depth. Presentation boards enable a client to visualize the proposed finished product by displaying colors, designs, and textures that will be used in the completed room. Mat board or illustration board is used for mounting manufacturers samples, drawings, and photos. Models may be used by the designer to allow the client to view all sides of a proposed project by showing a three-dimensional likeness. For more advanced presentations, slides may be used to show examples of previous work or designs used in similar situations to that of the client. A plan without text does not communicate a complete description of the various components. Appropriate text helps communicate information, but also makes the presentation look professional. Practice is necessary to develop skills necessary for legible lettering. Place lettering transparency on the overhead projector. 1. 2. 3. 4. All projects must have a title. Check the spelling of all words for accuracy. Always use guidelines when lettering. Block lettering is the basic lettering and is acceptable for project presentations. Letters should be bold and clear. Avoid making fancy, cute letters.  Housing, Interiors, Furnishings: Activity/Resource Guide - 8/99  Page 42   5.  Make each line quickly from the beginning to the end of the stroke. This makes the lines straighter and more accurate. Begin the letter with a straight line, then add diagonal and curved lines. Letters will be written in a variety of sizes. Generally, the smaller the letter, the easier it is to write. Practice lettering in a variety of sizes. Block letters are usually all CAPITALIZED. The size of the lettering is usually related to the importance of the labeling. For example, titles are lettered larger than notes in small areas. Spacing between letters and words is cortical. Think of all the letters as being the same size, approximately square (""M"" and ""W"" are a little wider.) Labeling should be done from left to right. Keep borders simpleavoid flowers and excessive curved lines. Simple border unite the project and make it look professional. Rounded letters will slightly top the guidelines and can be slightly closer together than straight letters. Do not cross ""J"" and ""I"". There are definite strokes to be used when lettering. Practice lettering, using the stroke guidelines shown on the next page. Use a soft pencil, but be careful not to smudge your lettering. Keep the point on your pencil sharp at all times.

Do you have any idea what that term means? Programming is helping a family find a house that fits their particular needs. No matter where one lives there are certain needs a person has, regarding living space. Can you identify some of these needs (privacy, cleanliness, protection, beauty, etc.)? There are many influences for selecting a place to live: 1. What are the employment opportunities? 2. Are the roads and highways finished and usable? 3. Is public transportation available? 4. How are the schools? 5. What is the crime rate? 6. How is the climate? 7. What is the cost of living relative to income potential? It is a challenge to discuss the specific needs of people because we so often incorrectly stereotype personalities and circumstances. For example, many high-strung athletes enjoy doing hand-work, such as counted cross-stitch and many frail-looking women drive school buses. In our discussion today, remember that we are discussing society's perceptions of the average family or person. However, keep clear in you mind that each person is an individual, and only he/she knows what individual needs are most important to him/her. Discuss the typical advantages and disadvantages of the various types of living conditions, but remember there will be exceptions to all of them.

The Zoning Board has the power to make exceptions to the zoning laws on a case by case basis (this is called a variance and the special use is referred to as nonconforming). Zoning laws mandate the kinds of building that can be built size of lots minimum size of dwelling minimum number of rooms in a dwelling kinds of businesses that may be allowed setbacks how close to other buildings a new building may stand how far from the street and other boundaries a building must be Building Code Building codes contain rules about building construction. They specify such things as the width, height, and number of doors a building must have; the kind of electrical wiring that may be used; and the fire safety rating of insulation materials that is acceptable. They are designed to ensure that health and safety standards are met throughout a community. Housing codes also regulate housing that is already constructed. These laws require certain minimum facilities and equipment such as good heating systems, adequate Housing, Interiors, Furnishings: Activity/Resource Guide - 8/99 Page 54   lighting, and complete bathroom. These codes also attempt to limit the number of persons or families that can reside in each living unit. The primary reason for having housing codes is to ensure safe and sanitary housing conditions for the residents of a community.

Almost all dyes, specialty chemicals, and finishing chemicals are applied to textile substrates from water baths. In addition, most fabric preparation steps, including desizing, scouring, bleaching, and mercerizing, use aqueous systems.  Textile operations var y greatly in water consumption. Figure 28 summarizes the water consumption of various types of operations. Wool and felted fabrics processes are more water intensive than other processing subcategories such as wovens, knits, stock, and carpet.   Chapter 5  FIGURE 29  Water Consumption by Unit Process Processing Subcategory Yarn & fabric forming Slashing Preparation Singeing Desizing Scouring Continuous bleaching Mercerizing Dyeing Beam Beck Jet Jig Paddle Skein Stock Pad-batch Package Continuous bleaching Indigo Dyeing Printing Print afterwashing Finishing Chemical Mechanical Water Consumption, gal/lb of production Nil 0.06 to 0.94 Nil 0.3 to 2.4 2.3 to 5.1 0.3 to 14.9 0.12 20 28 24 12 35 30 20 2 22 20 1 to 6 3 13.2 0.6 Nil  76   Chapter 5  constitutes the major portion of energy consumed in dyeing. Therefore, low bath-ratio dyeing equipment not only conser ves water but also saves energy, in addition to reducing steam use and air pollution from boilers. Low-bath-ratio dyeing machines conser ve chemicals as well as water and also achieve higher fixation efficiency. But the washing efficiency of some types of low-bath-ratio dyeing machines, such as jigs, is inherently poor; therefore, a correlation between bath ratio and total water use is not always exact.

Many processes involve washing and rinsing stages, and optimizing wash processes can conser ve significant amounts of water. In some cases, careful auditing and implementation of controls can achieve wastewater reductions of up to 70 percent. The washing and rinsing stages of preparation typically require more water than the other stages (e.g., bleaching, dyeing). Several typical washing and rinsing processes include: n Drop and fill batch washing. n Ove r f low batch washing. n Continuous washing (countercurrent, horizontal, or inclined washers).  A report on water consumption for a typical continuous bleach range found that consumption was more than 11,000 gallons per hour, or 270,000 million gallons per day. (See Figure 30.) Washing stages accounted for 9,900 gallons per hour, or 90 percent of the total. The application of the following simple, lowtechnology methods of water conser vation reduced water use: n Properly regulating f lows: 300 gallons per hour savings. n Counter f lowing bleach to scour: 3,000 gallons per hour savings. n Counter f lowing scour to desize: 3,000 gallons per hour savings. The total water savings without process modification was 150,000 million gallons per day, or 55 percent of water use. A process modification such as a combined one-stage bleach and scour also would save 6,200 gallons of water per hour, or an additional 150,000 million gallons per day, along with energy savings.  77   Chapter 5 FIGURE 31  Water Use in Batch Washing Process Description 1 Standard - 3 step drop/fill 2 Reduced bath - seven step drop/fill 3 Continuous overflow 4 Continuous overflow reduced bath 5 Three-step drop/fill, reuse bath 2 6 Three-step, reuse baths 2 and 3 Bath Ratio Water Use, gal/lbs % Change from Standard  1:8 1:5 1:8 1:5 1:8 1:8  1.62 1.26 2.38 1.49 1.19 0.75  ---22.2 46.9 -8 -26.5 -53.7  Drop-Fill Versus Overflow Washing  In the drop/fill method of batch washing, spent wash water is drained and the machine is refilled with a fresh wash bath. The fabric or other substrate in the machine retains much of the previous bath, perhaps as much as 350 percent owg. This percentage can be reduced by mechanical means (e.g., extraction, blowdown). Comparison of several methods of washing after bleaching shows the benefits of countercurrent wash methods, see Figure 31. Methods five and six, which implement countercurrent washing, produce savings of 26 and 53 percent compared with the standard drop/fill method. These results are based on comparisons of washing processes that would produce the same degree of reduction of fabric impurities using computer models. Countercurrent washing processes require the addition of holding tanks and pumps. 78  The capital cost of setting up such a reuse system typically is less than $50,000 and generates estimated savings of $95,000 annually. In many cases, reducing wastewater also reduces the need for expensive waste treatment systems.  Reusing Wash Water  Many strategies can be applied for reusing wash water. Three of the most common strategies are countercurrent washing, reducing carr yover, and reusing wash water for cleaning purposes.  Countercurrent Washing  The countercurrent washing method is relatively straightfor ward and inexpensive to use in multistage washing processes. Basically, the least contaminated water from the final wash is reused for the nextto-last wash and so on until the water reaches the first wash stage, after which it is discharged. This technique is useful for washing after continuous dyeing, printing, desizing, scouring, or bleaching.   Chapter 5  An important variant of the countercurrent principle is horizontal or inclined washers. Horizontal or inclined washing is more efficient because of the inherent countercurrent nature of water f low within the process. The mechanical construction of an inclined or horizontal countercurrent washer has to be much better than a traditional ver tical washer, ho w e v e r. Sloppy roll settings, weak or undersized rolls, unevenness, bends, bows, biases, bearing play, or other misalignments within the machine are much more important in a horizontal or inclined washer because the weight of water pressing down on the fabric can cause it to sag, balloon, or stretch. If properly constructed and maintained, horizontal or inclined washers can produce high quality fabrics while saving money and wat e r.  squeeze rolls or vacuum extractors typically extract water between steps. Equipment employing vacuum technology to reduce dragout and carr yover of chemical solutions with cloth, stock, or yarn is used to increase washing efficiency in multistage washing operations. In one case histor y, a processor installed vacuum slots after each wash box in an existing multistage continuous washing line and was able to reduce the number of boxes from eight to three . Wash boxes with built-in vacuum extractors are available for purchase, as well as washers for prints that combine successive spray and vacuum slots without any bath for the fabric to pass through. Because the fabric is never submerged, bleeding, marking off, and staining of grounds is minimized, and water use decreases. Another washer configuration with internal recycling capabilities is the ver tical counter f low washer, which sprays recirculated water onto the fabric and uses rollers to squeeze waste through the fabric into a sump, here it is filtered and recirculated. The filter is unique, consisting of continuous loops of polyester fabric that rotate continuously and are cleaned of filtrate at one end with a spray of clean water. This construction allows for maximum removal of suspended solids from water before discharge or reuse in another process. High-efficiency washing with low water use results. Energy use decreases greatly because less water must be heated.  Reducing Carryover  Because the purpose of washing is to reduce the amount of impurities in the substrate, as much water as possible must be removed between sequential washing steps in multistage washing operations. Water cont aining cont aminants that is not removed is carried over into the next step, contributing to washing inefficiency. Proper draining in batch drop/fill washing and proper extraction between steps in the continuous washing process are important. Often, 350 percent owg is carried over in typical drop/fill procedures. This amount can be reduced in some batch machines (e.g., yarn package dyeing, stock dyeing) by using compressed air or vacuum blowdown between washing steps. In continuous washing operations,  Reuse for Cleaning Purposes In many types of can be reused for printing, cleanup formed with used  operations, washwater cleaning purposes. In activities can be perwashwater, including :  n Backgray blanket washing. 79   Chapter 5  n Screen and squeegee cleaning. n Color shop cleanup. n Equipment and facility cleaning. A typical preparation department may also reuse wash water as follows: n Reuse scour rinses for desizing. n Reuse mercerizer washwater for scouring. n Reuse bleach washwater for scouring. n Reuse water-jet loom washwater for desizing. n Recycle kier drains to saturator.  Inspection of the written procedures showed that the fill step simply said fill. The wash step simply said wash. Without training and without a specific operating procedure, operators were left to determine water use on their own. This case may seem extreme, but even the best mills, which have well-documented production procedures, often do not have documented cleaning procedures. Cleaning operations that contribute large amounts of pollution to the total waste stream include machine cleaning, screen and squeegee cleaning, and drum washing.  Work Practices  Engineering Controls  Workers can greatly inf luence water use. Sloppy chemical handling and poor housekeeping can result in excessive cleanup. Poor scheduling and mix planning also can require excessive cleanup and lead to unnecessar y cleaning of equipment like machines and mix tanks. Leaks and spills should be reported and repaired promptly. Equipment maintenance, especially maintenance of washing equipment, is essential. Inappropriate work practices waste significant amounts of water; and good procedures and training are important. When operations are controlled manually, an operations audit checklist is helpful for operator reference, training, and retraining. In one case histor y, a knitting mill experienced excessive water use on beck dyeing machines. A study of operating practices revealed that each operator was filling the machines to a different level. Some operators filled the becks to a depth of 16 inches, others as much as 24 inches. Also, the amount of water used for washing varied. Some operator s used an over f low procedure, and others used drop/fill or half baths (repeatedly draining half of the bath, then refilling it). 80  Ever y mill should have moveable water meters that can be installed on individual machines to document water use and evaluate improvements. In practice, mills rarely measure water use but rely on manufacturers claims concerning equipment and water use. The manufacturers estimates are useful starting points for evaluating water consumption, but the actual performance of equipment depends on the chemical system used and the substrate. Therefore, water use is situation-specific and should be measured on-site for accurate results. The water meters should be regularly maintained and calibrated. Other important engineering controls, some of which have been discussed in other sections of this chapter, include: n Flow control on washers. n Flow control on cooling water (use minimum necessar y). n Countercurrent washing. n High extraction to reduce dragout. n Recycle and reuse. n Detection and repair of leaks. n Detection and repair of defective toilets and water coolers.   Chapter 5  Machiner y should be inspected and improved where possible to facilitate cleaning and to reduce susceptibility to fouling. Bath ratios sometimes can be reduced by using displacers that result in lower chemical requirements for pH control as well as lower water use.  Process Changes Pad-Batch Dyeing In pad-batch dyeing, prepared fabric is padded with a solution of fiber reactive dyestuff and alkali, then stored (or batched) on rolls or in boxes and covered with plastic film to prevent evaporation of water or absorption of carbon dioxide from the air. The fabric then is batched for two to 12 hours. Washing can be done on whatever equipment is available in the mill. Pad-batch dyeing of fer s several significant advantages, primarily cost and waste reduction, simplicity, and speed. Production of between 75 and 150 yards per minute, depending on the construction and weight of the goods involved, is common. Also, pad-batch dyeing is f lexible compared with a continuous range. Either wovens or knits can be dyed in many constructions. Frequent changes of shade present no problems because reactives remain water soluble, making cleanup easy. This method of dyeing is useful when versatility is required. Water use typically decreases from 17 gallons per pound to 1.5 gallons per pound, a reduction of more than 90 percent.  water intake system with no adverse effects on production. In some cases, specific types of wastewater can be recycled within a process or department. Examples are dyebath reuse, bleach bath reuse, final rinse reuse as a loading bath for the next lot, washwater reuse, countercurrent washing, and reuse for other purposes.  Bleach Bath Reuse  Cotton and cotton blend preparation (e.g., desizing, scouring, bleaching) are performed using continuous or batch processes and usually are the largest water consumers in a mill. Continuous processes are much easier to adapt to wastewater recycling/reuse because the wastestream is continuous, shows fairly constant characteristics, and usually is easy to segregate from other waste streams. Waste-stream reuse in a typical bleach unit for polyester/cotton and 100 percent cotton fabrics would include: n Recycling J-box and kier drain wastewater to saturators. n Using countercurrent washing. n Recycling continuous scour washwater to batch scouring. n Recycling w asher wat er to back gray blanket washing. n Recycling washer water to screen and squeegee cleaning. n Recycling washer water to color shop cleanup. n Recycling washer water to equipment and facility cleaning. n Reusing scour rinses for desizing. n Reusing mercerizer washwater for scouring. Preparation chemicals (including optical brighteners and tints), however, must be selected in such a way that reuse does not create quality problems such as spotting.  Processing Bath Reuse  Water from many processes can be renovated for reuse by a variety of methods. Several research efforts are underway. In a few operations, up to 50 percent of the treated wastewater is recycled directly back from the eff luent to the raw-  81   Chapter 5  Batch scouring and bleaching are less easy to adapt to recycling of waste streams because streams occur intermittently, drains generally go into pits and are not easily segregated, and batch preparation steps frequently are combined. With appropriate holding t anks, however, bleach bath reuse can be practiced in a similar manner to dyebath reuse, and several pieces of equipment are now available that have the necessar y holding tanks. The spent bleach bath contains all of the alkali and heat necessar y for the next bleaching operation. Peroxide and chelates must be added to reconstitute the bath. Like dyebath reuse, the number of reuse cycles in bleach bath reuse is limited by impurity buildup. The main impurities are metals, such as iron, that can interfere with the bleaching reaction. New types of rope bleaching units for knits featuring six to 12-stage jet transpor t systems have made continuous bleaching of most knit styles possible. These units were introduced in the late 1970s and typically produce 40 pounds per minute of knit fabric or more than one million pounds per month based on a three-shift, six-day operation. These machines have become ver y popular with large knit  processors because of their f lexibility and ability to conser ve energy, water, and chemicals. They also have complete builtin countercurrent capabilities. These units are being promoted for use in af ter washing fiber reactive and other types of dyes (e.g., after pad-batch dyeing) in addition to use as continuous knit preparation ranges.  Final Rinse Reuse as Loading Bath for Next Lot  One simple technique that saves water and, in some cases, BOD loading is to reuse the final bath from one dyeing cycle to load the next lot. This technique works well in situations where the same shade is being repeated or where the dyeing machine is fairly clean. A good example of this technique is acid dyeing of nylon hosier y. The final bath usually contains an emulsified softener that exhausts onto the substrate, leaving the emulsifier in the bath. This technique can ser ve as the wetting agent for loading the next batch, thus saving the water, heat, and wetting agent and associated BOD.

Levine      History of Slate Use      Character and Detailing      Where Does Slate Come From?      Deterioration of Slate and Slate Roofs       Repairing Slate Roofs     The Replacement of Deteriorated Roofs       Maintenance     Conclusion            Slate is one of the most aesthetically pleasing and durable of all roofing materials.  It is indicative at once of the awesome powers of nature which have formed it and the expertise and skill of the craftsman in handshaping and laying it on the roof. Installed properly, slate roofs require relatively little maintenance and will last 60 to 125 years or longer depending on the type of slate employed, roof configuration, and the geographical location of the property. Some slates have been known to last over 200 years. Found on virtually every class of structure, slate roofs are perhaps most often associated with institutional, ecclesiastical, and government buildings, where longevity is an especially important consideration in material choices. In the slate quarrying regions of the country, where supply is abundant, slate was often used on farm and agricultural buildings as well.                                                              Although slate replacement roofs are expensive, the superiority of materials and craftsmanship will give years of continued service. If amortized over the life of the roof, the replacement cost can be very reasonable. Photo: NPS files.                                                   Because the pattern, detailing, and craftsmanship of slate roofs are important design elements of historic buildings, they should be repaired rather than replaced whenever possible. The purpose of this Preservation Brief is to assist property owners, architects, preservationists, and building managers in understanding the causes of slate roof failures and undertaking the repair and replacement of slate roofs. Details contributing to the character of historic slate roofs are described and guidance is offered on maintenance and the degree of intervention required at various levels of deterioration.     The relatively large percentage of historic buildings roofed with slate during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries means that many slate roofs, and the 60 to 125 year life span of the slates most commonly used, may be nearing the end of their serviceable lives at the end of the twentieth century. Too often, these roofs are being improperly repaired or replaced with alternative roofing materials, to the detriment of the historic integrity and appearance of the structure. Increased knowledge of the characteristics of slate and its detailing and installation on the roof can lead to more sensitive interventions in which original material is preserved and the building's historic character maintained. Every effort should be made to replace deteriorated slate roofs with new slate and to develop an effective maintenance and repair program for slate roofs that can be retained.      History of Slate Use in the United States    Although slate quarrying was not common in the United States until the latter half of the nineteenth century, slate roofing is known to have been used prior to the Revolution. Archeological excavations at Jamestown, Virginia,have unearthed roofing slate in strata dating from 1625-1650 and 1640-1670. Slate roofs were introduced in Boston as early as 1654 and Philadelphia in 1699. Seventeenth century building ordinances of New York and Boston recommended the use of slate or tile roofs to ensure fireproof construction.                                                              Architectural pattern books of the mid-19th century awakened Americans to the  availability and quality of slate for roofing purposes. Drawing: Design XX, ""A French Roof House,"" in A.J. Downing's Victorian Cottage Residences.                                                    In the early years of the Colonies, nearly all roofing slate was imported from North Wales. It was not until 1785 that the first commercial slate quarry was opened in the United States, by William Docher in Peach Bottom Township, Pennsylvania. Production was limited to that which could be consumed in local markets until the middle of the nineteenth century. Knowledge of the nation's abundant stone resources was given commercial impetus at this time by several forces, including a rapidly growing population that demanded housing, advances in quarrying technology, and extension of the railroad system to previously inaccessible markets. Two additional factors helped push the slate industry to maturity: the immigration of Welsh slate workers to the United States and the introduction of architectural pattern and style books. Slate production increased dramatically in the years following the Civil War as quarries were opened in Vermont, New York, Virginia, and Lehigh and Northampton Counties, Pennsylvania. By 1876, roofing slate imports had all but dried up and the United States became a net exporter of the commodity.     The U.S. roofing slate industry reached its highest point in both quantity and value of output in the period from 1897 to 1914. In 1899, there were over 200 slate quarries operating in 13 states, Pennsylvania historically being the largest producer of all. The decline of the U.S. roofing slate industry began c.1915 and resulted from several factors, including a decline in skilled labor for both the fabrication and installation of slate and competition from substitute materials, such as asphalt shingles, which could be mass produced, transported and installed at a lower cost than slate. Only recently, with the increasing popularity of historic preservation and the recognition of the superiority of slate over other roofing materials, has slate usage begun to increase.      The Character and Detailing of Historic Slate Roofs    During some periods of architectural history, roof design has gone far beyond the merely functional and contributed much to the character of buildings. Roofs, by their compelling forms, have defined styles and, by their decorative patterns and colors, have imparted both dignity and beauty to buildings. The architectural styles prevalent during the latter half of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries placed strong emphasis on prominent roof lines and greatly influenced the demand for slate. Slate, laid in multicolored decorative patterns, was particularly well suited to the Mansard roofs of the Second Empire style, the steeply pitch roofs of the Gothic Revival and High Victorian Gothic styles, and the many prominent roof planes and turrets associated with the Queen Anne style. The Tudor style imitated the quaint appearance of some English slates which, because of their granular cleavage, are thick and irregular. These slates were often laid in a graduated pattern, with the largest slates at the eaves and the courses diminishing in size up the roof slope, or a textural pattern.  Collegiate Gothic style buildings, found on many university campuses, were often roofed with slate laid in a graduated pattern.                                                              This graduated slate roof is composed of large, thick slates at the eave which are reduced in size and thickness as the slating progresses to the ridge. Photo: Jeffrey S. Levine.                                                   The configuration, massing, and style of historic slate roofs are important design elements that should be preserved. In addition, several types of historic detailing were often employed to add visual interest to the roof essentially elevating the roof to the level of an ornamental architectural element. When repairing or replacing a slate roof, original details affecting its visual character should be retained.     Before repairing or replacing an existing slate roof, it is important to document the existing conditions and detailing of the roof using written, visual, and physical evidence so that original features can be identified and preserved. Documentation should continue through the repair or replacement process as significant details, long obscured, are often rediscovered while carrying out these activities. Local histories, building records, old receipts and ledgers, historic photographs, sketches, and paintings, shadow lines and nail hole patterns on the roof deck, and bits of historic material left over from previous interventions (often found in eave cavities) are all useful sources of information which can be of help in piecing together the original appearance of the roof. Size, shape, color, texture, exposure, and coursing are among the most important characteristics of the original slates which should be documented and matched when repairing or replacing an historic slate roof.     Historically, three types of slate roofing-- standard, textural, and graduated -were available according to the architectural effect desired. Standard grade slate roofs were most common. These are characterized by their uniform appearance, being composed of slates approximately 3/16"" (0.5cm) thick, of consistent length and width, and having a smooth cleavage surface. Thirty different standard sizes were available, ranging from 10"" (25cm) x 6"" to 24"" x 14"" (15cm x 61cm x 35cm). The slates were laid to break joints and typically had square ends and uniform color and exposure. Patterned and polychromatic roofs were created by laying standard slates of different colors and shapes on the roof in such a way as to create sunbursts, flowers, sawtooth and geometric designs, and even initials and dates. On utilitarian structures, such as barns and sheds, large gaps were sometimes left between each slate within a given course to reduce material and installation costs and provide added ventilation for the interior.     Textural slate roofs incorporate slates of different thicknesses, uneven tails, and a rougher texture than standard slates. Textural slate roofs are perhaps most often associated with Tudor style buildings where slates of different colors are used to enhance the effect.     Graduated slate roofs were frequently installed on large institutional and ecclesiastical structures. The slates were graduated according to thickness, size, and exposure, the thickest and largest slates being laid at the eaves and the thinnest and smallest at the ridge. Pleasing architectural effects were achieved by blending sizes and colors.                                                              Valleys are formed at the internal angle of two roofing slopes. Flashing is often placed under the slate to increase moisture protection at this vulnerable joint.  Photo: Jeffrey S. Levine.                                                   Detailing at the hips, ridges and valleys provided added opportunity to ornament a slate roof. Hips and ridges can be fashioned out of slate according to various traditional schemes whereby the slates are cut and overlapped to produce a watertight joint of the desired artistic effect. Traditional slate ridge details are the saddle ridge, strip saddle rid~e and comb ridge, and for hips, the saddle hip, mitered hip Boston hip, and fantail hip. A more linear effect was achieved by covering the ridges and hips with flashing called ""cresting"" or ""ridge roll"" formed out of sheet metal, terra cotta, or even slate. Snow guards, snow boards, and various types of gutter and rake treatments also contributed to the character of historic slate roofs.     Two types of valleys were traditionally employed, the  open valley  and the  closed valley . The open valley is lined with metal over which slates lap only at the sides. Closed valleys are covered with slate and have either a continuous metal lining or metal flashing built in with each course. Open valleys are easier to install and maintain, and are generally more watertight than closed valleys. Round valleys are a type of closed valley with a concave rather than Vshaped section. Given the broader sweep of the round valley, it was not uncommon for roofers to interweave asphalt saturated felts rather than copper sheet in the coursing in order to cut costs.     Although principally associated with graduated and textural slate roofs, round valleys were infrequently employed due to the difficulty and expense of their installation.     Common types of sheathing used include  wood boards, wood battens , and, for fireproof construction on institutional and government buildings,  concrete or steel . Solid wood sheathing was typically constructed of tongue and groove, square edged, or shiplapped pine boards of 1"" (2.5 cm) or 1-1/4"" (3 cm) nominal thickness. Boards from 6"" (15 cm) to 8"" (20 cm) wide and tongue and groove boards were generally preferred as they were less likely to warp and curl.     Wood battens, or open wood sheathing, consisted of wood strips, measuring from 2"" (5 cm) to 3"" (7.5 cm) in width, nailed to the roof rafters. Spacing of the battens depended on the length of the slate and equaled the exposure. Slates were nailed to the batten that transected its midsection. The upper end of the slate rested at least "" (1.25 cm) on the batten next above. Open wood sheathing was employed primarily on utilitarian, farm, and agricultural structures in the North and on residential buildings in the South where the insulating value of solid wood sheathing was not a strict requirement. To help keep out dust and wind driven rain on residential buildings, mortar was often placed along the top and bottom edge of each batten, a practice sometimes referred to as torching.                                                              Eave details include snow guards, snow boards, and gutter treatments. Snow guards are generally used in areas where the ice and snow accumulate to avoid dangerous slides from the roof.  Photo: Jeffrey S. Levine.                                                   Steel angles substituted for the wood battens in fireproof construction. The slates were secured using wire wrapped around the steel angle, where it was twistedoff tight. Alternately, any of a variety of special fasteners patented over the years could have been used to attach the slate to the steel angle. On roofs with concrete decks, slates were typically nailed to wood nailing strips embedded in the concrete.     Beginning in the late nineteenth century, asphalt saturated roofing felt was installed atop solid wood sheathing. The felt provided a temporary, watertight roof until the slate could be installed atop it. Felt also served to cushion the slates, exclude wind driven rain and dust, and ease slight unevenness between the sheathing boards.     Slate was typically laid in horizontal courses starting at the eaves with a standard headlap of 3"" (7.5 cm) (Figure 10). Headlap was generally reduced to 2"" (5 cm) on Mansard roofs and on particularly steep slopes with more than 20"" (50 cm) of rise per 12"" (30 cm) of run. Conversely, headlap was increased to 4"" (10 cm) or more on low pitched roofs with a rise of 8"" (20 cm) or less per 12"" (30 cm) of horizontal run. The minimum roof slope necessary for a slate roof was 4"" (10 cm) of rise per 12"" (30 cm) of run.      Where Does Slate Come From?    Slate is a fine grained, crystalline rock derived from sediments of clay and fine silt which were deposited on ancient sea bottoms. Superimposed materials gradually consolidated the sedimentary particles into bedded deposits of shale. Mountain building forces subsequently folded, crumpled, and compressed the shale. At the same time, intense heat and pressure changed the original clays into new minerals such as mica, chlorite, and quartz. By such mechanical and chemical processes bedded clays were transformed, or metamorphosed, into slate, whole geologic ages being consumed in the process. Slates vary in composition, structure, and durability because the degree to which their determinant minerals have been altered is neither uniform nor consistent.                                                          These traditional slater's tools are used to cut and trim, hammer, measure, and rip out nails.  Photo: Jeffrey S. Levine.                                                    The adaptation of slate for roofing purposes is inextricably linked to its genesis. The manufacturing processes of nature have endowed slate with certain commercially amenable properties which have had a profound influence on the methods by which slate is quarried and fabricated, as well as its suitability for use as a roofing tile.     Slate roofing tiles are still manufactured by hand using traditional methods in a five step process:  cutting, sculping, splitting, trimming, and hole punching.  In the manufacturing process, large, irregular blocks taken from the quarry are first cut with a saw across the grain in sections slightly longer than the length of the finished roofing slate. The blocks are next sculped, or split along the grain of the slate, to widths slightly larger than the widths of finished slates. Sculping is generally accomplished with a mallet and a broadfaced chisel, although some types of slate must be cut along their grain. In the splitting area, the slightly oversized blocks are split along their cleavage planes to the desired shingle thickness. The splitter's tools consist of a wooden mallet and two splitting chisels used for prying the block into halves and repeating this process until the desired thinness is reached. The last two steps involve trimming the tile to the desired size and then punching two nail holes toward the top of the slate using a formula based on the size and exposure of the slate.     Minerals, the building blocks of rocks, through their characteristic crystalline structures define the physical properties of the rocks which they compose. Slate consists of minerals that are stable and resistant to weathering and is, therefore, generally of high strength, low porosity, and low absorption. The low porosity and low absorption of slate mitigate the deleterious action of frost on the stone and make it well adapted for roofing purposes. The two most important structural properties of slate are cleavage and grain.     The metamorphic processes of geologic change necessary to produce slate are dependent upon movements in the earth's crust and the heat and pressure generated thereby. For this reason, slate is found only in certain mountainous regions. The most economically important slate deposits in this country lie in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern states transversed by or bordering on the Appalachian Mountain chain. Variations in local chemistry and conditions under which the slate was formed have produced a wide range of colors and qualities and ultimately determine the character of the slate found in these areas.     Slate is available in a variety of colors. The most common are  grey, blue-grey, black, various shades of green, deep purple, brick red, and mottled varieties.  The presence of carbonaceous matter, derived from the decay of marine organisms on ancient sea floors, gives rise to the black colored slates. Compounds of iron generate the red, purple, and green colored slates.     Generally, the slates of Maine, Virginia, and the Peach Bottom district of York County, Pennsylvania are deep blue-black in color. Those of Virginia have a distinctive lustrous appearance as well due to their high mica content. The slates of Lehigh and Northampton Counties, Pennsylvania, are grayish-black in color. Green, red, purple, and mottled slates derive from the New York-Vermont district. The slate producing region of New York, which centers around Granville and Middle Granville, is particularly important because it contains one of the few commercial deposits of red slate in the world.     Slates are also classified as fading or unfading according to their color stability. Fading slates change to new shades or may streak within a short time after exposure to the atmosphere due to the presence of finegrained disseminated pyrite. For example, the ""weathering green"" or ""seagreen"" slates of New York and Vermont are grayish green when freshly quarried. Upon exposure, from 20% to 60% of the slates typically weather to soft tones of orange-brown, buff, and gray while the others retain their original shade. Slates designated as unfading maintain their original colors for many years.     Color permanence generally provides no indication of the durability of slate. Rather, time has shown that the Vermont and New York slates will last about 125 years; Buckingham Virginia slates 175 years or more; and Pennsylvania SoftVein slates in excess of 60 years; Pennsylvania HardVein slates and Peach Bottom slates, neither of which is still quarried, had life spans of roughly 100 and at least 200 years respectively. The life spans provided should be used only as a general guide in determining whether or not an existing slate roof is nearing the end of its serviceable life.     Ribbons are visible as bands on the cleavage face of slate and represent geologic periods during which greater amounts of carbonaceous matter, calcite, or coarse quartz particles were present in the sediment from which the slate was formed. Ribbons typically weather more and were most common in Pennsylvania slate quarries. As they were not as durable as clear slates, ribbon slate is no longer manufactured for roofing purposes. Mottled grey slates from Vermont are the closest match for Pennsylvania ribbon slate available today.     In recent years, slates from China, Africa, Spain and other countries have begun to be imported into the United States, primarily for distribution on the West Coast. The use of imported slates should probably be limited to new construction since their colors and textures often do not match those of U.S. slate.      Deterioration of Slate and Slate Roofs                                                             The white blotches on these Pennsylvania Soft-Vein slates indicate areas where gypsum is leaching out onto the surfaces of the slates. Photo: Jeffrey S. Levine.                                                   The durability of a slate roof depends primarily on four factors: the physical and mineralogical properties of the slate; the way in which it is fabricated; installation techniques employed; and, regular and timely maintenance. The first three of these factors are examined below. The maintenance and repair of slate roofs are discussed in later sections of this Brief.     The natural weathering of roofing slate manifests itself as a slow process of chipping and scaling along the cleavage planes. Paper thin laminations flake off the surface of the slate and the slate becomes soft and spongy as the inner layers begin to come apart, or delaminate. The nature of the sound given off by a slate when tapped with one's knuckles or slating hammer is a fair indication of its condition. Highgrade slate, when poised upon the fingertips and struck, will emit a clear, solid sound. Severely weathered slates are much less sonorous, and give off a dull thud when tapped.     The weathering of slate is chiefly due to mineral impurities (primarily calcite and iron sulfides) in the slate which, in concert with alternating wet/dry and hot/cold cycles, react to form gypsum. Because gypsum molecules take up about twice as much volume as calcite molecules, internal stresses result from the reaction, causing the slate to delaminate. This type of deterioration is as prominent on the underside of the roof as on the exposed surface due to the leaching and subsequent concentration of gypsum in this area. Consequently, deteriorated roofing slates typically cannot be flipped over and reused.                                                              Paper thin lamination can be seen flaking off this weathered, 120 year piece of Pennsylvania Hard-Vein slate. Photo: Jeffrey S. Levine.                                                   The chemical and physical changes which accompany slate weathering cause an increase in absorption and a decrease in both strength and toughness. The tendency of old, weathered slates to absorb and hold moisture can lead to rot in underlying areas of wood sheathing. Such rot can go undetected for long periods of time since, often, there is no accompanying leak. Due to their loss of strength, weathered slates are more prone to breakage, loss of corners, and cracking.     Slates with low calcite content tend to weather slowly. Dense slates, with low porosity, likewise decay slower than slates with equal calcite, but with a greater porosity. The pitch of a roof can also affect its longevity. The steeper the pitch, the longer the slate can be expected to last as water will run off faster and will be less likely to be drawn under the slates by capillary action or driven under by wind forces. Spires and the steep slopes of Mansard roofs often retain their original slate long after other portions of the roof have been replaced. Areas of a roof subject to concentrated water flows and ice damming, such as along eaves and valleys, also tend to deteriorate more rapidly than other areas of the roof.                                                              View of these slates laid on open sheathing shows that delamination and flaking are just as bad or worse on the underside of slates as on the exposed surface. This is why most slates cannot be flipped over for reuse. Photo: Jeffrey S. Levine.                                                   Mechanical agents, such as thermal expansion and contraction and the action of frost, are subordinate in the weathering of slate, coming into play only after the slate has been materially altered from its original state by the chemical transformation of calcite to gypsum. The more rapid deterioration of slates found on roof slopes with the most severe exposure to the sun, wind, and rain (typically, but not always, a southern exposure) may be attributable to the combined result of the deleterious effects of impurities in the slate and mechanical agents. Atmospheric acids produce only negligible deterioration in roofing slate.     It is difficult to assess the procedures by which a piece of slate has been fabricated without visiting the quarry and observing the process first hand. The location and size of nail holes, grain orientation, the condition of corners, and the number of broken pieces are all things which may be observed in a shipment of slate to judge the quality of its fabrication. Nail holes should be clean and with a shallow countersink on the face of the slate for the nail head; grain oriented along the length of the slate; and, corners left whole. An allowance for 10% breakage in shipment is typically provided for by the quarry.     Installation problems often involve the improper nailing and lapping of slates. The nailing of slates differs from that of other roofing materials. Slate nails should not be driven tight as is the case with asphalt and wood shingles. Rather, they should be set such that the slate is permitted to hang freely on the nail shank. Nails driven too far will crack the slate and those left projecting will puncture the overlying slate.  Nail heads left exposed accelerate roof deterioration by providing a point for water entry. Non-ferrous slater's nails, such as solid copper or stainless steel, should always be used since plain steel and galvanized nails will usually rust out long before the slate itself begins to deteriorate. The rusting of nineteenth century cut nails is a common cause of slate loss on historic roofs.     When joints are improperly broken (i.e., when slates lap the joints in the course below by less than 3"" [7.5 cm]), it is possible for water to pass between the joints, through the nail holes and ultimately to the underlying felt, where it will cause deterioration and leaks to develop. Insufficient headlap can also result in leaks as water entering the joints between slates may have a greater tendency to be wind blown beyond the heads of the slates in the course below.     Occasionally, individual slates are damaged. This may be caused by falling tree limbs, ice dams in gutters, valleys, and chimney crickets, the weight of a workman walking on the roof, or a naturally occurring fault in the slate unit. Whatever the form of damage, if it is caught soon enough, the roof can usually be repaired or selectively replaced and deterioration mitigated.     The ability to lay slate properly so as to produce a watertight and aesthetically pleasing roof requires training, much practice, and the right tools. The installation and repair of slate roofs should be entrusted only to experienced slaters.      Repairing Slate Roofs    Broken, cracked, and missing slates should be repaired promptly by an experienced slater in order to prevent water damage to interior finishes, accelerated deterioration of the roof and roof sheathing, and possible structural degradation to framing members.     The damaged slate is first removed by cutting or pulling out its nails with a ripper. If steel cut nails, rather than copper nails, were used in laying the roof, adjacent slates may be inadvertently damaged or displaced in the ripping process, and these, too, will have to be repaired. If the slate does not slide out by itself, the pointed end of the ,slate hammer can be punched into the slate and the slate dragged out. A new slate, or salvaged slate, which should match the size, shape, texture, and weathered color of the old slate, is then slid into place and held in position by one nail inserted through the vertical joint between the slates in the course above and approximately one inch below the tail of the slate two courses above.                                                            After removing the deteriorated slate and sliding the new slate into place, it is secured with a copper nail.  A copper bib (shown here) is formed to protect the newly created nail hole. Finally, a slate hammer is used to push the bib in place over the nail head. Photo: Jeffrey S. Levine.                                                 To prevent water penetration through the newly created nail hole, a piece of copper with a friction fit, measuring roughly 3"" (7.5 cm) in width and 8"" (20 cm) in length, is slid lengthwise under the joint between the two slates located directly above the new slate and over the nail. Alternate methods for securing the replacement slate include the use of metal hooks, clips, and straps that are bent over the tail end of the slate. The application of roofing mastic or sealants to damaged slates should not be considered a viable repair alternative because these materials, though effective at first, will eventually harden and crack, thereby allowing water to enter.   Mastic also makes future repairs more difficult to execute, is unsightly, and, when applied to metal flashings, accelerates their corrosion.     When two or more broken slates lie adjacent to each other in the same course, or when replacing leaky valley flashings, it is best to form pyramids (i.e., to remove a diminishing number of slates from higher courses) to keep the number of bibs required to a minimum. When reinstalling the slates, only the top slate in each pyramid will need a bib. Slates along the sides of the pyramid will receive two nails, one above the other, along the upper part of its exposed edge.     When many slates must be removed to effect a repair, the sheathing should be checked for rotted areas and projecting nails. Plywood is generally not a good replacement material for deteriorated wood sheathing due to the relative difficulty of driving a nail through it (the bounce produced can loosen adjacent slates). Instead, new wood boards of similar width and thickness to those being replaced should be used. Because the nominal thickness of today's dimension lumber is slightly thinner than that produced in the past, it may be necessary to shim the new wood boards so that they lie flush with the top surface of adjacent existing sheathing boards. Pressure treated lumber is not recommended due to its tendency to shrink. This can cause the slates to crack and become displaced.     To permit proper re-laying of the slate, the new roof sheathing must be of smooth and solid construction. At least two nails should be placed through the new boards at every rafter and joints between the ends of the boards should occur over rafters. Insufficient nailing will cause the boards to be springy, making nailing of the slates difficult and causing adjacent slates to loosen in the process. Unevenness in the sheathing will show in the finished roof surface and may cause premature cracking of the slate. Roof sheathing in valleys and along hips, ridges, and eaves may be covered with waterproof membrane underlayment rather than roofing felt for added protection against leakage.                                                              After a hurricane or other natural disaster, it may be necessary to stabilize a roof temporarily until materials can be obtained and a qualified roofing contractor hired. Significant slate roofs should not be stripped off and replaced with asphalt shingles. Photo: NPS files.                                                   In emergency situations, such as when severe hurricanes or tornadoes blow numerous slates off the roof, a temporary roof covering should be installed immediately after the storm to prevent further water damage to the interior of the building and to permit the drying out process to begin. Heavy gauge plastic and vinyl tarpaulins are often used for this purpose, though they are difficult to secure in place and can be blown off in high winds. Roll roofing, carefully stitched in to areas of the remaining roof, is a somewhat more functional solution that will allow sufficient time to document the existing roof conditions, plan repairs, and order materials.     Slate roof repair is viable for localized problems and damaged roofs with reasonably long serviceable lives remaining. If 20% or more of the slates on a roof or roof slope are broken, cracked, missing, or sliding out of position, it is usually less expensive to replace the roof than to execute individual repairs. This is especially true of older roofs nearing the end of their serviceable lives because even the most experienced slater will likely damage additional slates while attempting repairs. Depending on the age of the slate, its expected serviceable life, and the cause(s) of deterioration, it may or may not be cost effective to salvage slates. Where deteriorated nails or flashings are the cause of the roof failure, salvage of at least some slates should be possible for use in repairs. When salvaging slates, each must be sounded to discover cracks and faults and the degree to which it has weathered. It is usually wise to salvage slates when only a portion of the roof is to be replaced. In this way, the salvaged slates may be used for future repairs to the remaining sections of the roof.       The Replacement of Deteriorated Roofs    Historic slate roofs should be repaired rather than replaced whenever possible. Before replacing a slate roof, check for isolated damage, corroded and worn flashings, leaky gutters, poor ventilation in the attic, and other possible sources of moisture. All too often slate roofs are mistakenly replaced when, in fact, they could have been effectively repaired. Deciding whether an historic slate roof should be repaired or replaced can be difficult and each roof must be judged separately.     If repair is not possible and a new slate roof must be installed, it is important to remember that more than just the replacement of the slate is involved. The old slate should be removed to prevent overloading of the roof timbers. Stripping should be done in sections, with felt installed, to avoid exposing the entire subroof to the weather. ln the process, rotted wood sheathing should be replaced and the roof timbers checked for signs of stress including deflection, cracking, and twisting. If such conditions are found, a structural engineer experienced in working with older buildings should be consulted. Other repairs, such as chimney repointing, which may require access to the roof should be completed before the new roof is put on.     Drawings and specifications for a new slate roof should be prepared by a restoration architect, especially if the project is going to be competitively bid or if the roof is particularly complex. Standard specifications, like those published in 1926 by the National Slate Association may be used as a basis for developing specifications appropriate for a particular project. The specifications and drawings should contain all the information necessary to replicate the original appearance of the roof as closely as possible. Certain changes may have to be accepted, however, since several types of slate once prominent in this country, such as ribbon slate, are no longer quarried. It is wise to anticipate the replacement of older roofs so that proper planning can be undertaken and financial resources set aside, thereby, reducing the likelihood of rash last minute decisions.                                                                Prior to a replacing a roof, historical documentation is gathered (such as photo documentation) to determine the roof configuration. Photo: NPS files.                                                   Roofing slate is sold by the square in the United States. One square is enough to cover 100 square feet (13.3 square meters) of plain roof surface when laid with a standard headlap of 3"" (7.5cm). When ordering slate, considerable lead time should be allowed as delivery may take anywhere from 4 to 12 weeks and even as long as 1 year for special orders. Orders for random widths of a particular slate can generally be filled more quickly than orders for fixed widths. Once on site, slates should be stored on edge, under cover on pallets.     A roof and its associated flashings, gutters, and downspouts function as a system to shed water. Material choices should be made with this in mind. For example, use a single type of metal for all flashings and the rainwater conductor system to avoid galvanic action. Choose materials with life spans comparable to that of the slate, such as nonferrous nails. Use heavier gauge flashings or sacrificial flashings in areas that are difficult to access or subject to concentrated water flows.     Flashings are the weakest point in any roof. Given the permanence of slate, it is poor economy to use anything but the most durable of metals and the best workmanship for installing flashings. Copper is one of the best flashing materials, and along with terne, is most often associated with historic slate roofs. Copper is extremely durable, easily worked and soldered, and requires little maintenance. Sixteen ounce copper sheet is the minimum weight recommended for flashings. Lighter weights will not endure the erosive action of dust and grit carried over the roof by rain water. Heavier weight, 20 oz. (565 grams) or 24 oz. (680 grams), copper should be used in gutters, valleys, and areas with limited accessibility. Lead coated copper has properties similar to copper and is even more durable due to its additional lead coating. Lead coated copper is often used in restoration work.     Terne is a less desirable flashing material since it must be painted periodically. Terne coated stainless steel (TCS) is a modernday substitute for terne. Although more difficult to work than terne, TCS will not corrode if left unpainted; a great advantage, especially in areas that are difficult to access.     Once a metal is chosen, it is important to use it throughout for all flashings, gutters, downspouts, and metal roofs. Mixing of dissimilar metals can lead to rapid corrosion of the more electronegative metal by galvanic action. Where flashings turn up a vertical surface, they should be covered with a cap flashing. Slates which overlap metal flashings should be nailed in such a manner as to avoid puncturing the metal. This may be accomplished by punching a second hole about 2"" (5cm) above the existing hole on the side of the slate not overlapping the metal flashing. It is important that holes be punched from the back side of the slate. In this way, a shallow countersink is created on the face of the slate in which the head of the nail may sit.     The use of artificial, mineral fiber slate is not recommended for restoration work since its rigid appearance is that of a manmade material and not one of nature. Artificial slates may also have a tendency to fade over time. And, although artificial slate costs less than natural slate, the total initial cost of an artificial slate roof is only marginally less than a natural slate roof. This is because all the other costs associated with replacing a slate roof, such as the cost of labor, flashings, and tearingoff the old roof, are equal in both cases. Over the long term, natural slate tends to be a better investment because several artificial slate roofs will have to be installed during the life span of one natural slate roof.                                                              Roofing felt is being installed over the decking; a rubberized membrane is used selctively at the eaves and under some flashing. Photo: NPS files.                                                   Clear roof expanses can be covered by an experienced slater and one helper at the rate of about two to three squares per day. More complex roofs and the presence of chimneys, dormers, and valleys can bring this rate down to below one square per day. One square per day is a good average rate to use in figuring how long a job will take to complete. This takes into account the installation of flashings and gutters and the setup and breakdown of scaffolding. Tear-off of the existing roof will require additional time.        Repair/Replacement Guideline    The following guideline is provided to assist in the repair/replace decision making process:  1.  Consider the age and condition of the roof versus its expected serviceable life given the type of slate employed.     2.  Calculate the number of damaged and missing slates. Is the number less than about 20%? Is the roof generally in good condition? If so, the roof should be evaluated for repair rather than replacement. Also, keep in mind that the older a roof becomes, the more maintenance it will likely require.     3.  Determine if there are active leaks and what their source may be. Do not assume the slates are leaking. Gutters, valleys and flashings are more likely candidates. ""False leaks"" can be caused by moisture condensation in the attic due to improper ventilation.     4.  Check the roof rafters and sheathing for moisture stains. Poke an awl into the wood to determine if it is rotted. Remember that very old, delaminating slates will hold moisture and cause adjacent wood members to deteriorate even if there are no apparent leaks.     5.  Are many slates sliding out of position? If so, it may be that ferrous metal fasteners were used and that these are corroding, while the slates are still in good condition. Salvage the slates and relay them on the roof. If the slates have worn around the nails holes, it may be necessary to punch new holes before relaying them.     6.  Consider the condition of the roof's flashings. Because slate is so durable, metal flashings often wear out before the slate does. Examine the flashings carefully. Even the smallest pinhole can permit large quantities of water to enter the building. Is the deterioration of the slate uniform? Often this is not the case. It may be that only one slope needs replacement and the other slopes can be repaired. In this way, the cost of replacement can be spread over many years.     7.  Press down hard on the slates with your hand. Sound slates will be unaffected by the pressure. Deteriorated slates will feel brittle and will crack. Tap on slates that have fallen out or been removed. A full, deep sound indicates a slate in good condition, while a dull thud suggests a slate in poor condition.     8.  Are new slates readily available? Even if replacement is determined to be necessary, the existing roof may have to be repaired to allow time for documentation and the ordering of appropriate replacement slates.      Note:  measurements in this publication are given in both U.S. Customary System and International (Metric) System for comparative purposes. Metric conversions are in some cases approximate and should not be relied upon in preparing technical specifications.       Maintenance    Given the relatively high initial cost of installing a new slate roof, it pays to inspect its overall condition annually and after several storms. For safety reasons, it is recommended that building owners and maintenance personnel carry out roof surveys from the ground using binoculars or from a cherry picker. Cracked, broken, misaligned, and missing slates and the degree to which delamination has occurred should be noted, along with failed flashings (pin holes, open seams, loose and misaligned elements, etc.) and broken or clogged downspouts. A roof plan or sketch and a camera can aid in recording problems and discussing them with contractors. In the attic, wood rafters and sheathing should be checked for water stains and rot. Critical areas are typically near the roof plate and at the intersection of roof planes, such as at valleys and hips. Regular maintenance should include cleaning gutters at least twice during the fall and once in early spring, and replacing damaged slates promptly. Every five to seven years inspections should be conducted by professionals experienced in working with slate and steep slopes. Good record keeping, in the form of a log book and the systematic filing of all bills and samples, can help in piecing together a roof's repair history and is an important part of maintenance.     As part of regular maintenance, an attempt should be made to keep foot traffic off the roof. If maintenance personnel, chimney sweeps, painters, or others must walk on the roof, it is recommended that ladders be hooked over the ridge and that the workmen walk on the ladders to better distribute their weight. If slates are to be walked on, it is best to wear soft soled shoes and to step on the lowermiddle of the exposed portion of the slate unit.      Conclusion    Slate roofs are a critical design feature of many historic buildings that cannot be duplicated using substitute materials. Slate roofs can, and should be, maintained and repaired to effectively extend their serviceable lives. When replacement is necessary, details contributing to the appearance of the roof should be retained. High quality slate is still available from reputable quarries and, while a significant investment, can be a cost effective solution over the long term.

GX001-50-16303891	"Forest Preserve District of Cook County (Illinois)       Nature Bulletin No. 669-A   March 4, 1978 Forest Preserve District of Cook County George W. Dunne, President Roland F. Eisenbeis, Supt. of Conservation  ****:SLATE, SHALE & MUDSTONE  There is a little book by Robert Irving about rocks and minerals. In the  first chapter, ""Every Rock Tells a Story, "" he tells these stories in a  simple way. Perhaps the title of this bulletin should have been reversed,  or merely MUD, because the story about mudstone, shale and slate  begins with mud.  Since more than a thousand million years ago, vast areas of what is now  the United States were repeatedly covered during long periods by  shallow seas. Each time, until a sea disappeared when the land was  lifted, rivers flowed into it. Where the sediment they carried was mostly  clay from weathered and ground-up rocks, it was deposited in layers of  mud on the sea floor. Shells of marine animals, and wind-blown dust  from volcanoes, sank to the bottom and were buried in mud.  Pressed down by its own weight and that of the water, the mud  sometimes solidified into Mudstone, a tough structureless substance  with no planes of cleavage and no strength. Some outcroppings of coal  in the bluffs along the Illinois River Valley are overlaid with this  material, incorrectly called ""soapstone. "" When unsupported and  exposed to the weather it soon crumbles into grayish powder. But, if the  bed of mud was very thick, and especially if deep layers of limestone or  of sandstone were deposited on top of it by another sea, it was  compressed and converted into a soft rock called Shale.  Shale, in addition to kaolin, small flakes of mica and bits of quartz  sand, may contain other minerals. It may be gray, or brown because of  an oxide of iron, or black and rich in carbon from the remains of plants  that lived in the sea. Shales are abundant throughout the world. They  are so weak, and so apt to split and erode when exposed to the weather,  that they cannot be used as building stone but some are included in the  manufacture of cement.  Oil shales contain petroleum or asphalt, formerly supposed to be  derived from myriads of tiny animals buried in the clay when it was laid  down. In Scotland, paraffin and olefin oils have been extracted from  shale since 1862. Deposits in New South Wales, Australia, yield 100  gallons per ton. In western Colorado and eastern Utah there are  mountains of oil shale. A process for extracting the oil is being  developed and those colossal deposits could supply the U.S. with  petroleum for many years.  Shale, like sandstone and limestone, is a sedimentary rock. Slate is a  metamorphic rock. It was formed from a bed of shale which, deeply  buried, was subjected to heat and enormous pressure when the earth's  crust shrank, folded, and mountains were created. As a result the shale's  minerals were rearranged and straight lines of cleavage developed at an  angle to the original bedding, so that it is easily split into layers.  Slate is fine-grained, heavy, hard, strong and very durable. It has been  quarried in Europe and the British Isles for hundreds of years. In the  United States there are quarries in several eastern states from Georgia  to Maine but principally in Vermont, northeastern New York (sole  source of red slate), and Pennsylvania where, in one quarry at Pen  Argyll, broad thin sheets of extraordinary size are produced. Slate is  widely used for roofing, blackboards, billiard table tops, laundry tubs,  and the bases of aquariums. Although the commonest color is gray,  shading toward black, slate is marketed in various sizes and thicknesses  for roofing and for flagstone paving in colors such as blue-gray, green  and gray, mottled green and purple, Vermont black, and red.  When we old folks went to school we used slates in wooden frames,  bound with red yarn, and slate pencils that would screech and make the  teacher mad.

GX261-76-12037828	"E. Proposed Plans for Dam Removal 1. Wildcat Diversion Dam a. Site access and mobilization. - Site access to Wildcat Diversion Dam is provided by traveling approximately 1 mile south of Battle Creek Bottom Road on an unimproved (dirt) road to the plateau (or north rim) above the dam, and by foot along a narrow trail to the right abutment of the dam. The damsite is owned by PG&E, but the access road crosses private property. Necessary approvals for site access would have to be obtained from private landowners. Electric power (110 V) is currently available at the site via an overhead transmission line. It is assumed that a contractor staging area would be established on the right abutment plateau. Construction equipment would probably be transported down to the damsite by helicopter, except for smaller equipment and tools that could be carried down the access trail. Helicopter service may be available from Redding Air Services, Redding, California (phone 530-221-2851) or from Erickson AirCrane Company, Central Point, Oregon (phone 541-664-7615). The use of a helicopter for site mobilization would probably require removal of the power transmission line at the site. Potential alternative methods using a fixed cableway or a large mobile crane would probably be too costly or otherwise infeasible, and were not assumed for the current cost estimates. The reconnaissance estimate is based on the use of a Skycrane to deliver and remove a Cat 311 excavator with hoe-ram (or equivalent) and other equipment (including air compressors) to the site. b. Streamflow diversion. - Using the construction sequence and diversion assumptions outlined in the previous section, a streamflow diversion requirement of 30 ft3/s was adopted for this study. The existing 30-inch-diameter pipe through the right end of the dam could be used to drain the reservoir under these flow conditions to about elevation 1074, or 0.7 feet below the existing dam crest, provided the canal pipeline is first removed from the downstream end of the 30inch pipe. If the existing 24-inch-diameter sluiceway is also used, the reservoir could be drawn down to about elevation 1073.2, or 1.5 feet below the existing dam crest. Sediment accumulations at the intakes may have to be excavated prior to diversion, since the canal intake and sluiceway have not been used since 1995. Excavation of a 3.5-foot-wide portion of the masonry dam at the fish ladder structure, to the original streambed grade, and subsequent breach of the fish ladder walls, would lower the reservoir an additional 4 feet, to about elevation 1069. c. Structure removal. - Features to be removed at Wildcat Diversion Dam would include the masonry dam overflow and nonoverflow sections, the fish ladder structure, the gated sluiceway, and the canal pipeline. The power transmission line may be retained for the new streamflow gauge below the damsite. Retention of the left abutment nonoverflow section and the fish ladder would unnecessarily constrict the natural channel to about 27 feet, or less than one-half the natural channel widths at both the Wildcat and Eagle Canyon damsites. The fish ladder structure may also pose a potential public safety hazard if left intact, with a maximum pool depth of 6.5 feet and with walls up to 8 feet high. Portions of the 11   24-inch-diameter canal pipeline are currently used as an access walkway to the stream, and represent a potential public safety hazard from falls. Future deterioration of the abandoned steel pipeline and support structures, potential floatation of the empty pipe during flood flows, and simple aesthetics, would also warrant their removal. A potential candidate for retention, however, is the canal intake structure on the right abutment of the dam. Already equipped with an access walkway and handrails, the intake structure could provide a safe vantage point for inspection of the site following removal of the dam, or for access to the new streamflow gauge, while minimizing removal costs. Cost estimates for both partial and full dam removal are included in this study. All structures would be fully documented in an Historic American Engineering Record (HAER) for the damsite. Using the available diversion capacity to maintain the reservoir level below the crest of the overflow section would allow demolition activities to begin on the dam crest. Excavation of a notch within the masonry structure using the excavator with hoe-ram and jackhammers would permit further lowering of the reservoir. Location of the notch within the existing fish ladder structure could provide some additional degree of control by limiting the differential head at the notch. Continued demolition of the masonry structure to the original streambed level would be performed by the excavator in the flow, with water depths averaging less than three feet. The cost estimates assume the masonry would readily break up at the mortared joints, and the masonry rubble would be spread out in the downstream channel. The concrete in the fish ladder structure, amounting to about 10 yd3 (with a total weight of about 20 tons) could be flown out in pieces, including any reinforcing steel, using a helicopter and a skip or bucket. Alternative demolition methods using chemical expansion in drilled holes to promote cracking could also be considered. The use of explosives at this site may create unacceptable environmental, safety, and upper slope stability concerns of the rimrock on the canyon walls, and is strongly discouraged. The cost estimate for partial removal assumes excavation of the masonry structure to the face of the intake structure, including removal of the 24-inch-diameter sluice gate, hoist, and pipe. The 36-inch-diameter slide gate, hoist, trashrack, and 15-foot-long section of 30-inch-diameter pipe would be retained, with the slide gate permanently closed and the downstream end of the pipe capped or plugged. Although the access walkway and handrails to the intake structure would be retained, all other miscellaneous metalwork, including CMP standpipes and automated control equipment, would be removed for salvage. The 24-inch-diameter steel pipeline portion of the Wildcat Canal would be cut up and airlifted out in approximate 20-foot sections over much of its 5,530-foot length. Steel pipe supports, standpipes, and catwalk sections along the canal alignment would also be airlifted out. The cost estimate for full removal includes the complete removal of all concrete saddles and footings along the pipeline alignment, and removal of the canal intake structure and all miscellaneous metalwork. Although both cost estimates include backfilling of the canal channel and removal of a county bridge crossing, a downstream landowner (Mr. Crawford) has reportedly expressed an interest in retaining a portion of the shallow canal section 12   and up to 400 or 500 feet of the steel pipeline for his own use, which may result in some reduction of the estimated removal cost. This would require suitable measures to prevent potential adverse impacts, however. d. Site restoration. - The left abutment and channel sections would be removed to streambed grade, with all concrete removed and with the masonry rubble distributed across the downstream channel. The partial dam removal plan would retain the intake structure and ancillary items on the right abutment, as well as the concrete footings for the Wildcat canal pipeline. Sediment management at the site is discussed in Section G. A final site inspection should be performed following the winter and spring runoff to confirm the adequacy of the dam removal work. 2. Eagle Canyon Diversion Dam a. Site access and mobilization. - Site access to Eagle Canyon Diversion Dam is provided by traveling approximately 1 mile north of Manton Road on an unimproved (dirt) road to a plateau (or south rim) above the dam, and by foot about 1/4 mile along a narrow trail to the left abutment of the dam. The damsite and the access road are located on private property. Necessary approvals for site access would have to be obtained from private landowners. Electric power (110 V) is currently available at the site via an overhead transmission line. It is assumed that a contractor staging area would be established on the left abutment plateau. Construction equipment would probably be transported down to the damsite by helicopter, except for smaller equipment and tools that could be carried down along the existing trail. Helicopter service may be available from either Redding Air Services, Redding, California (phone 530-221-2851) or from Erickson Air-Crane Company, Central Point, Oregon (phone 541-664-7615). The use of a helicopter for site mobilization would probably require early removal of the power transmission line at the site. Potential alternative methods using a fixed cableway or a large mobile crane would probably be too costly or otherwise infeasible, and were not assumed for the current cost estimates. The reconnaissance estimate is based on the use of a Skycrane to deliver and remove a Cat 311 excavator with hoe-ram (or equivalent) and other equipment (including air compressors) to the site. b. Streamflow diversion. - Using the construction sequence and diversion assumptions outlined in the previous section, a streamflow diversion requirement of 70 ft3/s was adopted for this study. The existing 4- by 10-foot radial sluice gate through the center portion of the masonry dam would be used to draw the reservoir level down to about elevation 1406.2, which is 6.2 feet below the dam crest (at elevation 1412.4) and 3.4 feet below the weir crest (at elevation 1409.4). Subsequent demolition of the far right end of the dam would further lower the reservoir level to facilitate other dam removal activities. c. Structure removal. - Features to be removed at Eagle Canyon Diversion Dam would include the masonry dam, the masonry weir crest structure, the radial gate structure, the Alaska Steeppass fish ladder, the concrete steppool structure, the metal canal flume structures, the concrete bench flume sections, and the power transmission line. Retention of the existing canal wall and gate winch block was assumed for the partial removal estimate to reduce removal costs and provide a 13   waste disposal area at the site, within the canal channel. The metal canal flume structures and the concrete bench flume sections would be removed for both cost estimates to avoid a potential public safety hazard and to restore the natural appearance of the canyon. The cost estimate for full removal includes the removal of all reinforced concrete footings along the metal flume alignment, and removal of the canal wall and gate winch block at the damsite. All structures would be fully documented in an Historic American Engineering Record (HAER) for the damsite. Using the available diversion capacity to maintain the reservoir level below the crest of the dam and weir crest would allow demolition activities to begin in the dry. Excavation of the right end of the dam using the excavator with hoe-ram and jackhammers would permit further lowering of the reservoir, assuming the flow would erode a channel through the upstream sediments. Continued demolition of both masonry structures to the original streambed level would be performed by the excavator in the flow, with water depths averaging less than three feet. The cost estimates assume the masonry would readily break up at the mortared joints, and the masonry rubble would be spread out in the downstream channel. Waste concrete, including any reinforcing steel, would be airlifted out using a helicopter and a skip or bucket, or for the partial removal estimate, be placed behind the canal wall to the extent possible. The canal section at the damsite has an average width of about 10 feet and a minimum depth of about 5 feet, for a distance of 142 feet from the face of the dam to the upstream portal of tunnel No. 1. The existing canal wasteway gate would be permanently closed, and the gate hoist would be removed, for the partial removal estimate. Alternative demolition methods using chemical expansion in drilled holes to promote cracking could also be considered. The use of explosives at this site may create unacceptable environmental, safety, and upper slope stability concerns of the rimrock on the canyon walls, and is strongly discouraged. A PG&E employee was killed near the damsite several years ago due to falling rock. The cost estimates include removal of the 4- by 10-foot radial gate and winch, and of the 3.5- by 6-foot structural steel slide gate and Limitorque operator at the canal intake. The intake gate superstructure and metal roof, and CMP standpipes, would also be removed from the site. Retention of the existing metal stairway (constructed about 1985) and pipe handrails would provide safe access along the canal wall for inspection of the site following dam removal, and is assumed for the partial removal estimate to reduce costs. All PVC pipes and selected concrete and timber structures used by PG&E in the past to collect and divert spring flows into the canal should be removed to improve the appearance and safety of the existing trail to the damsite. All accessible tunnel portals should be sealed to prevent entry, including both portals for the diversion tunnel at the damsite, the upstream portal of tunnel No. 1, and at least one other tunnel portal. The use of heavy steel security screens would permit future inspections of the tunnel conditions as required. Alternatively, the installation of tunnel supports (if needed) and concrete or masonry plugs at the portals may be considered for permanent closure. Both cost estimates assume the placement of concrete plugs at four tunnel portals. All concrete and forming materials are assumed to be delivered by helicopter. 14   The metal canal flume sections would have to be disassembled and bundled for removal by helicopter. The cost estimates assume all flume sheets and associated hardware would first be stacked in cradles for airlifting; followed by removal of the cross-beams, longitudinal bracing, and girders from alternating 20-foot spans, and bundling them with the adjacent framework sections. The framework sections with bundled pieces would be unbolted from their footings and airlifted out. Spillway sections, feeder pipes, access walkways, stairways, and other miscellaneous metalwork would also be removed. The weight estimates used for this study were provided by PG&E, based on the original construction quantities from 1980 to 1983 for a type #132 flume, with an additional allowance of 30 percent for I-beam footings, stairways, and other features. It is assumed that all metal items would be airlifted to the canyon rim, for possible use by private landowners or sale as scrap. Removal of the reinforced concrete footings (for the full removal estimate) assumes the footings would be demolished in place and airlifted out in a skip to a suitable disposal site. The reinforced ""L-wall"" portions of the concrete bench flumes would be sawcut and flown out in sections, and the gunite lining would be demolished and flown out in a skip. The open width and estimates; purposes, channel portions of the Eagle Canyon Canal, with an 8-foot bottom a 4-foot depth, are assumed to remain intact for the current cost however, some minor modifications may be necessary for public safety to prevent potential injury to people or livestock.  d. Site restoration. - All portions of the masonry dam and upstream weir structures would be removed to the original streambed grade, with the rubble distributed across the downstream channel. Retention of the canal wall at the damsite for waste disposal (under the partial removal plan) would require the placement of gravel and cobbles from the reservoir sediments on top of the waste materials. The existing springs would flow across this backfill to the river channel. Sediment management at the site is discussed in Section G. A final site inspection should be performed following the winter and spring runoff to confirm the adequacy of the dam removal work. 3. Coleman Diversion Dam a. Site access and mobilization. - Site access to Coleman Diversion Dam is provided by traveling approximately 1/4 mile south of Manton Road on a paved road to the right abutment of the dam. The damsite and access road are owned and maintained by PG&E. Electric power (110 V) is currently available at the site. It is assumed that a contractor staging area would be established on the right abutment near the dam. Construction equipment would be transported to the site using the existing roads. b. Streamflow diversion. - Using the construction sequence and diversion assumptions outlined in the previous section, a streamflow diversion requirement of 30 ft3/s was adopted for this study. The existing 14- by 8-foot radial gate near the right end of the dam would be used to drain the reservoir under these flow conditions to about elevation 996.2, which is 7.1 feet below the dam crest (at 15   elevation 1003.3) and 6.1 feet below the weir crest (at elevation 1002.3). Excavation of a notch within the masonry dam to the original streambed grade would further reduce the reservoir level. As noted previously, it may be possible to divert all natural streamflow into the Inskip Canal at Inskip Diversion Dam, and return 30 ft3/s to the South Fork downstream of Coleman Diversion Dam, permitting complete unwatering of the damsite during construction using existing facilities. Alternatively, the construction of a temporary cofferdam and the installation of a fish screen at the Inskip Powerhouse tailrace could permit the diversion of all streamflow from South Fork Battle Creek into the Coleman Canal at the Inskip Powerhouse, to reduce potential environmental impacts associated with unwatering a greater portion of the stream. This should be evaluated further for future dam removal studies. c. Structure removal. - Features to be removed at Coleman Diversion Dam would include the masonry dam overflow section with concrete overlay, the radial sluice gate structure, and the Alaska Steeppass fish ladder on the right abutment. The original fish ladder structure on the left abutment was abandoned in place about 20 years ago with no apparent problems, and is assumed to remain under the partial removal estimate to reduce demolition costs. Removal of the other structures would result in a channel width of about 100 feet, which is adequate. Retention of the Coleman Canal retaining wall and weir crest structure may facilitate construction of the direct pipe connection between the Inskip Powerhouse tailrace and the Coleman Canal. If retained, the stability of the existing wall should be checked for potential fill loads during final design, with a suitable tieback system (or buttress) added if necessary. All structures would be fully documented in an Historic American Engineering Record (HAER) for the damsite. The cost estimates for this study assume that the direct pipe connection, to be designed by DWR, has been constructed prior to removal of the dam, and that the canal intake area has already been backfilled to the adjoining ground surface. This would provide a working area immediately adjacent to the dam for removal activities, and would also provide a streamflow bypass capacity necessary to minimize diversion requirements. Using the available diversion capacity to maintain the reservoir level below the crest of the overflow section would allow demolition activities to begin on the dam crest. Excavation of a notch within the masonry structure to the original streambed grade, using a Cat 311 excavator with hoe-ram (or similar equipment) and jackhammers, would permit further lowering of the reservoir. Continued demolition of the masonry structure to the original streambed grade would be performed in the flow, with water depths averaging less than three feet. An excavator or a large dozer (such as a Caterpillar D-8 or D-9) could be used. The cost estimates assume the concrete overlay and the masonry would readily break up, and the masonry rubble would be spread across the downstream channel. The concrete sidewalls for the radial gate structure, the concrete box for the Alaska Steeppass fish ladder, and other waste concrete would be removed from the site for disposal in a suitable waste area. Alternative demolition methods using conventional drilling and blasting may be attractive at this site, due to the greater 16   height and thickness of the dam section compared to the Wildcat and Eagle Canyon Dams, and considering the accessibility of the site. The cost estimate for partial removal assumes excavation of the masonry structure between the abandoned fish ladder on the left abutment and the canal wall on the right abutment, including removal of the 14- by 8- foot radial gate and hoist, the 2-foot-wide fish ladder gate and hoist, the Alaska Steeppass fish ladder, and the steel footbridge from the right abutment. Other miscellaneous metalwork to be removed includes the pipe handrails and CMP standpipes. The cost estimate for full removal includes removal of the abandoned fish ladder on the left abutment and of the masonry gravity weir structure on the right abutment. Any removal or modification of the existing Coleman Canal retaining wall are assumed to be included in the cost estimates for the direct connection pipe from the Inskip Powerhouse tailrace. d. Site restoration. - The overflow portion of the masonry dam would be removed to the original streambed grade, with the rubble distributed across the downstream channel and the concrete waste removed from the site. The proposed partial removal plan would retain the original fish ladder structure on the left abutment, which has already been modified for abandonment, and the existing masonry gravity weir structure on the right abutment. Backfill behind the weir structure would be shaped and seeded to provide a natural appearance. Sediment management at the site is discussed in Section G, which may require the excavation of a new channel through the upstream sediment. A final site inspection should be performed following the winter and spring runoff to confirm the adequacy of the dam removal and upstream channelization work. F. Waste Disposal 1. Construction Debris Onsite disposal of construction debris should be used to the maximum practicable extent at all three damsites, to reduce costs. The masonry materials are believed to generally consist of rounded cobbles ranging between 6 inches and 2 feet in size, within a cement mortar matrix, and can safely be left within the stream channels, provided they are distributed sufficiently to prevent ponding. Waste concrete and other debris should be buried outside the stream channels, either within adjoining canals (as at Eagle Canyon Dam) or offsite. If a suitable disposal site cannot be found near each damsite, a commercial site, such as Anderson-Cottonwood Disposal (phone 530-221-4784), may be used. This study assumes disposal sites will be located within 1 mile of each damsite. Mechanical items and miscellaneous metalwork removed from the damsites may have some commercial value, and should be salvaged to help offset removal costs, as well as for environmental (recycling) considerations, if practicable. Landowners in the area have reportedly expressed some interest in the 24-inch-diameter pipe from the Wildcat Canal, and the semicircular flume plate sections from the Eagle Canyon Canal. The California Department of Fish and Game has expressed interest in the Alaska Steeppass fish ladders at the dams, for potential use at other sites.

Levine      History of Slate Use      Character and Detailing      Where Does Slate Come From?      Deterioration of Slate and Slate Roofs       Repairing Slate Roofs     The Replacement of Deteriorated Roofs       Maintenance     Conclusion                 A NOTE TO OUR USERS:  The web versions of the  Preservation Briefs  differ somewhat from the printed versions. Many illustrations are new, captions are simplified, illustrations are typically in color rather than black and white, and some complex charts have been omitted.                   Slate is one of the most aesthetically pleasing and durable of all roofing materials.  It is indicative at once of the awesome powers of nature which have formed it and the expertise and skill of the craftsman in handshaping and laying it on the roof. Installed properly, slate roofs require relatively little maintenance and will last 60 to 125 years or longer depending on the type of slate employed, roof configuration, and the geographical location of the property. Some slates have been known to last over 200 years. Found on virtually every class of structure, slate roofs are perhaps most often associated with institutional, ecclesiastical, and government buildings, where longevity is an especially important consideration in material choices. In the slate quarrying regions of the country, where supply is abundant, slate was often used on farm and agricultural buildings as well.                                                              Although slate replacement roofs are expensive, the superiority of materials and craftsmanship will give years of continued service. If amortized over the life of the roof, the replacement cost can be very reasonable. Photo: NPS files.                                                   Because the pattern, detailing, and craftsmanship of slate roofs are important design elements of historic buildings, they should be repaired rather than replaced whenever possible. The purpose of this Preservation Brief is to assist property owners, architects, preservationists, and building managers in understanding the causes of slate roof failures and undertaking the repair and replacement of slate roofs. Details contributing to the character of historic slate roofs are described and guidance is offered on maintenance and the degree of intervention required at various levels of deterioration.     The relatively large percentage of historic buildings roofed with slate during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries means that many slate roofs, and the 60 to 125 year life span of the slates most commonly used, may be nearing the end of their serviceable lives at the end of the twentieth century. Too often, these roofs are being improperly repaired or replaced with alternative roofing materials, to the detriment of the historic integrity and appearance of the structure. Increased knowledge of the characteristics of slate and its detailing and installation on the roof can lead to more sensitive interventions in which original material is preserved and the building's historic character maintained. Every effort should be made to replace deteriorated slate roofs with new slate and to develop an effective maintenance and repair program for slate roofs that can be retained.      History of Slate Use in the United States    Although slate quarrying was not common in the United States until the latter half of the nineteenth century, slate roofing is known to have been used prior to the Revolution. Archeological excavations at Jamestown, Virginia,have unearthed roofing slate in strata dating from 1625-1650 and 1640-1670. Slate roofs were introduced in Boston as early as 1654 and Philadelphia in 1699. Seventeenth century building ordinances of New York and Boston recommended the use of slate or tile roofs to ensure fireproof construction.                                                              Architectural pattern books of the mid-19th century awakened Americans to the  availability and quality of slate for roofing purposes. Drawing: Design XX, ""A French Roof House,"" in A.J. Downing's Victorian Cottage Residences.                                                    In the early years of the Colonies, nearly all roofing slate was imported from North Wales. It was not until 1785 that the first commercial slate quarry was opened in the United States, by William Docher in Peach Bottom Township, Pennsylvania. Production was limited to that which could be consumed in local markets until the middle of the nineteenth century. Knowledge of the nation's abundant stone resources was given commercial impetus at this time by several forces, including a rapidly growing population that demanded housing, advances in quarrying technology, and extension of the railroad system to previously inaccessible markets. Two additional factors helped push the slate industry to maturity: the immigration of Welsh slate workers to the United States and the introduction of architectural pattern and style books. Slate production increased dramatically in the years following the Civil War as quarries were opened in Vermont, New York, Virginia, and Lehigh and Northampton Counties, Pennsylvania. By 1876, roofing slate imports had all but dried up and the United States became a net exporter of the commodity.     The U.S. roofing slate industry reached its highest point in both quantity and value of output in the period from 1897 to 1914. In 1899, there were over 200 slate quarries operating in 13 states, Pennsylvania historically being the largest producer of all. The decline of the U.S. roofing slate industry began c.1915 and resulted from several factors, including a decline in skilled labor for both the fabrication and installation of slate and competition from substitute materials, such as asphalt shingles, which could be mass produced, transported and installed at a lower cost than slate. Only recently, with the increasing popularity of historic preservation and the recognition of the superiority of slate over other roofing materials, has slate usage begun to increase.      The Character and Detailing of Historic Slate Roofs    During some periods of architectural history, roof design has gone far beyond the merely functional and contributed much to the character of buildings. Roofs, by their compelling forms, have defined styles and, by their decorative patterns and colors, have imparted both dignity and beauty to buildings. The architectural styles prevalent during the latter half of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries placed strong emphasis on prominent roof lines and greatly influenced the demand for slate. Slate, laid in multicolored decorative patterns, was particularly well suited to the Mansard roofs of the Second Empire style, the steeply pitch roofs of the Gothic Revival and High Victorian Gothic styles, and the many prominent roof planes and turrets associated with the Queen Anne style. The Tudor style imitated the quaint appearance of some English slates which, because of their granular cleavage, are thick and irregular. These slates were often laid in a graduated pattern, with the largest slates at the eaves and the courses diminishing in size up the roof slope, or a textural pattern.  Collegiate Gothic style buildings, found on many university campuses, were often roofed with slate laid in a graduated pattern.                                                              This graduated slate roof is composed of large, thick slates at the eave which are reduced in size and thickness as the slating progresses to the ridge. Photo: Jeffrey S. Levine.                                                   The configuration, massing, and style of historic slate roofs are important design elements that should be preserved. In addition, several types of historic detailing were often employed to add visual interest to the roof essentially elevating the roof to the level of an ornamental architectural element. When repairing or replacing a slate roof, original details affecting its visual character should be retained.     Before repairing or replacing an existing slate roof, it is important to document the existing conditions and detailing of the roof using written, visual, and physical evidence so that original features can be identified and preserved. Documentation should continue through the repair or replacement process as significant details, long obscured, are often rediscovered while carrying out these activities. Local histories, building records, old receipts and ledgers, historic photographs, sketches, and paintings, shadow lines and nail hole patterns on the roof deck, and bits of historic material left over from previous interventions (often found in eave cavities) are all useful sources of information which can be of help in piecing together the original appearance of the roof. Size, shape, color, texture, exposure, and coursing are among the most important characteristics of the original slates which should be documented and matched when repairing or replacing an historic slate roof.     Historically, three types of slate roofing-- standard, textural, and graduated -were available according to the architectural effect desired. Standard grade slate roofs were most common. These are characterized by their uniform appearance, being composed of slates approximately 3/16"" (0.5cm) thick, of consistent length and width, and having a smooth cleavage surface. Thirty different standard sizes were available, ranging from 10"" (25cm) x 6"" to 24"" x 14"" (15cm x 61cm x 35cm). The slates were laid to break joints and typically had square ends and uniform color and exposure. Patterned and polychromatic roofs were created by laying standard slates of different colors and shapes on the roof in such a way as to create sunbursts, flowers, sawtooth and geometric designs, and even initials and dates. On utilitarian structures, such as barns and sheds, large gaps were sometimes left between each slate within a given course to reduce material and installation costs and provide added ventilation for the interior.     Textural slate roofs incorporate slates of different thicknesses, uneven tails, and a rougher texture than standard slates. Textural slate roofs are perhaps most often associated with Tudor style buildings where slates of different colors are used to enhance the effect.     Graduated slate roofs were frequently installed on large institutional and ecclesiastical structures. The slates were graduated according to thickness, size, and exposure, the thickest and largest slates being laid at the eaves and the thinnest and smallest at the ridge. Pleasing architectural effects were achieved by blending sizes and colors.                                                              Valleys are formed at the internal angle of two roofing slopes. Flashing is often placed under the slate to increase moisture protection at this vulnerable joint.  Photo: Jeffrey S. Levine.                                                   Detailing at the hips, ridges and valleys provided added opportunity to ornament a slate roof. Hips and ridges can be fashioned out of slate according to various traditional schemes whereby the slates are cut and overlapped to produce a watertight joint of the desired artistic effect. Traditional slate ridge details are the saddle ridge, strip saddle rid~e and comb ridge, and for hips, the saddle hip, mitered hip Boston hip, and fantail hip. A more linear effect was achieved by covering the ridges and hips with flashing called ""cresting"" or ""ridge roll"" formed out of sheet metal, terra cotta, or even slate. Snow guards, snow boards, and various types of gutter and rake treatments also contributed to the character of historic slate roofs.     Two types of valleys were traditionally employed, the  open valley  and the  closed valley . The open valley is lined with metal over which slates lap only at the sides. Closed valleys are covered with slate and have either a continuous metal lining or metal flashing built in with each course. Open valleys are easier to install and maintain, and are generally more watertight than closed valleys. Round valleys are a type of closed valley with a concave rather than Vshaped section. Given the broader sweep of the round valley, it was not uncommon for roofers to interweave asphalt saturated felts rather than copper sheet in the coursing in order to cut costs.     Although principally associated with graduated and textural slate roofs, round valleys were infrequently employed due to the difficulty and expense of their installation.     Common types of sheathing used include  wood boards, wood battens , and, for fireproof construction on institutional and government buildings,  concrete or steel . Solid wood sheathing was typically constructed of tongue and groove, square edged, or shiplapped pine boards of 1"" (2.5 cm) or 1-1/4"" (3 cm) nominal thickness. Boards from 6"" (15 cm) to 8"" (20 cm) wide and tongue and groove boards were generally preferred as they were less likely to warp and curl.     Wood battens, or open wood sheathing, consisted of wood strips, measuring from 2"" (5 cm) to 3"" (7.5 cm) in width, nailed to the roof rafters. Spacing of the battens depended on the length of the slate and equaled the exposure. Slates were nailed to the batten that transected its midsection. The upper end of the slate rested at least "" (1.25 cm) on the batten next above. Open wood sheathing was employed primarily on utilitarian, farm, and agricultural structures in the North and on residential buildings in the South where the insulating value of solid wood sheathing was not a strict requirement. To help keep out dust and wind driven rain on residential buildings, mortar was often placed along the top and bottom edge of each batten, a practice sometimes referred to as torching.                                                              Eave details include snow guards, snow boards, and gutter treatments. Snow guards are generally used in areas where the ice and snow accumulate to avoid dangerous slides from the roof.  Photo: Jeffrey S. Levine.                                                   Steel angles substituted for the wood battens in fireproof construction. The slates were secured using wire wrapped around the steel angle, where it was twistedoff tight. Alternately, any of a variety of special fasteners patented over the years could have been used to attach the slate to the steel angle. On roofs with concrete decks, slates were typically nailed to wood nailing strips embedded in the concrete.     Beginning in the late nineteenth century, asphalt saturated roofing felt was installed atop solid wood sheathing. The felt provided a temporary, watertight roof until the slate could be installed atop it. Felt also served to cushion the slates, exclude wind driven rain and dust, and ease slight unevenness between the sheathing boards.     Slate was typically laid in horizontal courses starting at the eaves with a standard headlap of 3"" (7.5 cm) (Figure 10). Headlap was generally reduced to 2"" (5 cm) on Mansard roofs and on particularly steep slopes with more than 20"" (50 cm) of rise per 12"" (30 cm) of run. Conversely, headlap was increased to 4"" (10 cm) or more on low pitched roofs with a rise of 8"" (20 cm) or less per 12"" (30 cm) of horizontal run. The minimum roof slope necessary for a slate roof was 4"" (10 cm) of rise per 12"" (30 cm) of run.      Where Does Slate Come From?    Slate is a fine grained, crystalline rock derived from sediments of clay and fine silt which were deposited on ancient sea bottoms. Superimposed materials gradually consolidated the sedimentary particles into bedded deposits of shale. Mountain building forces subsequently folded, crumpled, and compressed the shale. At the same time, intense heat and pressure changed the original clays into new minerals such as mica, chlorite, and quartz. By such mechanical and chemical processes bedded clays were transformed, or metamorphosed, into slate, whole geologic ages being consumed in the process. Slates vary in composition, structure, and durability because the degree to which their determinant minerals have been altered is neither uniform nor consistent.                                                          These traditional slater's tools are used to cut and trim, hammer, measure, and rip out nails.  Photo: Jeffrey S. Levine.                                                    The adaptation of slate for roofing purposes is inextricably linked to its genesis. The manufacturing processes of nature have endowed slate with certain commercially amenable properties which have had a profound influence on the methods by which slate is quarried and fabricated, as well as its suitability for use as a roofing tile.     Slate roofing tiles are still manufactured by hand using traditional methods in a five step process:  cutting, sculping, splitting, trimming, and hole punching.  In the manufacturing process, large, irregular blocks taken from the quarry are first cut with a saw across the grain in sections slightly longer than the length of the finished roofing slate. The blocks are next sculped, or split along the grain of the slate, to widths slightly larger than the widths of finished slates. Sculping is generally accomplished with a mallet and a broadfaced chisel, although some types of slate must be cut along their grain. In the splitting area, the slightly oversized blocks are split along their cleavage planes to the desired shingle thickness. The splitter's tools consist of a wooden mallet and two splitting chisels used for prying the block into halves and repeating this process until the desired thinness is reached. The last two steps involve trimming the tile to the desired size and then punching two nail holes toward the top of the slate using a formula based on the size and exposure of the slate.     Minerals, the building blocks of rocks, through their characteristic crystalline structures define the physical properties of the rocks which they compose. Slate consists of minerals that are stable and resistant to weathering and is, therefore, generally of high strength, low porosity, and low absorption. The low porosity and low absorption of slate mitigate the deleterious action of frost on the stone and make it well adapted for roofing purposes. The two most important structural properties of slate are cleavage and grain.     The metamorphic processes of geologic change necessary to produce slate are dependent upon movements in the earth's crust and the heat and pressure generated thereby. For this reason, slate is found only in certain mountainous regions. The most economically important slate deposits in this country lie in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern states transversed by or bordering on the Appalachian Mountain chain. Variations in local chemistry and conditions under which the slate was formed have produced a wide range of colors and qualities and ultimately determine the character of the slate found in these areas.     Slate is available in a variety of colors. The most common are  grey, blue-grey, black, various shades of green, deep purple, brick red, and mottled varieties.  The presence of carbonaceous matter, derived from the decay of marine organisms on ancient sea floors, gives rise to the black colored slates. Compounds of iron generate the red, purple, and green colored slates.     Generally, the slates of Maine, Virginia, and the Peach Bottom district of York County, Pennsylvania are deep blue-black in color. Those of Virginia have a distinctive lustrous appearance as well due to their high mica content. The slates of Lehigh and Northampton Counties, Pennsylvania, are grayish-black in color. Green, red, purple, and mottled slates derive from the New York-Vermont district. The slate producing region of New York, which centers around Granville and Middle Granville, is particularly important because it contains one of the few commercial deposits of red slate in the world.     Slates are also classified as fading or unfading according to their color stability. Fading slates change to new shades or may streak within a short time after exposure to the atmosphere due to the presence of finegrained disseminated pyrite. For example, the ""weathering green"" or ""seagreen"" slates of New York and Vermont are grayish green when freshly quarried. Upon exposure, from 20% to 60% of the slates typically weather to soft tones of orange-brown, buff, and gray while the others retain their original shade. Slates designated as unfading maintain their original colors for many years.     Color permanence generally provides no indication of the durability of slate. Rather, time has shown that the Vermont and New York slates will last about 125 years; Buckingham Virginia slates 175 years or more; and Pennsylvania SoftVein slates in excess of 60 years; Pennsylvania HardVein slates and Peach Bottom slates, neither of which is still quarried, had life spans of roughly 100 and at least 200 years respectively. The life spans provided should be used only as a general guide in determining whether or not an existing slate roof is nearing the end of its serviceable life.     Ribbons are visible as bands on the cleavage face of slate and represent geologic periods during which greater amounts of carbonaceous matter, calcite, or coarse quartz particles were present in the sediment from which the slate was formed. Ribbons typically weather more and were most common in Pennsylvania slate quarries. As they were not as durable as clear slates, ribbon slate is no longer manufactured for roofing purposes. Mottled grey slates from Vermont are the closest match for Pennsylvania ribbon slate available today.     In recent years, slates from China, Africa, Spain and other countries have begun to be imported into the United States, primarily for distribution on the West Coast. The use of imported slates should probably be limited to new construction since their colors and textures often do not match those of U.S. slate.      Deterioration of Slate and Slate Roofs                                                             The white blotches on these Pennsylvania Soft-Vein slates indicate areas where gypsum is leaching out onto the surfaces of the slates. Photo: Jeffrey S. Levine.                                                   The durability of a slate roof depends primarily on four factors: the physical and mineralogical properties of the slate; the way in which it is fabricated; installation techniques employed; and, regular and timely maintenance. The first three of these factors are examined below. The maintenance and repair of slate roofs are discussed in later sections of this Brief.     The natural weathering of roofing slate manifests itself as a slow process of chipping and scaling along the cleavage planes. Paper thin laminations flake off the surface of the slate and the slate becomes soft and spongy as the inner layers begin to come apart, or delaminate. The nature of the sound given off by a slate when tapped with one's knuckles or slating hammer is a fair indication of its condition. Highgrade slate, when poised upon the fingertips and struck, will emit a clear, solid sound. Severely weathered slates are much less sonorous, and give off a dull thud when tapped.     The weathering of slate is chiefly due to mineral impurities (primarily calcite and iron sulfides) in the slate which, in concert with alternating wet/dry and hot/cold cycles, react to form gypsum. Because gypsum molecules take up about twice as much volume as calcite molecules, internal stresses result from the reaction, causing the slate to delaminate. This type of deterioration is as prominent on the underside of the roof as on the exposed surface due to the leaching and subsequent concentration of gypsum in this area. Consequently, deteriorated roofing slates typically cannot be flipped over and reused.                                                              Paper thin lamination can be seen flaking off this weathered, 120 year piece of Pennsylvania Hard-Vein slate. Photo: Jeffrey S. Levine.                                                   The chemical and physical changes which accompany slate weathering cause an increase in absorption and a decrease in both strength and toughness. The tendency of old, weathered slates to absorb and hold moisture can lead to rot in underlying areas of wood sheathing. Such rot can go undetected for long periods of time since, often, there is no accompanying leak. Due to their loss of strength, weathered slates are more prone to breakage, loss of corners, and cracking.     Slates with low calcite content tend to weather slowly. Dense slates, with low porosity, likewise decay slower than slates with equal calcite, but with a greater porosity. The pitch of a roof can also affect its longevity. The steeper the pitch, the longer the slate can be expected to last as water will run off faster and will be less likely to be drawn under the slates by capillary action or driven under by wind forces. Spires and the steep slopes of Mansard roofs often retain their original slate long after other portions of the roof have been replaced. Areas of a roof subject to concentrated water flows and ice damming, such as along eaves and valleys, also tend to deteriorate more rapidly than other areas of the roof.                                                              View of these slates laid on open sheathing shows that delamination and flaking are just as bad or worse on the underside of slates as on the exposed surface. This is why most slates cannot be flipped over for reuse. Photo: Jeffrey S. Levine.                                                   Mechanical agents, such as thermal expansion and contraction and the action of frost, are subordinate in the weathering of slate, coming into play only after the slate has been materially altered from its original state by the chemical transformation of calcite to gypsum. The more rapid deterioration of slates found on roof slopes with the most severe exposure to the sun, wind, and rain (typically, but not always, a southern exposure) may be attributable to the combined result of the deleterious effects of impurities in the slate and mechanical agents. Atmospheric acids produce only negligible deterioration in roofing slate.     It is difficult to assess the procedures by which a piece of slate has been fabricated without visiting the quarry and observing the process first hand. The location and size of nail holes, grain orientation, the condition of corners, and the number of broken pieces are all things which may be observed in a shipment of slate to judge the quality of its fabrication. Nail holes should be clean and with a shallow countersink on the face of the slate for the nail head; grain oriented along the length of the slate; and, corners left whole. An allowance for 10% breakage in shipment is typically provided for by the quarry.     Installation problems often involve the improper nailing and lapping of slates. The nailing of slates differs from that of other roofing materials. Slate nails should not be driven tight as is the case with asphalt and wood shingles. Rather, they should be set such that the slate is permitted to hang freely on the nail shank. Nails driven too far will crack the slate and those left projecting will puncture the overlying slate.  Nail heads left exposed accelerate roof deterioration by providing a point for water entry. Non-ferrous slater's nails, such as solid copper or stainless steel, should always be used since plain steel and galvanized nails will usually rust out long before the slate itself begins to deteriorate. The rusting of nineteenth century cut nails is a common cause of slate loss on historic roofs.     When joints are improperly broken (i.e., when slates lap the joints in the course below by less than 3"" [7.5 cm]), it is possible for water to pass between the joints, through the nail holes and ultimately to the underlying felt, where it will cause deterioration and leaks to develop. Insufficient headlap can also result in leaks as water entering the joints between slates may have a greater tendency to be wind blown beyond the heads of the slates in the course below.     Occasionally, individual slates are damaged. This may be caused by falling tree limbs, ice dams in gutters, valleys, and chimney crickets, the weight of a workman walking on the roof, or a naturally occurring fault in the slate unit. Whatever the form of damage, if it is caught soon enough, the roof can usually be repaired or selectively replaced and deterioration mitigated.     The ability to lay slate properly so as to produce a watertight and aesthetically pleasing roof requires training, much practice, and the right tools. The installation and repair of slate roofs should be entrusted only to experienced slaters.      Repairing Slate Roofs    Broken, cracked, and missing slates should be repaired promptly by an experienced slater in order to prevent water damage to interior finishes, accelerated deterioration of the roof and roof sheathing, and possible structural degradation to framing members.     The damaged slate is first removed by cutting or pulling out its nails with a ripper. If steel cut nails, rather than copper nails, were used in laying the roof, adjacent slates may be inadvertently damaged or displaced in the ripping process, and these, too, will have to be repaired. If the slate does not slide out by itself, the pointed end of the ,slate hammer can be punched into the slate and the slate dragged out. A new slate, or salvaged slate, which should match the size, shape, texture, and weathered color of the old slate, is then slid into place and held in position by one nail inserted through the vertical joint between the slates in the course above and approximately one inch below the tail of the slate two courses above.                                                            After removing the deteriorated slate and sliding the new slate into place, it is secured with a copper nail.  A copper bib (shown here) is formed to protect the newly created nail hole. Finally, a slate hammer is used to push the bib in place over the nail head. Photo: Jeffrey S. Levine.                                                 To prevent water penetration through the newly created nail hole, a piece of copper with a friction fit, measuring roughly 3"" (7.5 cm) in width and 8"" (20 cm) in length, is slid lengthwise under the joint between the two slates located directly above the new slate and over the nail. Alternate methods for securing the replacement slate include the use of metal hooks, clips, and straps that are bent over the tail end of the slate. The application of roofing mastic or sealants to damaged slates should not be considered a viable repair alternative because these materials, though effective at first, will eventually harden and crack, thereby allowing water to enter.   Mastic also makes future repairs more difficult to execute, is unsightly, and, when applied to metal flashings, accelerates their corrosion.     When two or more broken slates lie adjacent to each other in the same course, or when replacing leaky valley flashings, it is best to form pyramids (i.e., to remove a diminishing number of slates from higher courses) to keep the number of bibs required to a minimum. When reinstalling the slates, only the top slate in each pyramid will need a bib. Slates along the sides of the pyramid will receive two nails, one above the other, along the upper part of its exposed edge.     When many slates must be removed to effect a repair, the sheathing should be checked for rotted areas and projecting nails. Plywood is generally not a good replacement material for deteriorated wood sheathing due to the relative difficulty of driving a nail through it (the bounce produced can loosen adjacent slates). Instead, new wood boards of similar width and thickness to those being replaced should be used. Because the nominal thickness of today's dimension lumber is slightly thinner than that produced in the past, it may be necessary to shim the new wood boards so that they lie flush with the top surface of adjacent existing sheathing boards. Pressure treated lumber is not recommended due to its tendency to shrink. This can cause the slates to crack and become displaced.     To permit proper re-laying of the slate, the new roof sheathing must be of smooth and solid construction. At least two nails should be placed through the new boards at every rafter and joints between the ends of the boards should occur over rafters. Insufficient nailing will cause the boards to be springy, making nailing of the slates difficult and causing adjacent slates to loosen in the process. Unevenness in the sheathing will show in the finished roof surface and may cause premature cracking of the slate. Roof sheathing in valleys and along hips, ridges, and eaves may be covered with waterproof membrane underlayment rather than roofing felt for added protection against leakage.                                                              After a hurricane or other natural disaster, it may be necessary to stabilize a roof temporarily until materials can be obtained and a qualified roofing contractor hired. Significant slate roofs should not be stripped off and replaced with asphalt shingles. Photo: NPS files.                                                   In emergency situations, such as when severe hurricanes or tornadoes blow numerous slates off the roof, a temporary roof covering should be installed immediately after the storm to prevent further water damage to the interior of the building and to permit the drying out process to begin. Heavy gauge plastic and vinyl tarpaulins are often used for this purpose, though they are difficult to secure in place and can be blown off in high winds. Roll roofing, carefully stitched in to areas of the remaining roof, is a somewhat more functional solution that will allow sufficient time to document the existing roof conditions, plan repairs, and order materials.     Slate roof repair is viable for localized problems and damaged roofs with reasonably long serviceable lives remaining. If 20% or more of the slates on a roof or roof slope are broken, cracked, missing, or sliding out of position, it is usually less expensive to replace the roof than to execute individual repairs. This is especially true of older roofs nearing the end of their serviceable lives because even the most experienced slater will likely damage additional slates while attempting repairs. Depending on the age of the slate, its expected serviceable life, and the cause(s) of deterioration, it may or may not be cost effective to salvage slates. Where deteriorated nails or flashings are the cause of the roof failure, salvage of at least some slates should be possible for use in repairs. When salvaging slates, each must be sounded to discover cracks and faults and the degree to which it has weathered. It is usually wise to salvage slates when only a portion of the roof is to be replaced. In this way, the salvaged slates may be used for future repairs to the remaining sections of the roof.       The Replacement of Deteriorated Roofs    Historic slate roofs should be repaired rather than replaced whenever possible. Before replacing a slate roof, check for isolated damage, corroded and worn flashings, leaky gutters, poor ventilation in the attic, and other possible sources of moisture. All too often slate roofs are mistakenly replaced when, in fact, they could have been effectively repaired. Deciding whether an historic slate roof should be repaired or replaced can be difficult and each roof must be judged separately.     If repair is not possible and a new slate roof must be installed, it is important to remember that more than just the replacement of the slate is involved. The old slate should be removed to prevent overloading of the roof timbers. Stripping should be done in sections, with felt installed, to avoid exposing the entire subroof to the weather. ln the process, rotted wood sheathing should be replaced and the roof timbers checked for signs of stress including deflection, cracking, and twisting. If such conditions are found, a structural engineer experienced in working with older buildings should be consulted. Other repairs, such as chimney repointing, which may require access to the roof should be completed before the new roof is put on.     Drawings and specifications for a new slate roof should be prepared by a restoration architect, especially if the project is going to be competitively bid or if the roof is particularly complex. Standard specifications, like those published in 1926 by the National Slate Association may be used as a basis for developing specifications appropriate for a particular project. The specifications and drawings should contain all the information necessary to replicate the original appearance of the roof as closely as possible. Certain changes may have to be accepted, however, since several types of slate once prominent in this country, such as ribbon slate, are no longer quarried. It is wise to anticipate the replacement of older roofs so that proper planning can be undertaken and financial resources set aside, thereby, reducing the likelihood of rash last minute decisions.                                                                Prior to a replacing a roof, historical documentation is gathered (such as photo documentation) to determine the roof configuration. Photo: NPS files.                                                   Roofing slate is sold by the square in the United States. One square is enough to cover 100 square feet (13.3 square meters) of plain roof surface when laid with a standard headlap of 3"" (7.5cm). When ordering slate, considerable lead time should be allowed as delivery may take anywhere from 4 to 12 weeks and even as long as 1 year for special orders. Orders for random widths of a particular slate can generally be filled more quickly than orders for fixed widths. Once on site, slates should be stored on edge, under cover on pallets.     A roof and its associated flashings, gutters, and downspouts function as a system to shed water. Material choices should be made with this in mind. For example, use a single type of metal for all flashings and the rainwater conductor system to avoid galvanic action. Choose materials with life spans comparable to that of the slate, such as nonferrous nails. Use heavier gauge flashings or sacrificial flashings in areas that are difficult to access or subject to concentrated water flows.     Flashings are the weakest point in any roof. Given the permanence of slate, it is poor economy to use anything but the most durable of metals and the best workmanship for installing flashings. Copper is one of the best flashing materials, and along with terne, is most often associated with historic slate roofs. Copper is extremely durable, easily worked and soldered, and requires little maintenance. Sixteen ounce copper sheet is the minimum weight recommended for flashings. Lighter weights will not endure the erosive action of dust and grit carried over the roof by rain water. Heavier weight, 20 oz. (565 grams) or 24 oz. (680 grams), copper should be used in gutters, valleys, and areas with limited accessibility. Lead coated copper has properties similar to copper and is even more durable due to its additional lead coating. Lead coated copper is often used in restoration work.     Terne is a less desirable flashing material since it must be painted periodically. Terne coated stainless steel (TCS) is a modernday substitute for terne. Although more difficult to work than terne, TCS will not corrode if left unpainted; a great advantage, especially in areas that are difficult to access.     Once a metal is chosen, it is important to use it throughout for all flashings, gutters, downspouts, and metal roofs. Mixing of dissimilar metals can lead to rapid corrosion of the more electronegative metal by galvanic action. Where flashings turn up a vertical surface, they should be covered with a cap flashing. Slates which overlap metal flashings should be nailed in such a manner as to avoid puncturing the metal. This may be accomplished by punching a second hole about 2"" (5cm) above the existing hole on the side of the slate not overlapping the metal flashing. It is important that holes be punched from the back side of the slate. In this way, a shallow countersink is created on the face of the slate in which the head of the nail may sit.     The use of artificial, mineral fiber slate is not recommended for restoration work since its rigid appearance is that of a manmade material and not one of nature. Artificial slates may also have a tendency to fade over time. And, although artificial slate costs less than natural slate, the total initial cost of an artificial slate roof is only marginally less than a natural slate roof. This is because all the other costs associated with replacing a slate roof, such as the cost of labor, flashings, and tearingoff the old roof, are equal in both cases. Over the long term, natural slate tends to be a better investment because several artificial slate roofs will have to be installed during the life span of one natural slate roof.                                                              Roofing felt is being installed over the decking; a rubberized membrane is used selctively at the eaves and under some flashing. Photo: NPS files.                                                   Clear roof expanses can be covered by an experienced slater and one helper at the rate of about two to three squares per day. More complex roofs and the presence of chimneys, dormers, and valleys can bring this rate down to below one square per day. One square per day is a good average rate to use in figuring how long a job will take to complete. This takes into account the installation of flashings and gutters and the setup and breakdown of scaffolding. Tear-off of the existing roof will require additional time.        Repair/Replacement Guideline    The following guideline is provided to assist in the repair/replace decision making process:  1.  Consider the age and condition of the roof versus its expected serviceable life given the type of slate employed.     2.  Calculate the number of damaged and missing slates. Is the number less than about 20%? Is the roof generally in good condition? If so, the roof should be evaluated for repair rather than replacement. Also, keep in mind that the older a roof becomes, the more maintenance it will likely require.     3.  Determine if there are active leaks and what their source may be. Do not assume the slates are leaking. Gutters, valleys and flashings are more likely candidates. ""False leaks"" can be caused by moisture condensation in the attic due to improper ventilation.     4.  Check the roof rafters and sheathing for moisture stains. Poke an awl into the wood to determine if it is rotted. Remember that very old, delaminating slates will hold moisture and cause adjacent wood members to deteriorate even if there are no apparent leaks.     5.  Are many slates sliding out of position? If so, it may be that ferrous metal fasteners were used and that these are corroding, while the slates are still in good condition. Salvage the slates and relay them on the roof. If the slates have worn around the nails holes, it may be necessary to punch new holes before relaying them.     6.  Consider the condition of the roof's flashings. Because slate is so durable, metal flashings often wear out before the slate does. Examine the flashings carefully. Even the smallest pinhole can permit large quantities of water to enter the building. Is the deterioration of the slate uniform? Often this is not the case. It may be that only one slope needs replacement and the other slopes can be repaired. In this way, the cost of replacement can be spread over many years.     7.  Press down hard on the slates with your hand. Sound slates will be unaffected by the pressure. Deteriorated slates will feel brittle and will crack. Tap on slates that have fallen out or been removed. A full, deep sound indicates a slate in good condition, while a dull thud suggests a slate in poor condition.     8.  Are new slates readily available? Even if replacement is determined to be necessary, the existing roof may have to be repaired to allow time for documentation and the ordering of appropriate replacement slates.      Note:  measurements in this publication are given in both U.S. Customary System and International (Metric) System for comparative purposes. Metric conversions are in some cases approximate and should not be relied upon in preparing technical specifications.       Maintenance    Given the relatively high initial cost of installing a new slate roof, it pays to inspect its overall condition annually and after several storms. For safety reasons, it is recommended that building owners and maintenance personnel carry out roof surveys from the ground using binoculars or from a cherry picker. Cracked, broken, misaligned, and missing slates and the degree to which delamination has occurred should be noted, along with failed flashings (pin holes, open seams, loose and misaligned elements, etc.) and broken or clogged downspouts. A roof plan or sketch and a camera can aid in recording problems and discussing them with contractors. In the attic, wood rafters and sheathing should be checked for water stains and rot. Critical areas are typically near the roof plate and at the intersection of roof planes, such as at valleys and hips. Regular maintenance should include cleaning gutters at least twice during the fall and once in early spring, and replacing damaged slates promptly. Every five to seven years inspections should be conducted by professionals experienced in working with slate and steep slopes. Good record keeping, in the form of a log book and the systematic filing of all bills and samples, can help in piecing together a roof's repair history and is an important part of maintenance.     As part of regular maintenance, an attempt should be made to keep foot traffic off the roof. If maintenance personnel, chimney sweeps, painters, or others must walk on the roof, it is recommended that ladders be hooked over the ridge and that the workmen walk on the ladders to better distribute their weight. If slates are to be walked on, it is best to wear soft soled shoes and to step on the lowermiddle of the exposed portion of the slate unit.      Conclusion    Slate roofs are a critical design feature of many historic buildings that cannot be duplicated using substitute materials. Slate roofs can, and should be, maintained and repaired to effectively extend their serviceable lives. When replacement is necessary, details contributing to the appearance of the roof should be retained. High quality slate is still available from reputable quarries and, while a significant investment, can be a cost effective solution over the long term.

Since radioactive materials can be dangerous, nuclear power plants                have many safety systems to protect workers, the public, and the                environment. These safety systems include shutting the reactor down                quickly and stopping the fission process, systems to cool the reactor                down and carry heat away from it, and barriers to contain the radioactivity                and prevent it from escaping into the environment.

GX225-66-16487272	"STONE      Crushed Stone & Dimension Stone                             Background   In industry, two types of ""stone"" are quarried, processed, and sold as commodities: they are known as  crushed stone  and  dimension stone .   Crushed stone is any type of rock material that is crushed to any of a variety of sizes. The most common types of stone processed into crushed stone include limestone and dolomite (70% of all crushed stone), granite (16%), and traprock (7%). Smaller amounts of marble, slate, sandstone, quartzite, and volcanic cinder are also used. Together, these rocks represent only 7% of annual crushed rock production.   Dimension stone is any type of natural rock material that is quarried in order to make blocks or slabs of rock that are cut to specific sizes (width, length, and thickness) and shapes. Dimension stone is used because it is durable, strong and attractive. It is usually important that they can be polished. The rocks chosen for dimension stone include all rock types (igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary). The most important rocks used as dimension stone are granite, limestone, marble, sandstone, and slate. Certain softer rocks such as alabaster (massive gypsum) and soapstone (massive talc) can also be considered dimension stone.     Sources     Crushed stone is produced in 49 states in the U.S. As can be expected, the crushed stone from any particular state depends on the general geology and rocks of that state. For instance, crushed limestone and dolomite is typical of New York State, marble and granite from Vermont, etc. Even though it is quarried and processed all over the United States, a small number of states account for more than 50% of the total crushed stone production. These states, in decreasing order of amount of stone produced, are Texas, Pennsylvania, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Missouri, Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee. In addition to quarried and crushed stone, significant amounts of crushed stone are recycled and more is imported. Most states are now recycling asphalt and crushed rock roadways as well as concrete roads and structures by crushing these materials and using them in new road construction projects. The U.S. does import significant amounts of crushed stone as well. Most is imported from Canada (53%), followed by Mexico (30%), The Bahamas (9%), and other countries (8%). Crushed stone resources worldwide are very, very large. Nearly endless quantities of all types of rock (igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary) are available for crushed stone production. However, high-quality stone, such as some limestone and dolomite used for very special purposes, are more limited to specific regions.   More than 130 companies in 33 states produce dimension stone. The states producing the most dimension stone are, in decreasing order of production, Indiana, Vermont, Georgia, and Wisconsin. Based on tonnage, granite accounts for the largest amount of dimension stone production each year (37%). Limestone production is next (33%), sandstone (16%), quartzite (4%), marble (3%), slate (3%), and miscellaneous stone (4%). Dimension stone is also imported. It is imported from Italy (42%), India (12%), Canada (12%), Spain (10%), and other nations (24%). The overall supplies of dimension stone are enough to meet annual demand. Specific deposits of dimension stone with particular characteristics can be limited and eventually quarried out.     Uses     Crushed stone is used mostly for road construction and maintenance. It is also used for chemical production, for making cement and lime, and in agriculture. There are a large number of other uses for crushed stone, many of which are not accurately or completely reported.   Dimension stone is quarried in large, rough blocks of stone, each of which weighs many tons. This rough block production represents 55% of the dimension stone produced annually. Rough blocks of various dimension stone are used mostly in construction (51%) and to make monuments (20%). The remainder is used to make curbstones for streets, flagstones for roofs and walkways, and other decorative uses such as for carvings and statues.     Substitutes and Alternative Sources     Stone resources in the world are large which guarantees crushed stone should never be in short supply. However, if necessary, a small number of materials can be used in place of crushed stone. Possible substitutes are sand, gravel, expanded clay, shale, perlite and vermiculite.   Depending on the situation, dimension stone can be replaced with steel, concrete, plastics, glass and other similar materials. In building or monument construction, for instance, the material chosen very much depends on the design choices and goals of the architect. A particular stone might be chosen for its color and texture, or for the look it gives to a building or a room. Such decisions can use any number of building materials."

No borings were made to determine the depth of alluvium in the stream channel. Diversion plans called for construction of upstream and downstream cofferdams, with the river flows carried through a wooden flume along one side of the narrow, 40-foot-wide canyon. The cofferdams were built on the pervious streambed glacial deposits. However, with the equipment at hand it was not possible to unwater the construction area due to the large amount of underseepage. Clamshell buckets were used to remove alluvial material from the stream bed and concrete placement began after dredging only of a few feet of material. Concrete was lowered in buckets through the standing water and deposited on the streambed materials. This was continued until the concrete reached an elevation above the water level. The upstream side of the dam was constructed on material that had filled into the river after construction was started. Due to excessive leakage beneath the structure, approximately 3,000 cement bags filled with sand and gravel were laid along the upstream face of the dam adjacent to the foundation point of contact. This did not remedy the situation, and the caisson cutoff began sinking through the alluvium.   The construction of the caisson was slow as it had to be accomplished working under compressed air, and the dam was completed while the excavation was proceeding. Reinforced cutoff walls were constructed 6-8 feet thick on the upstream side of the caisson excavation, and 4 feet thick on the downstream side of the excavation. The excavation revealed the poor quality of the concrete below the water surface where much of the cement had been washed away. Some of the concrete adjacent to the caisson was poor quality and was replaced. The caisson and cutoff walls were constructed downward to about 11 feet below the base of the dam. While the reservoir was being filled, large springs developed at the downstream toe. To reduce the flow, a single row of steel sheet piling was driven to a depth of about 30 feet below the stream channel, about 8 feet downstream from the toe of the dam. This could have significantly increased the exit gradients. During this activity (October 18, 1912), the sluiceway gates were closed, and the water rose until it began to flow over the north (left abutment) spillway.   Dam Failure — On October 30, 1912, after the workmen had left the construction site, bubbles were noticed downstream of the dam. Subsequently a piping erosion failure of the alluvial material beneath the dam developed which allowed the entire reservoir to pass under the dam. Sources vary in their estimates of the amount of water, ranging from 8,000 to 12,000 acre-feet, and the amount of time the lake took to drain, within about 1½-3 hours. The main portion of the dam founded on the rock abutments spanned the hole, and was undamaged. At the time of the blowout, a large quantity of logs and debris were washed into the hole, which interfered with determining conditions beneath the dam. However, shortly after the accident, the hole was determined to be 75 feet deep at the upstream face, and 90 feet deep at the downstream toe. Within the following month, however, the depths had been reduced to 30 feet or less by filling in with new river gravel. Although the property damage due to the failure was extensive, there was no loss of life. The entire flow of the river passed beneath the dam for a year following the accident.   Dam Reconstruction — Following failure of the dam, explorations were conducted in an attempt to locate a more suitable nearby site, but none was found. Work then concentrated on the existing site, and it was found that bedrock was about 70-80 feet below the base of the dam, which is similar to the soundings made shortly after failure. The presence of boulders and large logs in the loose material under the dam made drilling very difficult. Plans to unwater the site were abandoned because of the depth to rock, the presence of so many logs, and the unsuccessful attempt to unwater the site during original construction. Instead, the plan of reconstruction consisted of constructing heavy rockfill upstream and downstream of the dam.   The first step in the reconstruction, begun in 1913, was driving sheet piling across the river in the streambed deposits as follows:      (1) 50 feet deep at both 10 and 70 feet downstream of the toe of the dam,   (2) 40 feet deep at 150 feet downstream of the toe,   (3) about 80 feet deep (to rock) at 15 feet-upstream of the dam (measured from the upstream face), and   (4) 40 feet deep at 95 feet upstream of the dam.      A concrete stubbing block, or caisson, measuring 17 feet across the river, 37 feet along the river (based on 1967 survey), and 30 feet deep, was constructed between the downstream rows of sheet piling. Sheet piles were driven around the perimeter of the block, the loose materials were excavated, and the concrete was placed underwater by bottom dump bucket. The purpose of this block was to help keep the rockfill in place, which was later brought down from the canyon walls adjacent to the dam by heavy blasting.   Large quantities of earth material were placed on the rock prior to blasting in an attempt to get a well graded and relatively impermeable material. The details of this are uncertain. Incidental to the reconstruction, it was necessary to excavate about 6,000 cubic yards of rock from the approach channel to the south spillway. This material was placed upstream of the dam, and some of it was carried beneath the structure. Soundings downstream of the dam indicated this material did not make it past the concrete stubbing block. The blasting downstream of the dam was performed first. Six down holes (30 feet deep) at a time were shot until 20,000 cubic yards of fill, consisting primarily of rock varying in size from 2 to 40 tons (many in the 10-15 ton range), was deposited on the downstream side of the dam. The effect of this was to raise the water in the reservoir about 20 feet. A drawing prepared shortly after the reconstruction shows the downstream rockfill extended about 20 feet above the concrete stubbing block. By 1967, the material had been eroded away down to the elevation of the stubbing block, presumably due to spillway discharges.   Blasting upstream of the dam was performed by placing powder in 30-foot-down holes, in a large seam on the right side of the canyon, and in a tunnel on each side of the river. The down holes and seam charge between the tunnels and the dam were set off first, followed immediately by the tunnels and the remainder of the down holes (amount of time between charges unknown). The intent was for the first shot to form a cushion area to protect the dam from the larger tunnel shot. Due to a misfire, one of the tunnels was shot later than the other. There was no indication of damage to the concrete work following the blasting. In all, about 50,000 cubic yards of material was deposited upstream of the dam, with about 40,000 cubic yards being deposited simultaneously. A boring drilled in 1967 encountered a 15-foot-deep void at the base of the dam, indicating that the blasted material did not completely fill beneath the structure.   The blasting was successful in sealing the hole beneath the dam to the point where water rose and began to flow over the north spillway in about three days. However, there was still considerable seepage beneath the dam. In order to further cut down the seepage, fir mats 30 feet wide, 50 feet long, and 3.5 feet thick were constructed and placed over the upstream area within 150 feet of the face of the dam, and were covered with what was apparently a ""puddled"" material followed by a dumped fill of loose rock and earth. This work, completed in early 1914, is reported to have greatly reduced the seepage. However, seepage continued to be a problem. A hydraulic fill extending 300 feet upstream of the dam appears to have been placed in late 1918. In 1919, the seepage was estimated at over 120 cubic feet per second. A 3-inch-thick gunite layer, reinforced by _-inch square reinforcing bars at 12-inch centers both ways, was placed over the hydraulic fill upstream of the dam for a distance of about 295 feet upstream of the dam (based on 1967 survey). It is reported that the seepage was reduced by 92 percent when this was completed.   Borings made from the crest of the dam in 1967 penetrated the upstream face of the dam at several elevations. One that penetrated just below the gunite surface near the center of the dam indicated full reservoir level at that location. Another which penetrated the face below the hydraulic fill near the fir mattress just to the right of the dam center indicated a water level about 35 feet below the reservoir level. A third hole which penetrated the face of the dam in the rockfill below the fir mattress near the bottom of the right sluiceway was dry. This indicated that the material upstream of the dam was the real water barrier, and the rockfill under the dam was relatively free draining.   Dam Strengthening by Tendons — Dam safety studies performed in the late 1970's indicated that increased stability was required for normal pool loading conditions (gates closed), normal pool plus seismic loads (horizontal inertia and hydrodynamic earthquake force based on 0.1 g acceleration), and probable maximum flood (PMF) conditions. In 1980, 20 tendons were installed through the spillway structures and into the gravity dam to add stability to the structures. In addition, stoplogs were replaced with reinforced concrete beams, 10-foot-long concrete plugs were installed in the upstream section of the sluiceways, and a new piezometer was installed to the left of center of the gravity dam near the left sluiceway. It apparently penetrated the upstream face of the dam above the fir mattress, about 50 feet below the top of the dam.   The five tendons installed through the right (south) spillway piers and the three tendons installed through the left (north) spillway piers were anchored in rock. Four tendons on the right side of the gravity section were anchored in rock. In these cases, the primary grout zone extended up into the concrete structure, generally less than 5 feet. One adjacent tendon on the right side of the gravity dam was anchored partially in rock and partially in concrete. Large water losses were encountered at the concrete/rock interface in all cases. Grouting was required to advance the holes and keep them tight enough to grout the tendons in place. The seven tendons on the left side of the gravity section were anchored within the concrete near the base of the structure. The primary grout length for these tendons was about 35 feet, leaving a free length of about 25 feet. Secondary grouting of the free length was performed for all tendons after tensioning. The exceptions were three tendons where the secondary grout pipes were not functional. For these cases, a separate tube was used to grout the free lengths, then the heads were installed and the tendons tensioned prior to set of the grout. The design service load for the spillway tendons was 174 kips [1 kip = 1,000 lbs], and for the gravity dam tendons was 297 kips. No tendons penetrated the alluvial and fill material beneath the base of the concrete structure.   Piezometer No. 1 (also known as the south piezometer, installed in 1967 near the fir mattress) continued to show a water elevation of about 37 feet below the reservoir elevation. Piezometer No. 2 (installed in 1980) showed water levels generally about 45 feet below the reservoir elevation. Both piezometers fluctuated about 2-3 feet in response to a 5-foot fluctuation in tailrace water elevation.   At the direction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), an independent board of consultants reviewed the 1980 work, and concluded that the top of the primary grout anchorage zone was too high, and that the full effective post-tensioning force did not reach low enough. Based on their recommendation, five new 4- to 12-strand tendons were installed in the right (south) spillway piers, and five new 23-strand (558-kips service load) tendons were installed in the concrete gravity dam, with one 16-strand tendon installed in the dam near the spillway. Two tendons on the right side of the gravity dam were anchored in rock. The rest of the dam tendons were anchored in the bottom portion of the gravity structure. Again, no tendons penetrated the fill and alluvium below the dam. The primary grout zone for all tendons anchored in rock was well below the rock surface. The primary grout zones for the tendons in the gravity dam were essentially the bottom 10 feet of the holes. Secondary grouting was performed for all tendons following grouting. During this contract, a small concrete buttress was constructed between south spillway piers 5 and 6 at a low point in the rock. This concrete was intended to act as a strut to prevent lateral movement of the downstream ends of the piers inward toward Bay 5/6 during extreme loading conditions. A slotted pipe drain surrounded by granular filter material was installed at the upstream base of this concrete. The piezometer installed in 1980 (No. 2) had plugged, and was replaced by Piezometer No. 3 (also known as the north piezometer) during this contract, penetrating the upstream face in the rockfill about 10 feet above the sluiceways near the center of the gravity dam. This piezometer has shown higher pressures than the others. The most recent data shows the level to be less than 10 feet lower than the reservoir level, although after it was initially installed its level was approximately 15 feet below the reservoir level. There was about a 10-foot lowering of the level around January of 1991, followed by an increase of about 15 feet approximately 6 months later. The level appears to have crept up a few feet more in 1995. This piezometer also fluctuates several feet in response to tailwater fluctuations.   During the FERC review, it was determined that the previous analyses were not in accordance with the current FERC guidelines. New studies resulted in 12 new tendons being installed in the power intake and left (north) spillway to mitigate overturning concerns during PMF loading. Three 21-strand spillway tendons, and nine 8-strand intake tendons were used. Two holes had a void area in the concrete that opened into the intake gate area, which made them difficult to plug. A rigid plastic pipe was used to span the leakage area in these holes. The primary grout zone for all of these tendons was within rock, and below the rock surface by 3 to 10 feet. Secondary grouting was performed after tensioning of all of these tendons. Eighty cubic yards of fill concrete was placed during this contract in the intake section of the dam under the trestle between monoliths 12 and 14.      References for Appendix A   The Elwha Dam construction history was compiled from the following references.

Where the names of a company or a brand-name is noted, it is for purposes of information only and does not constitute an endorsement by the Bureau of Reclamation or the Department of the Interior   Diamond-wire sawcutting — Rotary diamond saws have been used to make cuts in concrete up to 27 inches deep. Diamond-wire saws produce a smooth vibration-free cut through heavy reinforcement and hard aggregates, with virtually no limitation on the size or thickness of the cuts which can be made. The diamond-wire system consists of a diamond-impregnated wire made to length for each cut and a hydraulically-powered drive system. Diamond wire is routed to envelope the area to be cut (often requiring a drilled hole), then guided into a drive wheel on the power unit. The drive wheel rotates and pulls the wire through the concrete. This system allows cuts of virtually any size through stone, and through unreinforced and reinforced concrete at cutting rates which can vary from 10-50 square feet (ft 2 ) per hour. Common wire lengths range from 50 to 70 feet, with wires longer than 400 feet unusual. A project in 1990 removed a bridge pier in 30-ton segments at a cost of about $30 per ft 2 . A dam rehabilitation project in New York removed over 16,000 tons of concrete in blocks weighing 60-110 tons each.   [Source:  Water Power and Dam Construction  magazine, April 1989 and July 1991]   Stitch-drilling — Diamond drills have been used to core holes in concrete up to 54 inches in diameter. Larger holes can be made by drilling a series of overlapping small holes in a circle or straight line, called stitch-drilling.   Soundless chemical-demolition agents (SCDAs) — These come in powder form and are mixed with water to form a slurry, which is inserted in boreholes in rock or concrete. The main component of SCDAs is calcium oxide, which forms calcium hydroxide when water is added. The resulting volatile reaction creates heat, and as the material crystallizes within the rock, it causes a threefold increase in volume. Tensile fracturing may occur within 10-15 minutes or up to 24 hours. Although inhibitors can be added to retard the chemical reaction and increase control over the process, the technique is still primitive, and its actual field use has been quite limited. SCDAs have generally been used only where blasting is prohibited, and will eliminate flyrock, noise, fumes, and vibrations associated with blasting. SCDAs have been used underwater in Seattle to remove bridge piers from docks and to avoid blasting close to shore. The high cost of SCDAs and some bad experiences in controlling the pre-splitting have caused the Corps of Engineers to limit its use of the expansive agents.   [Source:  Civil Engineering  magazine, March 1990]   BRISTAR is a chemical-demolition agent designed for various temperature ranges, and has been used for several Reclamation projects. It generally requires holes from 1½-2 inches in diameter spaced less than 2 feet apart.   Boom-mounted hydraulic impact hammers — Hydraulic demolition hammers come in many sizes, and are pinned to a backhoe or excavator boom in place of the bucket. The strength of the material determines the hammer needed for the job; hard rock (granite) requires a more powerful hammer (5,000 foot-pounds [foot-lbs] or more), while softer rock (sandstone) can take a smaller hammer (500-1,500 foot-lbs). Blow-energy limitations are sometimes required to control microcracking of remaining surfaces and to limit vibrations. Operator skill plays a large role in demolition rates. A rock cliff was excavated away from a house in Boston at a rate of 50 cubic yards per day. [Source:  Civil Engineering  magazine, March 1990]   Mechanical splitters (rock jacks) — The splitter system consists of a hydraulic pump, hoses, and one or more splitters. A hydraulically-driven wedge is inserted into predrilled boreholes to create crack planes through the full depth of a concrete wall or slab. The key to its success is drilling boreholes that are accurate in diameter, length, and straightness. Drilling 3½-inch-diameter boreholes can be expensive, and the number of splitters needed to sustain a high removal rate may not be cost effective. [Source:  Civil Engineering  magazine, March 1990]   DARDA rock and concrete splitters use a wedge-plug and feathers mechanism powered by a 10,000 lbs/in 2  power pack and have been used on Reclamation projects..   Hydro-Demolition (water-blasting) — Hydro-demolition is characterized by water jet pressures between 12,000 and 18,000 lbs/in 2 , water flow rates of 25-40 gallons per minute, and a manipulator with an automatic repetitive function which controls movement of the jet. A fine jet of water under high pressure is directed at the concrete surface. The jet penetrates the surface and water is forced into cracks in the concrete, opening them up and breaking out loose material, which is flushed away. Hydro-demolition is generally used to remove poor quality concrete from finished surfaces, leaving good concrete untouched.

Twenty-foot-deep cuts have been reported in Canada.   Oxygen thermal lance (flame-cutting) — Cutting concrete in tight or inaccessible locations, or when the concrete is very hard or heavily reinforced, can be accomplished with the thermal lance. This technique uses burning oxygen and a pipe packed with steel wire to perforate even the strongest concrete. The pipe end is heated to red-hot and pressed into the concrete surface, where oxygen is supplied at full pressure (115-200 lbs/in 2 ). The pipe and wire core burn at a temperature of 5,400 °F or more, hot enough to melt cement, sand, aggregate, and reinforcing steel. Between 2 and 6 holes are generally required per foot of cut to produce perforations up to 10 feet deep for breaking the concrete into removable slabs. The thermal lance has been used successfully in Poland for many years, although the cost is high compared to mechanical methods under normal conditions.

The construction contractor will design the actual blasts based on operation constraints and site conditions. ""Delays"" will be required for all blasting, which means that time intervals will be required between the detonation of various blast holes. This time interval can be on the order of tens of milliseconds, but even this short time between detonation is sufficient to reduce ""airblast"" (noise) levels and ground vibrations, as well as allow for movement of the blasted material to produce a better product. Thus, the peak airblast (noise) levels are related to the maximum charge per delay, and not the total weight of explosive used in the blast. In addition, there are several other factors that can affect the noise produced by blasting such as weather conditions, initiation systems and exposed explosives, geologic conditions and resulting degree of confinement, and vegetation and topography.   It was assumed that a water gel with a density of 1.2 g/cm 3  would be used. This is not the same as ""efficiency"" which is expected to be similar to that of dynamite.   Time frames are also estimates, since they are based on an assumed start date of November 1, and assumed durations for various tasks. The estimates are from the schedule developed as of June 23, 1995. The timing of the actual work will depend to an extent on the contractor's operation.   It is possible to control airblast levels to a certain extent by putting limits in the specifications, and then requiring monitoring using approved airblast monitors at certain locations, perhaps during certain times of the year. The contractor can then adjust the blasting to meet the requirements. However, it should be noted that severe restrictions could make the excavations more difficult and time consuming, such that the schedule may no longer be realistic.   Below is a brief summary of the anticipated charge sizes and timing for each anticipated blasting activity.       ELWHA DAM   Blasting at Elwha Dam will generally be performed to excavate the diversion channel on the left abutment, and remove the concrete gravity dam, and associated structures.   Diversion Channel Excavation — The majority of diversion channel excavation is anticipated in May 1998. The maximum depth of excavation is about 35 feet, which will require removal in two lifts, assuming 3-inch-diameter holes will be used. Approximately 6 large blasts are anticipated, with one or two days between each blast, assuming that presplit holes will need to be drilled to control the channel shape. It was assumed that a cartridged water gel blasting agent (density 1.2 g/cm 3 ) would be used, resulting in a total of about 850 pounds of explosive for each shot. Millisecond delay blasting would be required. No more than about three holes (18 feet deep with 5 feet of stemming at the collar) would be fired on any given delay, resulting in a maximum charge weight per delay of around 100 pounds. Removal of the rock plug is anticipated to occur following the channel excavation in July 1998. This would require about 5 shots, each about one-tenth as big as the production channel blasts, over a period of 2 to 3 weeks.   Diversion Channel Excavation Summary      · Six shots; 850 pounds of explosive per shot; 100 pounds maximum per delay; one or two days between shots; May 1998.   · Five shots; 85 pounds of explosive per shot; 10 pounds maximum per delay; over a two to three week period; July 1998.          Dam Removal — Dam removal is anticipated to occur in two stages. The first stage would occur in July and August 1998 when the upper 30-foot portion of the dam would be removed; the lower 70-foot portion of the dam would be removed between December 1998 and April 1999. The concrete blasting will likely use smaller blasts and blast holes than the diversion channel excavation. The blasts would vary as the thickness of the dam increases, but typically it is estimated that 15 foot depths would be excavated using about 4 feet of stemming material. Around 40 to 50 shots would be required. A typical blast for the lower portion of the dam would contain about 200 pounds of explosive, with up to 50 pounds on a single delay. The upper portion would be about half of this. It is anticipated that there could be one shot per day.   Dam Removal Summary      · Upper portion above elevation of 170 feet; 10 shots; 100 pounds of explosive per shot; 30 pounds maximum per delay; one shot per day; August 1998.   · Lower portion below elevation of 170 feet; 30 to 40 shots; 200 pounds of explosive per shot; 50 pounds maximum per delay; up to one shot per day; between January and May 1999.      Removal of Other Structures — Other concrete structures to be blasted at Elwha Dam include the two spillways, the penstock intake structure, and the powerhouse. These structures contain reinforcement steel, but are generally less massive. Removal of these structures is constrained to a certain extent by other activities, but since their removal is not typically not on the critical path, it is difficult to estimate when it might occur. The blasts would probably be fairly small, with no more than 100 pounds in place, and no more than 10 pounds per delay.   Downstream Caisson (to elevation of 90 feet)      · One shot; 300 pounds of explosive; 50 pounds maximum per delay; April 1999.      Left Spillway      · Four or five shots: 180 pounds of explosive per shot: 10 to 20 pounds maximum per delay: up to one shot per day: March and April 1998.      Right Spillway      · Eight to ten shots: 140 pounds of explosive per shot: 10 to 20 pounds maximum per delay: up to one shot per day: August 1998.      Intake Structure      · Eight to ten shots: 360 pounds of explosive per shot: 20 to 40 pounds maximum per delay: up to one shot per day: September to November 1998.      Upstream Concrete Block      · Two shots: 450 pounds of explosive per shot: 75 pounds maximum per delay: September to November 1998.          GLINES CANYON DAM   The primary blasting at Glines Canyon Dam will be the ongoing presplitting, required to break the upper 130-foot portion of the arch dam concrete into blocks small enough to handle, blasting of about ten notches to facilitate diversion for diamond-wire sawcutting of the arch, and production blasting to remove the lower 60-foot portion of the arch, including blasting of six notches.   Ongoing Presplitting — Presplitting to break the concrete blocks into pieces small enough to handle will be occurring from time to time during the entire dam removal process. These will be typically small shots, with 7.5-foot-deep holes, and about 25 pounds of explosive initiated all at once.   Presplitting Summary      · Numerous shots occurring periodically at any time throughout the dam removal process, 25 pounds of explosive detonated simultaneously.      Notch and Production Blasting — Blasting for diversion notches and for the lower portion of the dam will be similar in nature. It is anticipated that this blasting will occur between August 1998 and May 1999. Additional blasting will also likely occur between July 1999 and October 1999. Notch blasting will vary with the location, but typically will contain 5 shots. The first would be the largest, containing a total of about 250 pounds of explosive (including the presplit charges), with about 50 pounds per delay maximum. The holes would be 15 feet deep with about 4 feet of stemming. The remaining four shots would be small to remove the upstream concrete plug, each containing about 20 pounds of explosive shot all at once. These five shots would typically occur the same day. There would typically be about one to two weeks between shots to accommodate the sawcutting (assuming two shifts are worked). Production blasting in the lower portion of the dam would be very similar, except that it would not be necessary to wait as long between blasts, which could be done about once a week, depending on stream flow.   Notch Blasting (down to elevation of 462 feet) Summary      · Series of five shots, the first shot with 250 pounds of explosives and 50 pounds of explosive per delay maximum, followed the same day by four shots of 20 pounds (same delay) each, one to two weeks between each series of shots, Ten such series of shots anticipated, August 1998 to May 1999.      Production Blasting (below elevation of 462 feet) Summary      · Twelve shots, approximately 250 pounds of explosive per shot, 50 pounds maximum per delay, up to one shot per day, February through April 1999 and July through September 1999.      Intake and Trashrack Structure — The penstock intake structure would also likely be blasted. The shots associated with this would be similar to those outlined for removal of the associated concrete structures at Elwha Dam.   Intake Structure Summary      · Two shots, one to remove trash rack structure and one to remove intake conduit, each 50 to 100 pounds of explosives with 10 pounds per delay maximum, November or December 1998."

GX070-40-9294771	"Slate   Slate is a fine grained crystalline rock metamorphosed from bedded deposits of clay and silt. It can be worked into shingles readily because it has two lines of breakability: cleavage and grain. These occur generally at right angles to each other and are independent of the original bedding planes. The structure of    Front  elevation of a dwelling published in  Supplement to Bicknell's Village Builder . A specification for one of the designs included this direction for the French roof: ""Slate the sides of the roof with slate 5 x 12 inches, cornered as shown on elevation, nailed with galvanized nails; all hips and valleys to be flashed with tin in the best manner."" (Courtesy of The Athenaeum of Philadelphia)   the bedding remains in some slate deposits as visible bands running across the cleavage. Known as ribbons, these bands may be either weaker or harder than the surrounding slate. Slate's durability as roofing is due to its high strength, low porosity and low absorption rate. Specific mineral components are responsible for the various colors: carbon (black), hematite (red and purple), chlorite and ferrous iron oxide (green). Other minerals, considered impurities (calcite and iron sulfides), are slowly transformed by weathering into gypsum, which expands and causes the slate to delaminate.     Slate has been used as a roofing material in Europe for hundreds of years, with surviving examples dating to the 8th century. From the 17th to the 19th centuries, most of the roofing slate used in America was imported from North Wales, where slate quarrying was a major industry. Although the first commercial slate quarry in the United States      The Vendor Slate Co. had ten quarries in Pennsylvania, Vermont and New York in 1929. ( Sweet's Architectural Catalogue , 1929. Courtesy of The Sweet's Group, The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.) [click image for larger view]    was opened in 1785 in Peach Bottom, Pennsylvania, the industry was limited and local until the second half of the 19th century. At that time the industry grew and matured in response to a growing population, advancements in quarrying technology, an expanding rail system, and the immigration of Welsh slate workers to America.    The United States became a slate exporter after the Civil War, as quarries opened in Vermont, New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. Architectural styles of this period emphasized prominent roof lines and decorative patterns, details that were well suited to the varied colors and shapes available in slate. Properties such as nonflammability, durability, minimal maintenance costs, and aesthetic value made slate all the more desirable. Its primary drawback was its weight, making shipping costly and requiring substantial roof framing.    Between 1897 and 1914 production peaked. Later use of slate often employed different thicknesses and colors, and unevenly cut or aligned butts to produce picturesque effects suitable for English revival styles popular in the early 20th century. After 1915 widespread use of slate roofing declined in the United States, due in part to a lack of skilled labor, but more importantly, due to the development of modern, mass produced materials such as asphalt shingles, which seemed the more economical alternative.      ""Not all that glitters is gold. Not all that looks like slate is good slate."" claims the Bangor Slate Co. of Easton, Pennsylvania. They issued this certificate in 1906 emphasizing the source of slate as an indication of quality. [click image for larger view]     A slate is typically attached to wooden sheathing with two nails driven through prepunched holes, though as with tile, it may be wired or screwed to steel angles on a steel framed roof. At the end of the19th century asphalt saturated felt laid over the wood sheathing became a standard part of most slate roof installations. Slate is installed with an overlap that depends on the slope of the roof and requires a minimum pitch (generally  4 inches of rise per 12 inches of run) to effectively shed water. Particularly in coastal areas slate can be found laid in mortar, providing extra protection against wind driven rain.    Today slate continues to be quarried domestically as well as being imported from Europe, China and South America.            Quarrying     Until the 1870s the quarrying of slate changed little from what is illustrated by Diderot in the  Pictorial Encyclopedia of Science Art and Technology  of 1762. Blocks were separated from the floor of the quarry using picks, wedges, prybars and gunpowder, taking maximum advantage of the natural seams in the rock. Windlasses and simple cranes employed man or horse power to lift blocks of slate from the pit. With the Industrial Revolution came mechanical drills and steam-powered stone channeling machines and hoists. Waste associated with blasting was reduced and efficiency increased. Subsequent advances were marked by the introduction of the wire saw in 1926 and the diamond belt saw in 1988.     Mineralogie, Ardoises D'Anjou. Travail de la Carrierre Ouverte et Outils.

Box 3667 Charlottesville Va 22903                                                                 SLATE       Slate is a dense, tough rock that cleaves easily into broad plates or sheets. It may contain preserved or relict bedding that was present in the shale from which it was formed. The cleavage, in most cases, does not follow the relict bedding planes, but cuts across them at various angles.     Slate is found in metamorphic rocks which are formed by the alteration of pre-existing igneous or sedimentary rocks. Metamorphic rocks are typically classified based on the characteristic textures that can be observed in hand specimens. Metamorphic rocks are divided into two distinct types: foliated and non-foliated. Foliated rocks, which include slate, are characterized by layering, banding and parallel alignment of the mineral grains which compose the rock. Foliated rocks may be split along roughly parallel surfaces, a property known as rock cleavage.     There are four main types of foliated metamorphic rocks - slate, phyllite, schist and gneiss. Slate is so fine-grained that many of its component mineral grains are barely visible to the naked eye.     Foliated metamorphic rocks are further named and described by adding mineral or rock names before the metamorphic rock name. For example, a slate containing scattered grains of pyrite is called pyritic slate.

GX013-07-15378304	Pollution Prevention Tips: Dyebath and Bleach Bath Reconstitution for Textile Mills   North Carolina Department of Natural Resources and Community Development       Technique   An alternative to the discharge of exhausted batch processing baths is to save the bath, analyze it for remaining chemical/dye quantities, and then reconstitute the bath for further use.  In this manner, a single processing bath can be reused many times before being discharged.  This will significantly reduce the volume of and pollutant concentration in your plants effluent.  For example, at one facility wastewater flow was reduced by 34% while COD was reduced by 33% due to a dyebath reconstitution program.   This is a very simple technique to implement and can be applied to both dyebaths and bleach baths.  With dyebaths, the potential for significant auxiliary chemical savings makes dyebath reconstitution an economically attractive alternative to conventional batch dyeing.  Recent research and applications have shown that dyebath reconstitution is applicable to a large amount of the batch dyeing being performed today, and not only to the repeat shade dyeing applications where it has been practiced in the past.  With bleach baths, particularly with synthetic fibers, many cycles of reuse can result in significant savings.   The reconstitution process, using dyebaths as an example, can be thought of as consisting of four parts:      Saving the just exhausted dyebath.   Two basic alternatives are available for saving the exhausted dyebath.  The dyebath can be pumped to a holding tank, while the product is rinsed in the same machine in which it was dyed.  Then as soon as the rinsed product is removed, the dyebath can be returned to the dye machine for the next dyeing cycle.   Alternatively, the dyed product can be pulled from the exhausted dyebath and moved to another machine for rinsing.  This alternative eliminates the need for holding tanks and pumps, but requires additional product handling and a spare machine to use for rinsing.   In either scheme the dyebath should be cooled with a non-contact cooling water system.  Using contact cooling water will dilute the dyebath, thus increasing the quantities of chemicals required for reconstitution.  Alternatively bump-and-run dyeing techniques can be used.    Analyzing the bath for residual chemicals.   Most auxiliary chemicals do not exhaust to an appreciable degree during the dyeing process.  Thus, the make-up quantity is about 10 percent, due to carryoff on the product.  Certain auxiliaries, however, will exhaust or be partially depleted during dyeing. Generally, it is sufficient to estimate the degree of exhaustion and the quantity needed to replenish the bath.   The unexhausted dyestuffs, however, must be analyzed to determine the exact quantities remaining in the dyebath.  This is to ensure that the proper shade is achieved in the next dyeing cycle.  The analysis is performed with a spectrophotometer.  Procedures for performing this analysis are presented in reference 2, along with a computer program which will simplify calculating the required dyestuff additions.    Reconstituting the bath.   Reconstituting the bath consists of adding back the quantities of water, auxiliary chemicals, and dyestuffs needed for the next dyeing cycle.  Water is added to replace any lost through evaporation or in the product.  Auxiliary chemicals are also added in proportion to the amount of water added.  Any auxiliary chemicals that exhaust during dyeing are added to make-up for such exhaustion losses.  In general, these quantities can be estimated and do not require exact analysis.  Dyestuff add quantities are determined by subtracting the quantities present in the exhausted dyebath (as determined above) from the recipe quantities for the next shade to be dyed.    Reusing the bath for subsequent processing.   The major difference in reusing a dyebath is that the starting temperature is generally higher than that of fresh water.  This starting temperature should be tested and evaluated so that spotting and levelness problems do not occur in the reuse dyeings. In general, the loss of heat during storage, and the cooling due to make-up water are sufficient to drop the dyebath temperature to a safe level.   This technique has been used on a variety of fibers and dyestuffs.   Examples of full scale applications include:       Product   Fiber   Dyestuff   Dye Machines     Woven Fabric   Nomex   Basic   Jet     Woven Fabric   Cotton   Direct   Reel     Woven Fabric   Cotton   Vat/Sulfur   Jig     Ladies' Hosiery   Nylon   Disperse   Paddle/Drum     Carpet   Nylon   Acid   Beck     Yarn   Acrylic   Basic   Package      Textile dyeing is a complicated process and consequently there are many factors that may affect the implementation of dyebath reconstitution.  Procedures for evaluating the potential for starting a dyebath reconstitution program at your facility as well as procedures for establishing such a program are detailed in reference 2.      Capital and Operating Costs   Only a limited amount of equipment is needed to implement a dyebath reconstitution system.  This includes: storage tanks, necessary pumps, piping and valves and laboratory equipment.  Capital costs for a reconstitution system can be estimated based on the unit costs presented below:       Spectrophotometer   $3,000     Miscellaneous Labware   1,000     Desk Computer   5,000     Holding Tank (2,000 gal.)   6,000     Pump, Controls (200 gpm)    4,000     Piping, Valves, Screen (per tank)   6,000      Larger tanks, pumps and piping  will  be  required  for  large  dyebecks, such as in the carpet finishing sector of the industry.   Operating costs for reconstitution systems include the power for dyebath pumping, pump maintenance costs, and miscellaneous labware costs.  No additional manpower requirements are included for dyebath analysis, since this takes only a few minutes per cycle. A conservative estimate of annual operating costs is $2,000 per beck.   The estimated cost of implementing a dyebath reconstitution program at a typical dyehouse having five 1,500 gallon backs would be:      Capital Cost    Spectrophotometer   $ 3,000     Computer   5,000     Labware   1,000     Holding Tanks (5 @ 2,000 gal.)   30,000     Pumps, Controls   20,000     Piping, etc.   30,000     Total Capital Cost   $89,000     Yearly Operating Costs   $10,000      The actual costs will be very site specific and will depend on such factors as the volume of dye liquor to be handled and the physical layout of the production lines.    Pay Back   The economics of dyebath reconstitution will vary depending on a number of factors including the value of the auxiliary chemicals used, the type of dyestuffs, and liquor ratios used in dyeing. Based on the example given above the annual savings for the model facility would be:       Water Use (30,000 gpd)   $3,750     Sewer Use (30,000 gpd)   3,750     Energy (22.5 mm Btu/dav)   22,500     Auxiliary Chemicals   75,000     Total Savings   $105,000     Net Yearly Savings   $95,000      This would result in a pay back period of only 11 months.  After this initial period the dyebath reconstitution system would save $95,000 per year in operating costs.   Use of this technique at a number of plants has resulted in significant savings.  Reduction it auxiliary chemical, dye and water/sewer costs have been reduced by as much as 60%, 197, and 43%, respectively.  As can be seen, dyebath reconstitution is a very simple and economical method which can be used to reduce the cost of raw materials, water and wastewater treatment.

GX261-85-7137472	height and thickness of the dam section compared to the Wildcat and Eagle Canyon Dams, and considering the accessibility of the site. The cost estimate for partial removal assumes excavation of the masonry structure between the abandoned fish ladder on the left abutment and the canal wall on the right abutment, including removal of the 14- by 8- foot radial gate and hoist, the 2-foot-wide fish ladder gate and hoist, the Alaska Steeppass fish ladder, and the steel footbridge from the right abutment. Other miscellaneous metalwork to be removed includes the pipe handrails and CMP standpipes. The cost estimate for full removal includes removal of the abandoned fish ladder on the left abutment and of the masonry gravity weir structure on the right abutment. Any removal or modification of the existing Coleman Canal retaining wall are assumed to be included in the cost estimates for the direct connection pipe from the Inskip Powerhouse tailrace. d. Site restoration. - The overflow portion of the masonry dam would be removed to the original streambed grade, with the rubble distributed across the downstream channel and the concrete waste removed from the site. The proposed partial removal plan would retain the original fish ladder structure on the left abutment, which has already been modified for abandonment, and the existing masonry gravity weir structure on the right abutment. Backfill behind the weir structure would be shaped and seeded to provide a natural appearance. Sediment management at the site is discussed in Section G, which may require the excavation of a new channel through the upstream sediment. A final site inspection should be performed following the winter and spring runoff to confirm the adequacy of the dam removal and upstream channelization work. F. Waste Disposal 1. Construction Debris Onsite disposal of construction debris should be used to the maximum practicable extent at all three damsites, to reduce costs. The masonry materials are believed to generally consist of rounded cobbles ranging between 6 inches and 2 feet in size, within a cement mortar matrix, and can safely be left within the stream channels, provided they are distributed sufficiently to prevent ponding. Waste concrete and other debris should be buried outside the stream channels, either within adjoining canals (as at Eagle Canyon Dam) or offsite. If a suitable disposal site cannot be found near each damsite, a commercial site, such as Anderson-Cottonwood Disposal (phone 530-221-4784), may be used. This study assumes disposal sites will be located within 1 mile of each damsite. Mechanical items and miscellaneous metalwork removed from the damsites may have some commercial value, and should be salvaged to help offset removal costs, as well as for environmental (recycling) considerations, if practicable. Landowners in the area have reportedly expressed some interest in the 24-inch-diameter pipe from the Wildcat Canal, and the semicircular flume plate sections from the Eagle Canyon Canal. The California Department of Fish and Game has expressed interest in the Alaska Steeppass fish ladders at the dams, for potential use at other sites. The structural steel slide gate and Limitorque operator, and the access stairways, at Eagle 17   Canyon Dam would probably have some resale value, as would the access footbridge at Coleman Dam. PG&E may wish to retain some of the control equipment for use at their other dams. The older gates, hoists, pipe handrails, CMP standpipes, and miscellaneous steel sections may only have scrap value. Short's Scrap Metal (phone 530-243-4780) or other area recycling firms may be willing to purchase these items. Cost estimates for this study do not include any salvage value for any items removed from the dams.  2. Hazardous Waste Hazardous materials anticipated to be encountered as a result of the dam removal work include minor amounts of lead-based paints, oil, and grease. A slight potential for PCB (polychlorinated biphenyl) contamination may exist due to the presence of upstream powerplants. Site assessments should be performed to establish all potential environmental hazards existing at each damsite prior to final designs. A visual inspection and regulatory/literature search should first be performed to establish the possible presence of hazardous materials, followed by a more detailed evaluation to confirm the presence and extent of the hazardous materials and to plan appropriate actions for removal [8]. For the purpose of the current study, no hazardous waste is assumed to be present at any of the sites which would significantly impact costs for dam removal. G. Sediment Management 1. General Sediment has almost completely filled the reservoirs impounded by the three diversion dams proposed for removal on North Fork Battle Creek and South Fork Battle Creek. The Sedimentation and River Hydraulics Group (D-8540) was requested to assess the feasibility of allowing the river to naturally erode the sediment deposited behind these dams. Potential problems associated with allowing the river to naturally erode sediments behind a dam include [8]: Temporary increase of turbidity and associated environmental problems. Sediment deposition downstream, causing increased flood stage, localized blockage of facilities along the river, and damaged fish habitat. Movement of sediment wave downstream. Release of contaminated sediment. Using simple hydraulic and sediment transport analysis, this section addresses the likelihood that such problems will occur at this site.  18
GX014-96-7819705	"Umiat           Umiat is a small facility located about 150         southeast of Barrow and 70 miles southwest of Nuiqsut on         the north shore of the Colville River. Access is limited         mostly to air or occasionally river traffic. Ever since         its establishment during the late 40's and early 50's,         Umiat has served as an oil and gas facility and has no         significance to the Natives. It is also the site of the         first oil strike on the North Slope, and it predates         Prudhoe Bay by 20 years.                                           After the NPR-4 was laid         aside in 1923, limited exploration was done around the         Umiat area until the discovery of oil seeps in 1943.         These oil seeps sparked interest of many, and in 1944 a         party of Navy enlisted men structurally mapped the area         in detail. As a result of their mapping, the first         drilling site was chosen (Umiat Test Well 1).                       Scars still         remain from the early days of exploration.            It  is located         near the                       Umiat anticline's axis on upper         Seabee Creek. The well was spudded June 1945, shut down         in September, and reopened the following June. Only a         trace of oil shows were discovered. About 120 gallons         were recovered in the hole the following year when         operations were resumed. Apparently while sitting during         the winter, the drilling fluid froze and oil seeped out         on top of it. At about the same time         test well 1 was under construction, a base camp was set         up in present day Umiat. Ten other wells were drilled in         the immediate area over the next 8 years. Seven of the         ten had significant oil shows (test well 8 also had         natural gas shows). Something that is peculiar is the         close proximity of test wells 2 and 5. Test well 5 had         good shows while 2 was dry. This is because the wrong         type of muds were used in test well 2. These muds reacted         with the clay layers beneath, causing swelling and thus         blocking the oil from the drill hole.            A large percentage of the oil discovered here         came from the Grandstand Formation. The Grandstand         Formation is the lower most sequence of the Nanushuk         Group.  It is comprised of         marine sandstone sequences from both the Early and Late         Cretaceous. In the localities tested, this oil producing         formation is generally between 660-760 ft. in thickness.            There are currently 12 documented wells in the         area, Umiat Test Wells 1-11 (previously discussed) and         Seabee Test Well No. 1. Seabee Test Well, is one of the         28 exploratory wells drilled in the late 70's.           Even though the days of oil and gas         exploration are dead and gone, the area is still rich in         early exploration history.            Today, Umiat is used primarily for         recreational purposes. Often in the summer it gets use         from floatboaters, hunters, pilots and government         workers. Umiat currently has its own version of the         ""Hilton"" with 5 bunk rooms available to rent.         The airstrip is well maintained by the Department of         Transportation and is long enough to land a DC-6. Even         though air traffic is light most of the year, BLM is         proposing an air park to be located on the apron of the         north side of the runway. The air park would contain half         a dozen sites complete with only cleared spaces for         tents. Also present would be a historical static display         of a Weasel (tracked vehicle used in oil exploration)         from Umiat and an interpretive panel on early         exploration.

Legislation authorizing the ANSS was passed in 2000, and low levels of funding for planning and initial purchases of new seismic instrumentation have been appropriated beginning in FY2000. When fully operational, the ANSS will be an advanced monitoring system (modern digital seismographs and accelerographs, communications networks, data collection and processing centers, and well-trained personnel) distributed across the United States that operates with high performance standards, gathers critical technical data, and effectively provides timely and reliable earthquake products, information, and services to meet the Nation's needs. The ANSS will automatically broadcast timely and authoritative products describing the occurrence of earthquakes, earthquake source properties, the distribution of ground shaking, and, where feasible, broadcast early warnings and alerts for the onset of strong ground shaking. Most importantly, the ANSS will provide earthquake data, derived products, and information to the public, emergency responders, officials, engineers, educators, researchers, and other ANSS partners rapidly and in forms that are useful for their needs. The ANSS Technical Integration Committee (TIC) oversees the organization and activities needed to develop the technical basis for the ANSS. The strategy for ANSS implementation relies on recent advances in seismic instrumentation, wide area computer networking, data analysis, and earthquake products, all of which address the needs of a variety of users in all parts of the country. The Technical Guidelines for the Implementation of the Advanced National Seismic System, Version 1.0 (hereafter, Technical Guidelines) augment these advances by establishing guidance that is applicable to the national system and by identifying specifications for new equipment and software that will better meet the needs of the users of the ANSS. This document describes the key design and performance characteristics of the integrated ANSS. The implementation of the ANSS will undoubtedly cause significant changes in current regional networks. The result will be a new national system, built from standardized components, which may include local modifications for special situations. The TIC and its subcommittees extracted ANSS design goals from USGS Circular 1188, interpreting and expanding them as deemed necessary. The subcommittees then worked to develop functional specifications and high-level design elements. The most important element discussed has been an overall system organization that forms the framework for all subsequent design work. The technical architecture and its development are highly dependent on this organizational structure.  1   ANSS TG v 1.0 The proposed ANSS organization has clear similarities to the current configuration of the National Seismic System (NSS). The dependence on local expertise to interpret the data, a regional level approach to data acquisition and processing, a national operation center to provide a global overview, and a national archiving system all build on concepts of proven worth. However, the organization also reflects ANSS goals of coherent national integration, highly dependable rapid response, uniform, high-quality earthquake products, and widely available data sets. As part of the process of developing these consensus guidelines and standards for the ANSS, the Technical Integration Committee formed five subcommittees to address particular aspects of the system: Archiving and Distribution, Data Analysis and Products, Instrumentation, Network Architecture and Interconnection, and Siting and Installation. Figure 1 illustrates the responsibilities of the various functional components of the ANSS as covered by these committees.  Figure 1: Functional diagram of ANSS components, color-coded by the responsibility of the TIC subcommittees. Primary elements include stations, operation centers, archiving facilities, and the links among them. The white boxes indicate ANSS users. The ANSS will have both real-time (RT) and archival Data Base Management Systems (DBMS).  2   ANSS TG v 1.0  1.2 Vocabulary In describing the design of the ANSS it is important to use a well-defined nomenclature. For the purposes of this document the following meanings for commonly used terms are followed. Some of these terms have a different emphasis or specific meaning than some current uses. waveforms  raw, unprocessed, but possibly reformatted ground motion time series metadata - information needed to process or interpret seismological waveforms (station location, instrument calibration, site geology, site velocity structure, etc.) products - routinely produced earthquake parameters or other results of automatic and manual processing (picks, hypocenters, peak accelerations, shake maps, etc.) data - referring to any or all of waveforms, metadata, and products information  interpreted seismological data (tectonic framework, hazard evaluations, building safety, etc.) operation center  A physical facility housing staff and equipment for the routine operation and maintenance of ANSS hardware and software and routine data processing. Staff includes operators, technicians, analysts, etc. ANSS user - anyone interested in acquiring ANSS waveforms, products, or information (also referred to as end users or customers) Outlet  Any facility that has a standing request for waveforms or products (i. e., data and/or products are delivered to the outlet as soon as they are available at the respective operation center or archive facility). The many types and responsibilities of outlets more fully described in Appendix D. data archive system  one or more physical facilities housing staff and equipment for the long-term storage and distribution of data. Staff includes operators, technicians, and data base specialists. (data) client - a software module accessing a shared resource in a distributed system. For example, real-time modules within an operation center are clients to the shared buffer. Also, a module handling real-time data input at an operation center is a client to a remote data source. As a system, the ANSS will consist of various functions conducted at one or more facilities. The following five main functional activities are at the core of the ANSS. Instrumentation: Activities related to the installation, operation, and maintenance of field equipment (seismometers, accelerometers, DASes, etc.). Concentration: The process of consolidating telemetered, digitized waveforms from various station equipment, converting to a common format, and forwarding to one or  3   ANSS TG v 1.0 more operation centers. Concentration takes place at data concentrators, which may be collocated with other facilities. Processing: Activities related to the routine analysis of waveforms to produce summary parameters and other products. Routine processing is performed at operation centers. Real-time products are pushed to critical users from the operation centers. Archiving: Functions related to the permanent storage and distribution of ANSS data and products and their distribution to end-users. Interpretation: Activities related to the generation of scientific, engineering, and emergency response information. These include the public and civil authorities involved in earthquake response as well as scientists and engineers involved in research and development. Interpretation activities also can include feedback for the development of new operational capabilities. Interpretation is performed at (data or information) outlets. Each of the above functions is performed at one or more ANSS facilities and a facility may house more than one of these functions. ANSS facilities generally can be classified into: National: Activities or operations pertaining to the Nation as a whole. Regional: Activities or operations pertaining to one of the ANSS regions. Information outlet: Activities related to interpreting and providing information to end-users. Research and Development: Activities pertaining to improvements of ANSS processing or information products. Contributing: Activities or operations in ANSS partner networks that are not part of the ANSS core infrastructure but that exchange data with or augment the ANSS in some way (public-private partnerships, State or other Federal agencies, foreign entities, etc.).  1.3 Existing seismic network situation Many models of ANSS architecture may be constructed from a combination of functions and facilities. Before discussing the ANSS architecture recommended herein, we begin with the current system.  4   ANSS TG v 1.0  Figure 2. Key colors and symbols used for subsequent diagrams of ANSS organization. Note that functions (routine operation, interpretation and development, etc.) are represented by different symbols while types of ANSS facilities are represented by a different fill colors/patterns. The current state of national earthquake monitoring is illustrated in Figure 3, where there are activities at both the contributing and national level. Symbols in close proximity on this figure imply that the functions are collocated at the same facility. At the contributing level are the existing regional seismic networks, some supported by the USGS and others not. The current activities of these networks (station operation and maintenance, data processing, information production and distribution, and archiving) are generally characterized by a wide-range of hardware and software solutions and are not uniform across all networks. No ""regional"" (new ANSS meaning of ""regional"") activities or facilities are illustrated in Figure 3. Although the contributing networks are beginning to organize along regional lines, no regional centers have been officially designated. The National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) represents the current level of national activities, involving station operations, processing, and information distribution. All of the currently contributing centers (RSNs) that receive some USGS funding have established data exchange with the NEIC and, in some cases, with other centers. There is no true national archiving facility at this time, although some contributing networks archive data at the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) Data Management Center (DMC) while others have established local archives.  5   ANSS TG v 1.0  Figure 3: In the current system, the local processing centers are characterized by a wide range of hardware and software. Functionality of the system elements is highly variable though each center usually houses all functions mixed together. Data exchange between centers is highly variable. Although many aspects of the seismic monitoring in the United States have improved in the last few years, the current operations do not represent a true ""system"". In fact, the majority of seismic monitoring stations in the US are still short period stations, and strong motion sensors often are not digitally recorded. Although some components perform extremely well, others do not. Overall, the current state of seismic monitoring lacks a coherent and integrated structure. This is one of the major problems that the ANSS addresses. The current state of seismic monitoring is characterized by a complex topology, which is highly heterogeneous (different hardware and software in the different components) as well as highly asymmetric (different levels in the system performing different functions). Most current networks perform all functions at the same place with the same personnel. Products are ad hoc and not universally available and no uniform standards are applied. The existing system also has some fundamental vulnerability due to several operating facilities being located in areas of high seismic hazard.  1.4 Basics of the ANSS organization It is clear from Circular 1188 (a basis for the authorizing legislation for the ANSS) that a change from the current organizational structure is needed. Based on a review of circular 1188 and related documents, reports of the TIC subcommittees, and review and discussion within the TIC, we recommend an organizational structure with a strong and relatively standardized regional and national structure for routine monitoring operations and a separation of the development and interpretation functions from routine processing. This model is based on the following assumptions and characteristics: 1.  The ANSS is a complex system. A system is ""hardware, software, and people working together to solve a particular problem, or to produce a desired effect."" All components of the system need to be considered in order to produce the  6   ANSS TG v 1.0 ANSS. A ""systems engineering"" approach will be applied to the detailed design of the ANSS. To maximize reliability and produce uniformly high quality waveforms and products the operation of the ANSS will be undertaken by a dedicated operations staff. At the same time, to make ANSS products relevant and effective, ANSS design and management should be undertaken by scientists and engineers. Close coordination between the routine operation functions and the design/interpretation functions is essential. The ANSS is organized into regions, a national operation center, and a national archiving system, with one primary and perhaps other secondary operation facilities within each region. The regional operation centers will be responsible for managing the instrumentation and data collection within the region and for routine processing, and reporting on earthquakes in their geographical area. Each state or territory falls within a region. The ANSS must provide mechanisms for distribution of earthquake information and products to a wide variety of users over a broad range of time scales. The operation centers have the responsibility to provide earthquake waveforms and products to time-critical users, while the archiving facilities distribute waveforms and products to non-time-critical users. The ANSS will have a single long-term archiving system that is decoupled from the real-time routine processing functions. This may be a distributed system or it may be a single archive facility. Proper care must be taken for the ultimate recovery of all archived data in case of facility failure, and recent data must be recovered quickly. Ultimately the archiving system must insure that the system functions through periods of natural disasters and insure the long-term safekeeping of all data and derived products for future use. The requirements for the ANSS will evolve as the system develops and even after it is fully deployed. Mechanisms to allow changes and evolution in the technical and functional specifications and design as development efforts are evaluated will be established.  2.  3.  4.   5.   6.   7.   The ANSS requires multiple routine operational centers to avoid single points of failure and to be able to adapt quickly and efficiently to special regional conditions or situations. Therefore the ANSS requires robust and reliable exchange of a variety of data and products among facilities or components of the system. There is little difference between the national and various regional operating centers other than size and geographic areas of responsibility. In general there will be only one primary operational center per ANSS region at which routine data processing for the whole region will be done. The national level operation center will act as backup for all regions as well as coordinate issues between regions. One or more of the regional centers (or a separate facility) will also act as backup for the national center responsibilities in the event of a failure at the national center. A fundamental difference between the ANSS and the current monitoring situation is a clear separation of the routine operation of the ANSS from the development and interpretation aspects, as discussed in Appendix D. While in some of the currently  7   ANSS TG v 1.0 operating network centers there is some separation of these responsibilities there is rarely a formal distinction. The interpretation and development personnel are involved with operations from time to time at nearly all existing networks. The capabilities of modern computer networking obviate the requirement that they be housed in the same physical facility though in some cases there may be reasons to do so. Figure 4 illustrates the ANSS organizational structure: the functions of routine operation are separate from interpretation and development. A contributing (currently operating) network closely involved with a regional ANSS operation is included. Connecting arrows represent data or information flow paths. Line thickness is proportional to data volume.  Figure 4: This figure illustrates the ANSS organizational model, consisting of regional and the national centers with associated interpretation functions distributed more widely. A contributing network is shown with open symbols but is not an official part of the ANSS. Generally the flow of data through the proposed model for the ANSS is from bottom to top. At the bottom, seismic stations measure ground motion that is telemetered to data concentrators collocated with operation (data processing) centers. Data concentrators may be installed at remote locations to concentrate data from several seismic stations, perhaps reformat the data into standard ANSS data packets, and forward these data to operation centers over high capacity data communication circuits. National backbone stations are telemetered directly to the national operation center on independent circuits. Note that data telemetered into a data concentrator are immediately passed on to other centers as well as the local center. Automated earthquake products are produced at the operation centers and immediately distributed to interpretation outlets. Automated products are coordinated system wide through a set of business rules. The critical task of interpretation of ANSS data is conducted at information outlets. While the real-time ANSS infrastructure has been simplified in the interest of reliability, information outlets encompass everyone involved in translating seismic waveforms and  8   ANSS TG v 1.0 products into earthquake information. Note that information outlets have access to as many waveforms and products as needed to perform their function. The modularization of data acquisition, processing, and consumption (at the outlets) provides considerable flexibility in the ANSS infrastructure. For example, data concentrators could be remote from any operation center, concentrating stations onto high-speed communications links, and providing the data to multiple operation centers. Alternatively, station data could be multicast from the field to several operation centers and an archive facility through collocated data concentrators. The ability to collocate a concentrator with an operation center means that the design of the operation centers or archive facilities is independent of the field telemetry architecture. The concept of an outlet is very general and many types are envisioned. Outlets involved in rapid response activities (state offices of emergency services (OESs), emergency manager's trusted sources, and institutions interpreting the data for the media) are fed data and products directly from operation centers. Non-time critical outlets (e. g., research and development) are fed data from the data archive facilities to ensure complete data sets and to prevent burst loads on critical real time facilities. Outlets fed from the archive facilities may still be performing mission critical ANSS tasks (catalog production, hazard studies) and may still receive data in real time. Outlets may be operational (involved in reviewing real-time products) or informational. Outlets may be involved in the development of new ANSS products, procedures, or algorithms. Each operation center serves as a production outlet, interacting with the data archive to provide authoritative reviewed products, maintain metadata, and perform quality control (QC) functions. Quality control encompasses activities that assure the user of the quality of distributed data and products and may include manual product review, station calibration, metadata validation, and monitoring of field clock quality. Reviewed products (including quality controlled waveform data) are transmitted to the data archive facility as soon as they are completed. The one-to-one association between these special production outlets (shown in the same color as their respective operation centers in figure 4) is necessary to ensure that reviewed products have the same authoritative status as automatic products. Note that it is not essential that all operational functions be conducted in one production outlet per operation center. For example, it might be useful to collocate the rapid review of products with the operation center to enhance reliability while metadata maintenance functions are done elsewhere. For a more complete description of outlets, see Appendix D. The ANSS must establish appropriate standards for operation. Detailed standards are beyond the scope of this document. However, they should be established early in the development of the technical components of the system and be based on sound practice and technical capabilities. These standards for operation should be reviewed and updated as appropriate at a national level. The ANSS is a revolutionary effort to modernize the seismic monitoring system within the United States. The design of the ANSS should not be hampered by the state of seismic monitoring prior to the start of ANSS. Nevertheless, it is important to define an evolutionary path from the current situation to the final model, without interrupting  9   ANSS TG v 1.0 operations. Implementation of this transition will be the responsibility of the ANSS Implementation Committee assisted by the regional working groups; however the TIC assumes that most current network operations will become involved in some aspect of the ANSS organization. Some of the existing network operations centers may become regional operation centers. Others will take on the important tasks of interpreting ANSS data and helping with development of new ANSS capabilities. Detailed aspects of the ANSS system design and functional specifications for its various components are covered in the following chapters. Each is largely based on the respective subcommittee reports. In particular the ""Network Architecture and Interconnection"" chapter is critical to the system as a whole.  1.5 Evolution of the Technical Guidelines The Technical Guidelines is the first step in the implementation of the ANSS. It outlines the basic architecture of the ANSS and provides general guidelines on key technical issues regarding data collection, archiving, and analysis; instrumentation; site installation; and dissemination of products. Detailed technical standards are beyond the scope of this document, but will be developed based on these guidelines, sound seismological practice, and technical capabilities as technical components are developed throughout the implementation of the ANSS. This document represents the collective wisdom of a large portion of the seismological and earthquake engineering communities, summarized in technical reports from five subcommittees that form the basis of this document. The ANSS Technical Integration Committee (TIC) edited, reorganized, and repackaged the subcommittee reports, adding text as necessary. The Technical Integration Guidelines is very much influenced by the state-of-the-art today, and yet attempts to be visionary. This document is intended to be a living document that forms the technical framework for the ANSS. The TIC understands that as the system develops, technical questions relating to the development, deployment and operation of such a large system will require additional input. The Technical Integration Guidelines will continue to evolve and adapt to changing requirements as necessary. Revisions of the Technical Integration Guidelines document (exclusive of attachments) will be published as higher version numbers (e.g., a minor revision to accommodate the first attachment might be version 1.1, while a major revision of one or more chapters might be published as version 2.0). The TIC anticipates that input of a technical nature will continue to be needed by the ANSS. For this reason we recommend that the TIC continue to exist throughout the life of the ANSS to provide technical input and direction to the National Implementation Committee. We further recommend that the six members of the TIC continue to serve terms such that two members rotate off the TIC on an annual basis and two new members rotate on to the TIC. From time to time the TIC may populate a variety of temporary subcommittees or working groups where specific expertise is needed. In this manner the ANSS can continue to respond to new technological challenges as they arise.  10   ANSS TG v 1.0  2 Network Architecture and Interconnection 2.1 Overall Organization The TIC recommends a regionalized architecture for the ANSS with a primary operation/processing center in each ANSS region and a single national operation/processing center. This model provides multiple processing centers for redundancy, while allowing for customization for regional needs. This model also provides a natural scale for addressing issues of data quality control, scalability of processing systems, redundant reporting, product quality control, and flexibility and responsiveness to local contacts. Besides the primary operation/processing center for each region, there may be multiple operation centers for station and telemetry maintenance and multiple information outlets. Existing local networks likely will be transformed into an operation center or information outlet. The regional model of the ANSS implies consolidation and coordination of effort among the participating networks. The facilities of some local networks may become maintenance and data concentrators with processing activities occurring at the regional center. Local network operators may continue to be involved in station operation and maintenance, but their scientific expertise also will be devoted more to interpretation, research, and development using data from any subset (or all) of the ANSS. The rest of this chapter concentrates on the initial design of the routine operation part of the ANSS. While scientists and design engineers will be involved with development work on these components, professional engineers, programmers, and operators will perform the actual implementation and operation.  11   ANSS TG v 1.0  Region A  National  Region B  Region C  Figure 5: A map view of the hierarchy illustrated in Figure 4. This figure shows 4 adjoining regions with various ANSS elements. Note that existing networks are shown as collocated data concentrators and outlets. Regional and national centers are shown with the associated outlet collocated (collocated concentrators are not shown). Also, a distributed archive is hypothesized with both national and regional elements. The ANSS is a complex system, partly due to the number of nodes and interconnections. Therefore the TIC recommends minimizing the number of regional centers and concentrators within individual regions. The model calls for establishing one processing center per region, but recognizes that there may be exceptions. The advantages of locating the regional processing centers away from areas of significant seismicity are obvious. At a minimum, ANSS centers must be placed in facilities where appropriate earthquake resistant mitigation efforts have been completed. Note that local expertise will be available at many of the data outlets  12   ANSS TG v 1.0 In this model, the regional processing center will be the central hub of routine operations in an ANSS region. This center will have primary responsibility for rapid earthquake processing and notification. While the regional processing center will receive waveform and parametric data from different components of the system, and from adjoining regions, it will be the authoritative source of information on earthquakes in its region and will have responsibility for distribution of this information in near-real time to a multitude of information outlets. This role in the processing and distribution of rapid earthquake information makes the regional processing centers critical elements of the ANSS, requiring high levels of performance and robust and reliable operation. The national processing center will have similar capabilities and will receive data from all regions and the national stations and be capable of acting as backup for all regional processing functions. The national processing center will also act as coordinator between regions and arbitrate between discrepancies in products provided by different regions for the same event. The success of this regionalized model depends on the requirement that operators adhere to ANSS performance standards.  2.2 General Issues and Recommendations Quality control for the ANSS is crucial and must be a fundamental part of the ANSS system. Due to the number of seismic stations, number of channels, volume of waveform data, and abundance of products, quality control will most likely have to be much more automated than in the past. Systems must be designed to routinely monitor the characteristics of waveforms, including time, and data quality (dropouts, noise, etc) and alerts must be generated when parameters fall outside acceptable limits. Part of the system specification will clearly identify the performance standards. Major types of quality control must address items such as 1) waveform timing, 2) quality of instrument calibration including schedules for calibration, 3) accuracy of station metadata, 4) data availability statistics (uptime), 5) error estimates of measured parameters such as phase picks, and 6) error estimates of calculated parameters such as hypocentral locations or moment magnitudes. System wide quality control techniques (for example, using mining blasts to check station timing) will be important. Metadata will be maintained at the regional centers and techniques to test the accuracy of the metadata will be necessary. Quality control is an ANSS-wide issue. The methods and techniques used to monitor data quality should be standard. Although individual regions may have specific problems, the development of quality control techniques and standards should be consistent across the entire system. Distributed reporting of rapid earthquake information raises questions about robust data delivery if a regional processing center is disabled. Although the ANSS could implement a ""nearest-neighbor"" regional backup model, having the national processing center act as the backup to each region is the simplest model. At least one regional processing center (or a separate facility) must be able to reproduce the capabilities of the national  13   ANSS TG v 1.0 processing center in terms of global monitoring in the event of a failure at the national processing center. Rapid notification requires rapid review in order to confirm event validity or to remove spurious events. It is anticipated that each production outlet involved in rapid review will require a staff member to be either on site or on call at all times  with the expectation that earthquake alarms will be reviewed within a few minutes after notification. The generation of reviewed earthquake products will be performed in each region. Strictly speaking, the system architecture is relatively insensitive to the location of this activity. Although some aspects of design are simplified if this is centralized at a national facility, it seems clear that each region can provide more local understanding and should be responsible for its earthquake products. Production outlet(s) closely associated with the national processing center will be responsible for coordinating regional products, producing uniform national products, and producing and reviewing products for global events. Appropriate business rules and mechanisms will be required to keep the national and regional products synchronized. The ANSS will be a real-time system with all stations connected to real-time telemetry links (including structure-monitoring arrays). While some channels may be telemetered only when triggered by strong shaking, the system must be capable of telemetering all channels in real-time, with possible minor delays (seconds) in extreme cases. We assume that there will be no fundamental difference between the way weak and strong motion data are handled. Network design goals for real-time strong-motion stations are, in principle, the same as for other seismic instrumentation. However, some data will not arrive in real time, either because of telemetry failure or network congestion, particularly during large events. Thus the ANSS must be designed to handle late data as well as data that arrive out of order. The size of the data channels, both within processing systems and for telemetry between centers, is well within the technical limits of computer and networking technology, particularly since this technology continues to advance at a rapid rate. The aggregate data rate of all ANSS seismic channels is assumed to be less than 20Mb/s (see Appendix B). Including data from non-ANSS sources will increase this rate but it should still be within technical limitations of even current capabilities. Standardization, particularly as it relates to software, is a tricky issue. Using the exact same software is desirable to maximize efficiency and provide uniform products. However, uniformity often stifles innovation and in any case the system must be designed so that it has flexibility to deal with special local or regional problems. The TIC proposes that software for routine operations be largely standardized, but allow for local customization where warranted. The TIC sees no reason to require standardization at outlets other than the production outlets. Rather, software diversity at most outlets should be encouraged to promote the development and testing of new operational as well as interpretation algorithms.  14   ANSS TG v 1.0  2.3 Functional Design To address the issues of functional design for the ANSS, this section is organized into several subsections:  System Attributes and Issues  Data Flow among Elements of the ANSS  Data Distribution within Processing Centers  Rapid Data Delivery  Offline or Manual Review  Figure 6: Schematic illustration of ANSS functions and data flow among ANSS elements. The large rectangles encompass the tasks of regional/national processing centers and production outlets. To facilitate the discussion of these issues, Figure 6 illustrates the ANSS design in greater detail. This figure uses the symbology of Figure 2, but does not attempt to identify different levels of functionality. For example, the processing operations (square) include components for data acquisition, ""online"" or automated processing, ""offline"" or manual review processing, and quality control (encompassing data concentrator, processing center, and production outlets). There are also elements for rapid notification, archiving, 15   ANSS TG v 1.0 and data distribution. Colored lines among elements of Figure 6 indicate communication links where waveforms, metadata and products may flow. Some of these transactions will be continuous (for example, waveform exchange among the processing centers and to the archiving facilities) while others will be on-demand (for example, possible use of database interactions). Figure 6 also illustrates the different levels of data persistence or storage that may be required by the ANSS. Processing systems will use two levels of data buffers. One provides for relatively recent data and will be designed so that real-time processing applications associated with the processing center can access data in the appropriate time frame. The second level of data buffer is provided for intermediate-term storage associated with production outlets for rapid review and other QC purposes. The distinction in terms of the timeliness of data access is important, depending on the type of request. 2.3.1 System Attributes and Issues 2.3.1.1 Evolution From telecommunications to computational capabilities to networking to storage capacity, the technological underpinnings of the ANSS will change dramatically over its life span. It is essential that the ANSS be developed so that it can grow and evolve over time, both to take advantage of these changes as well as to respond to changes in the needs of the user community. In order to evolve, it is critical that the ANSS system be based on an open and extensible architecture, widely adopted standards, modern software concepts, and platform independence. 2.3.1.2 Standard Networking Tools The ANSS should use standard networking techniques including TCP/IP, domain name servers, and route determination using commercial standard routing protocols. The ANSS development should NOT take on the design of alternate networking techniques. 2.3.1.3 Standardized Interfaces, Protocols, and Formats All data flow, whether within or between elements of the ANSS, should use the same interfaces, protocols, and formats. All data access functionality must be provided to data client processes via a standard, well documented Application Programming Interface (API). This approach will reduce costs, and increase flexibility, scalability, and maintainability. For the purpose of system architecture, ANSS data falls into several distinct classes:  waveforms (with triggered waveforms as a special case)  parameters (such as picks, hypocenters, moment tensors, station metadata)  binary, large objects (a.k.a. BLOBs, such as ShakeMaps). The ANSS must be able to handle these three fundamental classes through the establishment of standardized interfaces for data exchange. In addition to supporting these three data classes, the ANSS will support the two following types of requests:  16   ANSS TG v 1.0  . An example of the standing order request might be the exchange of continuous waveform data between processing centers. The exchange of associated station metadata could also be considered a standing order, but of the parametric class. In contrast, a request for a particular waveform time segment, say, to fill in a data gap, would be an example of a discrete request of the waveform class. In designing the APIs, the ANSS must bear in mind the following four different classes of clients:  Elements within the routine operation of ANSS  ANSS interpretation and development outlets  Non-ANSS networks  Users of ANSS products 2.3.1.4 Modularity The ANSS software and hardware components should be highly modular. That is, each function in a system should be encapsulated in a separate module and each module should operate independently. While this design principle may not be possible to adhere to in all cases, it has a number of advantages. In particular, it allows new functionality to be added without compromising existing capabilities. 2.3.1.5 Scalability The ANSS must be scalable. The current proposals for the ANSS call for approximately ten thousand monitoring sites. However, given recent advances in microelectronics, this number could increase by more than an order of magnitude if inexpensive, small sensors are distributed widely and used to monitor buildings, bridges, and lifeline networks. Such a capacity may be achieved by dividing processing tasks among many instances of the same processing module, each running on a different processor and each handling a subset of the total data set. This modular ""divide and conquer"" approach, if correctly designed, can provide relatively open-ended scalability. Note that in order to achieve scalability by adding hardware, the software architecture must be designed for distributed processing from the ground up. The ANSS must leverage modern approaches to software design and development to insure scalability. 2.3.1.6 Complexity It is important to recognize that functionality (number of fancy features in the system) and performance tend to be inversely related. Therefore, critical subsystems (e.g., communication substrate and buffers) should avoid extra complications or processing ""features"". Wherever possible, the capabilities of existing communications protocols and widely available operating systems features should be used. For example, this could mean relying on the checksums and packet-dropout detection of TCP/IP or on operating system features such as threading for multitasking or by leveraging multicast technology if appropriate.   Standing order (continuous and on-going feed)  Discrete request (one-time request for a specific set of data)  17   ANSS TG v 1.0 2.3.1.7 Data volume An important issue for the design of the ANSS is sizing of communications links and processing systems. While adjoining regional processing centers may implement partial waveform exchange, the national processing center and the archiving facilities will see the full data flow in real time. At a minimum, each element of the system should be sized to allow for complete data recovery and processing for the largest earthquakes in normal operation and to quickly recover from partial telemetry outages. This will require telemetry and processing capacity to exceed the nominal data throughput. Note that a single M = 8 earthquake in Central California will involve collecting and processing a significant fraction of available ANSS waveform channels. Appendix B provides estimates of the data volume that the TIC believes to be relevant for system design. In general, continuous streams of data from all instruments must flow from stations to processing centers. Network triggering will significantly reduce the data volume from the strong motion instrumentation, but data from broadband seismometer channels will be continuous all the way to the permanent archive. 2.3.1.8 Buffering The system must be capable of buffering all available ANSS waveform and parametric data to ensure both complete processing when capacity is degraded and complete and error free transmission throughout the system (from field stations to end users) when communications links fail. While it is not practical to plan for all contingencies, at least one week of data should be buffered at all data concentrators, processing centers, and production data outlets. Buffering recommendations for field stations are discussed in chapter 3. 2.3.1.9 Speed The requirements of early warning, calculation of real-time location and magnitude, and real-time data distribution dictate that data delivery and processing delay (latency) are minimized. The system should add no systematic delays to the latency inherent in delivery from the data source. Since a data packet cannot be resent until it is fully received, store-and-forward type of data delivery relays should be minimized and data packet lengths for high digitization rates should be no more than a few seconds of data. Additionally, the latency associated with data buffers, the number of ""hops"" in the data paths, and steps in data processing must be reduced as much as possible. Late data - whether from triggered data streams or from communication outages - will be a fact of life. The ANSS must be designed to process late data. Late data should be organized seamlessly with data already received and late data should be incorporated in ANSS data products to the greatest extent possible as they become available. Also note that some products of the ANSS (e.g., waveform data for seismological research) require high levels of data completeness. At a minimum, the tradeoff between latency and completeness will require that older data must be transmitted out of order after a communications outage to minimize the latency of current data.  18   ANSS TG v 1.0 2.3.1.10 Security The ANSS must be a secure system. The design must ensure that critical computers are secure against intrusion, denial of service attack, and ""hacking"". Authentication should be used to allow data service only to authorized clients. Rapid notifications should also be protected against ""spoofing"". The TIC does not feel that data authentication, as used by the CTBTO, is necessary. 2.3.1.11 Reliability  The simplest statement of the ultimate reliability specification of the ANSS is that a total system failure during any significant event is unacceptable. In practical terms this means that enough of the ANSS must be operational at all times to provide reasonably high quality information about any potentially damaging event in the U.S. throughout the life of the system. On the other hand, it is expected that the full performance of the system in terms of response time and accuracy should be available a very high percentage of the time. This is inevitably a cost-performance issue. 100% availability is, in practice, impossible to guarantee and the cost of closely approaching this ideal grows exponentially. This is the best single argument for multiple, geographically isolated, data processing centers with national backup. 2.3.1.12 Robustness While multiple data processing centers, data outlets, and archive facilities greatly enhance system reliability, they also significantly increase the probability that parts of the system will be unavailable at any particular moment. Therefore, the ANSS must perform as well as possible under all likely partial failure scenarios. For example, it would be unacceptable to delay notification because all data were processed with inadequate capacity. Similarly, dropping 1 second of data every 20 seconds because of inadequate communications bandwidth would make all the data useless. One mechanism that has been found to enhance the performance of systems under stress is to prioritize the data so that all data delivered are usable and processing is still effective and timely, even though the data set processed in real-time may be incomplete. 2.3.1.13 Communication Links Mission-critical communications, at all levels, should be over a variety of independent physical paths to increase reliability. Path diversity is already built into some telemetry systems, especially commercially supported ones. For example, Internet routing is dynamic and ""self healing"". However, no single medium is 100% reliable and the ANSS should not have ""all of its eggs in a single communications basket,"" be it a physical link or technology type. Multiple links must be considered for major paths such as between processing centers and to the archive facilities. Designs for using multiple paths include switching from one route to another quickly and automatically if a fault is detected, splitting communications among different paths so that a failure only affects part of the data flow, and dynamic shifting of the load when links degrade. Necessary attributes of the data exchange protocols are that they be robust and reliable. Possible implementation considerations are the ability to prioritize data to allow for graceful degradation, using heartbeats and handshaking to insure completeness, error 19   ANSS TG v 1.0 detection to avoid corrupted packets, and filtering to allow selection of particular data products. 2.3.1.14 Health and Status Monitoring The ability to measure the health and status of the ANSS will be a critical aspect of the design. The operators of the ANSS need the ability to easily identify problems or failures in the system, ranging from loss of data due to communication problems, to the failure of processing computers or equipment. The implementation of system monitoring components will include elements such as the assessment of sensor health, connectivity to sensors, communication between and among centers, data latencies, status of processing elements, status of computers, routers, and other hardware, and ability to perform data distribution. 2.3.1.15 System Testing In addition to monitoring individual elements, it is necessary to provide ""total"" assessments of ANSS functionality. This should include both off-line simulations of typical and worse case conditions (for example a large earthquake during a partial telemetry loss) and on-line injection of test events/signals (without loss of real data) for testing the system as a whole. Similarly, new algorithms and configurations should be well tested before they provide information to ANSS users. 2.3.1.16 Ease of Operation Experience operating large seismic networks shows that substantial time and effort are required for reliable operation. The ANSS development should have significant effort devoted to making the system easy to operate. Issues that should be addressed include configuration, initialization, upgrading software, and reconfiguration of the system. Alternate systems for operational procedure training should be provided. Complete and well-organized documentation must be kept accurate and current. Configuration - Network and monitoring configurations must be easy to establish and check. Configuration information includes things such as station metadata, telemetry connections, hostnames, and other information. Configuration information must be part of the basic ANSS database system (i.e., configuration parameters must be available through the same mechanisms as other parameters). Configuration information entered into the system must be propagated automatically to all modules needing it. It would be desirable for ""smart"" field instrumentation to propagate information about changes in the field as they occur. Initialization of System - The system, or any part of it, must self-initialize when started and provide positive information that it restarted properly and is operational. The injection of test data, possibly waveforms, into the system on initialization might be used for system verification. Reconfiguration of System. - The ANSS system must be reconfigurable while it operates. It should not normally need to be restarted to re-read configuration information but rather reconfigure dynamically without exiting or loss of data. Reconfiguration must support versioning or journaling such that if a new  20   ANSS TG v 1.0 configuration is discovered to have problems it should be easy to revert to an earlier configuration. Alternate computers for maintenance and development.  Backup hardware for critical parts of the system must be available for redundancy and would be used for both emergency backup and routine maintenance of primary systems. Diagnostic Tools. - The ANSS should provide the ability to monitor system load and diagnose software and hardware problems while the system is in operation. Tools for both hardware health and software conditions should be routinely available and used by system operators. Commercial monitoring techniques and protocols such as SNMP should be used where appropriate. Software tools should allow operators to view results anywhere in the processing. Operational Procedures. - The ANSS should establish systematic operational procedures to insure the health and maintenance of the system. Operators should make routine checks of various aspects of system operation but also be well enough trained to recognize problems or conditions which fall outside those detected by the routine checks. Documentation. - The ANSS must provide simple, straightforward operational procedures documents as well as more detailed technical documents for both problem solving and development purposes. Documents must be completed and reviewed before any referenced process or procedure becomes operational. Patches or changes to software or procedures must be fully documented as they are made. Significant clerical effort should be part of the development and operational process to insure that both relatively static and dynamic documentation is well maintained. Knowledge Base and Discussion Forum. - To assist with operation and development the ANSS should provide three things: (1) a knowledge base so that users can find information about the system on their own, (2) training classes so that operators and users of the system can be educated in the system, and (3) a discussion and problem-solving forum for the dynamic solution to problems and development of new techniques. Suitable forums include face-to-face meetings, telephone conferencing, e-mail distribution lists and WEB based notes of the discussions. 2.3.2 Data Flow among Elements of the ANSS 2.3.2.1 Data Concentrator The data concentrator is the heart of the telemetry system. The concentrator will receive waveforms from stations, check for validity, and pass them on to one or more processing or archiving centers. The data concentrator may convert waveform packets into a standard format. This node could be a small, remote facility where multiple field stations are consolidated onto high bandwidth telemetry links or it could acquire data for a  21   ANSS TG v 1.0 collocated processing or archiving system. Concentration nodes will require significant data buffering to ensure complete data across communications outages. 2.3.2.2 Data Tracking The ANSS must be able to track the lineage or provenance of its data. Given the potential for distributed data acquisition and exchange among multiple components, tracking data as it flows through the system is a requirement. In addition to documenting the path, the tracking tag also assures the non-ANSS data provider of appropriate attribution. Although the complete solution is beyond the scope of this document, data tracking should at least include identification of the initial source of the data as well as the ability to indicate any processing or modification of the data and the agency that performed those operations. 2.3.2.3 Distributed databases It will be necessary to synchronize the data holdings of processing centers and production outlets with archiving facilities. This concept is discussed in Chapter 5. 2.3.3 Data Distribution within Processing Centers The requirements for data flow within an ANSS processing center are very similar to those for communication among centers and from centers to outlets. However, there are some special considerations to be addressed for data delivery within a center. These requirements are controlled by the processing function or functions with the most extreme demands for data volume, data delivery speed, and buffering (data persistence). 2.3.3.1 Buffering The heart of the processing center will be the mechanism to buffer data received from the concentrators for use by all interested clients. The system must buffer the data long enough for client applications to have a reasonable chance of successfully getting all the data they need to do their work. This data buffering may be shared with a collocated concentrator. Data buffering also allows out-of-order data to be sorted before use. A common buffer within the data transport system avoids duplication of the data into many application-specific buffers. 2.3.3.2 Other requirements Security and client management - The processing system as a whole must manage clients   to assure predictable behavior and guarantee service to mission critical clients.   Authentication will be used to allow data service only to authorized clients.   System management - Tools will be provided to report and monitor the performance and   load of the system.   System topology - The system topology must be flexible. It must be able to distribute   modular functions over multiple hosts and they should be free to move from host to host.   Single-points-of-failure will be reduced to an absolute minimum within any one center.   All critical functions will be offered by redundant servers. Switching from one server to   an alternate will be simple, fast and, where possible, automatic. The system will be able    22   ANSS TG v 1.0 to handle additional data volume by adding modules or hosts. Dynamic load balancing   would enhance the reliability of the system.   Stable load - Where possible, the behavior and resource consumption of the system will   be steady and predictable.   Exception handling - Exception handling must be part of the ANSS software. The   software must fix or report corrupted, out-of-order, or incomplete data. It must allow   clients to specify and handle time-outs for data requests.   2.3.3.3 Data Clients Data clients include components of the data distribution system, real-time processing modules, post-processing modules, quality control modules, and updates and information transfer to the archive. Data clients have a need to make standing orders or discrete requests (from either the fast or slow buffer). However, client connections must be stateless (each new connection must negotiate the data stream). The number of client modules in an operating center may be large. Data transport architecture between the common buffer and client processes must provide adequate throughput, low latency, and reliable delivery. 2.3.4 Rapid Data Delivery Rapid earthquake notifications will be one of the most important responsibilities of the ANSS and a key to the usefulness of many products. Rapid data and product distribution is distinguished from distribution from the archiving system primarily because of the time-critical need for the data. The system should be capable of rapidly generating many types of earthquake products, and each type must be automatically delivered in standard formats via multiple mechanisms. 2.3.4.1 Early Warning The ANSS earthquake processing system must provide information on a number of time scales but the fastest is essentially in real-time: information must go out to end users before the shaking from a large earthquake is over (possibly before shaking starts at some places (early warning)). While such speeds may not be attainable early in the system development, the goal for the ANSS must be to support continuous improvements in speed of production over the life of the system. The ANSS will be designed so that the system distributes earthquake information as quickly as it is determined. The system must allow for improvements in processing capability that accelerate rapid notifications. When the notifications are fast enough, early warning will be available. 2.3.4.2 Improvement with Time A fundamental principle of earthquake data processing is that information about an earthquake improves with time. As time passes, the acquisition system acquires more data and the processing system has more time to process the data. Given more time, more sophisticated algorithms can be used and with enough time, human interaction with the data is possible, allowing greater improvements in accuracy and completeness.  23   ANSS TG v 1.0 All data and products must be uniquely labeled and versioned to distinguish between new items and updates. A time-stamp and the identity of human reviewers should be included as well. When products are updated the latest update should take precedence over any earlier products of the same type for the same event. However the system must retain access to previous published versions of the products. 2.3.4.3 Precision and Accuracy Data and products distributed by the ANSS must include an associated assessment of their accuracy and the precision with which they are produced. Methods for determining the accuracy of the data and products must be agreed upon and used nationally. The assessment of quality will naturally vary by data type. Quality tags are needed to provide product recipients with a measure of how the information should or should not be used. When products improve with time, quality measures become particularly important. These measures may also be used as flags for some users who are interested in only the highest quality information. 2.3.4.4 Best Answer The ANSS will provide a single published description for any earthquake in the U.S. With multiple processing centers producing earthquake information, implementing the ""one authoritative answer"" approach will be challenging (particularly since some region boundaries cross seismic zones). The technique of providing the one and best solution for public use must be based on clear and programmable `business rules'. Such rules will be based primarily on speed and quality (i.e. the fastest best result becomes the public one). As new or different solutions for a particular event become available within the system there must be a clear way to rapidly determine if they should supercede the current public version or not. Manual over-ride of the automatic system must be available, including the ability to cancel a spurious event out right. 2.3.4.5 User Formats Some end users will require messages in specific formats or delivered by special channels or protocols. While the details of these are best left up to the specific implementation, the ANSS policy should be to attempt to provide as much information in as standard a format as possible. 2.3.5 Offline or Manual Review The ANSS must support multiple levels of product review and analysis. Although ""review"" is probably a continuous process, it is possible to distinguish two types. The first is the rapid review of alarm events, while the second is the typical ""post-earthquake"" analysis. Rapid review is performed immediately following an alarm and must be completed within a few tens of minutes after the origin time of the earthquake, with the goal of insuring the completeness and correctness of the rapid notifications. Corrections and updates to the automatic notification messages will be made through routine rapid review, typically performed at production data outlets.  24   ANSS TG v 1.0  Post-earthquake analysis is typically completed between tens of minutes to days to weeks (in some exceptional cases), with the goal of improving the automatic solution, using all possible data, and producing the most comprehensive and uniform data summary for an event. The continuum between rapid review and post-earthquake response is the periodic update of products as additional information becomes available. Post-earthquake analysis will be performed at production or other information outlets.  2.4 References Report of the Network Architecture and Interconnection Subcommittee, http://quake.geo.berkeley.edu/anss-nai/, 55pp.  25   ANSS TG v 1.0  26   ANSS TG v 1.0  3 Instrumentation 3.1 Introduction USGS Circular 1188 recommends that the ANSS include permanent and portable instrumentation. However, the portable instrumentation recommended represents less than 1% of the ANSS network. Herein, the TIC recommends standards to be used in procuring the basic instrumentation that will sense ground motion and store the resulting signals in a local data acquisition system (DAS) for the permanent broadband (national and regional) and urban monitoring (structures, reference and free field) deployments. Methods for handling the data flow upstream from the DAS are defined and described in Chapter 2. Those recommendations will influence some aspects of the communication and networking protocols in the DAS. Siting and installation procedures for the sensors and acquisition hardware are described in Chapter 4. There may well be constraints on size, packaging, power, and other factors, imposed by those standards or recommendations.  3.2 Approaching the Problem A basic assumption underlying ANSS instrumentation recommendations is that issues are addressed from the framework of existing technology. Some ANSS-specific requirements may encourage new developments, and they will be incorporated insofar as they are feasible and cost-effective. In addition, an attempt was made to specify as few different types of instruments as possible. This approach may over-specify instruments in some settings increasing capital costs, but reduces maintenance costs in the long run by decreasing the size of the spares pool and the number of different types of instruments that must be maintained. It may be possible to achieve significant capital cost savings with little or no loss of capability by relaxing specifications for certain environments (e.g., reference stations in noisy urban areas). Early consideration must acknowledge the different instrumentation systems that will make up ANSS, as summarized in the following. 3.2.1 National stations    Meet the needs of national and global monitoring.   High resolution in the band 0.01 to 15 Hz, on-scale recording, and latencies less than about 30 s. Meet the needs of national and global earthquake research.   Resolution below ambient noise in the band 0.04 Hz to 10 Hz, on-scale recording, high fidelity, and complete continuous data. Capture strong ground motion where generated by large nearby events.  27   ANSS TG v 1.0   Sensitivity in the band 0.02 to 50 Hz, a clip level of 4 g, constant absolute sensitivity, and low hysteresis. 3.2.2 Regional stations    Meet the needs of local and regional monitoring.   High resolution in the band 0.02 to 35 Hz, on-scale recording, and latencies less than about 10 s. Meet the needs of regional scale seismological research.   Resolutions below ambient noise in the band 0.04 to 10 Hz, on-scale recording, high fidelity, and complete continuous data. Capture strong ground motion where generated by large nearby events.   Sensitivity in the band 0.02 to 50 Hz, a clip level of 4 g, constant absolute sensitivity, and low hysteresis.  3.2.3 Free field and reference stations (non-structural installations)   Provide information about the strong motion wave field and local site effects with little (reference) or no (free field) contamination from major structures.   Sensitivity in the band 0.02 to 50 Hz, a clip level of 4 g, constant absolute sensitivity, low hysteresis, and latencies less than about 10 s. 3.2.4 Structural arrays  Provide information about the response of a structure to strong ground shaking.   Requires sensitivity in the band 0.02 to 50 Hz, a clip level of 8 g, constant absolute sensitivity, low hysteresis, and latencies of approximately 10 s.   Consider the use of emerging technology to measure the response of structures (i.e. Electronic Distance Measuring (EDM) or Global Positioning System (GPS) devices to measure structural displacements directly).  3.3 General Goals & Expectations Data delivery must be reliable and suitable for a variety of communications technologies. Equipment must operate reliably over long periods of time (at least 10 years) in hostile environments (extreme temperatures, moisture, ""dirty"" power, and pests). 3.3.1 Bandwidth Bandwidth goals for national stations are based on USNSN specifications. The low frequency specification is based on research needs while the high frequency specification is limited by attenuation over distances comparable with the inter-station spacing. Bandwidths for regional and strong motion stations are based on observed practice.  28   ANSS TG v 1.0 3.3.2 Sensitivity & dynamic range The clipping levels are true maximum ground motions that are to be recorded within specifications. 3.3.3 Data latency Short latencies for free field and reference stations are to support ""shake map"" generation. Latencies for structural arrays are based on the need for rapid assessment of structural damage (especially for critical structures).  3.4 General Design Concepts Some basic decisions about the behavior of ANSS stations either have or can be made a priori based on experience, technological trends, and the stated goals of the ANSS.   The need for wide bandwidths and linear high dynamic range probably dictate feedback sensor designs.  The need for high resolution dictates on-site digital recording and digital telemetry.   Seismological research and engineering practice and research require three component data.   Technological trends suggest standardizing on Internet protocols (IP). Strong motion data should have continuous access to telemetry when ever possible.    Sites with limited telemetry bandwidth will be accommodated by event segmented strong motion data, compressing all data, and adopting the lowest sample rates consistent with requirements.  The need for complete data suggests on-site storage for all types of stations.   Reliable communications requires error correction and packet retransmission, which requires bi-directional communications. Variable communications latencies require on-site timing.   Small data delivery latencies require short packets and reasonably fast communications speeds with minimal routing/buffering delays. The combination of on-site storage and short latencies requires that old data be caught up while current data flows uninterrupted. That is, after a communications outage, older data should be transmitted in time sequential order in parallel with the real-time data but at a lower priority.  29   ANSS TG v 1.0  3.5 Functional Specifications The specifications for national and regional seismometers are sufficiently similar that they could both be satisfied by the same sensor. This is reflected in the following specifications (e.g., the high and low frequency specifications have been extended for the national and regional seismometers respectively). If different national and regional seismometers are chosen (e.g., for cost reasons), these specifications should be modified by making the national seismometer bandwidth 0.01 to 15 Hz and the regional seismometer bandwidth 0.02 to 35 Hz. Free field, reference, and structural instruments are judged to have similar enough requirements that they are considered together. The primary difference seems to be that free field and reference stations will require three components while structural arrays require elements that may be from one to three components and multi-channel recording systems. The specifications call for the sensors and the information such as nominal transfer function serial number and sensitivity. Because this is equipment, the ANSS will need to work with acceptable form. 3.5.1 National station 3.5.1.1 Seismometer DAS to be able to report model specific and device specific information such as a feature that is not available in current vendors to see it implemented in an    Three orthogonal component differential outputs with a response nominally flat to velocity in the band 0.01 Hz to 35 Hz (amplitude response may be 3 dB below the peak response at 0.01 Hz and at 35 Hz).

SOH parameters shall be available in continuous telemetry packets for ease of monitoring SOH without special requests.   Capable of data compression at all sample rates. Packets will have a maximum length of 1000 samples to provide adequate latency.   Data telemetry must be error corrected, must support standard IP communications protocol(s), must support a variety of communications technologies, and must be capable of transmitting backlogged and triggered data without interrupting realtime data delivery.   Capable of buffering a minimum of 7 days of seismic data (in the event of a telemetry outage) in on-site storage media.   Instrument output shall be unaffected by reasonable changes in magnetic field and reasonable levels of radio frequency interference (see Appendix C).

Power consumption: Not greater than 1 watts average, 2 watts peak at 12 VDC.   Capable of acquiring sensor configuration parameters (i.e., manufacturer name, sensor type, sensor serial number, and factory calibration parameters) from both the seismometer and accelerometer and external power system (e.g., battery charger, UPS, or solar array) configuration and status as specified in Appendix C.   Configuration information stored in each DAS should allow reconstruction of the complete DAS transfer function for all active data streams. Configuration information should include:      Manufacturer name DAS type DAS serial number Board serial numbers and version numbers Factory calibration parameters including:  33   ANSS TG v 1.0    Nominal poles and zeros response if applicable Fir filter coefficients A/D conversion factors for each channel  3.5.1.4 Power System   Provide backup 12 VDC power to sensors, data acquisition system, and communications equipment for a minimum of 7 days in the event of main power source failure. For planning purposes, the power consumption of a national or regional station (six components) would average less than 3 W and a strong motion station (three components) less than 2 W exclusive of the communications system.   Provide surge suppression, filtering, and stable 12 VDC output from AC mains with an input range of 90-130 VAC.   Provide auto-cutoff of DC output voltage when it falls below 10.5 VDC to avoid damage to batteries or equipment.

Note that linear phase FIR filters are known to create acausal artifacts that can cause problems for automatic picks from stations very near to an event. Despite this drawback, the IS recommends that linear phase filters should be used for regional stations because of the enhanced value for later research. The IS suggests that acausal artifacts can be reduced to acceptable levels for real-time processing by attenuating high frequency energy using minimum phase filters.  3.5.2.2 Accelerometer  Same as for national station.  34   ANSS TG v 1.0 3.5.2.3 Data Acquisition System  Same as for national station, except:  Data buffering for 6 hours instead of 7 days.  3.5.2.4 Power System  Same as for national station.  3.5.3 Strong motion station (free field and reference) The accelerometer, the DAS, and the power system in this case shall be delivered as an integrated system, even though these three items may be physically separate modular units connected together with cables. The inter-module cables, with connectors, shall also be delivered as part of this integrated system. Cable lengths will be specified at the time the order is placed, and will be specific to each site. It is likely that a standard cable length will be appropriate in most cases.  3.5.3.1 Accelerometer  Same as for national station.  3.5.3.2 Data Acquisition System  Same as for national station, except:   Resolution of 21 bits in the band .02 to 50 Hz. Note that with 21-bits of resolution and a 4g sensor, theoretically a magnitude 2.5 event at 10 km should be well recorded and empirically a magnitude 1.8 event at more than 35 km can be recorded well enough to determine the peak acceleration. That is, ambient noise is likely to be the limiting factor in station performance, not the 21-bit resolution.   3 channels (minimum) instead of 6. A maximum sample rate of at least 200 samples/s.    Capable of on-site storage of a minimum of 2 hours of triggered data indefinitely in non-volatile memory (instead of 7 days continuous data).  3.5.3.3 Event detector  Shall be triggered by accelerations from 0.0008g up to 4g.  35   ANSS TG v 1.0 3.5.3.4 Power System  Same as for national station.  3.5.4 Strong motion station (structural) The accelerometer and its power system and the DAS and its power system shall be delivered as integrated subsystems, even though these items may be physically separate modular units connected together with cables. The inter-module cables, with connectors, shall also be delivered as part of this integrated system. Cable lengths will be specified at the time the order is placed, and will be specific to each site. It is likely that a standard cable length will be appropriate in most cases (between components at one location). Note that cables between the accelerometer and the DAS are not included. Wireless technology will be considered to allow easy distribution of sensors throughout an existing structure provided that it can be shown to be sufficiently reliable. 3.5.4.1 Accelerometer  Same as for reference station, except:  Must be available in 1, 2, and 3 component packages   Must have an option for a clip level of 6g instead of 4g with a gain stability of 3%.  3.5.4.2 Data Acquisition System  Same as for reference station, except:  Must be available in configurations including 3 to 24 channels.  3.5.4.3 Power System  Same as for reference, except:   Power must be available at each accelerometer and at the central multi-channel DAS.  3.6 System Packaging Vendors may address some of the specifications above including RFI, magnetic, and pressure shielding through equipment packaging. In addition, packaging will meet the following requirements:  All equipment: 36   ANSS TG v 1.0  Operate in 100% relative humidity.  Survive temporary shallow submersion in water (see Appendix C). All seismometers and accelerometers:  Provided with leveling legs. Structural strong motion station:  Accelerometer plus data power system shall not weigh more than 25 pounds.     3.7 Evaluation of Competing Systems  RFP must be written with testable specs (see Appendix C)   Sensor dynamic range shall be computed according to the recommendations of the Standards for Seismometer Testing Workshop, July 1989   Digitizer resolution computed according to the Modified Noise Power Ratio test.  Manufacturers shall provide their own test results   Pre-productions or prototype units provided during evaluation phase of contract will be fully tested   Production units must also comply with specs and will be spot checked at random to assure compliance (using a subset of acceptance tests)  3.8 Data Format At a minimum, data packets (both seismic and SOH) generated by the DAS shall include information that:  Uniquely identifies the station and channel  Provides information needed to decode and use the data including:  Data type and format  Packet length  Record number  Time correction In addition, the DAS shall be capable of formatting the manufacturer, equipment type, serial number, and metadata (e.g., response information) for the DAS and collocated sensors and power equipment for occasional transmission. The goal is to make field equipment as self documented as possible. Note, however, that it must be possible for the ANSS processing system to override erroneous metadata collected from the field if necessary.  3.9 Station Architecture The above specifications seek to make DAS and sensor equipment self identifying and capable of providing their own response metadata. It also seeks to provide SOH information from the DAS (e.g., location), sensors, and power system (e.g., power history). The model specified places the DAS in the central role of collecting the identification, metadata, and SOH information from all other subsystems and integrating 37   ANSS TG v 1.0 it in a single data stream to the outside world. In addition, the roles of metadata and SOH information have been specified in an arbitrary fashion (e.g., AC voltage has been specified as an SOH stream derived by the DAS, but it could also be metadata provided by an UPS). In fact, other models are possible and may be advantageous (e.g., DAS, sensors, and power system all reporting through a separate communications controller). In practice, any functionally equivalent station architecture will be considered.  38   ANSS TG v 1.0  4 Siting and Installation 4.1 Introduction Seismic instrumentation provides data that serve three primary purposes:    Rapid response to potentially damaging earthquakes, Seismic monitoring, and Seismological and engineering research.  Traditionally, siting and installation have been designed to provide good coverage of geological and manmade structures of interest and good recordings of events of interest. Coverage implies that events are recorded at a range of azimuths and distances adequate to derive required products and structures are instrumented adequately to understand their dynamic deformation. As a trivial example, accurate hypocentral determination requires good azimuthal coverage and ideally a range of distances including very close stations. Good recordings require seismically quiet sites, good coupling with the bedrock, and highly sensitive seismometers and recording equipment. Engineering studies require strong motion information around and throughout structures. The ANSS is focused on upgrading traditional seismic instrumentation with state-of-theart broadband seismometers and accelerometers and high resolution (e.g., 24-bit) digitizers. Through the use of negative feedback technology, broadband sensors are capable of recording earth noise at a quiet site as well as large amplitudes with a high degree of linearity over a broad frequency band. However, to take advantage of the sensitivity and bandwidth of broadband sensors, it is necessary to consider traditional siting and installation issues as well as new issues such as thermal stability and tilts due to atmospheric pressure.  4.2 Site Characterization Detailed understanding of the subsurface geology and soil/rock properties is important for understanding of the contribution of site response to measured ground motions and for the classification of measured ground motion parameters, particularly at strong motion reference stations. A good review of methods for site characterization is found in ASTM Standard D420-98 ""Guide to Site Characterization for Engineering, Design, and Construction Purposes."" For ANSS broadband and strong motion reference stations, some level of site characterization studies should be required for every station. At a minimum, the surface geology should be determined and available site information from previous local or regional studies should be obtained and added to the station's auxiliary information. Surface geology provides a primary description of the site and should be obtained from geology maps or observations by a knowledgeable person. Note that surface geology can  39   ANSS TG v 1.0 be a poor estimator of subsurface soil or rock properties, especially for sites geologically classified as rock. In addition to thorough geologic descriptions, site-specific characterization information should also be obtained at strong motion reference stations. At a minimum, the NEHRP/IBC site class should be determined. The NEHRP/IBC site class is important for comparison of measured ground motions with building code seismic design levels. These site classes, denoted A-F, are formally described in the 2000 International Building Code's seismic design provisions as follows: A. Hard rock with measured shear wave velocity V30>1500 m/s B. Rock with 760m/s 750m/s)  Lithology logging during drilling  Obtaining samples for laboratory testing  Seismic velocity logging  Laboratory testing of samples for index properties  Laboratory testing of samples for nonlinear properties  41   ANSS TG v 1.0 These investigations can be a major effort, requiring heavy equipment and expensive measurements and laboratory testing.  4.3 Station Documentation A new or existing ANSS station should be well documented. A user of the recorded waveform data or derived parameters should be able to obtain all of the metadata needed to identify the station, its instrumentation, its station configuration/construction, its site conditions, and any other information which might have an effect on the data. 4.3.1 Basic Station Data The basic documentation of a station should include the following, defined as the Basic Station Data:  Station identification (name, ID number, etc.)  Station location (coordinates, location description within site; detailed information may need to be protected in the property owner's interests)  Station access information (contacts, keys, etc.; may be protected information)  Station construction (type, description)  Site geology  NEHRP/IBC category/V30 value (strong motion reference only)  Station instrumentation details  Station calibration data  Station history (installation date, modification descriptions/dates, etc.) Ambient noise spectra (national and regional broadband sites only) These data must be available in two forms: an online database and an archival distribution media. 4.3.2 Auxiliary Station Information Other information about a station that should be documented includes:  Photographs of the station construction  Photographs of the station instrumentation installation  Photographs of the station vicinity (showing nearby buildings, topography, or other features)  Site map  Plots/numeric data for site characterization information  Other descriptive information about the site As for the Basic Station Data, the Auxiliary Station Information must be available in two forms: an online database and an archival distribution media.  42   ANSS TG v 1.0  4.4 National and Regional Stations USGS Circular 1188 specifies that the ANSS national stations are to be distributed as uniformly as possible across the US. The primary frequency band of interest is 0.01 to 15 Hz. Higher frequencies are not of interest because propagation distances are typically less than the mean inter-station spacing (~300 km). At the long period end, the national backbone can provide higher spatial sampling to complement the even longer period instrumentation of the Global Seismograph Network (GSN) for continental scale structural studies as well as improved coverage for long period source studies. Note that the ANSS plan calls for a backbone of 100 stations of which 80 would meet ANSS specifications and 20 would meet GSN specifications. GSN stations have similar requirements to the ANSS backbone stations except that there is interest in periods as long as 100,000 s. Locations of the regional broadband stations are the responsibility of the regional working groups and will not be discussed further here. The primary frequency band of interest is 0.05 to 35 HZ. At the high frequency end, small events very close to the station are of interest. At the long period end, fundamental and higher mode surface waves should be recorded. The siting and installation requirements for both national backbone and regional broadband stations will be considered in the following. Although the requirements for these elements of the ANSS are somewhat different, as discussed below, their siting and installation have much in common. The common elements and concerns are described in the following subsections. 4.4.1 Network Design Seismic network design is always a compromise between network goals and funding. The ANSS has chosen high resolution, broadband sensor technology that establishes the cost of each station. Funding then limits the number of stations available to meet program goals. This situation is further complicated by the multiple uses most networks serve. For example, rapid response requires sensors near urban areas while monitoring requires some coverage in areas of low to moderate seismicity. Similarly, sensors near seismic zones are needed for some research projects while other research requires more uniform regional coverage. Ultimately, the success of a network design depends on the ability of the network to produce the products required with the desired accuracy and timeliness. To some extent, this can be modeled theoretically. For example, the timeliness and accuracy of earthquakes in known locations can be tested. Of course, these results must be used with caution as station performance can be highly variable (short period noise can easily vary by 40 dB from site to site) and difficult to predict. Thought must also be given to the problem of network utility at various stages of completeness. Even with adequate funding, networks installation is typically performed over a number of years, and (broadband) network uptime rarely exceeds 90% in practice.  43   ANSS TG v 1.0 4.4.2 Seismic Noise Over the frequency band of interest to the ANSS (~0.01 to 35 Hz), seismic noise falls into three distinct regimes. At high frequencies (0.5 to 35 Hz), seismic noise is dominated by wind, running water, and cultural effects. Wind couples into the ground through trees, towers, antennas, structures, and even rough topography. Rapids and waterfalls couple into the ground directly, Cultural noise is generated by cars, trains, airplanes (on the ground), mining, manufacturing, and agriculture. In fact, almost anything people do in their daily lives contributes to cultural noise. At mid-frequencies (0.05 to 0.5 Hz), seismic noise is dominated by surface waves generated by ocean waves breaking on shorelines. This so-called 6-second microseism peak is huge (at least 20 dB above the high frequency noise and 40 dB above the long period noise). Although the microseisms are significantly larger near the ocean, they are a pervasive, worldwide phenomena. Long period noise (0.0001 to 0.05 Hz), is dominated by tilt noise due to thermal and atmospheric pressure effects. This counter intuitive result is due to the sensitivity of broadband sensors to nanoradian tilts. Thermal effects include the differential heating of structures or even rough topography inducing small deformations. Passing weather fronts differentially deforming the ground similarly induces pressure tilts. 4.4.3 Site Selection The best sites are located on (or even better, in) hard, uniform, competent bedrock; remote from populations centers, heavily traveled roads, train tracks, and heavy industry; and away from trees, antennas, buildings, rapids, and windy locations such as mountain peaks or saddles. Needless to say, these conditions are difficult to achieve and most seismic sites are a compromise between network design goals and site characteristics. This problem becomes even more difficult when power, communications, access, and security are considered. Seismic noise is heavily influenced by local geology. Installation on unweathered bedrock is best. Harder rock provides a higher signal to noise ratio and less complex geology provides less distortion in propagating waves, particularly at higher frequencies. However, weathered bedrock and well-consolidated sediments can also make useful seismic sites. Generally, softer, low impedance material amplifies both signal and noise, but results in a net loss in the signal to noise ratio. Softer materials are also much more prone to long period tilting, particularly due to thermal effects. Poorly consolidated material generally makes a poor seismic site and should be avoided if possible. Geologic, topographical, and political maps can be useful for preliminary siting work. Geologic maps help to determine if outcrops are available and what types of bedrock might be encountered. Topographical maps can provide a feeling for the roughness of the terrain, vegetative cover, and accessibility. Political maps can provide a guide to natural and cultural noise sources. Local seismic network experience can also be invaluable. Once preliminary sites are selected, they must be surveyed for suitability based on potential local noise sources, accessibility, availability of power, communications drops  44   ANSS TG v 1.0 or lines-of-site, security, and property ownership. Finally, it is important to operate broadband portable instruments with 24-bit recording at the most promising sites to determine the best ones empirically. It is necessary to use broadband instrumentation and to record for at least a day or two at each site to determine both the long and short period site noise characteristics because good short period sites are often poor long period sites and vise versa. Shallow seismic profiling can be useful in determining the complexity of the subsurface geology and the depth to competent bedrock. Although finding good seismic sites is never easy, there is hope because most noise sources are relatively high frequency and high frequency noise from surficial sources doesn't propagate very well. For instance, quite good performance is sometimes possible only a few kilometers from major highways and only 30 m from tall trees and antennas. For more information about siting see the New Manual of Seismological Observatory Practice (Bormann, 1999; http://www.seismo.com/ msop/nmsop/nmsop.html). For more information on the recommended distances from a variety of high frequency noise sources see the Manual of Seismological Practice (Wilmore, 1979; http://www.seismo.com/msop/msop79/msop.html). 4.4.4 Installation Types Various types of installation in mines or caves and at the surface in vaults or smaller structures will be discussed. Boreholes can be useful for emplacing sensors into bedrock when no outcrops are available and for reducing long period noise. However, because of the high cost and typically low cost-benefit ratio, boreholes are not recommended for use in the ANSS. Although the cost of drilling a shallow tunnel can be prohibitive, abandoned mines and to a lesser extent caves can provide outstanding seismic sites. This is because underground sites are often in hard rock, are thermally stable, and to some extent isolated from pressure effects. However, underground sites can also be difficult because of owner liability (e.g., due to the dangers of rock falls, radiation, and other hazardous materials) and environmental issues (e.g., cave decorations and endangered species). Underground locations also require special considerations for moisture and long cable runs (for power, communications, and GPS antennas). Partitions with tightly fitting doors are sometimes used to minimize air circulation, and moisture can be controlled through the use of gunnite. By far the most common type of seismic installation, however, is at or near the earth's surface. Installations in buildings have not proven effective because buildings significantly distort the wave field and are not recommended. Recent work has shown that the massive WWSSN style vaults are not necessary for good long period performance. Existing vaults are useful, but it is not recommended that the ANSS build more. Rather two types of surface installation are recommended: 1) small buried vaults and 2) barrels or pipes. The small vault is typically a concrete structure containing an isolated pier with a surface area of about 1 square meter, room for electronics, and a small maintenance working space. The floor of the vault would typically be buried at least 2.5 m below the surface of the ground. The top of the vault should be buried at least 30 cm. If possible, the DAS  45   ANSS TG v 1.0 should be collocated with the sensors and the communications and power equipment should be placed in a separate enclosure (in either a shelter above the vault or in a subsurface room near the vault; see Hanka, 2001; http://www.gfzpotsdam.de/geofon/agu_pub/) The barrel or pipe installation is typically constructed using large diameter, commercially available, concrete or galvanized pipe or heavy, plastic, toxic waste barrels. Typically, the pipe or barrel is set into concrete so that the top of the enclosure protrudes about 15 cm above the ground. The hole outside the enclosure is also filled with concrete. In this type of installation, the concrete at the bottom of the enclosure acts as the pier. The sensor must be placed deeply enough that the top of the insulating material above the sensor is still below the surface of the ground. If possible the DAS should also be placed in the seismic enclosure (see McMillan, 2001, USGS Open File Report, in preparation). Note that in this type of installation, the communications and power equipment are typically placed in a separate shed or enclosure away from the sensors. Note that barrel installations have also been used with some success in mines to provide thermal insulation and minimize convection. In all cases, the sensors are placed on a smooth concrete surface that is well coupled with the underlying rock. Bedrock is exposed by removing surficial soil and scraping off weathered material (preferably with a backhoe). The surface of the rock should be reasonably smooth and free of dirt before the concrete is poured. Chemicals that improve the adhesion of the concrete and resistance to moisture are often added. 4.4.5 Minimizing Environmental Effects Environmental factors act on seismic stations by either directly affecting the sensor(s) or indirectly affecting the sensor(s) through interactions with the seismic enclosure. Factors considered include electromagnetic interference (EMI), magnetic fields, wind, temperature variations, and pressure fluctuations. All of these factors can directly effect the sensor. Temperature and pressure also act indirectly through the enclosure. High performance seismic equipment generally employs differential circuitry to reject common mode signals such as EMI. EMI also can be minimize by keeping the analogue signal cables between the sensor and the DAS as short as possible. Most broadband sensors are well shielded against magnetic and pressure effects by heavy external steel cases. However, seismometers vary widely in their thermal sensitivity. Some sensors can be driven onto their stops by temperature changes as small as a few degrees C while others can withstand an order of magnitude greater variation. Broadband sensors typically accommodate thermal variations by mechanically re-centering their masses. In most cases, this process can be automated and remotely commanded. However, the data are useless during the re-centering process, which can last for minutes to hours. Therefore, thermal stability is essential to the effective operation of seismic sensors. Choosing sheltered sites, using subsurface installations, and separating any aboveground shelter and antenna from the sensors can minimize wind noise coupling directly into the enclosure. Choosing sites in hard rock, with only moderate topography and sealed subsurface installations helps minimize pressure effects. In a vault installation, isolating the pier (which is firmly coupled to the bedrock) minimizes the effect of the vault tilting.  46   ANSS TG v 1.0 In a barrel installation, the whole subsurface structure is coupled to the bedrock and no isolation is necessary. Warpless baseplates developed for several very long period sensors have been shown to be effective at controlling the effects of very long period tilts due to pressure (e.g., Holcomb and Hutt, 1992, Open File Report 92-302, USGS or Hanka, 2001; http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/geofon/agu_pub/). Choosing a site out of direct sunlight (or installing a cover or low lean to roof over the sensors), burying the sensors, using concrete without aggregate or reinforcing steel (to avoid differential expansion), and using adequate insulating material can minimize thermal effects. The concrete pier (or barrel floor) should also be vibrated to remove entrained air bubbles that can also result in differential expansion. Because long period seismic signals (and very long period seismometers themselves) are sensitive to very small thermal variations, the insulation of sensors is a highly developed art. The experts recommend at least 10 cm thick foam insulation sealed all around the sensors with an R value of at least 35 (e.g., Uhrhammer, Karavas, and Romanowicz, 1997; http://www.seismo.berkeley.edu/seismo/bdsn/instrumentation/guidelines.html). Note that in a vault installation the insulation and supporting structure around the sensor(s) amounts to a vault within a vault. Because broadband seismometers are active, they dissipate a small amount of heat. Therefore, if the insulation is too good, the sensors can overheat. Also, the heat dissipation can result in thermal convection around the sensors. This is combated by keeping the thermal enclosure around the sensors as small as possible and by filling the enclosure with foam beads or with fine playground sand. Either material kills convection and contributes to thermal stability. Sand has also been observed to improve seismic coupling between the sensor and the pier and helps to keep high aspect ratio sensors upright during strong shaking. Surprisingly, 24-bit digitizers are also sensitive to thermal variations and to air convection, which can increase electronic noise. Generally, they are housed in sealed environmental enclosures. However, because DASs draw more power than sensors (3 to 25 V), stabilizing their temperature is problematical. Low power DASs should be installed in the subsurface seismic enclosure if their size permits, but with less insulation than the sensors. Higher power DASs should be installed in a separate enclosure. Because of the environmental housing and their self heating, higher power DASs stabilize their own temperature to some extent, albeit at a rather high level (typically 35 to 40 C). 4.4.6 Installing the Equipment Installing the equipment requires consideration of:      seismic coupling sensor orientation electrical grounding cabling isolation of equipment that generates acoustic noise 47   ANSS TG v 1.0 Note that the location of the sensors must be determined to within 10 m referenced to the WGS84 datum. At low frequencies, the weight of the sensor is typically adequate to provide good coupling just by placing the sensor on the pier. However, coupling at frequencies above about 20 Hz is much more difficult as evidenced by spurious spectral bumps (probably due to the feet of the sensor chattering on the pier). Recommended coupling methods include surrounding the sensor with sand, potting the sensor(s) in plaster of Paris, or epoxying the feet of the sensor to the pier. Strong motion sensors should be attached to the pier with bolts or straps to avoid being overturned during very large accelerations. Seismometers should never be bolted or strapped to the pier because of the danger of contaminating small seismic signals. For near surface installations, experiments have shown that it is possible for a trained technician to orient sensors to about 1 degree from a compass heading (accounting for local magnetic declination and presuming no magnetic anomalies). To orient sensors in tunnels and deep vaults or to check the orientation of surface sensors a comparison of microseisms with a reference sensor at the surface has proven valuable (e.g., Holcomb, 2001, USGS Open File Report, in preparation). This method can be highly accurate even with sensor separations of several kilometers because of the strength and long wavelength of the microseisms. Adequate grounding is essential to get the best performance from sensitive electronics. For example, a lack of grounding has been observed to increase the electronic noise in high performance digitizers. For electronic purposes, the grounding wires do not have to be very heavy. However, more substantial grounding wiring may be required if the equipment is equipped with internal surge suppression. The electronics should not be grounded into the same point as the A/C power if at all possible. It is also important to eliminate ground loops, as they can add significant noise to the seismic signal. It is best to ground all equipment to a common point. Care must be taken because sensors can also be grounded through the pier. One possibility is to install the sensors on a heavy glass plate mortared to the pier. This has the added benefits of providing a smooth level surface and acting as a moisture barrier. Electronic equipment installed in racks or on shelves should be tied down to avoid damage during large accelerations. Excess cable should be kept to a minimum. Sensor cables, in particular should be laid in gentle arcs on the vault floor or suspended to avoid any strain on the sensor. Improperly laid cables can introduce noise into sensors as they expand and contract. Equipment that generates acoustic vibrations such as transformers (e.g., in battery chargers) and fans in electronic equipment must be located at least 10 m away from the sensor. Ideally, power and communications equipment should be located in a separate enclosure (a small shed or fiberglass enclosure mounted on a concrete pad is often used for this purpose). Installation of such equipment on soft foam rubber at least10 cm thick can greatly reduce the acoustic coupling into the ground.  48   ANSS TG v 1.0 4.4.7 Protecting the Station Delicate seismic equipment must be protected from:      lightning and other power surges flooding vandalism corrosion, dust, and mold rodents and other pests  It is possible, but generally expensive, to protect seismic equipment from direct lightning strikes (though the station will usually be taken down). Because direct lightning strikes are rare (at least through most of the US) and because the cost of seismic equipment is rapidly declining, heroic measures for lightning protection (e.g., massive grounding, Faraday cages, etc.) are probably not cost effective and are not recommended for the ANSS. It is worthwhile to avoid siting stations in high lightning risk locations (e.g., the tops of tall mountains). It is also worthwhile burying cable runs at least 20 cm below the ground to avoid attracting lightning. For stations operating from A/C power, surges due to nearby lightning strikes (or other sources) carried to the station through the power grid are a much more significant problem. Operating all seismic equipment from batteries and only using main power to charge the batteries has proven an effective solution to surges through the power grid. Surge protection built into most seismic equipment (given adequate grounding) is generally sufficient to protect the electronics from surges that make it through the batteries. Power in rural areas can have many problems other than surges including high or low voltages, phase discontinuities, and extended outages. A combination of batteries and DC-DC converters (built into most seismic field equipment) effectively deals with these problems. Because power is such a common source of station outages, it is worthwhile monitoring battery voltages as an aid to remote diagnosis. Monitoring A/C power is even more useful, but risky since it creates a direct path between the power grid and the DAS (bypassing the batteries). Also, field equipment should be equipped with low voltage cut-off circuitry to protect the batteries from complete discharge during extended power outages. Water in seismic vaults or electronics enclosures is also a significant problem, particularly if they are underground. Water typically gets into enclosures through the access cover, the floor, or the cable conduits. It is much less likely that water will penetrate the walls of the enclosure unless they are cracked. Any cracks or holes in the enclosure should be well sealed with concrete patch or silicon caulk. Dampness in vaults can be channeled away from equipment into a sump. In smaller enclosures the air can be dried using desiccant. Enclosure access doors, panels, or lids should fit tightly, be sealed with a gasket, and be designed to avoid water. Double doors or a low lean to roof over the vault (also useful as a sunscreen) can also be effective. The concrete used in the floor and pier of a vault or  49   ANSS TG v 1.0 floor of a barrel installation should be treated with chemicals that improve water resistance. If an isolated pier is used, the isolation gap should be filled with asphalt or a similar material to seal out water. Finally, cable conduits need to be tightly fitted through the enclosure wall and carefully sealed using gaskets or silicon caulk. The conduits themselves should be run downhill going away from the sensor enclosure and should be plugged with expanding (aerosol) foam insulation. Equipment other than the sensor should be installed above the floor (e.g., above the sensor insulation, on pallets or shelves, or onto walls) to avoid water damage. Note that sensors are usually hermetically sealed, but that their associated control electronics aren't always watertight. Sadly, vandalism can also be a significant problem at seismic sites. The best way to avoid vandalism is to make the station as unobtrusive as possible (e.g., by installing the equipment underground). Above ground enclosures should be out of sight from nearby roads and trails if possible. If above ground equipment (e.g., satellite or radio antennas) are likely to attract attention, other security measures should be taken. Camouflage, fencing, locks, and installation on public land or near rural dwellings can all be effective security measures. Note that the requirements for good security are diametrically opposed to the requirements for quiet sites. Steps taken to control flooding are also usually effective against dust, rodents, and other pests. Paradoxically, environments where flooding is not a problem (e.g., above ground electronics enclosures or tunnels) are often poorly sealed and are more prone to problems with dust and pests. Sealing enclosures and drying the air inside using desiccant can also combat corrosion and mold. Tunnels and large vaults usually offer a protected, thermally stable environment. However, it is still worth using enclosures (e.g., barrels, etc.) to protect the equipment from dust, mold, and pests. This is particularly true for any equipment that is not housed in its own environmental enclosure and to protect cable contacts from corrosion. 4.4.8 Recommended Installation  National Stations Tunnel and small vault installations are recommended for the GSN specification national backbone stations because thermal stability is so critical to long period performance. Vaults should be buried at least 2.5 m and thick insulation should be installed. Warpless baseplates should be used if possible to minimize the effects of pressure fluctuations. DASs should be installed in the seismic vaults for thermal stability. Power and communications equipment should be installed in a separate enclosure at or near the surface. Note that the depth to unweathered bedrock dictates the depth of burial of seismic vaults. The maximum vault depth that may be used is determined by the strength of the vault and cost. Installations as deep as 5 m should be considered. Tunnel and barrel installations are recommended for the remainder of the ANSS national backbone stations. In most parts of the US, burial of 0.5 to 1 m is adequate and easily achieved using barrels or pipes. If possible, DASs should also be installed in a subsurface enclosure for thermal stability. Power and communications equipment should be installed in a separate enclosure. If barrels must be installed at the surface, they should be buried with soil or loose rock leaving about 15 cm exposed. For additional  50   ANSS TG v 1.0 protection from direct sunlight and thermal isolation, it is recommended that the barrels be covered with sloping door set into a wooden frame and filled with foam peanuts. 4.4.9 Recommended Installation  Regional Stations Tunnel and barrel installations are recommended for regional broadband stations. In most parts of the US, burial of 0.5 to 1 m is adequate and easily achieved using barrels or pipes. If possible, DASs should also be installed in subsurface enclosures for thermal stability. Power and communications equipment should be installed in a separate enclosure. If barrels must be installed at the surface, they should be buried with soil or loose rock leaving about 15 cm exposed.  4.5 Urban Stations The siting and installation requirements for free field, reference, and structural recording are described in the following. 4.5.1 Important Issues in Station Siting and Design (Non-Structural) Perhaps the three most important technical issues related to the topic of non-structural strong motion station siting and design are: 1) minimization of effects of structures on recorded motions; 2) design of the instrument foundation to minimize its effect on recorded motions; and 3) the need for characterization of the station site. Background for these three issues is briefly summarized below. 4.5.1.1 Building Foundation Motions A goal of strong ground motion measurements is to accurately record the combined effects of earthquake source, propagation path, and geological/geotechnical site effects at a particular location within the range of amplitudes (<0.001 to 2g) and frequencies (0  50 Hz) needed for the various alerting, assessment, and research applications. Localized effects on the measurements of man-made features of the particular location, including the station itself, should be minimized. Earthquake ground motions near a building may be affected by the interaction between the structure and the soil. Therefore, in an urban area it may not be possible to find a completely uncontaminated site for a strong motion station. The concept of an Urban Reference Station, as opposed to a Free-Field station, accepts this characteristic. 4.5.1.2 Instrument Foundation Motions When a strong motion station is located away from buildings on soil, it will have its own small foundation for supporting the recorder and/or sensor. The instrument foundation can affect the recorded motions at high frequencies, and if the soil is soft, at frequencies as low as 10 Hz. ANSS and other strong motion station designs, especially those on open ground, should consider this issue of instrument foundation response and strive to create 51   ANSS TG v 1.0 a station that has horizontal and vertical transmissibilities of 1.0 over the 0  50 Hz frequency range. 4.5.1.3 The Need for Site Characterization The engineering properties of the soil or rock under a strong motion station can have a large effect upon the recorded motions. Most strong motion network operators do not routinely perform extensive site characterization studies for their new stations; the main reason is the cost of such studies. Strong motion station sites are often characterized by the surface geology. The recent ROSRINE project (http://geoinfo.usc.edu/rosrine) has shown that surface geology alone can be a poor predictor of subsurface engineering properties. A detailed understanding of the subsurface geology and soil/rock properties at a strong motion station is important for understanding of the contribution of site response to the measured ground motions. Site characterization studies are needed at every ANSS strong motion reference station. 4.5.2 General Siting Criteria Locations of ANSS free-field, reference and structural response stations shall be prioritized within a system of global priorities considering the following issues:  Desired density of coverage   Locations of existing stations  consider regions with inadequate coverage based on the desired density of coverage   Probability of shaking  consider the highest likelihood of shaking, both short period and long period   Probability of property damage  consider areas with elevated risk due to the type or number of structures or facilities   Probability of loss of life and indirect losses  consider areas with elevated probability of loss because of increased likelihood of casualties, death or human suffering due to the fragility of the infrastructure   Probability of learning  consider areas of major uncertainty in knowledge about earthquake generation, seismic wave propagation, ground motion attenuation, or site response in order to improve the understanding of the hazard in those areas   Value for emergency response  consider locations of strategic value for providing effective ground shaking information for emergency response 4.5.3 Reference Stations on Open Ground (Free Field Stations) Ideally, an urban strong motion reference station (either the entire station or just the sensor) will be installed on open ground in an attempt to minimize contamination of the recorded motions by structural response. This section contains siting criteria, a discussion of siting issues, and recommended station designs for strong motion reference stations on open ground.  52   ANSS TG v 1.0 4.5.3.1 Siting Criteria A strong motion station located on open ground will be considered a ""Strong-Motion Reference Station: Open Ground"" (SMRS-OG) if it meets the following criteria:   It is not sited on locally anomalous soft or hard soils that might create ground motions not expected to be experienced by nearby sites of interest;   It is not sited in or on a localized topographic feature such as a hill, ridge, or valley that might create ground motions not expected to be experienced by nearby sites of interest;   It is located a distance of at least one major structural dimension (height or length, whichever is greater) from any large building (>4000ft sq. ft in plan or >2 stories in height) or any building with a significant basement or foundation;   It is located a distance of at least one major structural dimension (height or length, whichever is greater) from any non-building structure likely to cause significant soilstructure interaction effects that will contaminate the data; and   Station construction is designed to minimize soil-structure interaction in the frequency range 0.02  50 Hz. 4.5.3.2 Siting Issues There are many issues to be considered in the location of a strong motion station. Perhaps the most important issues are those of site availability, permission, and permitting. A discussion of these issues and many other siting issues is beyond the scope of these guidelines. Four other important siting issues for SMRS-OG stations are briefly discussed below. These topics and discussions are not comprehensive, but are intended to raise main issues for further consideration. 4.5.3.2.1 Background Vibration  Although not as serious a problem as with high-gain broadband stations, SMRS-OG stations should be kept away from potential sources of vibration. These can include:  Large motors, pumps, or generators;  Large pipelines with active flow;  Large masts, poles, or trees;  Heavy vehicle traffic; and  Industrial activities When in doubt, it is suggested that the background vibrations at a potential site be monitored. Peak ground vibrations should be less than 0.001g. Even if the steady-state background vibrations are small, care must be taken to avoid locations where large vibrations could be induced during a strong earthquake. Large valves, pumps, or other mechanical or electrical devices that could activate or fail during earthquake shaking and transmit abnormal energy pulses also should be avoided. 4.5.3.2.2 Security  In both urban and remote areas, vandalism can be a problem for SMRS-OG stations. One must make provisions for security in the station design. This can be accomplished using 53   ANSS TG v 1.0 stout enclosures, locks, tamper-proof external hardware, and fenced enclosures. If fencing is used, care must be taken to minimize contamination of ground motions by the vibration of the fence; lightweight is best. The best security measure is providing a low profile for the station. 4.5.3.2.3 Power  Modern strong motion instrumentation, especially with real-time digital communications, will require a reliable power source of as much as a few tens of watts. For an SMRS-OG station, this power issue can provide a significant challenge. Solar power options are available, but several large solar panels will be required for most strong motion reference stations. This power issue should be carefully considered during planning and design for strong motion reference stations on open ground. One must also take care to minimize contamination of ground motions with vibrations from large solar panels and their supports. In any case, a battery system with enough capacity for 4 to 7 days of operation without power is needed. 4.5.3.2.4 Communications  The ANSS strong motion reference stations will be connected to some form of digital communications for data transfer and maintenance purposes. During the planning phase of a new station, one must consider the availability of appropriate communications. It may be difficult to connect wire- or fiber-based communications to a self-contained open ground station; one can consider wireless options in this case. One must also take care to minimize contamination of ground motions with vibrations from large antennae masts near the strong motion sensor. 4.5.3.3 Recommended Station Design There are many different strong motion station designs that have been used in both past and present. However, note that some of these designs use large foundation blocks or piers, which may not be appropriate for the definition of a strong motion reference station contained in these guidelines. Installation at an open ground location requires constructing a reinforced concrete mounting pad with a lightweight enclosure. A small concrete slab/pad and a lightweight enclosure will help meet the goal that the transmissibility of the installed strong motion station be 1.0 over the frequency range 0.02  50 Hz. To provide a standardized design for ANSS strong motion reference stations, recommended station designs for both self-contained stations (containing all electronics within one enclosure) and remote sensor stations (containing only the sensor, other electronics remote) are fully described in Document C-USGS-2000-01, Ver. 0.92 (COSMOS Guidelines for Installation of Advanced National Seismic System Strong Motion Reference Stations), pages 13 and 14. Other station designs, if used, should be experimentally or analytically studied to verify that the completed station does not significantly affect the recorded ground motions.  54   ANSS TG v 1.0  4.5.4 Reference Stations In Small Buildings An acceptable strong motion reference station can also be installed within a building small enough to have minimal effect upon the earthquake shaking. This section contains siting criteria and a discussion of siting issues for strong motion reference stations in small buildings. 4.5.4.1 Siting Criteria A strong-motion station will be considered a ""Strong-Motion Reference Station: Small Building"" (SMRS-SB) if it meets all of the following criteria):  It is located within a small building (<4000 sq. ft in plan and <2 stories in height);  It is installed on grade;  It is located in a building without significant basement;  It is located in a building with a small foundation (flat slab preferred, no pile foundations or deep spread footings);  It is located in a building of relatively lightweight construction (wood frame preferable, but reinforced masonry acceptable); and  It is located a distance of at least one major structural dimension (height or length, whichever is greater) from any large building (>4000 sq. ft in plan or >2 stories in height) or any building with a significant basement or foundation;  It is located a distance of at least one major structural dimension (height or length, whichever is greater) from any non-building structures likely to cause significant soil-structure interaction effects that will contaminate the data. 4.5.4.2 Siting Issues Siting issues are generally the same as for SMRS-OG stations with the following exceptions. 4.5.4.2.1 Background Vibration  Strong motion reference stations in buildings should be kept away from potential sources of ground and structural vibration. These can include: Large motors, pumps, or generators; Unsupported floor slabs; Localized human activity; Heavy vehicle traffic outside; and Industrial activities. Care should also be taken to protect the sensor from impact of falling objects. It is recommended that a clear space of 2m (minimum) be maintained around the sensor, and that the general area of the sensor be maintained free of furniture or contents that could move during an earthquake and contaminate the measured motions with impact vibrations.  55   ANSS TG v 1.0 4.5.4.2.2 Security  Vandalism can be a problem for strong motion stations in buildings. One must make provisions for security in the design of a strong motion station. A dedicated room with a locked door is recommended. Some installations also have a steel fence cage around the sensor within a non-dedicated room. 4.5.4.2.3 Power  For a strong motion station in a building, power may not be a major issue. However, sufficient power reserve should be provided in case of power failure, through batteries or an UPS, for operation for 4 to 7 days. Power conditioning is also a good idea. 4.5.4.2.4 Communications  In a building, communications may not be a major issue as with stations on open land, but it is still an important issue to be considered. 4.5.4.3 Recommended Station Design There is no one recommended design provided here for a strong motion reference station within a small building, because each building situation will be different. However, following are several strongly recommended features of a building installation:   The sensor, recorder, and all auxiliary components must be bolted or fastened securely to a major part of the structure, preferably the floor slab;   The location within a building should be as secluded as possible, away from human traffic;   The location within a building should be as far as possible from any structural or nonstructural building components that may strongly amplify the ground shaking. When in doubt, an experienced structural engineer should be consulted for appropriate location; and  The location should not be in the center of an unsupported floor slab. 4.5.5 Reference Stations in Densely Urbanized Areas Risk to life and property is often greatest in the densely urbanized sections of large metropolitan areas such as downtown and high-rise areas of San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, and New York. These areas often include older structures built prior to modern codes and in many cases may include structures on soft soils near embayment and coastal areas. Soil-structure interaction effects of tall structures, bridges, and other transportation structures in the downtown areas will likely contaminate ground motions. Seismic background noise in these areas will be variable and especially high during rush hours and construction periods. Nevertheless, it is these areas for which thorough measurements of ground motion and the performance of structures are of highest priority and critical for improvements in public earthquake safety. 4.5.5.1 Siting Criteria A strong-motion station will be considered a ""Strong-Motion Building Reference Station: Densely Urbanized Area"" (SMBRS-DU) if it meets the following criteria:  56   ANSS TG v 1.0  It is located so as to measure representative base floor motions in the densely urbanized areas;  It is located within a building 10 stories or less in height;  It is located on the base floor of the building (i.e. the lowest floor level, whether parking or basement). Reference stations located in densely urbanized areas should be sited with SMRS-SB criteria wherever possible. In those densely urbanized areas for which SMRS-SB type sites are not available SMBRS-DU criteria should be used. If possible, the building in which an SMBRS-DU station is located should also be instrumented for structural response to allow the building response to be removed from the ground or ground floor motions. Data from SMBRS-DU stations will be used for comparison with those of nearby reference stations located on open ground or in small buildings. A suggested goal for a densely urbanized area with high seismic hazard, in which SMRSOG or SMRS-SB stations are not possible, is to have one SMBRS-DU station for every 2 million square feet of building space or at a density that will ensure documentation of rapid changes in underlying geology. Density of stations based on the 2M sq. ft. guideline translates into spacing depending on the type of zoning. For zones of dense high-rise buildings this may be 1 to 2 square blocks, for zones of low-rise industrial buildings 1 to 2 square miles, and for urban residential zones several square miles or more. A combination of geologic and zoning criteria is required to determine spacing. In densely urbanized areas with moderate or low seismic hazard, a rational risk-based approach should be considered for optimization of SMBRS-DU station locations. 4.5.5.2 Siting Issues Siting issues are generally the same as for SMRS-SB stations with the following exceptions. Note that finding good locations for GPS antennas in downtown areas so that signals are not blocked by tall buildings can be an especially challenging problem for reference stations. This needs to be considered in the initial site permitting process for the instruments. 4.5.5.2.1 Background Vibration  Seismic background noise levels will in general be much higher in a densely urbanized downtown area than in an area located in a park or away from local cultural noise sources. When in doubt, it is suggested that the background vibrations at a potential site be monitored, so as to locate the instrument in feasible locations within a city block area with the smallest levels of peak acceleration during rush hours. 4.5.5.3 Recommended Station Design Recommendations for station design for SMBRS-DU stations are similar to those for SMRS-SB stations (previous section). The recommendations are not repeated here.  57   ANSS TG v 1.0 4.5.6 Structural Response Stations ""Structural Response Stations"", denoted SRS, are ANSS stations designed to measure and record the response of civil structures to strong earthquake shaking. Civil structures of main interest for ANSS are buildings, bridges, and dams. Other types of structures may also be included. The main purpose for these stations is to provide information on structural response to earthquake shaking that can be used to improve the safety of design and construction practices for new structures, or to assess or reduce the hazards posed by existing structures in earthquake-prone regions. For some critical structures, especially lifeline structures, SRS information may have more immediate emergency response applications such as state-of-health monitoring of structures or generation of regional damage indices. 4.5.6.1 Structural Response Parameters The following structural response parameters are of interest:  Building translation and rotation in plan   Interstory displacements and overall displacement response (including mode shapes and periods)  Rocking motion (overturning)  Floor accelerations and floor load distributions  Base input motion These data are used to:           Evaluate design practices and procedures Determine the severity of damage in a region Assess the health of a structure Identify structural failure mechanisms Assess effects of ground motion characteristics (period, amplitude, duration) on structural response Establish threshold levels of damage Verify or identify proposed nonlinear mathematical models of a structure Study soil-structure interaction at the foundation interface Evaluate earthquake rehabilitation methods Assess earthquake hazard potential of existing structures  4.5.6.2 Siting Criteria In general, ANSS SRS should be installed in structures or structure types deemed important for either local or national information needs in accordance with ANSS global siting priorities. It is recommended that structure selection and structure-specific design of an SRS be done by experienced personnel, and that each SRS design be reviewed by appropriate ANSS staff or committees.  58   ANSS TG v 1.0  Table 1  Model Building Classifications Recommended for Instrumentation (reference CSMIP 1985) Estimated Prevalence in Building Type Built Environment 1.

Precast concrete frame (low, medium, Low high rise) 16. Long span (low rise) High 17. Base isolated (low, medium rise) Low 18. Rehabilitated Low  Following are general criteria to be considered in SRS siting:   Probability of Shaking: as SRS stations will represent a large investment, they should be installed in regions of high probability of shaking. An exception to this guideline may be representative unique regional building types in areas of lower seismicity. Regions with a seismic hazard greater than 0.1g peak ground  59   ANSS TG v 1.0 acceleration with a 10% chance of exceedance in 20 years shall be considered for structural response stations.   Probability of Learning: SRS stations should be sited to maximize the potential of learning in needed areas of earthquake engineering understanding.   Potential for Loss: SRS stations should be sited in regions with a large population or densely built environment that will result in a high potential for earthquake loss due to seismic hazard, building inventory, or structure vulnerabilities.   Location Strategy: In general, structures selected for SRS installation should logically fit into a regional plan considering both regional and national needs for structural performance data. Locations of building structural response stations shall be distributed throughout the building inventory such that all model building classes are represented and the number of each is consistent with the distribution of buildings in the built environment. Model building classifications recommended for instrumentation are listed in Table 1. Location of structural response stations in non-building structures (dams, lifelines) shall be based on regional needs and locally important structures. An exception to this may be the desire to instrument important, unique structures for emergency response or research purposes.   Nearby Structures: SRS design shall consider the effect of nearby structures on the response of the instrumented structure. Where possible, stations should be sited away from structures likely to cause significant soil-structure interaction effects that may be recorded in the data.   Site Conditions: SRS siting should avoid unusual soil or topographic conditions which might affect the structural response, unless these unusual conditions are of specific interest to ANSS.   Structural Configuration: In general, buildings selected for SRS installation should be regular structures without significant vertical or plan irregularities in mass or stiffness, unless these conditions are of specific interest to ANSS. The presence of irregularities will complicate the response of the structure and limit the usefulness of the data for conclusions regarding general structural response. 4.5.6.3 Recommended Station Design The exact configuration of sensors within an SRS shall be optimized for information needs and budgetary constraints. If possible, a pre-analysis of the structure should be performed to assist in system design by estimating the global response and identifying locations of interest for local structural response. It is recommended that SRS configuration design be done by experienced personnel and reviewed by appropriate ANSS staff or committees. 4.5.6.3.1 Configuration  Following is generic guidance regarding SRS configuration:  60   ANSS TG v 1.0  Ground Motion Reference: A free-field or reference ground motion sensor shall be provided near the structure. This shall measure triaxial acceleration. Where possible this reference sensor installation shall meet the requirements of COSMOS/ANSS SMRS-OG station.  Structure Base Motion Reference: One triaxial acceleration sensor should also be installed at the base of the structure at or below grade to measure ""base motion.""  Sensors for Global Response: Sufficient acceleration sensors shall be distributed in the structure to resolve linear modal response (frequencies and gross mode shapes) based on the global response predicted for the structure. Both translation and torsion shall be considered. o  Global translation: Consider installing single-component sensors at the roof and at each intermediate level of low-rise buildings up to three stories in height; at the roof and two intermediate levels of mid-rise buildings four to seven stories in height; at the roof, two intermediate levels and locations of stiffness discontinuities in high-rise buildings more than eight stories in height. o  Global torsion: Consider installing pairs of single-component sensors at opposite ends of a floor plate at each instrumented level of a building. Differences between these measurements will estimate the torsional response.  Sensors for Local Response: Other sensors shall be distributed as required to measure important local responses, such as relative displacements or component strains identified as key parameters in a pre-analysis. Sensors for local response need not be limited to accelerometers. Use of extensometers, strainmeters, and electronic distance measuring technology should be considered. 4.5.6.3.2 Specifications  An SRS should be designed and installed to provide appropriate data for understanding the response of the structure. General guidance for installation is provided below (guidance for acceleration instrumentation is provided in chapter 3):   Measurement Types: Acceleration and displacement based quantities should be the main quantities measured. Sensors other than accelerometers shall be considered in SRS design when appropriate. Recording shall be digital.   Triggering: For triggered recording systems, trigger thresholds shall be appropriate for the expected earthquake and structural response motions. Preevent times shall be sufficient to capture the P-wave upon S-wave triggering; 10 seconds is a recommended minimum. Post-event times should be adequate to capture significant free response of the structure after ground shaking has stopped.  61   ANSS TG v 1.0 30 seconds is a recommended minimum, but more will be required for lowfrequency structures such as high-rise buildings or long-span bridges.  4.5.6.3.3 Installation    General: SRS instrumentation shall be installed with normal standards of professional care. The need for long-term reliability shall be foremost in the installation work plan and details.   Station Location Accuracy: Documented accuracy of one ten-thousandth of a degree in latitude and longitude.   Sensor location accuracy: Within the structure, sensor location accuracy should be 1m or better in all three axes relative to a designated reference sensor.   Sensor Orientation: Sensors within a structure shall be oriented in a logical manner, either to compass points or in line with the structure's primary axes. Sensors shall be mounted within 2 degrees of the desired orientation within the structure. Sensor orientation is critical to data interpretation and shall be well documented and controlled.   Anchoring: All sensors, recorder and auxiliary components shall be anchored securely to the structure to prevent relative motion.   Site Documentation: An SRS installation should be extensively and formally documented, with narrative and photographic descriptions of each component of the instrumentation system. This documentation shall also include sufficient site condition data for evaluation of local site effects and soil-structure interaction.   Maintenance Program: A post-installation maintenance program is essential to the success of an SRS.  4.6 References COSMOS, 2001, Guidelines for the Installation of Advanced National Seismic System Strong Motion Reference Stations, prepared by COSMOS for the USGS, Document CUSGS-2001-01.

The DADS will rely heavily upon the Network Architecture and Interconnection (see Chapter 2) to receive and transmit its information, and similarly will be driven by the needs identified by the Data Analysis and Products (DAP, Chapter 6) component to determine the types of data and information that must be handled. This summary is presented at a rather high level. Developing lower level requirements, in increasing detail, will be necessary in order to build the complete DADS system. At this point, this document does not address any design or implementation issues. For example, a requirement for a highly reliable DADS may necessitate a design with a dual redundant data center architecture. However, the requirements should specify only the target reliability. Only after this requirement is agreed upon can a design consistent with meeting the requirement be developed.  5.2 Operational Concept The DADS provides a mechanism for collecting together raw data, derived parameters, and metadata produced by the stations and processing centers comprising the ANSS. Data are acquired from data concentrators and/or data processing (operation) centers. Data may be transmitted to the DADS continuously, in near-real-time, or in batch mode, though receiving data via continuous telemetry is strongly preferred. Note that if waveforms are telemetered directly to a DADS facility from the field, they will be acquired and reformatted as needed by a collocated concentrator. Quality control of data is the responsibility of the processing centers, but the DADS will have basic QC capabilities where these capabilities make sense, particularly for functions that depend on the aggregations of data within the DADS. However, the processing centers are solely responsible for producing the definitive version of any data. The DADS shall have the capability to synchronize holdings with processing centers and production outlets for the purpose of obtaining or maintaining definitive versions of the data. Users will thus be able to receive the same version of data, whether they are receiving the data from a regional processing center or from the DADS. The DADS must be able to properly identify and track data from multiple sources through a data tracking and versioning system. The DADS distributes the waveforms, all metadata necessary to use the waveforms, and derived products in standard formats with the goal of supporting only a single standard format for each type of data. Data can be distributed in arbitrary (custom) aggregations, and regardless of whether the data are associated to a particular event or are unassociated. 65   ANSS TG v 1.0 Supported data distribution mechanisms shall include continuous near-real time transmission, data requests, and data subscriptions (standing orders). The DADS archives all data and products indefinitely, and in a manner that provides data security and allows continuing operation during regional-scale natural disasters or technology infrastructure disruptions. Operational concept highlights include:  Receive data (time series and discrete measurements)  Receive products derived from data  Receive metadata that describe the raw data  Archive data, metadata, and products  Distribute data, metadata, and products  Synchronize holdings with processing centers  Define and support a single format for incoming waveform data  Define and support a single format for each outgoing data type  Perform only limited, non-definitive, quality control (QC) on the data   Receive and distribute raw data and data products via multiple data transfer mechanisms  Be highly available  5.3 Requirements The requirements are categorized in several ways. System level requirements are presented first. To the extent possible, these requirements address only capabilities required of the overall system, and not specific functional behaviors. The second category of requirements are those which apply to interfaces between the DADS and other systems or entities. Finally, requirements that address the specific functional behavior of the system are presented. 5.3.1 System Level Requirements The DADS is a subsystem of the ANSS, with interfaces to other subsystems, and an architecture suitable for fulfilling its requirements. This section addresses those requirements that apply to the entire DADS subsystem. Note that these system requirements all lead to more detailed interface and functional requirements, but herein only the most fundamental requirements of the DADS are characterized: receiving, archiving, and distributing data. Although the DADS will be capable of distributing data in real time for the general scientific community, the real time needs of the operation centers and production outlets will not, in general, rely upon the DADS. The Data Archiving and Distribution Subsystem:  Shall be capable of receiving all of the types of data collected by the ANSS  Time series (waveform) data  Discrete measurements  Shall be capable of receiving all products derived by the ANSS  Shall be capable of receiving all metadata associated with received data  Shall be capable of receiving the entire volume of data produced by the ANSS  66   ANSS TG v 1.0  Shall manage only those data for which complete metadata are also provided  Shall archive all data, metadata, and products received   Shall be able to distribute, on demand, any of the archived data, metadata, or products  Be essentially continuously available, with no outages during  Natural disasters   Regional-scale infrastructure disruptions (power failures, communications failures, etc.)   Shall satisfy specific availability requirements (which are to be determined) for such areas as:  Availability of the system for data import  Availability of the system for data export   Acceptable latencies, which in general will be greater than latencies required of the ANSS processing centers  Shall provide a high degree of data security 5.3.2 Interface Requirements The DADS must interface with multiple entities, including processing centers and data users. The structure of some of the interfaces will be determined by the Network Architecture and Integration subsystem. The Data Archiving and Distribution Subsystem:   Shall receive and transmit data, metadata, and data products from and to processing centers with minimal delay introduced at the centers  Protocol(s) determined by NAI subsystem  Formats determined by the DADS   Shall exchange information with processing centers for the purpose of synchronizing holdings   Shall support a synchronization protocol (a request/response language built on a format and an underlying protocol)  Protocol(s) and formats determined by DADS  Shall provide data (and corresponding metadata) and products in response to  Custom requests  Subscriptions (standing orders)  Shall provide  Derived data products  Continuous waveform feeds  Engineering products 5.3.3 Functional Requirements These requirements attempt to address the specific behavior of the DADS. Note that a distinction is made between data formats and data exchange protocols. Requirements related to data formats and data exchange protocols will need to be pushed down to much  67   ANSS TG v 1.0 greater detail, and this work must be done in conjunction with the several other subsystems that are affected by these formats and protocols. The requirements stated here reflect the fact that the DADS needs to be flexible in some ways (e.g. by importing data via multiple protocols) and yet rigid in other areas (e.g. controlling the number of formats supported). 5.3.3.1 Data import   Multiple data transfer protocols shall be supported for receiving continuous and non-continuous (segmented) data from cooperating organizations  Acknowledged, point-to-point protocols  Ring-buffer-based protocols  Client-server push or pull protocols  Shall support receiving data via bulk data shipments  Electronic transfer (e.g. FTP)  Physical media (e.g. tape)   A single protocol shall be supported for importing data from processing centers and production outlets for the purpose of synchronizing holdings (synchronization protocol)   Shall support receiving data/metadata/product updates for data previously received (versioning)  Shall support tracking of the path/mechanism by which data were received 5.3.3.2 Data export   Multiple data transfer mechanisms shall be supported for distributing continuous and non-continuous (segmented) waveforms, metadata, and parameters   A single protocol shall be supported for exporting data to processing centers for the purpose of synchronizing holdings (synchronization protocol)  Multiple user data request mechanisms will be supported  E-mail  Web (GUI)  Interactive query results  Shall satisfy data distribution timeliness requirements, which are to be determined  Timeliness requirements shall be established for:  Class of user (e.g. processing center, end user, etc.)  Data requested (e.g. data type, data age, volume of data, etc.) 5.3.3.3 Formats   Data received from processing centers or data concentrators shall be in a single standard format  No format conversion is required for these data  Will maintain ability to re-construct raw data, by either:  Preserving raw, unconverted, data   Preserving descriptive information about raw data (e.g. original segment boundaries, etc.)  A single standard format is supported for data archiving 68   ANSS TG v 1.0   Legacy data are archived via encapsulation in (or translation to) the standard archiving format  A single standard format is supported for data distribution  Format shall include both data and corresponding metadata   Mechanisms to distribute waveform data alone and/or metadata alone will also be provided but will be closely tied to the standard format   Software for converting the standard format into widely used community consensus formats will be provided. 5.3.3.4 Synchronization  Shall support specific rules for updating holdings  Shall have the capability to initiate a synchronization request  Shall have the capability to receive a synchronization request  A synchronization request may serve to:  Push updated data to another site  Pull updated data from another site  Seek data to fill gaps in holdings  Verify the version or accuracy of data in a site's holdings   Shall have the capability to receive or transmit data to achieve synchronization with a processing center   Shall have the capability to update the archive when updated (replacement) data are received 5.3.3.5 Archiving  Shall have the capability to archive all data types collected by the ANSS  Includes time-series data of any sample rate  Includes discrete observations   Specific data products to be archived will be determined by Data Products committee   Shall have the capability to archive all processed (including QC'ed) time series data produced by the ANSS  Shall archive all metadata associated with archived data   Shall have the capability to archive all processing results (parametric information) produced by the ANSS  Specific data products to be archived determined by Data Products committee  Archive both the raw or equivalent and processed time series data.   Shall archive all data, metadata, and products such that queries to a DBMS may exploit relationships between these classes of information   Note: this does not imply that waveforms must be stored directly within a DBMS  Shall archive data indefinitely  Shall maintain a data management policy, reviewed annually, that addresses  69   ANSS TG v 1.0   Data storage migration to avoid extinction of formats/and storage media as well as the storage device technology  Data security (loss prevention) 5.3.3.6 Quality control   Primary data quality control shall be performed by the operation centers and production outlets  The DADS shall have the capability to perform limited quality control  To verify the integrity of holdings   Where such quality control can only reasonably be performed on aggregations of data only present within the DADS   Certain routine assessments of data quality such as signal to noise ratios, power spectral density functions, and other automatic quality control procedures  5.4 Other Issues The architecture of the DADS has been extensively discussed in the DADS meetings, but no final recommendations are included herein. Instead, one or more working groups will develop the DADS and address these issues:  A centralized rather than distributed architecture (i.e., a centralized archive).  Redundant archives to promote high availability.  Off-site storage for data security.  70   ANSS TG v 1.0  6 Data Analysis and Products 6.1 Introduction The ANSS must provide a timely, standardized, coordinated, automatic supply of authoritative earthquake data and products. The data collected, products generated, and the methods used to generate products need to be clear and fully documented in order for interested parties to use them confidently. The ANSS must provide robust, timely, interactive distribution of data and products system-wide and provide assistance with understanding the data and products to those who need it. The ANSS must distribute earthquake data and products to a wide variety of users broad range of time scales. In particular, regional and national processing centers production outlets have the responsibility to provide rapid earthquake information time-critical users, while the archiving facilities distribute data and information to time-critical users. over a and to non-  6.2 Users The logical flow of data is from field instrumentation to processing, distributing, and archiving of data and information products. At each step, user requirements should govern the system design and performance. This section identifies several categories of anticipated ANSS users, briefly summarizes their primary activities, and describes their needs for seismological data and products. 6.2.1 Earthquake Emergency Responder Primary activities:  Identify areas and levels of damage  Assess level of damage/functionality at specific buildings or facilities  Understand related phenomena such as tsunami, landslide or volcanic activity Data and information needs:  Fair-quality digital data from densely instrumented urban areas  Good-quality digital building data from special-interest buildings  Near real-time processed data and derivative products  Access to expert knowledge and training regarding data and products 6.2.2 Media, Public Officials, K-20 Educators, and the General Public Primary activities:  Be informed about what is happening  Make better risk management decisions at public and personal levels Data and information needs:  71   ANSS TG v 1.0  Raise earthquake hazard awareness and understanding of the earth   Near real-time derivative products that are easy to understand and reliably delivered to large numbers of recipients  Interpretation provided by local experts 6.2.3 Earthquake Engineer Primary activities:  Evaluate building performance as a function of reference ground motion   Update structural seismic design requirements based on strong motion recordings, processed data, and damage correlation studies  Advise building owners/occupants about safety and functionality of instrumented buildings Data and information needs:   Unclipped strong motion waveforms from 3-component reference stations and instrumented buildings and other structures  Near real-time and archived processed strong motion data  Detailed information about site conditions, sensor locations, and building design  Structural state-of-health monitoring reports  Measurements of global and local structural deformation 6.2.4 Seismic Hazard Analyst Primary activities:  Characterize seismic sources by style of faulting, depth of faulting, stress drop  Use earthquake catalogs to assess recurrence  Estimate seismic hazards Data and information needs:   Uniformly processed catalogs of earthquake source parameters including magnitude, depth, focal mechanism, stress-drop, and fault association  Identification of aftershocks  Attenuation and site response information 6.2.5 Engineering Seismologist and Geotechnical Engineer Primary activities:  Determine attenuation of ground shaking with distance and source characteristics  Evaluate site response as a function of source characteristics and site geology Data and information needs:  Good-quality digital data from dense arrays near causative fault  Data from a wide range of site conditions  Unclipped waveforms from 3-component strong motion reference stations  Real-time and archived data, both unprocessed and processed  Detailed geotechnical site characterization of all instrumented sites  72   ANSS TG v 1.0 6.2.6 Regional Seismologist Primary activities:  Study regional earthquakes, determine source parameters and characteristics  Study regional crust and mantle structure and properties  Associate earthquakes with faults and tectonic features  Study earthquake source processes  Provide earthquake information to all interested parties in near real-time Data and information needs:   High-quality, 3-component, high dynamic range broad-band digital data on regional and local scales  Real-time and archived raw and derived data 6.2.7 Global Seismologist Primary activities:   Study the locations, source parameters, and characteristics of worldwide earthquakes  Provide earthquake information to all interested parties in near real-time  Study large-scale earth structure and properties  Study earthquake source processes Data and information needs:   High-quality, 3-component, high dynamic range broadband digital data on global and continental scales  Real-time and archived raw and derived data  6.3 Rapid Products When an earthquake of potential general interest occurs, the ANSS should routinely provide:   Real-time seismograms - Media, technical staff, researchers, and public like access to real-time visual seismograms.   Phase picks - Currently single component phase picks are common. Recently three component picks have been developed.  Origin time - Time should be available in UTC format and local time formats.   Hypocenter  Locations should be available in both degrees-minutes and decimal degrees format. Depth should be available. Quality information such as error estimates, number of phases used, and distribution of stations should be available.   Distance from reports - Distances from cities (small, medium, and large), quarries, faults, and historical large events. Distances from seismic stations are often requested.   Magnitudes - A wide variety of magnitudes should be available including mb, and Ms, Mcd, Ml, Me, Mw. Quality information should be available such as number of stations, and components used in solution.  73   ANSS TG v 1.0   A single representative, authoritative magnitude should be chosen for distribution to the public and press Earthquake reports  Easily understandable event summaries distributed in many ways including emails and pages. Ground Motion Amplitudes  A wide variety of ground motion types including acceleration, velocity, displacement, spectral acceleration and velocity, and energy. ShakeMaps  Graphical representation of shaking information is rapidly becoming essential information. Event review pages  Rapid evaluation of automatic solutions supported by specially designed review pages that show waveforms, automatic phase picks and other information (for use by skilled staff only) Moment tensors and focal mechanisms  A variety of techniques should be supported. Structural state-of-health monitoring reports  the ability to assess the condition of an inventory of structures in an automated way would be useful in emergency response scenarios. Measurements of global and local structural deformations  direct measurement of structural displacements will help in post earthquake assessment of structures, and in future engineering research.          6.4 Information Products Information will be provided by the ANSS on a regular schedule for each region and for the nation as a whole. These should include but are not limited to the following:   Intensities listed by city or landmark  Intensity reports on a city-by-city basis may provide more useful information to the public than magnitude reports.   Community intensity map  The public contributes to produce an intensity map based on public reports.   Maps  Printed and Web based maps showing recent events in a geographical area are popular and important.   Catalog of quakes  Some users continue to favor text based earthquake catalog formats.   Operation reports  summaries of station installations, problems and changes and other operational events.   Event and continuous waveform data - The seismological research community will look to the ANSS to provide continuous waveform data for studies in earthquake and volcano processes and Earth structure. This will require both archives of continuous waveforms and event-based waveforms.   Derived time series  The engineering community is vitally interested in both raw time series as well as in derived time series (acceleration, velocity and displacement). Details about the processing steps used to obtain the product are essential to its use.   Spectral data series  The engineering community also wants response spectra, distributed in standard formats with documentation of damping values, periods, and the computational algorithm used.  74   ANSS TG v 1.0   Station metadata - Station coordinates, DAS and sensor type, instrument response. For strong-motion data, additional information about the near-surface geology and shear wave velocity is needed. The ANSS will provide specialized reports on subsets of all data - at all stages. For example, it is increasingly common to request a subset of all the data available, and then to perform additional processing using just this data subset. For example, partners may be interested in information from ANSS stations collocated at their facilities. The ANSS will support this type of data report.  6.5 Interpretation The routine operation of the ANSS will provide many standardized products, mostly in computer generated and readable forms. These will be distributed to a wide variety of users, many of who lack sufficient experience or training to use or even fully understand these products. The ANSS must provide functionality to assist many users with the interpretation and understanding of the routine products. Examples of these functions or personnel are the following:  Public/press  interface with the general public and news media.   Policy issues  interface with government and civil authorities regarding hazard mitigation or emergency preparedness.   Science  interface with other seismologists, geologists, engineers about specifics of the data and products  Data access  Database access issues for special requests. The personnel involved in the interpretation of the ANSS routine data and products can contribute greatly to the development and evolution of new procedures and products. Feedback from the users will play an important role in maintaining high quality and relevant products.  6.6 Authority The distributed ANSS system will be capable of providing authoritative earthquake parameters and rapid response data and products at all times. At a minimum, the ANSS will have a national production outlet that is staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The ANSS will provide continuous system monitoring, system control, and authoritative earthquake parameter and rapid response information. The ANSS will operate under ""incident command and response rules"" that provide clear guidelines as to who is in charge. The national production outlet will serve as an arbiter among the regions in resolving divergent views of the same earthquake. Appropriate business rules and mechanisms will ensure that a single authoritative set of parameters is available for each event at any time. The ANSS archive system will synchronize data with processing centers to ensure that data holdings are complete and current. The national production outlet will have the responsibility to construct a comprehensive seismicity catalog that is a superset of the regional and global events. Regional production outlets will have `on  75   ANSS TG v 1.0 call' staff available to respond rapidly to significant earthquakes in their region and to review routine data and products with the national production center.  6.7 Data Processing The ANSS should be responsible for providing uniform software and technical support for all centers and outlets (national and/or regional) producing ANSS standard products. Data shall be processed in accordance with the time-critical nature of their intended use. Table 2.

The model starts with a description of network elements or data sources including the number of stations per element, the number of components, sample rate, and field triggering percentage for both seismometers and accelerometers at each station, and the average number of bits per sample. The bits per sample represent the mean output of a compression algorithm (including compression overhead). Given this information, telemetry data rates, intermediate data buffer volumes, and archival volumes are estimated. Data rates include 20% telemetry overhead (data record and protocol packet headers, etc.). Intermediate data buffer storage is needed at the production outlets to support rapid review of automatic products, at the processing centers to support network triggering of continuous data, and at data concentrators and processing centers to provide complete data through telemetry outages (to other centers). Archive volume calculations provide for the possibility of a different compression amount and for discarding additional data at the operation centers (after telemetry from the field). Derived products and station metadata have not been included in the exchange rates because they are negligible. Products and metadata have been included in the archive totals as an overhead. Note that the data exchange rate would also apply to data exchanges between operation centers. The TIC recommends that national backbone broadband, regional broadband, urban reference, and urban free field data will all be telemetered from the field continuously in real-time. Low gain channels from national backbone and regional stations should be triggered. 1 Hz long period channels will be generated from the broadband data for both national backbone and regional broadband stations (note that this has been represented in the spreadsheet by making the sample rates slightly higher). Structural arrays should be event triggered, but the telemetry will be continuously available and capable of transmitting all data in real time. Note that rather than showing structural arrays as 3000, 3 component stations, they have been shown as 375, 24-channel arrays. Also note that 150 Hz sampling provides the full engineering bandwidth using brick-wall FIR filters. All data should be compressed in the field. At the operation center(s), all data will be acquired and buffered. Reference and free field data will be network triggered from this buffer. Data exchanged among regional processing centers and transmitted to the national processing and archiving centers will include only the event triggered reference and free field data. All data and products will be forwarded to the archive facilities as soon as they are available and will be provided to the community indefinitely. Note that the waveform data will be archived in compressed form. Acquisition, processing, and archiving of continuous broadband data from national and regional stations seems to have wide community support. Given the availability of continuous broadband data, there seemed no compelling reason to telemeter collocated low gain channels continuously as well. The choice to telemeter urban reference and free field data continuously is less clear. However, it was felt that the ability to extract small  80   ANSS TG v 1.0 events from the data would be better supported at the operation center(s) (using network triggers) than in the field. The choice to provide continuously available, full rate telemetry for structural monitoring was motivated by the desire to certify critical structures as safe or unsafe within 10-20 minutes of an event. Given that only short triggers from strong events are of interest, the telemetry data rate could probably be safely reduced to as little as 10% of the full data rate. The choice to use compression from the field was motivated by the high data rates and experience indicating that compression is an effective way of reducing bandwidth requirements provided that adequate excess bandwidth is available during events. The aggregate telemetry data rate (received) would be spread out over the regional and national operation centers. Data rates from individual stations are shown in the second able. Note that the telemetry data rate doesn't include stations that are transmitted to multiple operation centers from the field. The aggregate data exchange rate is the same as the aggregate telemetry rate except that the urban reference and free field data has now been triggered as well. This would represent the aggregate data flow into the archive facilities and, perhaps, into the national processing center. The exchange data rate also provides a rough estimate of the data exchanges among regional processing centers (e.g., nearest neighbors exchanging subsets of waveform data). Compression Tutorial For those not familiar with seismic compression techniques, our ability to compress data depends on two factors: 1) about 95% of all seismic data is background noise and 2) most of the available dynamic range is rarely used. That is, only a small part of the available waveform data contains seismic events and large seismic events are very rare. The crudest seismic compression technique is to simply discard noise and keep events. Such ""triggering"" algorithms are generally effective, but typically have 100% false alarm rates and may still miss small events. The second class of seismic compression algorithms is loss-less. In these methods, all data samples are retained, but unused dynamic range (i.e., the high order zeros in each sample) is discarded. Differencing or even double differencing the data can enhance this process. Note that additional information (overhead) must be embedded into the compressed data to allow its recovery. At a quiet site, loss-less algorithms can typically compress data from more than 24 bits to less than 6 including overhead. The disadvantage of loss-less compression is that the data volume expands during events when the compression becomes less effective. The differencing which is also less effective when compressing frequencies near the Nyquist emphasizes this effect. Theoretically, under worst case conditions, compression could actually lead to more bits per sample than uncompressed data. In practice, the correlation of data samples due to the anti-aliasing filters precludes this scenario. Experience has shown that allowing about 50% excess bandwidth is adequate to ensure real-time telemetry essentially all the time. Additionally, because of the attenuation of the earth, periods of degraded compression efficiency are typically short compared with the earthquake wave train.  81   ANSS TG v 1.0  Table 1 ANSS Data Rate/Volume Estimates Stations Data Source No. Stations 100 1000 3000 375 4475 High Gain No. Rate Trig Comp (Hz) % 3 3 51 101 100 100 No. Comp 3 3 3 24 21300 Low Gain Rate Trig (Hz) % 50 100 150 150 10 10 100 2 Sample Size (Bits) 8 8 8 8 Telemetry Data Rate per Source Station (Mbps) (Kbps) 1.61 3.20 4.32 0.69 0.16 3.20 12.96 0.26 16.58  National Backbone Regional Urban Ref + Free Urban Structure Totals:  3300  Data Source  Buffering Save Data for Volume (Days) (GB) 7 7 7 7 10.161 201.4 816.48 16.33 1044.4 27900  Trigger HG LG % % 100 100 100 100 10 100  Archiving Sample Exchange Size Rate (Bits) (Mbps) 8 8 8 8 0.16 3.20 1.30 0.26 4.91  Archive Volume (TB/yr) 0.56 11.03 4.47 0.89 16.96  National Backbone Regional Urban Ref + Free Urban Structure Totals: Total number of channels:  Table 2 ANSS Data Rate Per Station High Gain No. Rate Trig Comp (Hz) % 3 3 50 100 100 100 Low Gain Rate Trig (Hz) % 50 100 150 150 150 150 150 10 10 100 100 100 100 100 Sample Size (Bits) 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 Telemetry Data Rates NRT Trigs Average Worst Case (Kbps) (Kbps) (Kbps) 1.58 3.17 4.32 11.52 23.04 34.56 46.08 2.38 4.75 6.48 17.28 34.56 51.84 69.12  Data Source  No. Comp 3 3 3 8 16 24 32  National Backbone Regional Urban Ref + Free Urban Structure "" "" ""  1.73 3.46 5.18 6.91  1.

Dynamic Range The dynamic range of seismic sensors is to be computed according to the recommendations of the Standards for Seismometer Testing Workshop, July 1989. That is, dynamic range as a function of frequency shall be defined to be the ratio in decibels of the RMS clip level and the RMS noise floor as a function of frequency. The RMS clip level shall be taken to be the RMS value of a sine wave of the appropriate frequency that just clips. The noise floor shall be taken to be the non-coherent noise between two identical sensors recorded at a quiet site (or just the sensor noise if it is well above ambient earth noise). The RMS noise floor is computed by averaging power over half octave bands centered on the desired frequency, multiplying by the half octave bandwidth (to make the units power rather than power/Hz), and taking the square root. Vendors are required to provide a plot of the RMS noise floor in decibels (referenced to the RMS clip level) versus log frequency including at least the frequency band .01 < f < 50 Hz for each component of each sensor proposed. For reference, each plot shall include the USGS New Low Noise Model (NLNM) and representative earthquake RMS spectra (including a model 2.5 Mw event at 10 and 100 km) averaged over half octave bands. Note that the NLNM and model event spectra will be provided by the ANSS. Resolution The resolution of digitizers is to be computed according to the Modified Noise Power Ratio test as described in Sandia National Laboratories technical report SAND 94-0221, ""Modified Noise Power Ratio Testing of High Resolution Digitizers"", by T. S. McDonald, 1994. The test involves driving two identical digitizer channels with pseudo random, band limited, Gaussian noise and measuring the noise power ratio (NPR), defined as the ratio of the RMS input noise to the RMS non-coherent noise floor (both averaged over the digitizer pass band). The resolution is estimated indirectly by comparing the NPR as a function of RMS input noise against ideal digitizers. Copies of SAND 94-0221 will be provided by the ANSS. Vendors are required to provide a plot of NPR in decibels versus loading factor in decibels compared with theoretical curves for ideal digitizers of varying dynamic ranges (i.e., number of bits). The loading factor is the ratio of the digitizer clip level to the RMS input noise. The NPR must be determined at RMS input levels between the RMS shorted input and clipping in 10 dB steps. Vendors are also required to provide a plot of shorted input power in decibels versus frequency and at least one plot of the phase of the noncoherent noise in degrees versus frequency. Both plots must including at least the frequency band 0 < f < 50 Hz.  84   ANSS TG v 1.0 Magnetic Fields When equipment is operated in the presence of magnetic field intensity changes of up to 10 milligauss, there shall be no detectable effect in the output signal. Atmospheric Pressure Sensitivity to atmospheric pressure changes shall not be detectable at the output of the instrument including changes due to passing fronts and thunderstorms. Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) When equipment is operated in the presence of RFI there shall be no detectable effect in the output signal provided that the RFI does not exceed FCC standards. For relevant standards see ""Limits for General Population/Uncontrolled Exposure"" (FCC document ""A Local Government Official's Guide to Transmitting Antenna RF Emission Safety: Rules, Procedures, and Practical Guidance"", June 2, 2000). Mean Time Between Failures (MBTF) MTBF shall be estimated by the Bell Communications Research (Belcore) method. The method is defined in ""Reliability Prediction Procedure for Electronic Equipment"" (Belcore document number TR-332, Issue 6) and may be computed using commercially available software (e.g., RelCalc). Configuration Information Sensors and power equipment shall be capable of reporting and DASes of receiving manufacturer, model, serial numbers, and other relevant information as specified (e.g., nominal response information for sensors and power status information for power systems). Data shall be communicated in the ASCII character code via a 1-wire network (MicroLAN) as described in http://www.maxim-ic.com/1st_pages/tb1.htm. Temporary Shallow Submersion in Water The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standard 60529 specifies degrees of protection provided by enclosures, also known as the IP code. ANSS requires IP67 level protection, which means 1) the enclosure shall be dust tight and 2) the ingress of water shall not be sufficient to damage the electronics when submerged under 1 m of water (measured from the base) for 30 minutes.  Appendix D - Production, Interpretation, and Outlets  85   ANSS TG v 1.0 The Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) real-time and off-line processing systems should be constructed from four modular hardware/software building blocks. In particular, the heterogeneity and number of the three types of modules (data concentrators, operation centers, and data archiving facilities) that are between the sensors and the users should be kept to a minimum for reliability and cost reasons. However, the fourth module type (outlets, which directly support ANSS participants and end users as well as some production tasks) should be diverse and numerous, involving the whole community and supporting the whole spectrum of ANSS related uses. Production functions (including those performed at outlets) should be logically separate from interpretation functions (also performed at outlets). Separating production and interpretation allows a system design that supports the goals of a highly reliable production environment and a highly diverse interpretation environment. Specialization does have negative aspects including problems in communication and coordination among groups of specialists. However, other large-scale organizations have developed effective strategies for dealing with these issues. While some of these problems have already been addressed by the ANSS management structure, others must be addressed as the ANSS develops. Introduction This Technical Guidelines for the Implementation of the Advanced National Seismic System, Version 1.0 (hereafter, Technical Guidelines) presents a blueprint for the next generation technological infrastructure for fixed network seismology in the US. While most of the technical discussion has found wide acceptance within the community, the non-technical proposal of a formal separation of production and interpretation functions has proven to be more controversial. In the body of the Technical Guidelines, the operation center technical construct is associated with production and the outlet technical construct with interpretation (but also some production). It seems likely that the multiplicity of roles envisioned for outlets has further confused these issues. The concern expressed by the seismological community is natural considering that the separation of production and interpretation suggests the dismantling of highly successful procedures and strategies evolved by Regional Seismograph Network (RSN) operators over decades. Inevitably, the scope of the proposed organizational shift has also created concerns at many seismological institutions about their future role within the emerging ANSS structure. In the following, ANSS tasks and their identification with ANSS technical constructs will be examined. In particular, the dual nature of outlets will be explored. With a common nomenclature established, the recommendation to separate production and interpretation will be examined. Finally, the consequences of modularizing ANSS tasks in general and separating production and interpretation in particular will be explored. ANSS Structure  86   ANSS TG v 1.0 The ANSS organizational structure favors the modularization of various production and interpretation functions. Production is identified with both the automated collection and processing of seismic waveforms and the routine manual activities that comprise seismic practice. In this context seismic practice includes quality control (QC) activities and the construction of derivative products such as catalogs. QC includes the review, rapid and otherwise, of automated products as well as removing artifacts from waveforms (e.g., timing problems) and monitoring the state-of-health of field and processing equipment. Each of these tasks may be accomplished by one or more cooperating organizations. Similarly, interpretation is identified with non-routine activities that require specialized knowledge, insight, and creativity. Thus, interpretation includes interpreting data for emergency managers and the media, the development of new algorithms for routine analysis and research work, seismological research, and engineering studies. Again, each of these tasks may be accomplished by one or more cooperating organizations. For clarity, the output of production functions (e.g., waveforms, automated products, routinely produced manual products, etc.) is referred to as data. Conversely, interpretation organizations can be thought of as consuming data and producing information. The Technical Guidelines recommends a modular technical structure comprised of data concentrators, operation centers, data archiving facilities, and outlets. This structure is hierarchical in the sense that waveform data is generated by widely distributed field equipment. It is then concentrated onto communication backbones by data concentrators, delivered to operation centers where automated products are derived, and finally delivered to data archiving facilities where it is organized and stored to satisfy future requests. Field equipment, data concentrators, operation centers, and data archiving facilities are all automated and performing tasks of a routine nature and therefore are all part of ANSS production. In addition, data flows in real-time from operation centers and archiving facilities to outlets where humans become involved for the first time. Technically, an outlet is defined by the machinery needed to ensure the reliable delivery of data pushed from one or more operation centers and/or archiving facilities and to organize the data for a variety of non-real-time (although perhaps time critical) uses. Organizationally, an outlet is any group of people with a standing request for data from one or more operation centers and/or archiving facilities. The outlet formalism turns out to be a convenient way of implementing a wide variety of ANSS tasks fulfilling both production and interpretation functions. For example, the rapid review of automated products, waveform QC, and the construction of catalogs are all production functions that would be performed at outlets. Similarly, the interpretation of data for emergency managers and the media, developing new products and/or algorithms, and research are all interpretation functions that also would be preformed at outlets. Development of the Guidelines  87   ANSS TG v 1.0 The controversy over the proposed separation of production and interpretation raises the question of why the Technical Guidelines addresses this fundamentally non-technical issue. After all, the Technical Guidelines excludes other non-technical issues such as the structure of the field deployment and maintenance effort, the organization of education and outreach, and institutionalizing (human) feed back mechanisms among disparate elements of the ANSS. The answer, of course, is that the technical and organizational structures of the ANSS are inextricably intertwined. In particular, it has proven very difficult to visualize whether technical elements of a nationally coherent ANSS are workable without some organizational context. The same considerations were applied to developing the organizational framework and the technical structure. That is, a conscious effort was made to be forward looking and to take advantage of past experience without being unduly constrained by current implementations. The impact on the whole system of each organizational and technical module was considered in the light of ability to meet ANSS goals and to satisfy the needs of ANSS funding sources, participants, and end users. The idea of separating functions that have traditionally been closely coupled arose from several different lines of reasoning. In the following the requirements for production and interpretation facilities and the needs of production and interpretation personnel are considered. These considerations lead to the conclusion that the production environment should be centralized and standardized while the interpretation environment should distributed and heterogeneous. Production and Interpretation Automated elements of the ANSS production environment such as data concentrators, operation centers, and data archiving facilities are in the primary path from field equipment to users and must be highly reliable to avoid the loss of waveforms and automated products vital to effective rapid response. In contrast, outlets are at the end of the data path and though they are also essential to meeting the goals of the ANSS, the failure of an outlet will not compromise the timeliness or completeness of automated products. Of course, the loss of an outlet involved in rapid review or rapid response would affect the early confirmation or interpretation of automatic results. However, outlets involved in other areas of production and interpretation are not essentially realtime operations and although they need to be reliable, they can tolerate some down time. This analysis suggests a hierarchy. The more tightly a task is coupled to real-time, the higher the risk of losing data, and the less outages of any length can be tolerated. It is easy to show that redundancy reduces the probability a total system failure, but enhances the probability of a partial failure due to increased complexity. That is, critical facilities should be centralized, but not too much. Therefore, the best balance between redundancy and complexity favors a small number of operation centers/archiving facilities and rapid review/response outlets, but doesn't rule out making other types of outlets more distributed. A reasonable degree of centralization coupled with standardized software make it easier to produce standardized automated products, coordinate the release of products among  88   ANSS TG v 1.0 centers, and reduce capital, developmental, operational, and maintenance costs. Reducing the cost of expensive support professionals (including seismic analysts working 24-hour shifts, system engineers, and data base administrators) is critical to the long term health of the ANSS. Although standardization tends to stifle innovation, experience indicates that support personnel generally work more effectively in a relatively stable environment. These arguments also favor centralizing and standardizing production facilities. The problem with centralization is that it excludes the participation of people who don't work at the centers. This is unacceptable if the ANSS is to meet the goal of providing effective local interpretation of earthquake data for emergency managers and the press. Also, fostering innovation is important not only in ANSS related research, but also in developing new products and algorithms to keep the ANSS current and relevant. Innovation requires a heterogeneous, dynamic environment in order to experiment with new technologies. Also, research and development personnel tend to thrive in a dynamic environment. Of course, dynamic, heterogeneous environments increase the risk of system failures. Placing tasks requiring such an environment outside of the primary data path (i.e., to outlets) makes sense. It also makes sense to isolate (i.e., modularize) interpretation tasks that require higher and lower degrees of reliability. For example, an interpretation outlet acting as a trusted source for emergency managers must function, even when software under development fails. Conversely, scientists and engineers should do science and engineering instead of keeping non-critical research systems operational 24 hours a day. Striking a balancing between tasks and personnel favoring a centralized, standardized, stable environment and tasks and personnel favoring a distributed, heterogeneous, dynamic environment leads inevitably to treating production and interpretation in different ways. Modularization One way to satisfy the divergent requirements of production and interpretation is to make a formal separation between them. In organizational terms, this separation means that production and interpretation tasks would be performed by different groups of people. In technical terms, this separation is implemented as a clean interface between operation (data processing) centers and (interpretation) outlets. Notice that this separation is formal in the sense that it allows, but does not require that production and interpretation tasks be physically separated. It could imply something as simple as production and interpretation groups (with separate management) working side by side on separate hardware/software systems connected by an operation center/outlet interface. However, this same structure could equally well support an isolated group of researchers allowing them the same degree of participation in ANSS as researchers collocated with a production group. Of course, ANSS modularization will necessarily be far more extensive than simply separating production and interpretation. As we have seen, modularization (into data concentrators, operation centers, and archiving facilities) is required in the production environment by the diversity of tasks and by geography. Modularizing other production  89   ANSS TG v 1.0 tasks (into outlets) is advantageous because it isolates the load on automated real-time processing systems, though it does add overhead (in the operation center/outlet interface). Modularizing production tasks also adds considerable flexibility. For example, it allows tasks such as rapid review, waveform QC, and catalog construction to be performed at different locations if desired. Similarly, it makes sense to modularize different types of interpretation facilities because of the wide variety of tasks, the geographical distribution of participating institutions, and widely varying requirements for reliability. While modularizing ANSS roles and responsibilities on technical, economic, and community participation grounds makes sense, there is the disturbing implication of compartmentalizing the associated personnel. Of course, the modularization of tasks and the compartmentalization of personnel are ubiquitous in large organizations because complex projects must be broken down into manageable pieces and personnel are more efficient when they can specialize. However, the resulting decrease in communications between groups of specialists and the indirect nature of controlling an organization through layers of management are well known problems. Fortunately, effective strategies for ensuring adequate communications among groups of specialists and for ensuring that organizations remain responsive to the needs of customers have been developed. Scale Issues Although the compartmentalization of specialists is minimized in an ideal RSN environment, where a small, close knit group designs the network, deploys stations, writes processing code, informs the public, and conducts research, it is an open question whether this advantage can be maintained as the ANSS grows. Nor is it obvious that the role of the scientist-manager can (or should) be preserved. In fact, it is not at all clear that this model applies to the larger RSNs even today. For example, the Northern California Seismic Network (NCSN) has small, but distinct groups of specialists maintaining stations, maintaining the processing system, and analyzing the data. Further, although a scientist manages the NCSN, managing the network effectively leaves little time for research. The ANSS is projected to grow to more than three times as many stations as are currently operated by all of the RSNs together and to more than ten times the number of channels. In addition, national integration means that all of these stations and channels must be considered to be part of one very large system. ANSS production inevitably will require a full time staff of dedicated specialists including field technicians, computer hardware and software maintenance personnel, programmers, data base administrators, and seismic analysts. Examining other large seismological organizations (e.g., the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) or even the National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC)) suggests that some degree of compartmentalization of personnel is inevitable and, in fact, should be planned. The NEIC experience suggests that maintaining the role of the scientist-manager is pointless. Large networks require full time management. The IRIS experience suggests that professional managers can be beneficial, providing full  90   ANSS TG v 1.0 time management for operations and freeing scientists and engineers to specialize in science and engineering. Managing the ANSS While the Technical Guidelines call for modularization of tasks to provide the flexibility ANSS will require, it doesn't discuss the organizational mechanisms that must be implemented to ensure responsiveness to both short and long-term community needs, interaction among groups of specialists, and interaction between the community and specialists. The operation and management of IRIS provides important clues about how these problems might be addressed. In fact, this is why the ANSS was organized along IRIS lines with professional management advised by a hierarchy of committees representing community interests. The National Steering Committee and the Regional Advisory Committees may be thought of as providing the long term guidance for ANSS evolution in much the same way as the IRIS Executive Committee and the Standing Committees. The IRIS experience indicates that the advice of the community is carried out more effectively if full time managers have strong geophysical backgrounds ensuring that they understand the needs and share the interests of the community. Similarly, the ANSS should look to working seismologists and engineers to fill the positions of Director and National/Regional (network) Coordinators. Of course, the ANSS also has unique management problems related to its real-time monitoring mission. Of particular concern is the ability of the ANSS to react to the community desire to focus monitoring resources on transient phenomena such as volcanic swarms or aftershock sequences. To address these issues, the ANSS organization includes the National and Regional Working Groups, a unique layer of community involvement, potentially dealing directly with day-to-day network issues. In addition, ANSS professional management should be available and responsive to the community on a day-to-day basis. The concern has been expressed that community input through the advisory committees and working groups is not as effective as the direct control of a scientist-manager. This is undoubtedly true and to some degree inevitable through the transition from a confederation of regional networks to a single national system serving the entire community. Thus far, it appears that the ANSS working groups are capable of providing the degree of ""control"" that the community desires. Undoubtedly striking the right balance between the needs of the national community and the local needs of particular institutions will be a learning experience. However, ultimately it is within the power of the community to ensure that the ANSS organizational structure evolves to meet their needs. IRIS has also addressed communication among groups of specialists. For example, the exchange of station configuration and QC information between network operations and maintenance personnel (part of the Global Seismograph Network (GSN)) and data collection personnel (part of the Data Management Center (DMC)) has been successfully institutionalized. Although IRIS chose to collocate operation and data collection groups,  91   ANSS TG v 1.0 these groups are managed separately. In addition, research feedback on data quality and data management issues has been instituted in the form of Data Problem Reports. The ANSS needs to consider institutionalizing similar types of communications to ensure the effective development and operation of the network. Finally, IRIS has addressed the issue of operational specialists providing seismologists and engineers with the information needed to make the best use of the data. For example, most global seismologists don't have a hands-on ""feel"" for the behavior of GSN field equipment. However, through workshops educating them in GSN data characteristics and direct experience with the data they have managed to adapt and to produce quality research. Similarly, the ANSS will make every attempt to provide seismologists and engineers with the information the need to make the best use of the data. Conclusion Modularizing both the organizational and technical structure of the ANSS will provide the flexibility needed to meet ANSS goals in an evolving organizational, technological, and funding environment. In particular, formally separating production and interpretation functions is the key to providing both a stable, reliable, cost effective production environment and a diverse, dynamic interpretation environment. However, this specialization of functions among modules potentially creates problems in communication and coordination between groups of specialists, in adapting production to meet short-term scientific goals during transient phenomena, and in providing scientific guidance for the evolution of the production environment. Effective strategies for dealing with some of these problems have evolved in other large-scale seismological programs. Some of these strategies have already been adopted in the ANSS management structure. The ANSS community requires that strategies already implemented are effective and that new strategies evolve as needed to ensure that the ANSS is responsive to their needs.  92"

Extensive tests of RTKGPS verified centimeter-level accuracies, effective for tracking a wide range of dynamic motions. The deployment of a system for a full-scale earthquake test in Japan demonstrated the flexibility and stability of a pilot system, while providing an otherwise unattainable data set for earthquake researchers. Why We Pursued This Research Advances in GPS technologies have made ground surface displacement measurements under static as well as dynamic conditions easier to obtain with increased accuracy and reduced costs. Limitations in conventional displacement sensors have made large-scale deformation monitoring applications challenging, such as those employed in the study of landslides and bridges. Geotechnical and structural practice increasingly demand measurements of soil mass and structure deformations (for example, landslides, lateral spreading from earthquakes, long-period bridge response during earthquakes), so the benefits of GPS in complementing more conventional instrumentation technologies appear promising, particularly in remote monitoring applications. What We Did An in-house research project was initiated a few years ago to evaluate the feasibility of studying geotechnical and structural phenomena with a GPS-based instrumentation package utilizing emerging high precision RTK-GPS and wireless Figure 2  Bench test results validate RTK-GPS methods  communications technologies. The project involved systematic validation testing, systems integration, prototype development, and, finally, a test deployment of the system in a full-scale earthquake experiment at a port facility in northern Japan in late 2001. The system was developed primarily for the remote monitoring of landslide and bridge movements. GPS field units transmit raw data wirelessly to an office PC for processing and data visualization (Fig.1). The system provides a real-time data stream of up to 20 data points per second with centimeter accuracy.  To quantify ""real-world"" performance and demonstrate the viability of RTK-GPS as a displacement measurement tool, a series of bench tests were performed, simulating the range of magnitudes, rates, and frequencies of displacements typically encountered in landslide and bridge monitoring applications. Validation test results clearly demonstrated the accuracy of RTKGPS under static and dynamic conditions (Fig.2). Figure 1  System Architecture   Two full-scale earthquake tests conducted in Japan in late 2001 provided a unique opportunity to deploy the Caltrans RTK-GPS system in a controlled test environment. The focus of the study was to collect data on the response of civil structures, Figure 3  Earthquake loads such as bridge (lateral spread) on bridge foundations, and utility pipelines during severe loading induced by earthquakes (Fig.3). Accurate measurements of ground deformations (from liquefaction and lateral spread) during the generated seismic events were a critical research component and were impossible to obtain by conventional instrumentation techniques. The Caltrans team deployed a total of twelve GPS units at the site, an area approximately 50 by 100 meters, bordered on one end by a large waterway with the soil held back by a sea wall. Explosive charges, placed in a grid pattern across the site, were used to generate the earthquake loads. Figure 5  GPS data during blasting  The Researchers Recommend Test deployments and validation testing have shown that networked RTK-GPS is a good tool for displacement measurements, and is recommended for Caltrans' instrumentation practice. Additional research into long-term performance and system maintenance issues need to be investigated in a third phase of the project. GPS technologies and products continue to improve and the Department should continue to explore the potential for other applications. A few commercially available solutions have also come to market since the project began and should be evaluated for more routine deployment.

In 2002, the estimated value1 of nonfuel raw mineral production for New York was $1.01 billion, based upon preliminary U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) data. This was about a 2% decrease from that of 20012 and followed a 1% increase from 2000 to 2001. New York was 15th in rank (13th in 2001) among the 50 States in total nonfuel mineral production value, of which the State accounted for more than 2.5% of the U.S. total. In 2002, crushed stone, by value, remained New York's leading nonfuel mineral, followed by cement (portland and masonry), salt, construction sand and gravel, and wollastonite. These five mineral commodities accounted for about 97% of the State's total nonfuel mineral production value. The State's major construction material commodities--cement, common clays, construction sand and gravel, crushed stone, and gypsum--accounted for more than 77% of the State's nonfuel mineral value. The production and value of crushed stone substantially increased in 2002, but decreases in zinc (down more than $22 million), salt, and cement were greater, descending order of value, resulting in the small net drop in value for the year. Smaller decreases occurred also in construction sand and gravel and dimension stone (table 1). The value of zinc dropped in 2002 common clays, of the continued idle status of the Balmat Mine, one of the two mines most recently producing zinc in the State (both in St. Lawrence County). Because of continued depressed prices in the zinc market, ZCA Mines Inc. temporarily had closed the mine in May 2001, after which it permanently closed its other zinc mine, the Pierrepont Mine, in August 2001. ZCA subsequently decided to dispose of its Balmat Mine assets and focus on its core business of zinc recycling. The mine remained on care and maintenance throughout 2002 awaiting sale of the property (Matthews, 2002). In 2001, New York's increase in value resulted mostly from increases in crushed stone, up $49 million, and construction sand and gravel, up $6 million, as well as a more than $3 million increase in dimension stone. These gains were moderated somewhat by significant decreases in zinc and wollastonite and a smaller decrease in salt, resulting in a small net gain for the year. Based on USGS estimates of the quantities produced in the 50 States in 2002, New York remained the only State to produce wollastonite and continued to be second of 3 industrial garnet-producing States, third in salt, and fourth in talc. While the State remained one of the top 10 portland-cement-producing States, it deceased to 10th from 9th in the production of dimension stone. Additionally, New York mining and mineral processing operations produced significant quantities of crushed stone, construction sand and gravel, masonry cement, common clays, and gypsum (descending order of value). Primary aluminum and raw steel were produced from materials obtained from other domestic and foreign sources. Based upon USGS annual data, New York, while slightly increasing production, decreased to fifth from fourth in the production of primary aluminum. The following narrative information was provided by the New York State Geological Survey (NYSGS) and the Division of Mineral Resources3 (DMR) of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). Reclamation and Environmental Issues Demand for minerals continues to grow in New York. However, new mines tend to be controversial, and it is easier for industry to expand existing operations. The DMR reported that during 2002, 423 mined land reclamation permits were issued Statewide, of which 56 were for new mines. Staff approved final reclamation of 425 hectares (ha) at 93 mines that closed and approved concurrent reclamation of an additional 151 ha at operating mines. A total of 19,000 ha is currently affected by mining, an increase of 190 ha from the previous year. Since the program's inception in 1975, a total of 8,270 ha of land has been reclaimed.  The terms ""nonfuel mineral production"" and related ""values"" encompass variations in meaning, depending upon the minerals or mineral products. Production may be measured by mine shipments, mineral commodity sales, or marketable production (including consumption by producers) as is applicable to the individual mineral commodity. All 2002 USGS mineral production data published in this chapter are preliminary estimates as of July 2003 and are expected to change. For some mineral commodities, such as construction sand and gravel, crushed stone, and portland cement, estimates are updated periodically.

Data for 2002 are preliminary and are expected to change; related rankings may also change. 3 William Kelly, Associate Director with the NYSGS (a bureau of the New York State Museum in the State Education Department), Division of Research and Collections, and Steven Potter, Mined Land Reclamation Specialist II with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Division of Mineral Resources, coauthored the text of the State mineral industry information provided by those agencies. NEW YORK--2002 34.1  1   By the end of 2002, DMR had required $87 million in financial security to guarantee reclamation of mined land. The DMR observed an increase in bond cancellations by surety companies, which may be an aftermath of September 11. There appears to be reluctance on the part of financial institutions to provide bonds or other securities for mine operations. There also is an apparent spike in transfer of ownership and permits for many operations. Zinc Corp. of America (ZCA) and its predecessors have operated zinc mines in the Balmat-Edwards area of St. Lawrence County since the first decade of the 20th century. In recent years, the company has exhausted the ore at both its Hyatt and Pierrepont Mines. The Hyatt Mine has been reclaimed and reclamation has started at the Pierrepont Mine. The Balmat No. 4 Mine was ZCA's only active operation where known reserves totaling about 1.8 million metric tons remain. Exploratory drilling was conducted in search of additional ore. During 2002, Horseheads Industries Inc., the parent company of ZCA, declared bankruptcy. ZCA indicated that OntZinc Corp. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Pan American Resources Inc.) was considering a possible purchase of ZCA. The Town of North Hempstead in Nassau County was the recipient of the 2002 New York State Mined Land Reclamation Award. More than 160 ha of an abandoned sand mine was reclaimed and transformed into one of the finest golf courses on Long Island. The designers worked closely with the National Audubon Society to meet strict standards for wildlife conservation and habitat enhancement. The course is one of only 17 Audubon Signature Facilities in the country. The town implemented a thorough water quality monitoring, management and conservation program and limited the use of fertilizers and pesticides to help minimize environmental impacts. Reclamation of this mine, formerly known as Colonial Sand and Gravel, was particularly challenging. The mine was in operation for more than a century, and sand was removed to a depth of more than 60 meters to provide construction material for New York City. The resulting topography was very rugged. When the mine was abandoned in the late 1980's, severely eroding bluffs threatened nearby property. Legislation and Government Programs Unregulated mining by Native American entities became an issue this year. Regional DMR staff monitored the transfer of active mining operations to the Oneida Indian Nation in central New York. These mines continued to operate without State oversight and have been the subject of media attention. A mine that provided construction material for the Oneida Nation's gambling casino in Oneida County had severe erosion problems that affected nearby citizens. A mine in Orleans County was involved in an experimental project using coal combustion waste (CCW) as backfill in the mine. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has proposed rulemaking that would govern the placement of CCW in mines and has reviewed several projects across the country, including New York State. This mine was the only site in New York using CCW for mine backfilling and the work proceeded under a research and demonstration permit issued by the Division of Solid and Hazardous Materials. A mining company in Tompkins County submitted a permit modification application to expand an existing underground rock salt mine from roughly 3,000 ha to 5,000 ha. DMR staff determined that no significant environmental impacts could be expected as a result of the expansion. The Mined Land Reclamation Law was amended to allow for exploration of bluestone to occur without having to go through the full mining permit process. Based on the provisions of the revised Mined Land Reclamation Law, DEC developed a Bluestone Exploration Authorization process that incorporated environmental safeguards similar to those in a Mined Land Reclamation Permit. With a Bluestone Exploration Authorization, small quantities of stone can be extracted to determine if the material is workable and marketable. A landowner or quarryman can determine whether a potential deposit is worth mining before making a significant investment of time and money to apply for a full Mined Land Reclamation Permit. Key elements of the legislation include the following: exploration site is limited to a maximum 0.4 ha (1 acre) area; stone removal may not exceed 450 metric tons per year; authorization is renewable for 1 additional year, and at the end of exploration, the site must be reclaimed or a Mined Land Reclamation Permit must be obtained. A wollastonite producer proposed a major expansion of its wollastonite mine in the Town of Lewis, Essex County. New York State is the only producer of wollastonite in the country. If the amendment to the company's mining permit is approved in its present form, the quarry would expand from 24 ha to 36 ha. The NYSGS continued bedrock and surficial geologic mapping projects in several regions of the State. Mapping priority was given to areas of expanding development surrounding urban areas and along transportation corridors. Maps were produced at a scale of 1:24,000. In 2002, digital maps were produced from seven 7.5-minute quadrangles in New York. NYSGS staff completed further mapping of volcanic ashfall layers throughout the sedimentary rocks of the Appalachian Basin from New York to Virginia to Ohio. In addition, Lower and Middle Devonian rock were the focus of study in the Appalachian Basin. This included terrestrial Devonian rocks of the Catskill Mountains of eastern New York. A bedrock geologic map and report dealing with a large portion of the Adirondack Mountains was published. The mapped area is in the west-central Adirondacks, centered on the Fulton Chain-of-Lakes region. It is a single-sheet map comprising six 15-minute quadrangles. Efforts continued to identify suitable geologic formations for the disposal of brine generated by the creation of caverns for the storage of natural gas. Brine disposal is the last barrier to gas storage development in artificial caverns in evaporite deposits 34.2 U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY MINERALS YEARBOOK--2002   underlying New York. Cavern storage has been found to be a very efficient means of providing natural gas, especially for demand peaks that occur on a daily basis. Further, cavern storage offers economic incentives for electrical generating companies and natural gas suppliers to purchase large quantities of gas during periods of low demand for use during the winter months. Current research (2002) is focused on the Late Ordovician Queenston Formation.

GX018-68-16479260	"9. PLUTONIUM ACQUISITIONS               The total DOE plutonium acquisitions for the period 1944 to September 30, 1994, were 111.4 metric tons. Of the 111.4 MT plutonium acquired, 104 MT were produced in Government reactors; 103.4 MT in production reactors, and 0.6 MT in nonproduction reactors. In addition, 1.7 MT were acquired from U.S. civilian industry, and 5.7 MT from foreign countries. This section describes each of the acquisition categories in detail.  It should be noted that the acquisitions detailed in this report do not include small quantities of plutonium received from foreign governments under Military Agreements for Cooperation per Section 91C of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. These transactions remain classified for national security reasons and are not discussed in this report.  As a result of treaty obligations, legislation, and intergovernmental policy decisions, some nonweapon grade plutonium acquired from U.S. civilian and foreign sources has been designated ""restricted use"" plutonium. Restricted use plutonium cannot be used in nuclear weapons. Restricted use plutonium is located primarily at the Hanford Site, the Savannah River Site, the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory facilities, and the Argonne National Laboratory West.  Figure 5  shows a comparison of the quantities of plutonium received from the four acquisitions categories that are used in this report.  9.1 GOVERNMENT PRODUCTION REACTORS               The United States Government has used 14 plutonium production reactors at the Hanford and Savannah River sites to produce plutonium for the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile and DOE research and development programs. From 1944 to 1994, these reactors produced 103.4  [note 12]  metric tons of plutonium; 67.4 MT at Hanford, and 36.1 at Savannah River.    9.1.1 Hanford Reactors               Nine production reactors were built at the Hanford Site between 1944 and 1963. All were graphite moderated, light-water cooled reactors located in the north sector of the Site along the Columbia River. The first eight had single-pass (once-through) cooling systems, while the ninth, N-Reactor, had a recirculating primary coolant system and operated at higher pressures and coolant temperatures than the older reactors.  The chief product of the Hanford reactors was weapon grade plutonium, however, non-weapon grade plutonium and occasionally Tritium, Polonium-210, Uranium-233, Thulium-170, Iridium-192, and other special use isotopes were also produced. Specific dates of operations of the Hanford production reactors follow:  Name   Start-Up Date   Shutdown Date     B-Reactor   September 1944   February 1968     D-Reactor   December 1944   June 1967     F-Reactor   February 1945   June 1965     H-Reactor   October 1949   April 1965     DR-Reactor   October 1950   December 1964     C-Reactor   November 1952   April 1969     KW-Reactor   January 1955   February 1970     KE-Reactor   April 1955   January 1971     N-Reactor   December 1963   January 1987        The Hanford B, D, F and DR-Reactors were designed to operate at 250 megawatts (MW) thermal. H-Reactor was designed to operate at 400 MW, C-Reactor at 650 MW, and KW and KE-Reactors at 1800 MW each. N-Reactor was designed to operate at 4000 MW.  In the 1950's, major upgrades were made at the first eight Hanford reactors to increase production. By the early 1960's, the following power levels had been achieved and sustained: 2210 MW at B-Reactor, 2165 MW at D-Reactor, 2040 MW at F-Reactor, 2140 MW at H-Reactor, 2015 MW at DR-Reactor, 2500 MW at C-Reactor, and 4400 MW each at KE and KW-Reactors. However, an administrative power limit of 4000 MW was imposed by the Atomic Energy Commission at the KE and KW-Reactors.  N-Reactor's power level did not change substantially over the years, and in 1966 a generating plant was constructed to convert part of the reactor's heat output to the production of electricity.  The Hanford reactors produced 67.4 metric tons of plutonium including 54.5 MT of weapon grade plutonium through 1987 before the last Hanford production reactor was shutdown. The annual fiscal year Hanford production is presented in  Figure 6  and  Table 2.     Hanford Fuel Segregation Program               In the mid-1980's, to increase the availability of weapon grade plutonium, Hanford initiated the Fuel Segregation Program. This program took advantage of the fact that some of the fuel assemblies discharged during the N-Reactor fuel grade campaigns contained weapon grade plutonium.  Plutonium production is based on fuel exposure by neutron bombardment, the amount of time that fuel is in a reactor, reactor heat/power operating conditions and the location of the fuel within the reactor. The neutron flux produced in a reactor varies across the reactor core. The exposure received by a fuel element at the end of a given tube will be different from the exposure received in the middle of the tube, where fuel irradiation is most concentrated.  Neutron flux variations also occurs between fuel elements having different positions within a reactor. Therefore, even if a reactor is operating in a fuel grade plutonium production mode, flux variations will cause the irradiated fuel to contain some weapons grade plutonium. By using special measuring instruments and understanding of the above reactor properties, weapon grade plutonium was identified and chemically separated from the irradiated fuel.  From 1983 through 1984 Hanford extracted approximately 425 kg of weapon grade plutonium by the Fuel Segregation Program. While sorting increased the weapon grade plutonium inventory by 425 kg of plutonium, it also decreased the fuel grade plutonium by an equivalent amount.    9.1.2 Savannah River Site Reactor               Five heavy water production reactors were built at the Savannah River Site (SRS) near Aiken, South Carolina between 1953 and 1955. The production reactors used heavy water as a moderator primary cooling medium. The primary coolant was completely contained in the reactor building. Heat was extracted through the use of heat exchangers cooled by water from the Savannah River.  Through 1988, the Savannah River reactors produced 36.1 metric tons of plutonium. The Savannah River production by fiscal year is presented in  Figure 7  and  Table 3.   While the main products of the Savannah River reactors were weapon grade plutonium and tritium, a variety of isotope products including Uranium-233, Americium-242, Curium-244, Polonium-210, Cobalt-60, Plutonium-238, Plutonium-242, and Californium-252 were also produced.  The order and dates of operations of the production reactors at the Savannah River Site are as follows:  Name   Start-Up Date   Shutdown Date     R-Reactor   December 1953   June 1964     P-Reactor   February 1954   August 1988     K-Reactor   October 1954   Standby July 1992     L-Reactor   July 1954   June 1988     C-Reactor   March 1955   June 1985        The five Savannah River reactors each were originally designed to operate at less than 500 megawatts (MW) thermal. During the period from 1955 through 1965, the thermal power levels of the reactors were increased to approximately 2500 MW by engineering enhancements such as installing larger pumps, more heat exchangers, larger pipes and optimizing the reactor physics, internal coolant flow designs and improved fuel element designs. Currently all reactors are shut down except for K-Reactor which is being maintained in cold standby, as a near term contingency for tritium production.    Blending    The Savannah River reactors produced primarily weapon grade plutonium with a Pu-240 content of about 6 percent. Starting in 1981, to increase the availability of plutonium for the weapons program, the Savannah River P, K, C-Reactors were operated to produce weapon grade plutonium with a 3 percent Pu-240 content. This method of operating accelerated reactor operations, decreased target irradiation time, and increased fuel throughput.  From 1982 through 1990 the DOE was able to convert approximately 2.8 MT of fuel grade plutonium to weapon grade by blending the 3 percent Pu-240 with fuel grade plutonium. While blending increased the weapon grade plutonium inventory by 2.8 MT of plutonium, it also decreased the fuel grade plutonium by an equivalent amount. Of the 2.8 MT of fuel grade plutonium blended to weapon grade, 2.4 MT was blended at Savannah River, and 0.4 MT at Hanford.    9.2 GOVERNMENT NONPRODUCTION REACTORS               The reactors in this category were not operated to produce plutonium, but rather were U.S. military reactors, government experimental power-reactors, government power reactors, naval propulsion reactors, and government test and research reactors. They included several DOE-owned and public utility-operated prototype reactors.  From 1952 to 1994 the nonproduction reactors, while operating to meet their respective missions, produced a total of 0.6 metric tons of plutonium; 0.1 MT weapon grade plutonium and 0.5 MT fuel grade plutonium. Quantities of plutonium produced in Government nonproduction reactors are shown by fiscal year in  Figure 8  and  Table 4.   Examples of nonproduction reactors that produced plutonium include the Experimental Breeder Reactor No. 2 in Idaho, the Fast Flux Test Facility at Hanford, the Shippingport Reactor in Pennsylvania, the La Crosse Boiling Water Reactor in Wisconsin, the Boiling Nuclear Superheat Reactor in Puerto Rico and the NS Savannah, the only U.S. cargo-passenger ship to be driven by nuclear power.  A complete listing of AEC, ERDA, DOE and DoD reactors including location, type, power, and operating time frames can be found in the report,  Nuclear Reactors Built, Being Built, or Planned , DOE/OSTI-8200 (Revision 58) August 1995.    9.3 U.S. CIVILIAN INDUSTRY               The U.S. Civilian Industry category is primarily comprised of plutonium purchased by the Department from civilian power reactor operators under the Plutonium Credit Activity and other U.S. civilian acquisitions.  A total of 1.7 metric tons of fuel grade plutonium was acquired under this category; 0.9 from the Plutonium Credit Activity, and 0.8 from other civilian acquisitions. Through 1983, this plutonium could be used in nuclear weapons activities. After 1983, legislation restricted the use of plutonium acquired from U.S. civilian industry to non-weapon activities.    9.3.1 Plutonium Credit Activity               In the 1950's, commercial utilities began returning spent fuel to the AEC under a program called the Plutonium Credit Activity. This program, established by the U.S. Congress in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, provided ""credit"" for plutonium produced in commercial nuclear reactors operating on uranium fuel purchased or leased from the AEC. Although the uranium in the civilian power reactor industry in the 1950's and early 1960's was owned by the AEC and leased to the utility companies, the plutonium produced during operation of these reactors was owned by the utility companies.  The U.S. Government paid the utilities $10.4 million for approximately 0.9 MT of plutonium. Most of the plutonium purchased under the Plutonium Credit Activity was reprocessed at Nuclear Fuels Services (NFS) West Valley. NFS West Valley, located near Buffalo, New York, was the only private facility in the U.S. to reprocess spent nuclear fuel. In addition to commercial spent fuel, NFS West Valley also reprocessed government owned spent fuel and liquid residues.      Of the 0.9 MT of plutonium, 895 kg  was reprocessed at NFS West Valley, and subsequently shipped to the Hanford site as plutonium nitrate solution. Quantities of plutonium received by DOE from NFS West Valley are shown by source in  Table 5.   In addition,  2.5 kg came from the Vallecitos Boiling Water Reactor and was reprocessed at the Savannah River Site.     Additional information on NFS West Valley is available in the DOE report,  Plutonium Recovery from Spent Fuel Reprocessing by Nuclear Fuel Services at West Valley, New York from 1966 to 1972 , February 1996.    9.3.2 Other U.S. Civilian Acquisitions               In addition to the plutonium purchased under the Plutonium Credit Activity, the DOE received an additional 0.8 metric tons of fuel grade plutonium from other U.S. civilian sources.  Of the 0.8 metric tons plutonium received, 0.7 MT was in spent fuel. Most of this material was received for storage and monitoring, and eventual disposal. Almost all of this spent fuel is currently stored at three facilities, the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, the Savannah River Site, and at the West Valley Demonstration Project. As shown in  Table 6,  the spent fuel came from U.S. commercial light-water reactors, one-of-a-kind commercial reactors, and special fuels associated with universities, and private industry.      The major sources of spent nuclear fuel were the Florida Power and Light Company, Turkey Point reactor (66 kg of plutonium); Virginia Electric Company, Surry 1 & 2 reactors (267 kg); and GPU Nuclear Corporation, Three Mile Island 2 reactor (158 kg).  Smaller amounts of plutonium in spent fuel were received from other reactors including: the Omaha Public Power Company, Fort Calhoun 1 reactor; Wisconsin Electric Power Company, Point Beach 1 reactor; Connecticut Yankee Company, Haddem Neck reactor; and the Power Reactor Development Company, Enrico Fermi reactor.     In addition to spent nuclear fuel, the DOE also received 0.1 MT plutonium from commercial industry, universities, and hospitals, primarily in the form of scrap, sources, and mixed oxides. Generally, these were the return of U.S. Government plutonium that had been previously transferred to industry under various agreements.    9.4 FOREIGN COUNTRIES               This category consists of plutonium received by barter under the 1958 U.S. and U.K. Mutual Defense Agreement, as well as plutonium received from foreign countries under Agreements for Cooperation for the peaceful uses of atomic energy. Total plutonium received from foreign countries was 5.7  [note 20]  metric tons of primarily fuel grade plutonium; 5.4 MT under the Mutual Defense Agreement with the United Kingdom, and 0.4 MT from Agreements for Cooperation.    9.4.1 Mutual Defense Agreement between the U.S. and the U.K.               Under the Mutual Defense Agreement with the United Kingdom from 1959 to 1980, the United States acquired a total of 5.4 MT of plutonium (5360 kilograms) in exchange for 6.7 kilograms of tritium and 7.5 MT of highly enriched uranium.    9.4.2 Agreements for Cooperation               Programs for international cooperation in the peaceful uses of atomic energy are carried out largely through Agreements for Cooperation with the IAEA, the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), and through bilateral agreements with other countries, as authorized by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. Under these programs, the Department exchanged information on peaceful uses of nuclear materials with other nations and provided chemical reprocessing services to foreign countries.  A total of 0.4 metric tons of plutonium were obtained under these agreements, including 254 kg of plutonium from Canada, 79 kg of plutonium from Taiwan, and 50 kg from others.      Of the 254 kg plutonium received under bilateral agreements with Canada, 252 kg were in spent fuel.  The spent fuel was received at the Savannah River Site from 1959 to 1964,  and processed.  The remaining 2 kg of plutonium were received primarily at Hanford  from 1962 to 1985, and consisted of oxides and sources.   Of the 79 kg plutonium received under bilateral agreements with Taiwan, 78 kg were in spent fuel from the Taiwan Research Reactor.  The spent fuel was received at the Savannah River Site, and 63 kg of plutonium were processed.  The remaining 1 kg of plutonium was acquired in 1978 and is stored at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.  The remaining 50 kg of plutonium were received from 13 other countries including Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.  Generally, these smaller quantities were the return of U.S. plutonium that had been previously transferred to these countries under various agreements.     Quantities of plutonium received under international agreements for cooperation for the peaceful uses of atomic energy are shown by country in  Table 7  and by year in  Table 8.

GX251-16-16388280	"T  HE  MINERAL I  NDUSTRY OF  GEORGIA  This chapter has been prepared under a Memorandum of Understanding between the U.S. Geological Survey and the Georgia Geologic Survey for collecting information on all nonfuel minerals. In 1999, the preliminary estimated value1 of nonfuel mineral production for Georgia was $1.84 billion, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). This was about a 7% increase from that of 1998,2 following a 2.4% increase from 1997 to 1998. The State rose in rank to fifth from seventh among the 50 States in total nonfuel mineral production value, of which Georgia accounted for more than 4.5% of the U.S. total. Georgia was by far the leading clay-producing State in the Nation, accounting for about 26% of total U.S. clay production. Kaolin remained the State's foremost nonfuel mineral commodity in 1999, accounting for almost 58% of Georgia's estimated total nonfuel mineral value and, of that, about 93% of its clay value; crushed stone was second, accounting for more than 26% of Georgia's nonfuel mineral value. In 1999, nearly all nonfuel mineral commodities increased in value, led by a $62 million, or 6%, increase in the value of kaolin and a $43 million, or nearly 10%, increase in the value of crushed stone. Smaller yet significant increases (listed largest to smallest) occurred in construction sand and gravel, dimension stone, and portland cement; only barite, common clays, and fuller's earth showed decreased values, all of which were relatively small. In 1998, increases in kaolin, crushed stone, fuller's earth, and masonry cement led the State's increase in value; only common clay, down $6.1 million, showed any significant decrease in value for the year (table 1). Based upon USGS estimates of the quantities produced in the United States during 1999, Georgia remained first among the 50 States in kaolin and fuller's earth; second in crude mica and second of two barite-producing States; third in iron oxide pigments; fourth in crushed stone, common clays, and feldspar; and ninth in masonry cement. Georgia rose to third from fifth in the production of dimension stone. Additionally, the State was a significant producer of portland cement and industrial sand and gravel. _____________ 1  The terms ""nonfuel mineral production"" and related ""values"" encompass variations in meaning, depending upon the minerals or mineral products. Production may be measured by mine shipments, mineral commodity sales, or marketable production (including consumption by producers) as is applicable to the individual mineral commodity. All 1999 USGS mineral production data published in this chapter are preliminary estimates as of May 2000, and are expected to change. For some mineral commodities (for example, construction sand and gravel, crushed stone, and portland cement), estimates are updated periodically.

Data for 1999 are preliminary and expected to change, while related rankings may also be subject to change. GEORGIA--1999  The following narrative information was provided by the Georgia Geologic Survey, 3 in cooperation with representatives of Elberton Granite Association, the Georgia Mining Association, and the Georgia Crushed Stone Association . The industrial rocks and minerals mined in Georgia reflect the geologic diversity of the State's four major physiographic provinces. In the Valley and Ridge Province, limestones and shales are used for aggregate, portland cement, common brick, and floor tile manufacture. In addition, slate is crushed for aggregate and filler. Barite and iron oxide pigments (ochre and umber) are mined from weathered dolomitic rocks in the Cartersville District. In the Blue Ridge and Piedmont Provinces, igneous and metamorphic rocks (mostly gneiss and granite) are extensively mined for crushed and dimension stone as well as for feldspar, marble, scrap mica, and residual clay (for brick and portland cement.) Kyanite has been previously mined in these provinces. Sedimentary strata of the Coastal Plain province contain most of Georgia's various clay resources (common clay, fuller's earth, and kaolin), construction and industrial sand and gravel, and soft limestone (for aggregate and cement). Pleistocene barrier island sands in southeast Georgia have been mined for heavy minerals (ilmenite, leucoxene, monazite, rutile, and zircon). Throughout the State, local alluvial sand and gravel deposits are mined for aggregate. Georgia's industrial minerals industry is dominated by kaolin, which in 1998 accounted for more than one-half of production value. Nearly all of the kaolin is mined in the Georgia Kaolin District. Approximately 72% of production is for coating and filling in paper manufacture. The remainder is used in the manufacture of various glass and ceramic products, and as fillers, extenders, and binders in adhesives, paints, plastics, and rubber. Leading kaolin producers are Imerys (formerly Imetal SA, France), Engelhard Corp., Thiele Kaolin Co., and J.M. Huber Corp. In 1999, Imerys purchased most of ECC International Ltd., one of Georgia's leading kaolin producers. J.M. Huber acquired the remainder of ECC. Global Industrial Technologies Inc. acquired A.P. Green Industries Inc., and United Catalysts Inc. purchased Evans Clay Co. The kaolin industry employs approximately 4,200 mine and plant personnel plus an additional 3,000 contractors. Kaolin exports increased by 2%, and kaolin was the leading export commodity out of the port of Savannah in 1998. Overall, the industry is strong; however, prospects for future growth are limited due to 1%-growth worldwide in recent years and widespread overcapacity of paper plants (which consume nearly 80% of all kaolin). Georgia kaolin faces increasing competition in many foreign markets. For example, Brazilian kaolin represents strong competition in European markets and is now being imported into North America. _____________ 3  Bruce J. O'Connor, Principal Geologist, authored the text of mineral industry information submitted by the Georgia Geologic Survey. 12.1   The crushed stone industry opened five new quarries and shipped a record high of approximately 70 million metric tons of crushed stone. A 70% increase in Federal funding (to $1 billion per year) for Georgia highway construction may fuel increased highway construction, which accounts for the largest portion of the crushed stone market. Air quality problems in the 13-county metropolitan Atlanta area have resulted in a moratorium on new highway construction and improvements. This limitation is offset by the significant increase in consumption that is anticipated outside the Atlanta region due to the Governor's program of rural highway improvement. As a result, crushed stone production in 2000 is expected to be similar to 1999. The major crushed stone companies in the State are Hanson Building Materials America, Martin Marietta Aggregates, Vulcan Materials Co., and Blue Circle Aggregates Inc. In 1999, Vulcan acquired Colwell Construction Co., Inc., which operated three quarries in the Blue Ridge Province. In addition, all of the quarries operated by Benchmark Materials (a subsidiary of Beazer PLC), including those formerly owned by Davidson Mineral Properties and Stone Man, Inc. were consolidated into Hanson. Georgia's dimension granite industry is concentrated in the Elberton District. During 1998, there were approximately 44 active quarries producing monument-grade granite. The industry employs approximately 2,400 individuals, including a quarry work force of 280. In 1998, the total industry payroll was $53.9 million, while the quarry payroll was $6.8 million. Local sales of granite were stable in 1998, and demand for curbing stone for markets in the northeastern United States continued to be very strong. Sales to Pacific Rim markets  declined substantially due to new domination by nearly identical stone from China. The major dimension stone companies are Star Granite Co., Keystone Memorials Co., Central Granite Co., and Georgia Structural Stone Inc. In 1999, two Georgia quarries owned by Georgia Stone Industries Inc. were purchased by Georgia Structural Stone. Keystone purchased the Georgia quarries from Rock of Ages Corp. Two distinct types of fuller's earth clay are mined in the Coastal Plain Province. Attapulgite (palygorskite-sepiolite) clay is mined in the Meigs-Attapulgus District, and montmorillonite clay is mined in the area of the Georgia Kaolin District. The clay is used for absorbents (including pet litter), petroleum cracking catalysts, paints, pharmaceuticals, carriers for various chemicals, drilling mud, and portland cement manufacture. Principal producers are A & M Products and Oil-Dry Corp. World class deposits of high-quality marble are in the Tate District north of Atlanta. The area produces dimension stone for the monument and decorative stone market, crushed stone for aggregate, and ground high-purity, high-calcium marble for various filler and extender applications. In 1999, Imerys acquired Georgia Marble Co., which had dominated the marble industry in Georgia for decades. Mining in Georgia is regulated at the State level by the Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division. Permitting is a one-stop process that covers all air emission, water quality, and mine reclamation issues. Public concern is increasingly focused on airborne dust as well as surface- and ground water pollution. As a result, new crushed stone quarries, for example, require paved haul roads and crusher enclosures to meet dust emission standards.

GX251-42-7893703	"T  HE  M  INERAL INDUSTRY OF  N  EW  Y  ORK  This chapter has been prepared under a Memorandum of Understanding between the U.S. Geological Survey and the New York State Geological Survey for collecting information on all nonfuel minerals. In 2000, the estimated value1 of nonfuel mineral production for New York was $1 billion, based upon preliminary U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) data. This was a marginal increase from that of 19992 and followed a 2.6% increase from 1998 to 1999. New York continued to be 15th in rank among the 50 States in total nonfuel mineral production value, of which the State accounted for about 2.5% of the U.S. total. In 2000, crushed stone, by value, remained New York's leading nonfuel mineral, followed by cement (portland and masonry), salt, construction sand and gravel, and zinc. Increases in the values of all five commodities, which together accounted for about 90% of the State's total nonfuel mineral production value, led to the State's overall rise in value. Zinc represented the major portion of New York's metal production and value. The State's major construction material commodities--crushed stone, cement, construction sand and gravel, and gypsum--accounted for about 66% of the State's nonfuel mineral value. In 1999, New York's increase in value resulted mostly from increases in cement, gypsum, and salt, moderated somewhat by decreases in the values of crushed stone, construction sand and gravel, zinc, and wollastonite (descending order of change in value) (table 1). All other changes had little effect on the overall net result. Based on USGS estimates of the quantities produced in the 50 States in 1999, New York remained the only State to produce wollastonite and continued to be fourth in zinc and talc. While the State increased in rank to 3d from 4th in the production of salt, to 7th from 9th in dimension stone, and to 10th from 11th in masonry cement, it decreased to 2d from 1st of three industrial garnet-producing States and to 10th from 9th in portland cement. Additionally, New York mining and mineral processing operations produced significant quantities of crushed _____________ 1 The terms ""nonfuel mineral production"" and related ""values"" encompass variations in meaning, depending upon the minerals or mineral products. Production may be measured by mine shipments, mineral commodity sales, or marketable production (including consumption by producers) as is applicable to the individual mineral commodity. All 2000 USGS mineral production data published in this chapter are preliminary estimates as of July 2001 and are expected to change. For some mineral commodities, such as construction sand and gravel, crushed stone, and portland cement, estimates are updated periodically. To obtain the most current information, please contact the appropriate USGS mineral commodity specialist.

The following narrative information was provided by the New York State Geological Survey (NYSGS) and the Division of Mineral Resources3 (DMR) of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. The DMR reported that there were 2,475 mines active in New York in 2000. These mines affected 19,774 hectares (ha). During the year, 116 ha were reclaimed for a total of 7,279 ha reclaimed since the inception of the Mined Land Reclamation Program in 1975. Of the total number of mines statewide, 1,837 were operated by industry, and 638 were operated by governmental agencies. The majority of mines (901) affected parcels of land from 0 to 2 ha; mines affecting 2 to 4 ha were second most abundant. Mines affecting 4 to 8 ha were 436. Those of 8 to 12 ha numbered 155, and 295 were greater than 12 ha. Minor projects accounted for the rest of the total. During the year, 361 mining permits were issued, of which 71 were for new mining projects. Total value of reclamation security held by New York State in 2000 was about $77.1 million. The winner of the New York State 1999 Annual Reclamation Award, Porter's Concrete Service, Inc., won a national reclamation award from the Interstate Mining Compact Commission (IMCC). Porter won a special small operator award from the IMCC for its innovative reclamation at its Barton and Waverly Mines in Tioga County. AKZO Nobel Salt Inc. (Akzo) was presented the annual New York State Mined Land Reclamation Award for the closure and restoration of its underground salt mine in Livingston County. Akzo also won the National Association of State Land Reclamationists Award for 2000. Final reclamation of the largest sand pit in the New York State was completed. This mine, in North Hemstead on Long Island, once supplied large amounts of material to Manhattan and the New York City metropolitan area. A golf course will be constructed on the site of the former mine. Noise and visual impacts emerged as the most significant environmental issues involved in the application of St. Lawrence Cement Co. for a proposed new $300 million cement plant to be located in the middle of an existing quarry in Hudson, NY. Current plans call for a plant that is 107 meters in height and that will operate 24 hours per day in an area where there is no history of nighttime operations. Negotiations with State and local agencies continued. The NYSGS continued bedrock and surficial geologic mapping projects in several regions of the State. Mapping priority is given to areas in which expanding development surrounding urban areas and along transportation corridors drives the need for an understanding of mineral resources, among other topics. Maps are produced at a scale of 1:24,000. _____________ 3 William Kelly, Associate Scientist with the NYSGS (a bureau of the New York State Museum in the State Education Department), Division of Research and Collections, and Steven Potter, Mined Land Reclamation Specialist II with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, DMR, coauthored the text of mineral industry information submitted by those agencies. 34.1  NEW YORK--2000   In 2000, four quadrangles in eastern, central, and western New York were mapped. Geologists in the Division of Research and Collections of the New York State Museum, an affiliate of the NYSGS, began investigations into lower Paleozoic  hydrothermal dolomite formations. These have the potential to be significant reservoirs of natural gas in New York State. Test wells yielded production far exceeding typical New York gas wells.

GX019-05-7942130	"Plutonium Recovery from Spent Fuel Reprocessing by Nuclear Fuel Services at West Valley, New York from 1966 to 1972    Prepared by U.S. Department of Energy, February 1996       Table of Contents    Executive Summary     Purpose     Background     NFS West Valley Reprocessing Campaigns     NFS West Valley Plutonium Shipments to the AEC     NFS West Valley Plutonium Shipments to Others     Note        Executive Summary             This report provides a detailed accounting of the separated plutonium received by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), a predecessor to the Department of Energy (DOE), from Nuclear Fuel Services (NFS), which operated a commercial spent fuel reprocessing facility located near West Valley, New York, 35 miles south of Buffalo. The NFS facility was the first and only private plant in the U.S. to reprocess spent nuclear fuel. NFS began receiving spent nuclear fuel at West Valley in 1965, and operated the facility from 1966 to 1972 to chemically separate and recover plutonium and uranium from the fuel.  In total, the plant recovered 1926 kilograms (kg) of plutonium and shipped almost 80% of the material (1530 kg) to the AEC. The remaining plutonium, 396 kg, either was retained by the utility companies, sold to industry by the utilities, or purchased by NFS and later re-sold to industry for use in plutonium recycle operations.  Of the 1530 kg of separated plutonium received by the AEC from the NFS West Valley facility, 635 kg originated from fuel or reactors that were AEC-owned and 895 kg came from commercial power- reactor fuel. The AEC purchased the 895 kg of commercial power-reactor plutonium from the utility companies under a program named the Plutonium Credit Activity which was established by the U.S. Congress in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.      Of the 635 kg of AEC-origin plutonium, most came from N-Reactor, a plutonium production reactor at the Hanford site near Richland, Washington.  Specifically, 534 kg of plutonium came from N-Reactor, 95 kg from the Nuclear Fuels Services facility in Erwin, Tennessee, and 6 kg from the Bonus Reactor, an AEC-owned demonstration reactor in Puerto Rico.   Of the 895 kg of separated plutonium purchased by the AEC from the utility companies, 436 kg was from Yankee Atomic Electric Company (Yankee Rowe), 285 kg from Commonwealth Edison Company (Dresden-1), 63 kg from Consumers Power Company (Big Rock Point), 7 kg from Northern States Power Company (Pathfinder), and 104 kg from Consolidated Edison Company (Indian Point-1).      All of the AEC-owned and -purchased plutonium was shipped as plutonium nitrate solution from NFS to the Hanford site. These shipments were made by commercial truck in accordance with applicable transportation regulations. Most of the plutonium received by the AEC from NFS was used in breeder reactor and zero-power reactor programs. To meet the isotopic and physical requirements for these programs, the NFS plutonium was blended with other plutonium and converted to either metal or oxide. The isotopic composition of the power reactor plutonium generally precluded its use in weapons production, even after blending, and there is no indication that blending occurred for that purpose.    Purpose             The purpose of this report is to provide a detailed account of the separated plutonium received by the AEC from NFS, a commercial spent fuel reprocessing facility located near West Valley, New York, 35 miles south of Buffalo. This document is part of a larger effort to respond to the Secretary of Energy's June 27, 1994, announced goal to declassify and release detailed plutonium information (See the DOE report,  Plutonium: the First 50 Years,  February 1996). This report is the first comprehensive look at NFS West Valley reprocessing operations and is the result of an exhaustive search of open literature, historical memoranda, and nuclear material accountability records.    Background             In 1953, the U.S. announced the Atoms for Peace Program. This program signaled a shift in U.S. policy from closely guarding all information about nuclear science to encouraging peaceful uses of nuclear energy at home and abroad. The agreements implementing this program allowed a sharing of information about industrial applications of nuclear energy, including nuclear fuel reprocessing techniques, while discouraging nuclear weapons proliferation. This change in U.S. policy set the stage for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT).      The IAEA was established in the late 1950s to encourage the use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and to provide safeguards against proliferation; the safeguards were designed to detect, rather than to prevent, the diversion of nuclear materials.   The NPT was ratified in 1968 and became effective in 1970, and in 1995 the NPT was extended indefinitely.  Currently, more than 170 nations are adherents to this treaty.  The NPT provides for the right of each participant to engage in peaceful nuclear activities, including spent fuel reprocessing.  Nations not already in possession of nuclear weapons agreed not to develop themand to accept IAEA-directed safeguards for all peaceful nuclear activities under their control.      The objective of the Atoms for Peace Program was to promote the domestic and international exploration, development, and advancement of the technology necessary to build and operate reliable, economic nuclear power plants; to provide cooperative assistance in establishing a self-sufficient nuclear power industry; and to ensure the development and use of nuclear energy in electric power production and salt water desalination.  To insure a self-sufficient, domestic commercial nuclear power industry, the AEC encouraged the transfer of nuclear fuel reprocessing from the federal government to private industry. As a result of this policy, three commercial reprocessing facilities were built in the U.S.: General Electric s Midwest Fuel Recovery Plant at Morris, Illinois; Allied General Nuclear Services (AGNS) plant at Barnwell, South Carolina; Nuclear Fuel Service's facility located near West Valley, New York.  Optimism about the future growth of the nuclear industry led the State of New York to set aside 3345 acres near West Valley, New York, and to encourage nuclear industries to locate there. Although fuel reprocessing had been practiced in the U.S. since 1944, large-scale fuel reprocessing in the U.S. had been conducted only at DOE facilities in Idaho, South Carolina, and Washington State, until NFS began operations at West Valley, NY.  The NFS West Valley facility was the first and only private plant in the U.S. to reprocess spent nuclear fuel. The NFS facility was a PUREX (Plutonium Uranium Extraction) process plant with a design capacity of 300 tons of fuel per year. The PUREX process included storing spent fuel assemblies; chopping the assembly rods; dissolving the uranium, plutonium, and radioactive products in acid; separating and storing the radioactive wastes, and separating uranium nitrate from plutonium nitrate. Two other commercial reprocessing facilities were built in the United States, but never operated.      The General Electric's Midwest Fuel Recovery Plant (also 300 tons per year) at Morris, Illinois, adjacent to the site of the Commonwealth Edison Company Dresden reactors, was completed at a cost of $64 million but was declared inoperable in 1974.   In 1970, Allied General Nuclear Services (AGNS) began construction of a 1500 tons per year reprocessing plant at Barnwell, South Carolina, adjacent to the DOE Savannah River site.  The Barnwell facility was due to begin operation in 1974, but following delays in construction and licensing, it still had not been completed or licensed when in 1977 President Carter decided to defer indefinitely all reprocessing of commercial irradiated fuel.      In the spring of 1963, the AEC issued the necessary permits to NFS, a subsidiary of the W.R. Grace Company (NFS was acquired by the Getty Oil Company in 1969), to begin construction of a fuel reprocessing facility. NFS was granted a license on May 27, 1965 to receive and store fuel at its reprocessing facility in West Valley. The first shipment of fuel, from the Yankee Rowe reactor in Massachusetts, was placed in the fuel storage pool at West Valley on June 5, 1965. Government and commercially-generated fuel continued to be received at NFS until 1973. There were a total of 756 truck and rail shipments.  The AEC encouraged NFS to focus on commercial fuel reprocessing; however, the AEC guaranteed a minimum quantity of government fuel to NFS in the absence of sufficient commercial supplies. Sufficient commercial supplies were not available because there were not many operating commercial reactors during the NFS reprocessing period of 1966 to 1972. As a result, approximately 60% of the facility's supply of fuel and 33% of the plutonium came from AEC reactors. Specifically, a majority of this came from N-Reactor.  In 1972, NFS (now owned by the Getty Oil Company) halted all reprocessing operations in order to increase reprocessing capacity, and to alter the facility to meet new regulatory requirements. However, subsequent difficulties were encountered in retrofitting the facility to meet these requirements and, after four years of fruitless negotiations with federal and state regulatory authorities, NFS announced its intention to cease reprocessing operations and transfer the management and long-term storage of approximately 600,000 gallons of high-level radioactive liquids and sludges at the West Valley Site to the site's landlord, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority. This transfer was in accordance with contractual obligations.  By 1980, the West Valley Demonstration Project Act (WVDPA) (Public Law 96-368) directed the DOE to solidify the high-level radioactive waste at West Valley to borosilicate glass, suitable for permanent storage in an approved federal repository. The WVDPA also directed the Department to decontaminate and decommission the tanks and facilities used at West Valley, and dispose of the low-level and transuranic wastes.  The West Valley Nuclear Services Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Westinghouse Electric Corporation, was selected in 1981 as the prime contractor for the WVDPA. West Valley Nuclear Services Company has operated the West Valley site for the U.S. Department of Energy since 1982.    NFS West Valley Reprocessing Campaigns          There were a total of 27 processing campaigns performed at West Valley, however, only the first 26 campaigns reprocessed intact reactor fuel. The last campaign involved processing liquid residues received from Nuclear Fuels Services facility in Erwin, Tennessee, generated during the fabrication of fuel for the SEFOR reactor.  Table 1  provides a summary of the NFS fuel reprocessing campaigns including the amount of plutonium recovered. The material reprocessed by NFS, summarized by source in  Table 2,  was both government and commercially-generated. In both tables the quantities of ""Plutonium Received"" were based on shipper's data, i.e., theoretical calculations of plutonium produced in the reactors.  The ""Recovered Plutonium"" is the actual amount of plutonium recovered by NFS. The difference between the often imprecise theoretical calculations of plutonium produced in reactors versus the measurement of the amount actually recovered is called an inventory difference. When the recovered amount is larger than the received amount, the shipper may have under estimated the amount of plutonium produced in the reactor.  Other factors that contribute to the difference between received and recovered plutonium include the measurement uncertainty, process holdup, and normal operating losses/ measured discards. Normal operating losses/measured discards occur when known quantities of plutonium are intentionally removed from the inventory because they are technically or economically unrecoverable and are disposed of by approved methods. Two examples of normal operating losses are liquid discards to waste storage tanks, and solid waste packaged in drums and crates awaiting shipment to waste disposal facilities generically referred to as ""burial sites."" Examples of plutonium-bearing items sent to burial sites include discarded piping, spent ion exchange equipment, and contaminated laundry and shoe covers.  The AEC-owned plutonium came from the following:    The Hanford N- Reactor, a production reactor formerly called the New Production Reactor, is located near Richland, Washington, about 150 miles southeast of Seattle.  This reactor is owned and was operated by the AEC.  N-Reactor was designed as a dual-purpose reactor for the production of plutonium and the production of by-product steam for electricity generation.  It was a graphite-moderated, pressurized light water- cooled reactor.  N-Reactor operated from 1963 to 1987.   The Bonus Reactor, a demonstration boiling water reactor, was located at Ricon, about 75 miles west of San Juan, Puerto Rico.  This reactor featured high-temperature, superheated steam and was owned by the AEC but operated by the Puerto Rico Water Resources Authority.  The Bonus reactor began operation in 1964 and was permanently shut down in 1968.   The remainder of the material came from the Nuclear Fuels Services facility in Erwin, Tennessee, and was in the form of liquid residues generated during the fabrication of reactor fuel for the Southwest Experimental Fast Oxide Reactor (SEFOR), an experimental reactor, located near Strickler, Arkansas.  SEFOR was built by the Southwest Atomic Energy Associates  [Note a]  for testing liquid metal fast breeder reactor fuel.  SEFOR began operations in 1969 and was permanently shut down in 1972.      The remaining fuel came from seven commercial nuclear power reactors that were owned and operated by commercial utility companies.    The Big Rock Point Nuclear Power Plant.  This boiling water reactor, owned and operated by Consumers Power Company, is located on Lake Michigan near Charlevoix, Michigan, about 200 miles northwest of Detroit.  Big Rock Point has operated since 1963.   CVTR, Carolinas-Virginia Tube Reactor.  This pressurized heavy water tube reactor, owned and operated by Carolinas-Virginia Nuclear Power Associates was located in Parr, South Carolina, about 25 miles northwest of Columbia.  This reactor began operation in 1964 and was permanently shut down in 1967.   Dresden Nuclear Power Station, Unit #1.  This boiling water reactor, owned and operated by Commonwealth Edison Company, was located near Morris, Illinois, about 50 miles southwest of Chicago.  Dresden-1 commenced operation in 1960 and was permanently shut down in 1978.   Humboldt Bay Nuclear Plant.  This boiling water reactor, owned and operated by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, was located on Humboldt Bay near Eureka, California, about 200 miles north of San Francisco.  This plant commenced operation in 1963 and was permanently shut down in 1976.   Indian Point Nuclear Power Station, Unit #1.  This pressurized water reactor, owned and operated by the Consolidated Edison Company, was located on the Hudson River at Buchanan, New York, about 35 miles north of New York City.  Indian Point began operation in 1962 and was permanently shut down in 1974.   Pathfinder Nuclear Power Plant.  This experimental, boiling water reactor, owned and operated by the Northern States Power Company, was located on the Big Sioux River, near Sioux Falls, South Dakota.  Pathfinder began operations in 1964 and was permanently shut down in 1967.   Yankee Atomic Electric Power Station.  This pressurized water reactor, owned and operated by the Yankee Atomic Electric Company, was located near Rowe, Massachusetts, about 45 miles east of Albany, New York.  This reactor began operation in 1960 and was permanently shut down in 1992.       NFS West Valley Plutonium Shipments to the AEC              In the 1950's, commercial utilities began returning fuel to the Atomic Energy Commission under a program called the Plutonium Credit Activity. This program, established by the U.S. Congress in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, provided ""credit"" for plutonium produced in commercial nuclear reactors operating on fuel purchased or leased from the AEC. Although the uranium in the civilian power reactor industry in the 1950's and early 1960's was owned by the AEC and leased to the utility companies, the plutonium produced during operation of these reactors was owned by the utility companies.  The Plutonium Credit Activity program began in 1957 and ended in 1970. The U.S. Government paid the utilities approximately $10.4 million for approximately 900 kg of plutonium. All of the plutonium purchased under this program was reprocessed at the NFS facility and shipped to the Hanford site with the exception of 2.5 kg plutonium from the Vallecitos Boiling Water Reactor that was reprocessed at the Savannah River site.  Both the AEC-owned plutonium and the plutonium purchased by the AEC under the Plutonium Credit Activity (1530 kg total) listed in  Table 3,  were shipped to the Hanford site as plutonium nitrate solution. The liquid shipments were by commercial truck in accordance with applicable transportation regulations.  Of the 1530 kg of separated plutonium received by the Hanford site from the NFS facility, 635 kg came from fuel or reactors that were AEC-owned, and the remaining 895 kg came from the commercial power-reactor fuel.    Of the 635 kg of the AEC-origin plutonium, the majority came from N-Reactor, a plutonium production reactor at the Hanford site near Richland, Washington.  Specifically, 534 kg of plutonium came from N-Reactor, 95 kg from the Nuclear Fuels Services facility in Erwin, Tennessee, and 6 kg from the Bonus Nuclear Electrical Station, an AEC-owned demonstration reactor.   Of the 895 kg of separated plutonium purchased by the AEC from the utility companies, 436 kg was from Yankee Atomic Electric Company (Yankee Rowe), 285 kg from Commonwealth Edison Company (Dresden-1), 63 kg from Consumers Power Company (Big Rock Point), 7 kg from Northern States Power Company (Pathfinder), and 104 kg from Consolidated Edison Company (Indian Point-1).      Most of the plutonium the AEC received from the NFS facility was used in the breeder reactor and the zero power reactor programs. To meet the isotopic and physical requirements for these programs, the NFS plutonium was blended with other plutonium and then converted to either a metal or an oxide. Even by blending, the isotopic mixture of the power reactor plutonium generally precluded its use in weapons production and there is no indication that blending for that purpose occurred.    NFS West Valley Plutonium Shipments to Others             As shown in  Table 4,  not all of the NFS separated power-reactor plutonium was sold to the AEC. A total of 396 kg of separated power-reactor plutonium was either retained by the utility companies, sold by the utility company to industry, or purchased by NFS and later sold for use in plutonium recycle operations. Of that total, almost 60% was shipped from the NFS West Valley facility to foreign countries for use in research or as fuel for foreign breeder-reactor programs.    A total of 221 kg plutonium was shipped to West Germany for use at the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center.  Several reactors are located at the Center, and it is Germany's most important applied research installation engaged in breeder- reactor research.  Work on fast breeders has been carried out at Karlsruhe since 1960, with Euratom support of the breeder work starting in 1963.   A total of 10 kg plutonium was shipped to the United Kingdom's Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell.  The two experimental zero-power reactors at Harwell provided basic physics information on fast-reactor cores.   Approximately 1 kg of plutonium was sent to the Santa Maria O'Galeria, Plutonium Research and Development Center in Casaccia, Italy.   The remaining 164 kg of plutonium was sent from the NFS West Valley facility to domestic companies, i.e., Babcock & Wilcox Plutonium Laboratory in Leechburg, Pennsylvania, the Westinghouse Electric Plutonium Development Laboratory in Cheswick, Pennsylvania, and the Nuclear Fuels Services facility in Erwin, Tennessee, for use in research or the fabrication of reactor fuel.       Note             a. The Southwest Atomic Energy Associates consisted of seventeen U.S. investor-owned utilities, the Federal Republic of Germany, the General Electric Company, and Euratom.

THORVILSON2 1  United States Department of Agriculture--Agricultural Research Service Center for Medical, Agricultural and Veterinary Entomology 1600 SW 23rd Dr., Gainesville, Florida 32608, USA 2 Texas Tech University Lubbock, Texas 79409-2l22, USA  (Received July 19, 2001; accepted August 6, 2002)  Abstract--The red imported fire ant Solenopsis invicta Buren, has evolved sophisticated chemical communication systems that regulate the activities of the colony. Among these are recruitment pheromones that effectively attract and stimulate workers to follow a trail to food or alternative nesting sites. Alarm pheromones alert, activate, and attract workers to intruders or other disturbances. The attraction and accumulation of fire ant workers in electrical equipment may be explained by their release of pheromones that draw additional worker ants into the electrical contacts. We used chemical analysis and behavioral bioassays to investigate if semiochemicals were released by electrically shocked fire ants. Workers were subjected to a 120 V, alternating-current power source. In all cases, electrically stimulated workers released venom alkaloids as revealed by gas chromatography. We also demonstrated the release of alarm pheromones and recruitment pheromones that elicited attraction and orientation. Arrestant behavior was observed with the workers not electrically stimulated but near those that were, indicating release of unkown behavior-modifying substances from the electrically stimulated ants. It appears that fire ants respond to electrical stimulus by generally releasing exocrine gland products. The behaviors associated with these products support the hypothesis that the accumulation of fire ants in electrical equipment is the result of a foraging worker finding and closing electrical contacts, then releasing exocrine gland products that attract other workers to the site, who in turn are electrically stimulated.

This large biomass of aggressive fire ants dominates the ecological community (Porter and Savignano, 1990) and interferes with human activities (Lofgren, 1986). One unusual effect on human activities is fire ant damage to electrical equipment, in which large numbers of ants invade outdoor electrical apparatuses, create short-circuits, foul conductive materials, and jam internal mechanisms (Eagleson, 1940; Vinson and MacKay, 1990), all of which can lead to destruction of circuitry. Alternating-current frequencies, heat, ozone, magnetic fields, and wire insulation have no effect on ants (MacKay et al., 1989). Fire ants were initially reported to be attracted to electrical fields along with several other ant species (MacKay et al., 1992a,b). However, Slowik et al. (1996) reported that fire ants are not attracted to electrical fields, but instead probably release chemicals that excite and attract other ants to the release site after ants contact bare, bridgeable conductive surfaces, such as exposed wires or contact points. Electrical stimulation of worker ants causes incapacitation, death, and aggression towards sister workers (Slowik et al., 1996). In addition, both voluntary (not induced by electrical stimulation) and involuntary (displayed by electrically stimulated ants) ""gaster-flagging"" was observed (Obin and Vander Meer, 1985; Slowik et al., 1996). Gaster flagging signals the release of defensive venom alkaloids (Obin and Vander Meer, 1985). Therefore, the release of semiochemicals by electrically shocked worker ants in the vicinity of infested circuitry may cause destructive aggregations of fire ants in electrical equipment (Slowik et al., 1996). Pheromonal chemical cues are the most important form of communication among ants (Vander Meer and Alonso, 1998), and several pheromone systems of S. invicta have been investigated. For example, an alarm /excitant pheromone is involved in mating flight activity (Obin and Vander Meer, 1994; Alonso and Vander Meer, 1997). A recruitment pheromone is produced by the Dufour's gland and is released via the sting apparatus (Wilson, 1959). This complex recruitment pheromone system has several concentration- and context-related functions. Pheromones attract workers (Vander Meer et al., 1988), modulate their general responsiveness [i.e., orientation induction (Vander Meer et al., 1990)], and orient workers along a pheromone trail to food (Vander Meer et al., 1981). Fire ant venom is primarily composed of piperidine alkaloids, readily analyzed and well characterized (MacConnell et al., 1971; Leclercq et al., 1994). Venom functions in defense against intruders, in procurement of prey, and as an antimicrobial agent to maintain hygienic conditions within a colony (Obin and Vander Meer, 1985).   SEMIOCHEMICALS OF  Solenopsis invicta  2587  Venoms of other social hymenopterans such as bees, wasps, and hornets can be experimentally collected by electrical stimulation (O'Connor et al., 1963). In the field, honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) housed near extra-high-voltage power lines are induced to sting and release venom when electrified by as little as 900 nA of current after alighting on wet hive entrances (Bindokas et al., 1988). Fire ants, like honeybees, may also release venom and perhaps other semiochemicals when electrically shocked. These released chemicals might contribute to the observation that large masses of fire ants are often found in electrical circuitry, causing the equipment to malfunction (Vinson and MacKay, 1990). We report here the results of experiments that investigate, through behavior-specific bioassays and chemical analyses, what pheromones or semiochemicals are released by electrically stimulated fire ants.  METHODS AND MATERIALS  Source of Monogyne Solenopsis invicta Colonies. Queenright monogyne S. invicta colonies were obtained by rearing colonies from newly mated queens or by excavation of field nests. Monogyne colonies from the field were characterized by low mound density, well-developed large nests, polymorphic characteristics of colony workers (Greenberg et al., 1985), no more than one queen found, and a high level of intraspecific aggression (Morel et al., 1990). Excavated field colonies were brought to the laboratory only if the colony queen was found, and then the colony workers and brood were isolated by a standard float-out procedure (Banks et al., 1981). All colonies isolated after excavation were placed in plastic rearing trays (52  39  7.5 cm). Inside walls of trays were painted with Fluon (Dupont, Wilmington, Delaware, USA) to keep ants from escaping. Each colony was provided with Petri dish nest cells (14 cm diam.  2.5 cm deep) with a Castone substrate (Dentsply Co., York, Pennsylvania, USA) and cotton-stoppered water tubes (Obin, 1986). Colonies were reared on crickets and 10% sugar water absorbed in wads of tissue. Rearing temperatures were maintained between 21 and 28 C, and the lightdark cycle was variable. Preparation of Electrical Wire. A standard receptacle plug was attached to one end of common electrical cord (ca. 2 m). At the other end of the cord, ca. 2 cm of insulation was removed. Separately, insulation was stripped from 18-gauge wire, except for 5 mm on one end. The 18-gauge wire was soldered to the available end of the common electrical wire. Heat-shrink Teflon tubing was placed over each of soldered connections and wrapped with electrical tape. A piece of heat-shrink Teflon tubing was also placed over the wire ends that still had a small amount of insulation remaining. This functioned to hold the wires ca. 1 mm apart. The bare wires (5 cm long) were bent appropriately to better contact the floor and side of the test vial (20-ml scintillation vials), taking care to keep them 1 mm apart and   2588  VANDER MEER, SLOWIK, AND THORVILSON  not touching each other. Wires were energized by plugging the electrical cord plug into an adjustable power supply containing a 1-A fuse that was connected to a standard 120 V, alternating-current power source. General Experimental Procedure. Test worker ants (ca. 50) were randomly selected from laboratory-maintained monogyne S. invicta colonies (see above) and placed into 20-ml scintillation vials that had their inside lip painted with Fluon to help keep the ants inside the vial. The vial was clamped to a ring stand for stability. The wire was plugged into the adjustable power supply and gently inserted into the vial of ants. Ants were allowed to settle down without electrical stimulation for at least 15 min. The power was turned on and adjusted to 110 V. Ants walking across both bare wires would complete the electrical circuit and become electrically stimulated. After 2 min, the power was turned off and the ants were removed from the wire and vial with feather forceps. The bent end of the wire was placed on the lip of a clean and labeled 20-ml scintillation vial. Hexane (Burdick and Jackson, Muskegon, Michigan, USA; GC2 grade) was added to the top of the bare wire one drop at a time with a disposable Pasteur pipet and allowed to run down the length of the wire to the bend where it dropped into the vial. This was repeated several times to ensure that all potential compounds released by the ants were removed from the wire. The hexane wire rinse was transferred to an autosampler vial for analysis by GC or for bioassay. The vial in which the worker ants were electrically stimulated was also carefully rinsed with hexane and subjected to chemical analysis or bioassay. If headspace samples (air in the vial) were needed, the vial in which the ants were electrically stimulated was immediately capped after the ants were removed. The procedure for the alarm bioassay is described in detail below. Analysis of Venom Alkaloids and Cuticular Hydrocarbons. Immediately after an electrical stimulation treatment or control was complete and the worker ants were removed, 10 l of a 100 ng/l hexane solution of n -tetracosane were added to the test vial as an internal standard. Similarly, prior to rinsing the treatment or control electrical wire with hexane, 10 l of a 100 ng/l hexane solution of n -tetracosane were added to the collection vial as an internal standard. After addition of the internal standard, the treatment or control samples were treated as described above. Prior to GC analysis, all samples were brought to a volume of 100 l and transferred to 300-l autosample inserts. Gas chromatography (GC) was carried out with a Varian 3700 (Varian, Palo Alto, California, USA) gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and a split/splitless injector operated splitless for 0.33 min after which the splitter was turned on (90:1 ratio). Injector and detector temperatures were 300 C. Samples were injected into the system using an autosampler (Leap Technologies, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA). Analyses were performed on a DB-1 fused silica column (0.32 mm ID  30 m; 0.25-m film thickness; J & W Scientific, Folsom, California, USA). The oven was programmed from 150 to 285 Cat 10 C/min with a 2-min hold. Data were analyzed with Turbochrome Workstation   SEMIOCHEMICALS OF  Solenopsis invicta  2589  Version 6.1.0.1 (Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, Connecticut, USA). Peak assignments for the venom alkaloids and cuticular hydrocarbons were based on the GC analysis of authentic S. invicta alkaloids and hydrocarbons obtained by overnight soaking of S. invicta workers in hexane (see Vander Meer et al., 1985; Ross et al., 1987). Preparation of Poison and Dufour's Gland Extracts. The poison gland and the Dufour's gland are attached to the sting apparatus. The poison gland produces the piperidine alkaloids that are used by workers in defense and prey procurement. The Dufour's gland is located at the base of the sting and its products exit to the outside via the sting. The Dufour's gland is the source of the fire ant recruitment pheromone. The worker sting apparatus was removed in water with the aid of a dissecting microscope (Leica MZ-8, Heerbrugg, Switzerland) by placing and holding the ant in the water ventral side up. With another pair of forceps, the sting apparatus was removed by grabbing the last segment of the abdomen and pulling it out along with the sting apparatus. Once removed, the fat bodies were taken away, exposing the two glands. At this point, either gland could be obtained by pinching it off where it attaches to the sting apparatus. Excess water was removed by touching the gland carefully to a piece of tissue. The gland was transferred to a probe, then into a vial containing hexane where it was macerated. The volume of hexane was adjusted to give the required concentration in terms of gland equivalents. Alarm Bioassay. Worker groups were taken from each of 15 mature monogyne S. invicta colonies maintained in the laboratory. Approximately 100 workers and a small amount of brood from each colony were placed in small plastic tray (7  22  5 cm), whose inner sides were painted with Fluon to prevent escape. The bottom of one half of the tray was covered with a thin layer of moist Castone. Red cellophane was placed over the Castone end of the tray to induce the workers to settle down with their brood. After the ants settled down (at least 30 min), the red cellophane was carefully removed. Tests were carried out only on subcolonies that were calm. The bioassay required an observer and an assistant. The assistant prepared test samples for the observer so that the observer did not know the sample identity. Test samples consisted of 3 ml of air or headspace (vapor above a sample contained in a vial) drawn into a syringe (5 ml, plastic, Henke-Sass Wolf Co., Tuttlingen, Germany). The assistant randomly assigned each sample to a worker group, so that all worker groups were tested with each of the test samples and controls. The observer positioned the syringe 12 cm directly above a selected quiescent worker group, then 1 ml of vapor was slowly released over the workers. Prior to the actual test, the observer determined the blank air release rate that did not initiate a reaction from the worker ants. Reactions were rated on a scale of 14 (1 = no reaction, 2 = no more than raised heads and/or antennation of the air, 3 = one worker reacted with rapid movement, and 4 = several workers exhibiting an excited reaction). All tests were conducted with a room temperature of 28 C and standard overhead fluorescent lighting.   2590  VANDER MEER, SLOWIK, AND THORVILSON  Air from an empty vial was tested as a negative control, and 1025 workers (shaken) were used as a positive control. Shaking disturbed the workers and induced them to release alarm pheromone. Only those series of tests in which appropriate reactions to the negative and positive controls were obtained were used for analysis. Each replicate from a treatment was assayed at least five times, as were the negative and positive controls. We found that greater consistency was obtained for the positive control if there was a vial of workers for each replicate. The following treatment samples were evaluated: Electrically stimulated ants (stimulation time 120 sec); electrically stimulated ants (20 sec); shaken ants (with vial lid off for 120 sec); shaken ants (vial lid off <10 sec); and poison sac contents (1 gland equivalent/10 l hexane absorbed onto a filter paper strip, solvent allowed to evaporate and placed in the bottom of a bioassay vial, headspace taken immediately). The McNemar test for significance of changes (Sokal and Rohlf, 1981) was used for analysis of the alarm reaction bioassay data. For this analysis, scores of 12 were considered no reaction, and 34 were counted as alarm. The number of worker groups that displayed an alarm reaction to the test sample but not to the negative control was compared to the number of worker groups that reacted to the negative control but not to the test sample. Orientation Bioassay. The orientation bioassay presumably measures the ability of workers to detect and follow a chemical trail. The procedure was a modification of that described by Barlin et al. (1976) and Jouvnenaz et al. (1978). Queenright, monogyne colonies were used in the bioassay. The orientation bioassay apparatus consisted of a ramp leading to a test platform (7.5  10 cm), which was connected by a tongue depressor to a similar size platform on which were food items, e.g., crickets or a cotton ball saturated with honeywater (1:1). The legs of the two platforms were painted with Fluon, which forced the ants to move up the ramp and across the test platform to the food platform. A piece of plain paper (7.5  10 cm) was placed on the test platform. The above-described apparatus was set up on a colony tray floor, and worker ants were given time to develop a natural trail to the food platform. Test pieces of paper were prepared by lightly marking in pencil two arcs on opposite sides of the paper from the center of one end to the center of the other end. Test solutions (10 l) were streaked evenly along one of the arcs, and the appropriate solvent control streaked along the other arc. The test paper was air-dried for about 20 sec, then the natural trail paper on the test platform was replaced with the test paper. If, within 3 min, one ant followed the treatment arc from start to finish, the test was considered positive. A negative test was characterized by confusion at the two trail ends. Samples evaluated were the wire rinse (A) and the vial rinse (B) from electrically stimulated workers in the vial, the wire rinse (C) and vial rinse (D) from nonelectrically stimulated workers in a vial, and (E) the hexane vial rinse of worker ants in a vial without the wire. There were five replicate samples for each of the treatments. All samples   SEMIOCHEMICALS OF  Solenopsis invicta  2591  from electrically stimulated ants were adjusted to 250 l total volume of hexane prior to use. Samples that did not give a positive orientation bioassay were concentrated to 50 l volume and retested in the bioassay. If the samples did not show activity at this concentration, they were assumed to not have measurable activity. The Dufour's Gland Equivalents Released by Electrically Stimulated Ants. Samples that showed positive orientation bioassay activity were systematically diluted with hexane until the samples were inactive. Dufour's gland extracts were prepared at a starting concentration of 1 Dufour's gland equivalent (DE) per 10 l. Serial (1:2) dilutions were made with hexane, and orientation bioassays conducted until the extract was inactive. This was repeated three times. The Dufour's gland equivalent deposited by electrically stimulated ants on the wire and in the vial was determined by comparing the last active concentration of Dufour's gland extracts with the last active dilution of the wire and vial samples from electrically stimulated ants. Knowing the starting volume and the dilution regime allowed the estimation of Dufour's gland equivalents in the wire and vial samples. Olfactometer Bioassay. A Y-tube olfactometer was used to determine if attractant compounds were released by electrically stimulated worker ants. The bioassay apparatus was similar to that described by Vander Meer et al. (1988). The positive standard was 0.3 queen equivalents of dissected and extracted queen poison sacs (poison sacs from 10 polygyne queens in 300 l of hexane), the source of the queen attractant pheromone. A null hypothesis of equal numbers of ants in each arm was tested with chi-square analysis. Samples collected from electrically stimulated worker ants were evaluated in the olfactometer bioassay only if a positive response was obtained in the orientation bioassay, since workers are 200 300 times more sensitive to recruitment pheromone in the orientation bioassay than in the olfactometer bioassay (Vander Meer, 1986).  RESULTS  The Ant Response. Worker ants calmly walked on the vial surfaces prior to energizing the bare copper wires that were in the test vials. On energizing the system, worker ants bridging the two wires responded by gaster flagging, curling their gaster toward the wire in a stinging movement, and rapid, random movement in the vial. Other workers that were not initially electrically stimulated, reacted with alarm behaviors, including gaster flagging, and moved excitedly toward the wires, where if they made contact with both wires, they too were induced to exhibit the defensive behaviors described above. Interestingly, before the end of the bioassay (2 min), worker ants not on the wire aggregated quietly away from the wire ends. This was in sharp contrast to their rapid movement at the beginning of the test. Approximately 1525 workers were electrically stimulated during the 2-min course of the experiment (mean  SE: 22.8  1.26 workers, N = 8). Some   2592  VANDER MEER, SLOWIK, AND THORVILSON  of these workers did not survive the treatment. The observed reaction of the ants to electrical stimulation suggested that we could expect to find venom alkaloids and evidence for the release of alarm pheromones. Venom Alkaloids and Cuticular Hydrocarbons. Both classes of compound can be readily analyzed by GC in a single chromatogram (Ross et al., 1987). All expected piperidine alkaloid components (six) characteristic of S. invicta were found. The quantitative results for the venom alkaloids are shown in Figure 1. The total amount of venom alkaloid from the wire rinse of electrically stimulated ants was greater than the treatment vial rinse (mean  SE: 3.33  0.56 g vs. 0.23  0.04 g; N = 5 and 4, respectively; unpaired t test, df = 7; t = 4.905, P = 0.002) and by inference any of the controls (see Figure 1). This is a direct reflection of the observed worker defensive behaviors induced by electrical stimulation. The wire was the main target of the ants, but gaster flagging and venom-throwing may have also distributed venom onto the inner walls of the vial. In addition, some worker ants not on the wire may have been stimulated to release venom into the vial. The amount of venom found in the treatment vials also was greater than any of the control samples (treatment vial rinse vs. control wire rinse: mean  SE: 0.23  0.04 g vs. 0.06  0.01 g; unpaired t test, df = 7, t = 5.939, P = 0.002). The amount of alkaloid found on the control wire and in the control vial were not  FIG. 1. Results are shown for the quantitative analysis of S. invicta venom alkaloids found on the wire or the vial for the control and treatment samples indicated. (A) ""Non-stimulated ants-Vial"" is the vial rinse that matches the ""Non-Stimulated Ants-Wire"" sample. This control had the wire inserted as in the electrically stimulated samples but the wire was not energized. (B) ""Non-stimulated Ants-Vial"" was a control that had worker ants, but did not have the wire inserted. N = 5.   SEMIOCHEMICALS OF  Solenopsis invicta  2593  different (unpaired t test, df = 7, t = 2.127, P = 0.066). Perhaps the disturbance of putting the wires into the vials with ants induced some of the workers to attack and release some venom on the wire. The mean amounts of venom in control vials were the same regardless of whether the wires were inserted or not (mean  SE: 0.03  0.01 g vs. 0.03  0.01 g, respectively). The principal source of cuticular hydrocarbons are from the cuticle of the insect; however, in most ants, including the fire ant, a cephalic lumen, called the postpharyngeal gland, is a copious source of the same hydrocarbon components that are found on the cuticle (Soroker et al., 1994). In our electrical stimulation experiments, the hydrocarbons could be passively transferred from worker cuticle to the wire and/or vial or they could be regurgitated from the postpharyngeal gland through the pharynx and mouth to the wire or vial substrate. Treatment and control vials did not differ in the total amount of cuticular hydrocarbons deposited in the vial during the 15-min acclimation time and the 2-min treatment time (mean  SE: 77.0  18.3 ng vs. 78.5  10.4 ng; unpaired t test, df = 7, t = -1.451, P = 0.944). Alarm Bioassay. Figure 2 shows the results of initial bioassays aimed at determining if electrically stimulated ants released alarm pheromone. Headspace  FIG. 2. Alarm bioassay results for headspace from vials in which worker fire ants were electrically stimulated and three controls. Shaken ants represents a positive control. Nonstimulated worker samples are a negative control, and laboratory air is another negative control. The results show that under standard experimental conditions the headspace above electrically stimulated ants does not elicit an alarm response in the alarm bioassay. Results are shown as the mean and SE of 10 replicates.   2594  VANDER MEER, SLOWIK, AND THORVILSON  samples from electrically stimulated ants did not elicit a significantly different alarm reaction from workers than the nonelectrically stimulated controls (McNemar test: G = 1.04, P > 0.05; N = 25), but was different from the shaken ant positive control (McNemar test: G = 18.5, P < 0.001; N = 25). These results did not correspond to expectations based on behavioral observations. Figure 3 shows the results of shaking worker ants in the vial (positive control) and then not sampling the opened vial for 2 min, the normal duration of the electrical stimulation. Allowing the volatiles generated from the shaken ants to dissipate for 2 min gave a result different from the positive control of shaken ants with the headspace sample taken immediately (McNemar test: G = 13.86, P < 0.001; N = 10). The results for shaken ant samples allowed to stand for 2 min was no different from the unshaken ant negative control (McNemar test: G = 0; P > 0.05; N = 10). Based on this result, we modified our electrical stimulation time to 20 sec, immediately after which the wire was removed and headspace samples were withdrawn for evaluation in the alarm bioassay. The results are shown in Figure 4. The electrically stimulated (20 sec) headspace samples elicited greater alarm response than the appropriate nonstimulated control (McNemar test: G = 13.86, P < 0.001; N = 10; mean  SE: 3.9  0.10 vs. 1.4  0.16, respectively). However, there were no differences between the headspace samples of electrically  FIG. 3. Alarm bioassay results for headspace from vials in which worker fire ants were shaken to release alarm pheromone. For shaken ants (positive control) the headspace sample was taken immediately after shaking. Samples represented by shaken + 120 sec were shaken as above but the vial was left open for 120 sec prior to taking the headspace sample. Unshaken worker samples were a negative control as was laboratory air. The results show that while shaken ants release alarm pheromone, the pheromone components are highly volatile and evaporate by 120 sec after shaking. Results are shown as the mean and SE of 10 replicates.   SEMIOCHEMICALS OF  Solenopsis invicta  2595  FIG. 4. Alarm bioassay results for headspace from vials in which worker fire ants were electrically stimulated for 120 sec and 20 sec. Unshaken ants was a negative control. Nonstimulated ants (20 sec) was another control where the nonenergized wire was inserted into the vial with worker ants and the headspace sample was taken after 20 sec. The results demonstrate that the alarm pheromone is released early during the electrical stimulation and evaporates out of the vial by the end of the standard 120-sec electrical stimulation time period. Results are shown as the mean and SE of 10 replicates.  stimulated workers and the headspace from the positive control, shaken workers (McNemar test: G = 1.39, P > 0.05; N = 10). To test whether or not the venom alkaloids were responsible for the observed alarm activity, we applied one poison gland equivalent to a piece of filter paper, allowed the hexane to evaporate, and placed the paper into a typical bioassay vial (20 ml). The vial was capped and the headspace associated with that vial was tested for alarm activity. There was no difference between the air control and the headspace from above the poison sac samples (McNemar test: G = 1.39, P > 0.05; N = 10). Thus, we demonstrated that the contents of the poison sac (primarily venom alkaloids) were not responsible for the alarm response. Orientation Bioassay. The orientation bioassay results are shown in Figure 5. All hexane rinse samples (wire and vial, N = 5) from electrically stimulated ants gave positive orientation bioassay results. The assay provides a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer to orientation activity. We calculated the DE by comparing electrically stimulated ant sample (wire and vial hexane rinses) bioassay results with results from Dufour's gland extracts at known volume and DEs. Both electrically stimulated ant samples and the Dufour's gland samples were systematically diluted until orientation activity was lost. The mean last positive bioassay for the Dufour's gland samples was 0.0015 DE (SE =  0.0005). This corresponds to ca. 0.9 pg/cm   2596  VANDER MEER, SLOWIK, AND THORVILSON  FIG. 5. Results from a recruitment orientation bioassay. Serial dilutions of treatment samples were carried out until the samples no longer gave positive results in the orientation bioassay. These results were compared with serial dilutions of Dufour's gland extracts (the source of the pheromone) containing known Dufour's gland equivalents (DE). The number of DE could then be calculated for each of the treatment samples. Only electrically stimulated workers released detectable quantities of the orientation pheromone. All other samples had to have <0.0015 DE--the lowest detectable amount. Results are shown as the mean and SE of 5 replicates.  of (Z,E)- -farnesene, the recruitment orientation pheromone (Vander Meer et al., 1981). Knowing the starting volume of the electrically stimulated ant samples and monitoring their systematic dilution (or initial concentration) to the last positive orientation bioassay response, we related this to the results with the Dufour's gland extracts and calculated the DE of each sample (Figure 5). The initial bioassay of the controls (vial and wire rinses from samples that had ants, wire inserted, but not electrically stimulated) were negative even after fivefold concentration; therefore, they had to contain <0.0015 DE (Figure 5). Similar results were obtained with vial samples that had ants but no wire inserted (Figure 5). Like the venom alkaloids, more Dufour's gland products were deposited on the wire than on in the vial, although there was no significant difference between the two sets of samples (wire, 1.7  1.1 DE vial, 0.4  0.2 DE; df = 8, t = 1.094, P = 0.359; N = 5). Olfactometer Bioassay. Each wire hexane rinse ( N = 5) was tested in the olfactometer bioassay three times. Chi-squared analysis of the two-choice olfactometer showed that each of the wire hexane rinse replicates was attractive to worker fire ants (for each of the five replicates, df = 1,  2 > 3.85, P < 0.05; null hypothesis of equal response to treatment and control). The mean percent of the ants responding to the treatment side of the olfactometer was 67.5 (SE = 1.5, N = 5). In contrast, there was not enough recruitment pheromone deposited by   SEMIOCHEMICALS OF  Solenopsis invicta  2597  electrically stimulated ants in the vial to release a response in the olfactometer bioassay (df = 1,  2 < 3.85, P > 0.05). The mean percent of ants responding to the treatment side of the olfactometer was 56.7 (SE = 1.1, N = 5). The response of worker ants to the queen poison sac extract positive control was 75.5  2.6% ( N = 5, 0.33 queen equivalents/10l hexane).  DISCUSSION  Fire ants use a wide array of semiochemicals for defense and intraspecific communication (Vander Meer and Alonso, 1998). Our results demonstrate that electrically shocked fire ants indiscriminately release exocrine gland products. Venom alkaloids from the poison sac and recruitment pheromone from the Dufour's gland were released through the sting apparatus. Alarm pheromone was released, presumably, from mandibular glands (Alonso and Vander Meer, 1997). Although not considered an exocrine gland, postpharyngeal gland contents can be regurgitated through the mouth during trophallaxis (Soroker et al., 1994). Hydrocarbons are the major class of compound found in the postpharyngeal gland, and these compounds are easily analyzed by GC (Lok et al., 1975; Vander Meer et al, 1985). Chemical analysis for hydrocarbons specific to S. invicta (Ross et al., 1987) from electrically stimulated fire ant workers failed to show release of postpharyngeal gland products. Release of exocrine gland products from other glandular sources, e.g., maxillary and labial glands, or the hindgut are probable, but not detectable due to our lack of knowledge regarding the behaviors and chemistry associated with these potential semiochemical sources. Interestingly, by the end of the electrical stimulation period, workers that had not been directly affected by the electrical current were inactively aggregated away from the electrified wire. This behavior may have been released by an unknown pheromone or was the result of exposure to high concentrations of known semiochemicals, e.g., venom alkaloids. Our previous investigations into the behaviors associated with fire ant mating flights (Obin and Vander Meer, 1994; Alonso and Vander Meer, 1997) showed that the alate excitant pheromone used to initiate mating flights was produced by the mandibular glands. The products were further shown to be extremely short-lived and were released in small quantities and/or were of high volatility. Similarly, an alarm pheromone response was released from the crushed heads of workers (Wilson, 1962) and was reproducible in our laboratory (R.K.V.M., unpublished data). Our work here supports the ephemeral nature of the fire ant alarm pheromone, which, to be effective, must quickly dissipate when the threat is no longer detected (see alarm pheromone review in Vander Meer and Alonso, 1998). Release of recruitment and alarm pheromones by an electrically stimulated worker has direct implications toward the accumulation of fire ants in electrical equipment. The estimated number of worker Dufour's gland equivalents released   2598  VANDER MEER, SLOWIK, AND THORVILSON  by electrically stimulated fire ant workers was almost 1000 times the amount needed for significant worker attraction in the olfactometer (Vander Meer, 1986; Vander Meer et al., 1988) described here. In addition, one of the behaviors associated with alarm pheromones is attraction toward the worker releasing the alarm pheromone (Vander Meer and Alonso, 1998). Taken together, it is reasonable to assume that other fire ant workers in the vicinity of the semiochemical-releasing worker would be drawn toward the live contacts. There are many species of ants that maintain large populations (see Holldobler  and Wilson, 1990), but none rival the high population densities of S. invicta in the United States. After its accidental importation into the United States in the 1930s (Lofgren, 1986), the population densities of the ant are about five times greater than found in their native South America (Porter et al., 1992), and in the United States can be as high as 100120 mature monogyne colonies per hectare. Each colony maintains up to 250,000 workers or 30 million ants per hectare (3000 worker ants/m2 ). Even if one assumes that only 510% of the workers are foraging, there are still 150300 workers/m2 . Thus, it is likely that a foraging worker accidentally bridges live contacts in electrical equipment, releasing pheromones that attract nearby workers to the live contacts. These workers, in turn, release exocrine gland products, which increase pheromone concentration and the probability of attracting additional workers to the live contacts. We believe that the high population densities and the ""weedy"" nature (Tschinkel, 1987) of S. invicta is why this ant presents such a significant problem relative to electrical equipment. Earlier work investigated the effect of electrical fields on S. invicta and several other ant genera (MacKay et al., 1992a,b). The authors concluded that workers from all species tested ( N = 10) were attracted to electrical fields and that the number of ants accumulated at the electrical contacts increased with increasing voltage (directly related to electrical field strength). Our results for the fire ant present a pheromone-based alternative to their potential attraction to electric fields. All ant species are social and have evolved pheromone systems that help to maintain the health and social structure of the colony (see Vander Meer and Alonso, 1998; Holldobler and Wilson, 1990). Therefore, there is a high probability that  other ant species will also release exocrine gland products in response to electrical stimulation, which would then explain their apparent attraction to electrical fields (MacKay et al., 1992b). The differences in our conclusions may be based in semantics, since MacKay et al. (1992a) state in their discussion that while the ants accumulated at the electrically activated disks, ""visual observations did not suggest the ants oriented to the powered disks."" Orientation of the workers toward the powered disks would constitute ""attraction,"" not simply that there were a number of ants at the disk after 10 min (see Vander Meer and Morel, 1988; Vander Meer and Alonso, 1998). Thus, our results support the report by Slowik et al. (1996) that electrically stimulated fire ants are not attracted to electrical fields, but may release pheromones that result in aggregations of ants at the site of electrical stimulation.   SEMIOCHEMICALS OF  Solenopsis invicta  2599  Acknowledgments--This research was a portion of the second author's research leading to his MS degree in Entomology at Texas Tech University.

GX251-93-2398137	"T  HE  MINERAL I  NDUSTRY OF  NEW YORK  This chapter has been prepared under a Memorandum of Understanding between the U.S. Bureau of Mines, U.S. Department of the Interior, and the New York Education Department, New York Geological Survey, for collecting information on all nonfuel minerals.  New York ranked 15th in the Nation in nonfuel mineral production value1 in 1995, down from 13th in 1994, according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The estimated value for 1995 was $820 million, an 8% decrease from that of 1994. This followed a nearly 5% increase from 1993 to 1994 (based on final data). The State accounted for more than 2% of the U.S. total nonfuel mineral production value. In 1995, crushed stone replaced salt as New York's leading nonfuel mineral, based on value. About 90% of the State's nonfuel mineral production value came from industrial minerals and mineral products, primarily crushed stone, salt, construction sand and gravel, portland cement, and wollastonite. Zinc accounted for most of the metal production and value. In 1995, the State's overall decrease in nonfuel mineral value, mostly in salt, crushed stone, portland cement, and construction sand and gravel, was mitigated to a small degree by increases in zinc and common clays. By contrast, in 1994, the values for most mineral commodities increased with the exception of construction sand and gravel and portland cement. Compared with Compared with 1994, other nonfuel TABLE 1  minerals that increased in value in 1995 were as follows: dimension stone, masonry cement, industrial sand and gravel, and gemstones. Decreases occurred in talc and pyrophyllite, garnet, crude gypsum, lead, and peat. Based on USGS estimates of quantities produced in the 50 States in 1995, New York remained the only State to produce wollastonite, second of two garnet-producing States, third in salt and zinc, fourth in talc and pyrophyllite, and sixth in lead. While the State remained 10th in dimension stone, it dropped from 8th to 10th place in portland cement. Additionally, New York mines and plants continued to produce significant quantities of crushed stone, construction sand and gravel, common clays, and masonry cement. The New York State Geological Survey2 reported that the Division of Mineral Resources of the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (NYDEC) issued 342 mining permits in 1995, of which 130 were for new permits and 212 were for renewals. There were 2,560 active mines during the year, of which 71% were industryowned and the remainder were State-owned. Roughly 25% of total acres disturbed by mining were reclaimed. 2  NONFUEL RAW MINERAL PRODUCTION IN NEW YORK1 1993 Mineral Quantity Value (thousands) Quantity 1994 Value (thousands)  1995 Quantity  p  Value (thousands) $8,170 125,000 12,800 W 190,000 134,000 219,000 8,830  Cement: Masonry metric tons 75,300 $5,420 82,000 $6,020 111,000 Portland do. 2,970,000 149,000 2,650,000 139,000 2,380,000 Clays thousand metric tons 508 9,250 507 9,270 572 r Peat metric tons W W W 12 W r r Salt thousand metric tons 5,620 191,000 6,060 233,000 4,990 e e Sand and gravel (construction) do. 34,900 162,000 28,000 138,000 26,800 Stone: 3 Crushed do. 38,400 223,000 39,400 239,000 36,500 3 3 Dimension metric tons 19,300 3,440 24,600 7,370 36,300 Combined value of emery (1993), garnet (abrasive), gemstones, gypsum (crude), lead, sand and gravel (industrial), silver, stone [crushed traprock (1993), dimension granite and quartzite (1994)], talc and pyrophyllite, wollastonite, zinc, r and values indicated by symbol W XX 108,000 XX 121,000 XX r Total XX 852,000 XX 892,000 XX e Estimated. pPreliminary. rRevised.

Initially, the Appellate Division ruled that a town could not completely ban mining. The decision by the Court of Appeals could have a major impact upon the mining industry in New York if municipalities amend zoning laws to prohibit mining. The NYDEC issued a permit to Akzo-Nobel Salt, Inc. to construct a new underground salt mine at Hamptons Corners, NY. Protect a Clean Environment, Inc. (PACE) and the League of Women Voters of Livingston County protested the permit because of groundwater and mine design concerns and requested a legal hearing. Officials from the New York State Department of Conservation, Division of Mineral Resources and Division of Solid Waste met with staff of Zinc Corporation of America (ZCA) to discuss the potential for a research, development, and demonstration permit to allow the use of coal ash as supporting fill in underground hard rock mines. ZCA hopes the project will demonstrate that coal ash can reduce the need for landfill space, be used safely to fill voids below groundwater level, and provide adequate structural strength at relatively low cost. Mining continued at a record pace in Akzo-Nobel's flooded salt mine at Retsof in Livingston County. By the end of the year, approximately 2.1 million metric tons (2.3 million short tons) of salt were stockpiled. Continued flooding caused the mine to be abandoned in September; by December the mine was completely flooded. Mine closure  was orderly and carried out in an environmentally sound manner. All fluids were drained from equipment to be abandoned in the mine and shipped off site for disposal. All mine shafts were filled and capped. At the end of 1995, plans and permit applications for a new rock salt mine located several miles southeast of the Retsof Mine were forwarded. Plans for the new mine called for ground breaking in late spring of 1996. As a result of the interest generated in underground mining in New York by the collapse of a portion of the Akzo-Nobel salt mine, legislative attention was focused on the industry. An Assemblyman representing Manhattan in New York City, the chair of the Assembly Environmental Committee, held public hearings on the underground mining industry in order to determine if further regulation of the industry was warranted. Representatives of most of the underground mines in the State, interested citizens' groups, and individuals were called to testify. 1 The terms ""nonfuel mineral production"" and related ""values"" encompass variations in meaning, depending on the minerals or mineral products. Production may be measured by mine shipments, mineral commodity sales, or marketable production (including consumption by producers) as is applicable to the individual mineral commodity. All 1995 USGS mineral production data are estimates, as of Dec. 1995. For some commodities, especially construction sand and gravel, crushed stone, and portland cement, estimates are updated periodically.

In 2001, the estimated value1 of nonfuel mineral production for Alabama was $938 million, based upon preliminary U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) data. This was about a 1% increase from that of 2000,2 following a 6% decrease from 1999 to 2000. The State remained 16th among the 50 States in total nonfuel mineral production value, of which Alabama accounted for almost 2.5% of the U.S. total. The top four nonfuel mineral commodities produced in Alabama in 2001 (based upon preliminary data) were, in descending order of value, cement (portland and masonry combined), crushed stone, lime, and construction sand and gravel, accounting for 94% of the State's total production value. The combined value of cement (portland and masonry) and crushed stone represented nearly 76% of the total (table 1). In 2000, the State's overall drop in value resulted mostly from the decrease in crushed stone, down $54 million, and the lowered values of portland cement and construction sand and gravel, down $7 million and $5 million, respectively. The largest increases occurred in lime, up about $7 million, and kaolin. Nonfuel mineral production in Alabama consisted entirely of industrial minerals. Compared with USGS estimates of the quantities produced in the other 49 States in 2001, Alabama remained second in kaolin; third in lime, common clays, and bentonite; fourth of six iron oxide pigment-producing States; was one of the top five masonry cement-producing States; and remained eighth in salt. While the State rose to third from fifth in masonry cement, it went from fifth to sixth in portland cement. Additionally, Alabama was a significant producer of crushed stone, construction sand and gravel, and industrial sand and gravel. No metals were mined in the State. All metal 1 The terms ""nonfuel mineral production"" and related ""values"" encompass variations in meaning, depending upon the minerals or mineral products. Production may be measured by mine shipments, mineral commodity sales, or marketable production (including consumption by producers) as is applicable to the individual mineral commodity. All 2001 USGS mineral production data published in this chapter are preliminary estimates as of August 2002 and are expected to change. For some mineral commodities, such as construction sand and gravel, crushed stone, and portland cement, estimates are updated periodically. To obtain the most current information, please contact the appropriate USGS mineral commodity specialist.

Data for 2001 are preliminary and are expected to change; related rankings may also change.  production in the State, especially that of raw steel, was the result of processing materials acquired from other domestic and foreign sources. Production of a natural mixture of bauxite (no longer used to produce primary aluminum) and bauxitic clay with a very low iron oxide content has been reported to the USGS since 1995 as kaolin; it is primarily used to make refractory products. The Geological Survey of Alabama3 provided the narrative information that follows. In 2001, there were 112 companies or operations involved in the mining and production of industrial mineral resources. This included 45 limestone-dolomite operations for crushed stone that were active in the State. In addition, granite, sandstone, and quartzite operations for crushed stone were active. Marble operations were active for the production of micronized calcium carbonate and building stone. There were 17 clay (common clay, bentonite, fuller 's earth, kaolin, fire clay) operations active in the State, along with 48 sand and gravel operations. Other operations include chalk, building stone (marble, limestone, and sandstone), salt, and recovered sulfur. Mineral exploration in Alabama has continued to focus on industrial resources with several large expansions in the State. The Alabama Development Office reported recent capital investment in new or expanding industrial mineral operations to be more than $20 million. This included crushed stone, common clay (for brick and tile), and fire clay (Alabama Development Office, 2001). Another record in the production of crushed stone (limestone, dolomite, granite, marble, sandstone, and quartzite) in Alabama was reported for 2001. Birmingham, Alabama-based Vulcan Materials Co. remained the largest construction aggregate producer in the country. The State's newest dimension stone operation was inactive during the year due to litigation (Faulk, 2001). This operation was the first to market Silurian age varicolored limestone quarried in Lauderdale County, AL. More information on geology, hydrology, occurrence, mining history, and general economics of specific mineral resources in Alabama is available from the Geological Survey of Alabama.

GX252-40-8671960	"T  HE  MINERAL I  NDUSTRY OF  NEW YORK  This chapter has been prepared under a Memorandum of Understanding between the U.S. Bureau of Mines, U.S. Department of the Interior, and the New York Education Department, New York Geological Survey, for collecting information on all nonfuel minerals.  In 1996, New York, for the second consecutive year, ranked 15th in the Nation in total nonfuel mineral production value,1 according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The estimated value for 1996 was $891 million, an increase of 0.6%, or $5 million, from that of 1995. This followed a decrease of smaller magnitude from 1994 to 1995 (based on final 1995 data). The State accounted for more than 2% of the U.S. total nonfuel mineral production value. In 1996, crushed stone, by value, remained New York's leading nonfuel mineral, followed by portland cement, salt, and construction sand and gravel. About 90% of the State's nonfuel mineral production value came from industrial minerals and mineral products. Primarily, these were (in descending order of value) crushed stone, portland cement, salt, construction sand and gravel, and wollastonite. Zinc accounted for the major portion of metal production and value. Although the State's increase in nonfuel mineral value in 1996 was small compared with that of 1995, there were significant changes in individual commodities. The $28-million combined increase of crushed stone and construction sand and gravel values more than balanced the substantial decrease in the value of salt (see table 1.) Compared with 1995, other nonfuel minerals that increased in value in 1996 were as follows: wollastonite, industrial garnet, lead, silver, and peat. Decreases occurred in portland cement, zinc, dimension stone, masonry cement, crude gypsum, and talc. The State's small net decrease in nonfuel mineral value in 1995 mainly resulted from even larger changes in individual commodities than those of 1996. In 1995, substantial decreases in the values of salt and crushed stone plus a relatively small decrease in construction sand and gravel were more than offset by the significant increase in the value of portland cement (see table 1) plus smaller increases in wollastonite, zinc, and common clays. Based on USGS estimates of the quantities produced in the 50 States in 1996, New York remained the only State to produce wollastonite, second of two garnetproducing States, and third in the production of zinc. While the State climbed from fourth to third in the production of talc, it dropped from third to fourth in salt. Additionally, New York mining and mineral processing operations produced significant quantities of crushed  stone, portland cement, construction sand and gravel, common clays, dimension stone, and masonry cement. The following narrative information was provided by the New York State Geological Survey2 (NYSGS). During 1996, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) issued 312 mining permits. Active mines in New York totaled 2,527, of which 1,828 were operated by members of the mineral industry and the remainder by municipal owners. Total value of the financial security held by New York to guarantee reclamation procedures was nearly $63 million. The NYSGS reported that the Akzo-Nobel (Retsof) salt mine was completely flooded by early January 1996. Seismic activity and subsidence associated with dissolution of salt in the mine and consequent closure of the mine cavities diminished dramatically. The NYSGS discontinued seismic monitoring in April, completing 24 months of continuous operation of three seismographs. Salt shipments continued from the stockpile. The NYSDEC issued a permit to Akzo-Nobel Salt Inc. to construct a $140-million salt mine at Hampton's Corners, NY, approximately 5 kilometers from the former Akzo salt mine in Retsof, NY. Plans for groundbreaking for a new mine shaft in midyear were abruptly aborted when a decision was made by Akzo-Nobel N.V. of the Netherlands not to construct a new mine in Hampton's Corners. At the time of the decision, a valid mining permit from New York State was in hand and the rights to mine salt under approximately 22,200 hectares (9,000 acres) had been acquired. Test drilling at the new mine site was complete, and a mining plan had been submitted to State and local officials. At the time of the announcement of the decision not to pursue a new mine, the company reported that the Retsof facility would be used as a ""distribution center."" Salt shipments by way of truck continued from a stockpile throughout 1996. The salt packaging plant operated until the end of the year. Legislative attention, aroused by the failure of the Akzo-Nobel salt mine, focused on the underground mining industry in New York. Regulatory bills were introduced in both houses of the State Legislature. The proposed legislation rose from the floor of the State Assembly and was introduced in the State Senate as part of the 1  NEW YORK--1996   Governor's program. If passed, the proposed legislation would have clarified and expanded the State's jurisdiction over underground noncoal mining in New York State. But ultimately, no legislation was passed into law. In addition, legislative hearings began in the fall of 1996 on a proposed new wollastonite mine at Oak Hill, NY, operated by NYCO Minerals Inc. NYCO currently operates a wollastonite mine at Lewis, NY. No permit decision had been reached by yearend. ---------- 1 The terms ""nonfuel mineral production"" and related ""values"" encompass variations in meaning, depending on the minerals or mineral products.

GX238-09-2757643	"MINI-PLATE BOUNDARY OBSERVATORY science for a changing world Project Name: Mini-Plate Boundary Observatory  Principal Investigators: Paul Silver, Carnegie Institute of Washington Barbara Romanowicz, UC - Berkeley Malcolm Johnston, U. S. Geological Survey Yehuda Bock, UC - San Diego Estimated Start Date: Duration of Study: June 2001 Ongoing  PBO Project Summary Abstract The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) recently released a report on the probability of a magnitude 7 earthquake occurring in the San Francisco Bay Area. There is a 70% chance that one or more of the Bay Area's many active faults may produce such an event near its population centers. Crustal deformation studies are currently underway aimed at improving the analysis of seismic hazards. During the summer of 2001, the USGS plans to build several new deformation stations in the Bay Area as part of the prototype Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) program. These stations will expand an existing network of Bay Area sites instrumented to measure deformation within the seismically active zone of the tectonic plate boundary between the Pacific and North American plates. Deformation will be measured using borehole strainmeters, seismometers, pore pressure, and GPS (Global Positioning System) receivers. Some of these instruments will be installed at the surface while others will be cemented to solid bedrock at depths between 400 and 800 feet down a borehole. They will provide the information needed to see geodetic strain, microearthquake activity, and deformation at depth.  Problem Statement Nearly all earthquake and volcanic hazards exist along zones of concentrated crustal deformation at the tectonic plate margins of the earth. The plate boundary between the Pacific and North American plates, particularly in the Bay Area along the San Andreas fault, produces large earthquakes and crosses large urban populations, placing many people and much property in peril. Previous geodetic studies of crustal deformation relied upon costly and, at times, unreliable, periodic survey data. Since the mid-1990's, advancements in technology and a new focus of funding have enabled the creation of a network of stations providing continuous recording.  allows earthquake source details and details of fault slip to be determined. Seismometers will compliment surface geodetic data by registering earthquake vibrations generated at seismogenic depths. All data collected by the crustal deformation network would be available on the internet.  Methods Station installations include borehole 3-component strainmeter and seismic instruments at a depth of 400 to 800 feet. A GPS (Global Positioning System) antenna will be installed at the surface, using the borehole casing as part of a stable monument. A description of the station installation procedure follows. Stage One : Borehole Drilling Drilling of a 10"" - 11"" diameter borehole using fresh water, drilling mud and/or bentonite and/or nontoxic biodegradable viscosifiers, to a maximum depth of 800 feet. The borehole is cased with a cemented 6"" steel casing. A GPS antenna monument would be placed over the borehole casing necessitating special borehole location providing a largely unobstructed sky view to the east, south, and west. All required environmental codes for the construction of boreholes will be met.  Objectives Ongoing recordings from geophysical stations will produce deformation and seismic information used to study plate boundary loading and seismic hazards. GPS measurements provide overall crustal movements at periods of a month or longer. Strainmeter measurements provide high precision deformation data at periods of milliseconds to months. This   400 - 800 ft  Stage Two : Instrument Installation If stable, unfractured basement rock is encountered at a depth of 400 to 800 feet, a 10 - 40 foot core sample would be removed below the casing. Next a strainmeter would be grouted within the cored section, which would then be covered with 20 feet of cement. A seismic package would then be placed next in line followed by other instruments. Finally, the hole would be filled with cement to the surface. Where allowed, to conserve water, recycled water would be used for drilling. Stage Three : Electronics and Recorder Installation The following instruments would be housed in a concrete block enclosure at the surface approximately 25 feet from the borehole: data acquisition recorders, satellite transmitters, rechargeable batteries, atmospheric pressure transducers, and seismometer electronics. Connection to nearby power (solar may be an option) and phone lines would be required. Equipment visible at the surface might include: 1) 6'x6'x8' high concrete block structure, 2) a GPS antenna monument (10"" diameter x 4' casing extension with 18"" diameter dome top) over the borehole, 3) satellite (12"" x 24"") and radio (8"" x 12"") antennas mounted on a galvanized metal pole ~10' tall. Should visual screening of equipment be decided as necessary, the USGS will provide installation of plant materials, or other landowner approved remedy. After installation is complete, annual maintenance visits would be required to retrieve on-site records and reset digital clocks.  U. S.

The guidelines describe the locations and the types of instruments to be used for several ""typical"" buildings in Seismic Zones 3 and 4. A typical cost is included for a ""typical"" instrumented building. The main objective of the seismic instrumentation program for structural systems is to improve our understanding of the behavior and potential for damage of structures under the dynamic loads of earthquakes. This will be achieved through the development of an integrated network that measures the earthquake source, transmitted ground motions, and structural response. These measurements will be correlated with observations of structural performance to evaluate current design and construction practices in order to minimize damage to buildings during future earthquakes.   Instrumentation of structures requires multiple single-channels rather than a tri-axial unit used for free-field deployment. Instrumentation of structures needs interconnection of cables between the accelerometers and recorders for common-time recording. Until such time when wireless/remote motion detection/recording is feasible, reliable, and readily available, cables will have to be used to achieve common-time recording. Furthermore, recent digital systems with GPS options require additional cable connection between the GPS unit (which has to be placed at the roof or appropriate location so that the GPS unit can see the sky) and the recording unit. There are installation costs. In some cases, this can be minimal and in other cases it can be substantial. The installation costs include conduits, pulling cables and electrical wiring. Finally, there is the maintenance, data retrieval, processing and dissemination issue. In the past, with analog instruments, this was a major problem. However with recent advances and improvements on digital accelerograph systems, the cost to maintain, retrieve, process and disseminate data from such systems will be lower.      WHY INSTRUMENT FEDERALLY OWNED BUILDINGS?  In general, it buildings. In state (public) surveys. Part  is very difficult to pursuade private property owners to instrument their most cases, it is not possible to get private property owners to allow federal or agencies to deploy seismic instruments or conduct comprehensive damage of the problem for building owners is the concern for possible future litigation.  5   This problem can be circumvented by instrumenting federally owned/leased structures. Federally owned/leased buildings will not require permits to deploy instruments by a federal agency nor will they be closed to federal inspection teams following a damaging earthquake. Making the connection between recording strong ground motions and documenting building performance is essential to a national earthquake-engineering program. For example, very few (only 2) steel buildings that were damaged during the 1994 Northridge (California) earthquake were instrumented (only minimally). On the other hand, more than 300 steelframed buildings that are being investigated for possible damage did not have any instruments in them.  Instrumentation of federally owned and leased buildings supports the aims of the 1977 National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act which refers to priorities such as:    Assist in developing improved building codes Assess earthquake hazards in federal facilities.  Instrumentation of federally owned and leased buildings is also compatible with the spirit of the Public Law 101-614 NEHRP Reauthorization Act. Section 8(a)(1) of this law states: ""The president shall adopt, not later than December 1, 1994, standards for assessing and enhancing the seismic safety of existing buildings constructed for or leased by the Federal Government...."" Instrumentation of new and existing federal buildings is particularly important in light of Executive Orders 12941 (Seismic Safety of Existing Buildings) signed in December 1, 1994 and Executive Order 12699 (Seismic Safety of New Buildings) signed on January 5, 1990. These two Executive Orders demonstrate both the concern and the need for safety of both the personnel that work within the buildings and the public that use the buildings. Public safety will be enhanced by seismic instrumentation because seismic instrumentation will provide important data to:     Assess the causes of damage, if any. Develop the best methods to repair damaged structures. Assess the vulnerability of the buildings Evaluate the dynamic characteristics of the buildings for planning for and selection of the best methods to strengthen and retrofit structures, if necessary.      There are approximately 84,000 federally owned and 5000 federally leased buildings in Seismic Areas 3 and 4 (as defined in the Seismic Zone Map of the United States in the Uniform Building Code [UBC 1997]). The acquisition value of these buildings is $16 billion. This figure does not include contents. Therefore, protection of property is also an issue. The distribution of federally owned/leased properties are illustrated in Table ES-1 and Figure ES-1 (both from GAO/GGS 92-62 Quake Threatened Buildings, 1992). Instrumentation of federal buildings therefore will lead to improvements in the seismic performance of the buildings, thus resulting in safety to employees and the public, and to protection of public property.  6      Federal agencies should set an example by instrumenting federally owned/leased buildings. Evolution of new technologies in earthquake resistant design, construction and retrofit practices requires systematic and efficient verification of the performance of structures built with the new technologies or retrofitted with new methods. Such verification can only be accomplished by strategically deploying seismic sensors in such structures to record their performances during future events. Several federal buildings in seismic areas are being retrofitted by such emerging technologies (e.g. VA Hospital in Long Beach, Court of Appeals Building in San Francisco [both buildings using base-isolation], a Navy Building in San Diego [using viscous-elastic dampers]).

INTRODUCTION  There are three main approaches to evaluate seismic behavior and performance of structural systems. 1. Laboratory Testing: Subsystems, components, or (if the facility is large enough) prototypes or large, scaled models of complete systems are tested under static, quasistatic, or dynamic loading. This approach does not necessarily demand a timedependent testing scheme, such as a shaking table or hydraulically powered and electronically controlled loading systems; however, testing of structural systems under controlled simulated environments is desirable. Since the early 1950's such laboratory research has increased both in quantity and quality, with engineering colleges in the United States playing a key role. Laboratory testing has also contributed substantially to our understanding of dynamic soil properties and the interaction phenomenon between the soil and structure. 2. Computerized Analyses: Using special purpose public-domain or private software, structures are analyzed for prescribed loads determined either by code provisions or postulated site-specific ground motions. 3. Natural Laboratory of the Earth: The third main approach to evaluate the behavior and performance of structural systems is to use the natural laboratory of the Earth, by observing and studying the performance (and possibly the damage to structures) following earthquakes. By determining why specific designs lack earthquake resistance and then by using extensive laboratory testing of modified designs, significant progress in improved designs can be achieved. For such design studies a natural laboratory would be a seismically prone area that offers a variety of structural systems; in optimum test areas, strong ground motions as well as moderate-level motions would be experienced frequently. Integral to the ""natural laboratory"" approach is the advance instrumentation of selected structures so that their responses can be recorded during future earthquakes. Thus, it is essential that integrated arrays of instrumentation be planned and installed to assess thoroughly the relation of ground motion that starts at a source and is transmitted through various soils to a substructure and finally to a superstructure. The direction for seismologists and engineers working together is clear; to develop integrated networks which measure the seismic source, the transmittal of ground motion, and the structural response processes. I.1 Objectives for Seismic Instrumentation of Structures  The main objective of seismic instrumentation program for structural systems is to improve our understanding of the behavior and potential for damage of structures under the dynamic loads of earthquakes. As a result of this understanding, design and construction practices can be modified so that future earthquake damage is minimized.  10   An instrumentation program should provide enough information to reconstruct the response of the structure in enough detail to compare with the response predicted by mathematical models and those observed in laboratories, the goal being to improve the models. In addition, the data should make it possible to explain the reasons for any damage to the structure. The nearby free-field and ground-level time history should be known in order to quantify the interaction of soil and structure. More specifically, a well-instrumented structure for which a complete set of recordings has been obtained should provide useful information to: (1) check the appropriateness of the dynamic model (both lumped-mass and finite element) in the elastic range, (2) determine the importance of nonlinear behavior on the overall and local response of the structure, (3) follow the spreading nonlinear behavior throughout the structure as the response increases and determine the effect of this nonlinear behavior on the frequency and damping, (4) correlate the damage with inelastic behavior, (5) determine the ground-motion parameters that correlate well with building response damage, and (6) make recommendations eventually to improve seismic codes (elebi and others, 1987). (7) facilitate decisions to retrofit/strengthen the structural system as well as securing the contents within the structures. I.2 Scope  The scope of this report is intended to consider issues that are related to instrumentation of structures and a variety of structural instrumentation schemes including those at free-field near structures. Thus, we are concerned mainly with how actually the real structures respond to on-scale earthquakes. Ultimately, the data obtained should reveal the performance of the subject structure at a particular site. I.3 Code versus Extensive Instrumentation  The most widely used code in the United States, the Uniform Building Code (UBC-1997 and prior editions), recommends, for seismic zones 3 and 4, a minimum of three accelerographs be placed in every building over six stories with an aggregate floor areas of 60,000 square feet or more, and in every building over ten stories regardless of the floor area. The purpose of this requirement by the UBC was to monitor rather than to analyze. UBC-Code type instrumentation is illustrated in Figure 1a. The UBC-type instrumentation, because it is designed for monitoring, is not necessarily a useful first stage for the instrumentation being discussed. Experiences from past earthquakes show that the UBC minimum guidelines do not ensure sufficient data to perform meaningful model verifications. As an example, three horizontal accelerometers are required to define the horizontal motion of a floor (two translations and torsion). Rojahn and Matthiesen (1977) concluded that the predominant response of a high-rise building can be described by the  11   participation of the first four modes of each of the three sets of modes (two translations and torsion); therefore, a minimum of 12 accelerometers would be necessary to record these modes. If vertical motion and rocking are expected to be significant and need to be recorded, at least three vertical accelerometers are required at the basement level. This type of instrumentation scheme is called the ideal extensive instrumentation scheme herein and is illustrated in Figure 1b. Figures 1c and 1d illustrate typical special purpose instrumentations. Diaphragm effects are best captured by adding sensors at the center of the diaphragm as well as the edges (Figure 1c).  Figure 1. Typical Instrumentation Schemes Performance of base-isolated systems and effectiveness of the isolators are best captured by measuring tri-axial motions at top and bottom of the isolators as well as the rest of the superstructure (Figure 1d). Furthermore, high-precision record synchronization must be available within a structure if the response time histories are to be used together to reconstruct the overall behavior of the structure. Rojahn and Raggett (1981) provided some additional guidelines for the instrumentation of bridges, and instrumentation of earth dams has been addressed by Fedock (1982). Within the last decade plus, system identification techniques have made it possible to identify structural characteristics (modal frequencies, modal damping) using recorded responses of  12   structures (Ljung, 1987). These methods have evolved into single-input single-output and multi-input multi-output versions that enable construction of modal shapes. Like the superstructure, the foundation system needs to be instrumented to study its response. This is easily accommodated along the instrumentation scheme of the superstructure. Placing sensors at critical locations of the foundation to capture all its relevant motions will at a minimum facilitate study of its behavior. However, more information is required to interpret the motion of the foundation substructure relative to the ground on which it rests. Engineers use free-field motions as input motion at the foundation level, or they obtain the motion at foundation level by convoluting the motion through assumed or determined layers of strata to base rock and deconvoluting the motion back to foundation level. To confirm these processes requires downhole instrumentation near or directly beneath a structure. Downhole data are especially scarce, although a few such arrays have been developed outside of the United States. These downhole arrays will serve to yield data on: (1) the characteristics of ground motion at bedrock at a defined distance from a source and (2) the amplification of seismic waves in layered strata. Instrumentation needs of a structure have been addressed by Rojahn and Matthiesen (1977), Hart and Rojahn (1979) and elebi and others (1987). I.4 Current Programs for Instrumentation of Structures  Programs for instrumentation of structures can be classified into three categories: 1. Federal Programs. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has its own nationwide instrumentation program. In addition, if requested, USGS will coordinate, install, maintain, and process the data acquired from strong-motion arrays and structures instrumented by various Federal agencies, state and local governments and private organizations. 2. State Programs. In California, the State Division of Mines and Geology (CDMG) has the responsibility to develop strong-motion arrays to instrument typical structures within the State of California (Shakal, 1984). Other states (for example, Alaska) have similar programs. 3. Private Institutions. Some private institutions such as International Business Machines (IBM), Kaiser Permanente (Kaiser), University of Southern California (USC) have developed their own instrumentation programs. Through these programs, more than 400 structures are known to be instrumented (National Research Council, 1982). Although these networks, particularly the USGS, CDMG, and USC networks, were designed with full cooperation, maintenance of these instruments and data processing are done by each program separately; therefore, at present there is no national coordination of efforts (National Research Council, 1982). Similar concerns were aired 13   during a national strong-motion instrumentation workshop (Iwan, 1981). However, recently, a new organization, Consortium of Organizations for Strong-Motion Observation Systems (COSMOS, 1999) has been incorporated to fill this void.  14   II.  STEPS IN INSTRUMENTING A STRUCTURE  II.1 Selection of Structures to be Instrumented In selecting structures for seismic instrumentation, unless other factors are considered and/or specific organizational choices are made a priority, the following general parameters can be followed to rank structures for instrumentation: 1. Structural parameters: the construction material, structural system, geometry, discontinuity, and age, 2. Site-related parameters: a. Severity-of-shaking factor to be assigned to each structure on the basis of its closeness to one or more of the main faults within the boundaries of the area considered (e.g. for the San Francisco Bay area, the San Andreas, Hayward, and Calaveras faults are considered). b. Probability of a large earthquake (M = 6.5 or 7 occurring on the fault(s) within the next 30 years was obtained. The purpose of this parameter is to consider the regions where there is strong chance of recording useful data within an approximately useful life of a structure. c. Expected value of strong shaking at the site, determined as the product of a and b. The next step in ranking structures is to assign rational weighting factors for structural parameters and site-related parameters. A ranked list of structures emerges from this effort. As an example, the USGS, with input from an Instrumentation Advisory Committee for the San Francisco Bay Area, in 1983 developed a recommended list of structures for seismic instrumentation and rank them according to a rational set of parameters and criteria (elebi and others, 1984). Once the particular structure to be instrumented is identified, the engineering staff in turn obtains instrumentation permits for selected structures, gathers information relative to the project including structural plans and design and model information, and directs structural evaluation and if necessary performs ambient response studies. II. 2 Requisite Information Once it is decided to instrument a particular structure and permit is obtained, it is imperative that a series of studies, deductions, and decisions be made. Furthermore, it is important to optimize the instrumentation schemes from the points of view of both cost and required data. This necessitates study of the expected dynamic behavior of the structure. The preliminary studies include the following steps: (1) study of available design and analysis information after permission for instrumenting is granted by the owner, (2) site visit, and (3) required analytical studies and tests, if feasible and necessary. 15   In general, (1) (2) (3)  the following information, if available, will be required: relevant blueprints and design calculations, dynamic analysis (mode shapes and frequencies), if available, forced-vibration test results, and ambient-vibration test results.  Seldom is all this information available for any structure. In particular, for a structure that is yet to be constructed, blueprints, design calculations and if available, dynamic analyses may be all the information to design its instrumentation scheme so that part of installations of conduits and cables can be feasibly carried out during construction. The collected set of data is then used as a basis for determining transducer locations that will adequately define the response of the structure during a strong earthquake. After the sensor locations have been agreed upon by the engineering staff, the installation team, a representative of the owner of the structure, and an electrical contractor is called in to plan placement of the data cable. The installation team works with the contractor during this phase and subsequently calibrates and installs sensors and recording systems. A final step is a complete documentation of each transducer location and orientation, characteristics of total system response, and any peculiarities of the instrumentation or access to required sites. These steps are described in more detail in the following section. II.3 Site Visit A general scheme can be prepared after a study of the blueprints and other available information related to dynamic characteristics. However, the general scheme for locating instruments needs to be confirmed by a site visit (for existing buildings). The structure may present various constraints that affect safe installation and reliable performance of the sensors. The site visit enables the technical personnel to make relevant changes in the prepared schemes. II.4 Importance of Building Specific Free-Field Station If physically feasible, it is advisable to include into the instrumentation scheme, a building specific free-field station. Such a free-field station is usually deployed at a distance greater than 1.5-2 times the height of the nearest/tallest building. This is due to the desire that motions recorded by a free-field station should not be influenced by the shaking of the buildings. As can be expected, in urban areas, this may be a problem due to the density of built facilities. In general, free-field and ground-level motions should be known in order to quantify the interaction of soil and structure. However, data recorded at building specific free-field stations can be used to augment data bases used for structural response studies as well as ground motion studies including development of attenuation relationships and quantification of site response transfer functions and characteristics.  16   II.5 Tests on Existing Structures to Determine Dynamic Characteristics Although it is possible to obtain a satisfactory understanding of a structure's expected dynamic behavior by preliminary analytical studies, when feasible and necessary, an ambient-vibration and/or a forced vibration test on an existing structure can be performed to identify mode shapes and frequencies. Ambient vibration tests can be performed efficiently using portable recorders at three to five locations that are expected (from analytical studies or other information) to have maximum amplitudes during the first three to four vibrational modes. Thus, elastic properties of the structure can be determined. If the subject structure experiences nonlinear behavior during a strong shaking, it will be much easier to evaluate the nonlinear behavior once linear behavior is determines before the nonlinear behavior occurs during the strong shaking. Compared to ambient-vibration test, a forced-vibration test is more difficult to perform. The required equipment (vibration generator with control consoles, weights, recorders, accelerometers, and cables) is heavier, and the test takes longer than the ambient-vibration test. Furthermore, state-of-the-art vibration generators do not necessarily have the capability to excite to resonance all significant modes of all structures (elebi and others, 1987). II.6 Dynamic Analysis If a dynamic analysis was not prepared by the designers of a structure or the information is unavailable, then a simplified finite-element model could be developed to obtain the elastic dynamic characteristics. This is performed with any one of the several tested computer programs available (e.g. SAP2000, ANSYS, and STRUDL).  17   III. SELECTION AND INSTALLATION OF INSTRUMENTS In selection and defining an instrumentation scheme, an optimum list of hardware is developed after careful consideration of cost and data requirements. Appendix A describes technical capabilities of commercially available sample sensors and recording systems. While developing the instrumentation scheme within the budgetary constraints, it is best to consider the maximum available channels for each recording system. Most recording systems have maximum of 12 or 18 channels of recording capability. The following general approach is followed to install seismic instruments: 1. After an instrumentation scheme is developed and approximate sensor locations are chosen, USGS engineers and technicians and the owner's representative review the site to determine exact sensor locations and routing of cables and conduits, if required, satisfactory to both parties. This is important from viewpoint of long-term accessibility, potential interference with the occupant's space, placement of data cable runs, and aesthetic requirements of the owner. Figure 2 exhibits a sample schematic showing locations of sensors, routing of cables, location of junction boxes and recording units. 2. Next the USGS technician inspects the entire structural scheme with an electrical contractor who will install the data cable, junction boxes at key locations and terminal boxes (if required) at each sensor site. The modern recording systems may not require terminal boxes (see Appendix A - e.g. Mt. Whitney1) as they have internal terminals. Actual cabling by the contractor is monitored by the USGS and the owner's representative to be sure the cable is installed as desired and that all building code regulations are followed. 3. The cable-termination box (if necessary) is prepared in the USGS shop and includes data circuits, batteries and battery charges. This box is normally mounted on the wall above the recorder. The recorder location is selected on the basis of security, typically in a telephone or electrical switch room, and in some circumstances is enclosed with separate fencing in an open area. 4. The instrumentation undergoes a preliminary calibration in the strong-motion laboratory and is then installed in the structure with appropriate test procedures including a static tilt sensitivity test for each component and determination of direction of motion for upward trace deflection on the record. For modern digital systems, this information is entered into the recorder data section and is stored in a general database. Other documentation includes precise sensor location, period and damping of each unit, location of cable runs, access information, and circuit diagrams.  1  Quotation of brand names does not constitute endorsement of any particular product.  18   IV.  MAINTENANCE  It is essential to have periodic and consistent maintenance of instruments in order to have a successful program. Unless maintenance arrangements are made, successful recording of data cannot be accomplished. Therefore, routine maintenance is conducted every 3-12 months if circumstances and experience so allow. This maintenance includes the following:  Figure 2. Schematic showing typical deployment of sensors and routing of cables to the recorder. 1. Remote calibration of period and damping. 2. Inspection of battery terminals, load voltage, and charge rate (batteries are replaced every 3 years). 3. Measurement of threshold of triggering system and length of recording cycle. As a final maintenance procedure, a calibration record is obtained and then examined for the desired characteristics. All inspection procedures are recorded in the permanent station file at the laboratory.  19   V.  DATA RETRIEVAL AND PROCESSING  Modern strong motion instruments now have capabilities to store and transmit digital data through telecommunications links and other media, including the WWW (Appendix A). This communication makes data retrieval easier and faster than with older analog systems, where data were retrieved only by site visits to collect the films and required digitizing by manual or automatic systems. Currently only digital systems are manufactured, so that as the older analog systems are replaced data retrieval and processing will become easier. However, data retrieval by telecommunications has additional hardware costs as well as monthly subscription costs. 1. The data from digital recordings are passed through a correction algorithm that applies a high-frequency filter (typically 50 Hz), instrument corrections, if necessary, and decimation to 200 samples per second. A low-cut Butterworth filter (or another appropriate filter) removes all periods longer than a predetermined period from the data. This period is chosen after consideration of the strong-motion duration of the records, any distortion during pre-event signals, displacements calculated at specific sites, and displacements of adjacent film and digital recordings at specific sites. Plots of the corrected acceleration, velocity, and displacements for each channel of recording are prepared. 2. Response spectra are calculated for periods up to about half of the long-period limit. Linear plots of relative-velocity response spectra and the log-log tripartite plots of pseudo-velocity response are prepared. 3. Fourier amplitude spectra, calculated by fast Fourier transform, are presented on linear axes and log-log axes. These sets of processed data are then provided to the user community for their evaluation, assessment of facilities and structures, and research.  20   VI.  UTILIZATION OF DATA FROM INSTRUMENTED STRUCTURES  VI.1 General Seismic monitoring of structural systems constitutes an integral part of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program in the United States and similar programs in other countries. Recordings of the acceleration response of structures have served the scientific and engineering community well and have been useful in assessing design/analysis procedures, improving code provisions and in correlating the system response with damage. Table 1 summarizes some of the uses for the data from instrumented structures. Unfortunately, only a few damaged structures have been instrumented in advance to perform studies of the initation and progression of damage during strong shaking (e.g. Imperial County Services Building during the 1979 Imperial Valley earthquake, [Rojahn and Mork, 1981]). In the future, instrumentation programs should consider this deficiency. Jennings (1997) summarizes this view as follows: ""As more records become available and understood, it seems inevitable that the process of earthquake resistant design will be increasingly, and quite appropriately, based more and more upon records and measured properties of materials, and less and less upon empiricism and qualitative assessments of earthquake performance. This process is well along now in the design of special structures"". The methods used in studying structural response records are quite diverse: (a) mathematical modeling (finite element models varying from crude to very detailed, subjected to timehistory, response spectrum or modal analyses). The procedure requires the blueprints of the structures which may not be readily accessible; (b) system identification techniques: single input/single output or multi input/multi output. In these procedures, the parameters of a model are adjusted for consistency with input and output data (Ljung, 1987); (c) spectral analyses: response spectra, Fourier amplitude spectra, autospectra, Sx or Sy, cross-spectral amplitudes Sxy, and coherence functions () [using the equation : 2 xy (f) = S2xy (f) / Sx (f)Sy (f) ] and associated phase angles (Bendat and Piersol, 1980); and (d) simple procedures based on principles of structural dynamics (e.g. recently Jennings (1997) analyzed data from two buildings within close proximity (<20 km) to the Northridge epicenter, calculated the base shear from the records as 8 and 17 % of the weights of the buildings, drift ratios as 0.8 and 1.6 % (exceeding code limitations). Jennings (1997) states: ""A difference between code design values and measured earthquake responses of this magnitude  approaching a factor of ten  is not a tenable situation."" Until recently, in general, only accelerometers (single, biaxial or triaxial) were used to instrument structures. However, observations of damages during the 1994 Northridge and 1995 Kobe earthquakes, have forced engineers and scientists to focus on performance based seismic design methods and to find new techniques to control drift and displacements. To verify these developments, sensors directly measuring displacements or relative displacements (transducers, laser devices and GPS units) are now being considered. A recent development in using differential GPS measurements for monitoring long-period structures is summarized by elebi and others (1999).  21   VI.2A Sample Case: Pacific Park Plaza (Emeryville, Ca.) The 30-story reinforced concrete Pacific Park Plaza Building (PPP) is an equally spaced three-winged, cast-in-place, ductile, moment-resistant framed structure. Constructed in 1983 and instrumented in 1985, it is the tallest reinforced concrete building in northern California. A general view, a plan view, a three-dimensional schematic, and its instrumentation are shown in Figure 3 (elebi, 1992, 1996). The building with a 5-ft mat foundation rests on 828 (14-inch-square) prestressed concrete friction piles, each 20-25 m in length, in a primarily softsoil environment, with an average shear-wave velocity between 250 and 300 m/s and a depth of approximately 150 m to harder soil.  Figure 3. Plan layout and three-dimensional schematic and instrumentation scheme of Pacific Park Plaza (PPP), Emeryville, CA. The planning for the instrumentation scheme of PPP was achieved after study of the blueprints and after giving careful consideration to the available dynamic analyses and lowamplitude test results. The building was subjected to dynamic analysis and forced-vibration testing by means of a vibration generator (Stephen, written commun., 1984). The important vibrational characteristics (mode shapes and frequencies) are provided in Figure 4 (Stephen, 1984). From the study of the mode shapes, vibrational data from ground level, the thirteenth and twenty-first floors, and the roof were determined to be most useful. Therefore, instruments placed on each of these levels (Fig. 3) includes two orthogonal sensors at the core as well as an additional sensor at the end of each wing at levels other than the ground level. By obtaining translational accelerations at the core and the wings, it will be possible to determine the translational modes of the core and differential translation or torsional vibrations of the wings. Although analytical models of this building indicate that the assumption of flexible  22   foundations does not alter the vibrational characteristics of the building (Stephen, 1984), it is essential to confirm it by means of four vertical sensors (one at the core and one at each wing) at ground level. In addition, a triaxial strong-motion accelerograph is deployed at a free-field site on the south side of the building (SFF or EMV2,3). Thus, a total of 24 sensors (FBA-11) linked to two central recorders (now updated to two digital 12-channel K-2 recording systems) provide a practical instrumentation scheme for this building.  Figure 4. Translational and torsional mode shapes of Pacific Park Plaza (Stephen, 1984) During the Ms=7.1 Loma Prieta earthquake of October 17, 1989, a complete set of records were obtained from the Pacific Park Plaza (PPP). The building, at 100 km from the epicenter of the earthquake, had considerably amplified input motions but was not damaged during the earthquake. The east-west components of acceleration recorded at the roof and the ground floor of the structure, at the associated free-field station (SFF in Fig. 3) and, for comparison, the motion at Yerba Buena Island (YBI), the closest rock site with a peak acceleration of 0.06 g, are shown in Figure 5. The response spectra also shown in Figure 5 clearly demonstrate that the motions at EMV were amplified by as much as five times when compared with YBI. In most studies, the site of south free-field (SFF) is referred to as the Emeryville site (EMV). In 1997, the analog recording instruments at Emeryville were upgrade to digital. A downhole accelerograph was installed at the same location as the surface free-field station, SFF. 3 2  23   Amplification is also indicated by the amplitude of the peak accelerations (0.26 g for EMV and 0.06 g for YBI). The differences in peak acceleration at the free-field station (0.26 g) and at the ground floor of the building (0.21 g) (Fig. 5a) suggest that there was soil-structure interaction (SSI). In the design of the building, site-specific design response spectra (based on three probabilistic earthquakes based on expected levels of performance) were used: (a) the maximum probable earthquake (50 % probability of being exceeded in 50 years with 5 % damping) anchored at zero period acceleration (ZPA) of 0.32g, and two maximum credible earthquakes both with 10 % damping but 10 % probability of being exceeded in (b) 50 years [ZPA of 0.53 g] and (c) 100 years [ZPA of 0.63 g]. The design response spectra and the spectrum of the EW component of recorded motion at the SFF are shown in Figure 6. The ZPA of the recorded EW acceleration at SFF (0.26 g) (at 100 km from the epicenter) is close to that of the postulated maximum probable earthquake (0.32 g). Furthermore, the spectral accelerations of the EW component of SFF is considerably higher than the maximum probable earthquake for periods >0.6 seconds  that is, practically for the first three modes of the building. Therefore, one important conclusion derived from the records is that improvements are necessary in establishing site-specific design response spectra to account for realistic shaking at a specific site taking into account expected future closer earthquakes likely to produce larger peak accelerations.  Figure 5. Recorded (EW components) of accelerations and corresponding response spectra at the free-field, ground floor and roof of Pacific Park Plaza (PPP), and at Yerba Buena Island (YBI), at approximately the same distance as PPP, depict the level of amplification.  24   Table 1.

Design response spectra and response spectra of recorded motions at the ground floor and SFF of Pacific Park Plaza. Also shown is the 1979 UBC response spectrum for comparison. 25   Using different methods, the building has been studied in detail by Anderson and Bertero (1994), Anderson and others (1991), Kagawa and others (1993), Kagawa and Al-Khatib (1993), Aktan and others (1992), Kambhatla and others (1992) and elebi and Safak (1992). All investigators agree that the predominant three response modes of the building and the associated frequencies (periods) are 0.38 Hz (2.63 s), 0.95 Hz (1.05 s), and 1.95 Hz (0.51 s). These three modes of the building are torsionally-translationally coupled (elebi, 1996) and are depicted in the cross-spectra (Sxy) of the orthogonal records obtained from the roof, ground floor and SFF (the south free-field site) (Figure 7) and the normalized cross-spectra of the orthogonal records (bottom right in Figure 7). The frequency at 0.7 Hz (1.43 s) observed in the spectra is this site frequency (elebi, 1996). System identification techniques, when applied to the records of this building, yielded unusually large damping ratios corresponding to the 0.38-Hz first-mode frequency [11.6 % (NS) and 15.5 % (EW)] [Table 2] (elebi, 1996a). Such unusually high damping ratios attributed to a conventionally designed/constructed building with its large mat foundation in a relatively soft geotechnical environment is due to radiation (or foundation) or material damping. This is one of two cases where large damping percentages implied by the recorded responses of buildings have been attributed to radiation damping; the other case is from the Olive View Hospital in Sylmar, Ca.  data from the Northridge earthquake (elebi, 1997).

Also shown (bottom right) is the normalized cross-spectrum depicting structural and site frequency peaks. (350 & 260 depict degrees clockwise from true north).  26   Table 2.

Also, it is noted in Table 2 that although flexibility of the foundation was considered in the 1985 analyses, the structural frequency remained the same as the frequency determined with fixed base assumption. Clearly, the mathematical models developed at that time needed improvements. This conclusion could only be reached because we have recorded on scale motions. Most recent studies indicate that the frequencies from recorded motions can be matched when soil-structure interaction (SSI) is incorporated into the mathematical models (Kagawa and others, 1993; Aktan and others, 1992; Kambhatla and others, 1992). Furthermore, a study of the building for dynamic-pile-group interaction by (Kagawa and Al-Khatib, 1993; Kagawa and others, 1993) indicates that there is significant interaction. Their studies show that computed responses of the building using state-of-the-art techniques for dynamic-pile-group interaction compares well with the recorded responses. On the other hand, Anderson and others (1991) and Anderson and Bertero (1994) concluded that soil-structure interaction was insignificant for Pacific Park Plaza during the earthquake. They compared the design criteria, code requirements, and the elastic and nonlinear dynamic response of this building due to the earthquake using both simplified and detailed analytical models. VI.3 Summary of Sample Lessons from Studies of Recorded Structural Responses Instrumentation of structures as part of hazard reduction programs is very beneficial, as studies of this type will help to better predict the performance of structures in future earthquakes. (1) Studies of recorded responses of buildings help researches and practicing professionals to better understand the cumulative structural and site characteristics that affect the response of buildings and other structures. Such studies impact mitigation efforts. In turn, the behavior that may be expected from buildings during future earthquakes with large input motions (either due to larger magnitude earthquakes or earthquakes at closer distances to the building) can be forecast. 27  (2)   (3)  (4)  (5) (6)  (7)  (8)  There is a large inventory of buildings within 0-10 km of the many major faults capable of generating M>7 earthquakes. This is particularly important because, very recently, the Structural Engineers Association of California (SEAOC) issued the 1996 edition of the Recommended Lateral Force Requirements and Commentary which has provisions for increasing the design base shear by 0-100 % depending on the 0-10 km distance of the building from the fault. This implies that the forecasting of performance of buildings within 0-10 km of major faults must be done more informatively. This requisite information can be achieved only through acquiring and studying response data from buildings during earthquakes. There is an acute need to better evaluate structural and site characteristics in developing earthquake-resisting designs of building structures. Studies of recorded responses of structures to date show that designs of buildings with low structural damping, resonation and beating effects caused by closely-coupled translational and torsional modes must be avoided. As expected in most tall buildings, higher modes are excited. Higher modes play an important role in the response of building structures and therefore must be carefully evaluated to assess their future performances. Some of the building response data are from tall buildings on soft soils. The motions at the soft-soil sites of some of the important tall buildings are amplified by 3-5 times within the periods of engineering interest when compared with the motions at rock site approximately the same distance away from the epicenter of the earthquake. Responses of tall buildings on soft soils due to motions originating at considerable distances must be accounted for. Drift ratios calculated from observed data in certain cases exceed code drift limitations for part or all of the structural systems. Assessing the drift exposure of structural systems are ever more important since the design/analyses of buildings are recently being shifted towards a performance based design procedure. One of the most important aspects of structural behavior that is least understood is the soil-structure interaction (SSI). Such interaction alters the dynamic characteristics of structures and consequently may be beneficial or detrimental to the performance of the structure. In Mexico City (1985), SSI was detrimental. In other cases, it was beneficial. Recorded response data provides much needed information to identify as to when SSI is beneficial and when detrimental. During Northridge, for example, one feature of SSI, radiation damping was found to be helpful in the behavior of the New Olive View Hospital  even though the building experienced resonance. Specific studies are underway to determine improved methods for incorporating SSI into design procedures. SSI stands to be prominent in the behavior of several instrumented buildings (e.g. Pacific Park Plaza Building [PPP], Santa Clara County Office Building [SCCOB], Transamerica Building [TRA] etc) as assessed from studies of the recorded responses of buildings during the October 17, 1989 Loma-Prieta earthquake (Ms=7.1). Therefore, two specific issues are that (1) identification of beneficial and adverse effects of soil-structure interaction is a necessity, and (2) design offices must be informed and trained in consideration of the effect of soil-structure interaction in estimation of fundamental period and damping of a building  as this is not yet the case.  28   (9)  (10) (11)  (12)  (13)  (14)  Development of design response spectra deserves more intensive consideration by geotechnical engineers since site effects play an important role in the response of building structures. There are significant discrepancies in the comparison of the response spectra derived from recorded motions with the actual design response spectra. Amplified motions due to soft soil conditions, site-specific resonating frequency content (e.g. basin effects) must be kept in mind in the development of design response spectra. The propagation direction of surface waves arriving at the buildings affect particularly unsymmetrical buildings or buildings. Design of basements of tall buildings has been done in the past with input motions at the ground level. Measurements (records) from tall buildings with 2-4 floors of basements indicate that the motions at the basemat are different that that at the ground level. Also the rotations of the basemat are different than the rotations of the sidewalls of the basements. Design considerations for basements therefore need to be reviewed. The implication is that the current practice, which assumes that the inertial forces at the ground level and basemat level to be the same, is not correct. Some suggested changes in design procedures have been made. Low-amplitude tests have been conducted on five buildings that recorded the Loma Prieta earthquake. Results indicate, as expected, that the first-mode periods extracted from strong motion response records are longer than those associated with the ambient vibration records. Similarly, the percentages of critical damping for the first mode for the ambient data are significantly smaller than those from the strong-motion data. These differences may be caused by several factors including: (a) possible soil-structure interaction which is more pronounced during strong-motion events than during ambient excitations, (and similarly, in buildings with pile-foundations, possible pile-foundation interaction which may not occur during ambient excitation), (b) non-linear behavior of the structure (such as micro-cracking of the concrete at the foundation or superstructure), (c) slip of steel connections, and (d) interaction of structural and non-structural elements. Changes in damping values and fundamental period values commensurate with inferred strong-motion values should be considered to improve design and analyses results. Specific instrumentation schemes of some of the already instrumented buildings and of those buildings yet to be instrumented must be improved and/or implemented so that the response characteristics expected of that building can be captured (e.g. SSI, pounding, variation of drift due to abrupt changes in stiffness). When applicable, specific buildings should be specially instrumented extensively to better capture their behavior in response to actions such as pounding and SSI. Because the energy of the ground motions can be azimuthally variable, structures with wings or unsymmetrical structures can be significantly affected by it.  (15) Instrumented structures that have been built or retrofitted with innovative technologies such as base isolated systems indicate which types of base-isolation systems are more effective than others. During the Northridge earthquake, the USC hospital built on rubber bearings performed well but another system did not perform as expected. Therefore, instrumentation of structures helps us to identify which innovative emerging isolation technologies perform as expected during strongshaking.  29   (16) Methods are being developed to identify initiation and propagation of damage by studying the response data from instrumented (and damaged) structures. Unfortunately there were only 2 buildings that were damaged and had seismic instrumentation. This aspect of acquiring information from instrumented structures is gaining importance to develop methods for assessing whether structures are damaged or not. (17) Response data is providing to be a key to the analyses of few buildings that showed higher shaking at mid-floor levels that their respective top floors. This phenomenon is not yet understood and is being investigated. (18) Determination of dynamic characteristics of structural systems is important in assessing their vulnerability and in developing procedures to analyze and design future structures. The data recorded from instrumented structures is used to determine structural characteristics. One additional aspect of this is determination of the effect of accidental torsion of symmetric structures. The code provisions that require accidental torsion provisions are now under scrutiny. Following such earthquakes, the formulas in the codes for determination of fundamental periods of structures and design coefficients for assessing the strength requirements have been continuously revised over the years. (19) Performance of flexible diaphragms of industrial buildings has been improved as a result of studies of recorded motions of such structures. (20) It has been noted that azimuthal propagation of incoming earthquake motions from different events of different epicentral locations affects the performance of structures that are not symmetrical and/or structures with wings. This issue needs to be studied further to assess how design requirements can be affected by this action. (21) Studying response records from instrumented structures provides a means to identify the performance problems of the structures and therefore devise and select the best possible retrofit and/or upgrade system. An example of this is the Santa Clara County Office Building in San Jose, California. Records from 3 earthquakes showed that the building resonated and had very low damping. Consequently, the retrofit system selected and implemented is the viscous elastic damper system that increases both the stiffness and damping of the structure.  30   VII. COST/BUDGET ISSUES The cost of instrumenting a structure in general is based on the number of channels of sensors that will be deployed following decision making process. However, it seems feasible to provide a standardized 12-18 channel instrumentation scheme as most commercially available recording systems have maximum 12 or 18 channels (e.g. K2 and Mt. Whitney, respectively). Experience of a decade and more indicates that the cost can be approximately estimated as follows:    Each channel of recording system ~ $1K Each channel of sensor ~ $1K Installation per channel (labor, cabling etc) ~$2K.  Thus, a 12-channel system would cost approximately $48-50K. This normally will include a triaxial free-field station in the immediate vicinity of the building, if physically possible. Furthermore, the cost can go up depending upon the difficulty with which cables that connect the various sensors at different locations of a building can be pulled to connect the sensors to the recording system. Instrumentation costs of $50 K for a building and its contents is a small investment when compared with the actual worth of a building (and its contents). Naturally, larger and more complex building systems will require more than 12 channels to define its vibrational behavior. In such cases, combinations of 12 and 18 channels are used.  31   VIII. CONCLUSIONS This report presents the current methods and status of instrumenting structures and discusses the benefits derived from instrumenting a structure as well as the extent to which a structure should be instrumented. It also reviews some lessons derived from well-instrumented structures in earthquakes.  32   REFERENCES Aktan, H., Kagawa, T., Kambhatla, A., and elebi, M., 1992, Measured and analytical response of a pile supported building, in Proceedings, Tenth World Conference on Earthquake Engineering: A.A.

Biaxial versions are either ordered specially or mounted on a plate by customers. For special projects where triaxial motions below the ground surface needs to be recorded, tri-axial downhole accelerometers are used. Figure A-1 shows uniaxial, triaxial and downhole accelerometer used. The accelerometers are bolted to the building frame or floor, and sensed data are transmitted to the central recording location by shielded cable.  Figure A-1 (from left to right), FBA-11 (uniaxial), FBA-13 (triaxial) and FBA-13DH (downhole) A.1.2 Episensors The balance ES-SB balance 0.25 to sensors 4  latest version of triaxial accelerometer is the Episensor (Figure A-2). Episensor force accelerometers are also available in uniaxial (the FBA ES-U) and borehole (the FBA shallow and FBA ES-DH deep) packages. The triaxial unit consists of three forceaccelerometer modules mounted orthogonally in one package. Recording ranges of   4g are user selectable. The recording bandwidth ranges from DC to 200 Hz. These also have four types of outputs that can be field-selected by the user:  2.5V single-  Commercial names cited in this report is for demonstration only and does not constitute endorsement of the product. User should investigate all available products.  38   ended output for use with traditional Kinemetrics earthquake recording instruments;  10V single-ended or  20V differential output for use with Kinemetrics new Everest 24-bit digital recorder and other 24-bit digital recorders currently on the market.  Figure A-2. Triaxial Episensor (13.3 cm diameter, 6.2 cm height) A.2 SUMMARY OF OLDER VERSIONS OF ANALOG RECORDERS A.2.1 Accelerographs It can be stated that tri-axial accelerographs, whether analog or digital, are the most widely used instruments by many national and international organizations to record ground motion as well as structural response. This is because they are versatile enough to be deployed on ground as well as at different locations of structures. That is why perhaps the code-writers (UBC) adopted the tri-axial instruments as the code-requirement. A triaxial accelerograph contains the tri-axial accelerometers within the unit that also houses the recording components. Therefore, it is capable of recording triaxial motions (two orthogonal horizontal components and 1 vertical) at a point on a surface (free-field or structure). The different types of accelerographs used are: A.2.1.1Triaxial Strong-Motion Accelerograph (SMA-1): Triaxial self-contained accelerographs are often needed and deployed in conjunction with the remote-sensor system either to record free-field ground motions or to supplement the structural instrumentation when more than 12 channels are required. Although deployment of digital units in Japan, Taiwan and the United States is progressing speedily, Kinemetrics Model SMA-1 is the most widely deployed triaxial, self-contained, analog unit at the present (Figure A-3). This instrument records data optically onto 70-mm photographic film from 25-Hz flexure-type accelerometers. The SMA-1 has the same trigger system, recording capability, and real time options as described for the CRA-1 below. 39   However, with new digital units that are competitively priced, SMA-1 models are no longer manufactured and the existing inventory is slowly being replaced by digital units. In fact, the manufacturer is now offering kits to convert analog SMA-1 units to digitally record. Because, in the future, the analog units will not be manufactured and used, detailed descriptions are not provided herein but are available elsewhere (Hudson, 1979).  Figure A-3 shows a picture of an SMA-1 and the SMA-1 after digital conversion A.2.1.2Central Recording Accelerograph [CRA-1] Central Recording Accelerograph (CRA) is a 12-channel, analog recording system that records photographically on a single 7 in film. This analog recorder has been usually used for structural-response studies. It can be modified to have a 13th channel. In this system, incoming signals are directly transmitted to 150-Hz galvanometers, which in turn deflect a light beam across the moving film strip. The instrument, triggered by a vertical starter with as nominal threshold of 0.01 g between 1 and 10 Hz, has a total recording time of 25 minutes. The recording continues to operate for approximately 20 seconds (shop adjustable after the last occurrence of vertical ground motion exceeding the triggering threshold, in order to record the earthquake fully. An internal clock impresses half-second time marks on the edge of the film. A feature by the USGS, puts real time on the opposite edge of the film from an internal time-code generator or by using a WWVB radio code signal. In the latter case the instrument must operate for a minimum of 60 seconds in order to accommodate the entire WWVB code. Float-charged batteries located in a nearby battery box supply power. A rotary key switch provides for periodic testing of natural frequency and damping of the remotely located sensors. The sensors are connected externally to the CRA unit via a junction box. It is mainly used for structural instrumentation. As with SMA-1, the manufacturer is no longer supplying these units and therefore is not further deliberated herein. A.2.2.SSA-1 and SSA-2 Series These earlier version, 12-bit, solid-state, digital accelerographs record motions at 100-200 samples per second per channel. Newer, 18-24 bit versions of digital systems are now being competitively priced. These earlier versions are no longer being manufactured.  40   A.3 CABLES When hooking up accelerometers to Altus instruments (K-2 or Mt. Whitney) maximum 6 accelerometers can be hooked up with one cable. It is preferable to hook up 3 accelerometers on one, 6-pair 18-gage cable (Belden part # 9774 or the equivalent) or to hook up 6 accelerometers to one, 9-pair 18-gage cable (Belden part # 9775 or the equivalent). One pair is needed for each accelerometer and 3 pairs are used for power and commands to each accelerometer. Up to 6 accelerometers can share the power and command wires. In other words, you need at least one 4 pair cable for one accelerometer on up to one 9 pair cable for 6 accelerometers. There should be a junction box at each location where the main cable breaks out to pick up more accelerometers. The junction box should be sized according to the number and size of the cables which will be connected in and, or passing through it. The individual accelerometers may be attached to the main cable using insulated Butt Splices such as Panduit part # BSN18. Wherever the main cable has a break in it, it should be spliced using a tubular, double screw barrier strip with wire protector of the appropriate size (Buchanan part numbers TSB23012DS, TSB5001231DS, and TSB100012DS). The recorder should be located such that it is the shortest possible run to an outside wall in order to facilitate the installation of 25 meter Bullet GPS antenna. The internal GPS option can be used if you can locate the recorder within 25 meters of the antenna. If this is not possible, then the external GPS option has to be ordered and the external GPS receiver has to be installed within 25 meters of the GPS antenna. If the external GPS option is used, then it will be necessary to install a power and data cable between the external GPS receiver and the recorder. An assigned vendor supplies a custom cable for this application or you can use a different cable using the appropriate guidelines as published in their operations manual. A.4 SUMMARY OF DIGITAL RECORDERS A.4.1 K-2 Digital Recorder  Figure A-4. Modern digital K-2 recording system can download data to a laptop or transfer by modem or other communications media. One of the state-of-the-art digital recording systems is the K-2 recorder that has sensor interface, choice of sampling rates (20-250 sps), multi-recording modes, communication  41   interfaces (RS232cable and/or modem) and recording as a data-logger with storage on local flash card hard disks of any size. These capabilities facilitate recording recording with shortperiod and broadband seismometers. The data can be transferred by site visit to manually retrieve the data or by dialing up the system. The system also works as a digitizer and can communicate via radio, telephone or satellites links, sending a serial data stream to another recording media such as a desktop computer. The sensor interface has a pre-amplifier board that can take input of 40 volts peak-to-peak (+/- 10 volts differential) to provide a direct connection for broadband seismometers. Shortperiod seismometers can also be used with gain of X1, X3, X10, X30 or X100. The units can also be modified by installation of damping resistors. For most structural instrumentation applications, high-frequency transducers such as accelerometers and velocity transducers are used. These transducers in general require high sampling rates (e.g. 100-200sps). However, the K-2 units are capable of recording with broadband seismometers at low sampling rates also. Data recorded by a K-2 unit can be retrieved by several methods: 1. Remove the flash card or hard disk and place it in a PC card slot on the analysis computer. Analysis software can then open the files as it would any other program file. By this way, data transfer is not necessary. 2. Direct connection with the RS-232C cable. Data transfer or interrogation can be accomplished over the serial port without having to first stop data acquisition. Finally, the data can be transferred to a remote-site computer via telephone, radio or satellite. 3. Using an internal high-speed telephone (14.4 KB, 28.8 KB, or 56KB), cellular or ISDN modem installed on the second PC card slot and runs off the same power supply as the K2 system. 4. Using an external telephone (traditional or cellular) or radio modem connected to the RS-232C port. Usually for radio connection, spread spectrum radio modems (902-928 MHz) are used. 5. Specific software can be used to automatically transfer from a network of K2s to a PC. Data from K2 can also be transferred continuously and in real-time to a central data acquisition system using radio, telephone or satellite communication links. Dynamic range of K2 series is greater than 114dB. The data acquisition can be accomplished with 24-bit DSP (digital signal processing).  42   A.4.2 Mt. Whitney Recording System  Figure A-5. Mt. Whitney  an up to 18-channel digital recording system specifically used for structural monitoring Mostly used for structural monitoring purposes, the Mt. Whitney is an 18-channel central recording (requiring only one master board), high dynamic range (>110dB) accelerograph system. The 18 channels of acceleration data are acquired in a single file at 19 bits of resolution at 200 sps. As with K-2, the data is stored on flash card type hard disk and is equipped with a GPS receiver for synchronization to absolute time and an internal PCMCIA modem for remote alerting and data transfer.

RELATED DOCUMENTS Drawings and general provisions of the Contract, including General and Supplementary Conditions and Division 1 Specification Sections, apply to work of this section. SUMMARY A. Furnish and install a complete seismic instrumentation system as specified herein. For typical, symmetric and low-rise buildings (1-5 stories) that are not base-isolated and that do not have flexible diaphragms, the seismic monitoring system may comprise of a 12 channel [or another specified] recorder, 12 [or appropriate number specified] sensors mounted to the structure, an external GPS timing device, an external power supply and a high speed communications link. However, for buildings that are (i) taller, (ii) base-isolated, (iii) have flexible diaphragms, (iv) not symmetric, or (v) either vertically or horizontally irregular, the number of channels required to record structural response during earthquakes may be increased in order to capture significant response modes that may define its behavior and performance. In some cases, the number of channels may be increased to between 24-60 channels after due considerations following studies of the blueprints and evaluation of structural system. B. The completed system shall be installed to the satisfaction of, tested by, and upon acceptance will be maintained and monitored by the National Strong Motion Program of the United States Geological Survey (NSMP-USGS). C. Specified sensors, recorder, timing devices and related equipment shall be the same as those provided for other similar projects implemented by USGS and shall be furnished and installed by USGS (See address be1ow).

GX037-77-2687079	"My name is David Lochbaum. I have been the Nuclear Safety Engineer for the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) since October 1996. Prior to joining UCS, I spent more than 17 years in the industry on the startup and operation of nuclear power plants. UCS, e stablished in 1969, seeks to ensure that all people have clean air, energy and transportation, as well as food that is produced in a safe and sustainable manner. We have  worked on nuclear plant safety issues for nearly 30 years. In fact, far too many of the safety issues that I work on today were also worked on by my predecessor, Robert Pollard, and his predecessors, Daniel Ford and Henry Kendall. This experience convinces us that the United States should not consider an expanded role for nuclear power until we achieve something that we have never had—namely, a consistently effective regulator.         The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has exclusive responsibility for regulating safety at US nuclear power plants. That the last US reactor meltdown happened 22 years ago (Three Mile Island) is circumstantial evidence that the NRC is not always an inept regulator. On the other hand, there is mounting circumstantial evidence in areas such as nuclear plant license renewal, steam generator tube cracking, risk-informed regulation, and nuclear plant security indicating that the NRC is not always an effective regulator either. These warning signs are described in the following sections.         Nuclear Plant License Renewal    The NRC currently approves a 20-year extension to the original 40-year license for a nuclear plant after its owner ""demonstrates that a nuclear power plant facility's structures and components requiring aging management review in accordance with §54.21(a) for license renewal have been identified and that the effects of aging on the functionality of such structures and components will be managed to maintain the CLB [current licensing bases] such that there is an acceptable level of safety during the period of extended operation."" [1]  In theory, this demonstration seems like a solid basis for continued safe operation. In reality, this demonstration amounts to little more than a paperwork exercise that is frequently contradicted by actual experience. Since the beginning of the 21 st  century, at least eight nuclear power plants have been forced to shut down due to equipment failures caused by aging:         1.       March 7, 2000: The owner reported that Nine Mile Point Unit 2 in New York had automatically shut down when the system controlling the level of water over the reactor core failed. The owner attributed the failure as  ""Specifically, the manual-tracking card failed to provide an output signal when the feedwater master controller was switched from automatic to manual mode of operation … The manual-tracking card failed due to  aging ."" [emphasis added]    2.       March 14, 2000: The owner reported that Catawba Unit 1 in South Carolina had automatically shut down due to an inadvertent electrical ground problem. The owner reported  ""A detailed failure analysis determined that the root cause of the connector failure was the misapplication of the connector insert insulating material which is made of neoprene. … The neoprene insert at the failure point on the connector exhibits signs of  accelerated aging  [emphasis added]. The inserts are hardened and there are charred deposits on the end of the inserts which are indications of electrical tracking.""    3.       March 17, 2000: The owner reported that Indian Point Unit 2 in New York had been forced to declare an emergency condition and shut down after a steam generator tube failed and resulted in approximately 19,197 gallons leaking from the reactor coolant system. The owner stated ""Preliminary analysis indicates that the cause of the tube failure is primary water stress corrosion cracking (PWSCC)"" [i.e., aging].    4.       March 27, 2000: The owner reported that Catawba Unit 2 in South Carolina had automatically shut down due to an inadvertent electrical ground problem. The owner reported  ""A detailed failure analysis determined that the root cause of the connector failure was the misapplication of the connector insert insulating material which is made of neoprene. … The neoprene insert at the failure point on the connector exhibits signs of  accelerated aging  [emphasis added]. The inserts are hardened and there are charred deposits on the end of the inserts which are indications of electrical tracking.""    5.       September 12, 2000: The owner reported that Oyster Creek in New Jersey had been forced to shut down because a system needed to provide containment integrity had failed a periodic test. The owner determined  ""The cause of the degradation in Secondary Containment was  age-related degradation  [emphasis added] of the automatic ventilation exhaust valve seals.""    6.       September 27, 2000: The NRC reported that Diablo Canyon Unit 1 in California had automatically shut down after an electrical transformer failed and interrupted the supply of electricity to the reactor coolant pumps. The NRC stated  ""The licensee's evaluation concluded that a center bus bar overheated at a splice joint, which caused a polyvinyl chloride boot insulator over the splice joint to smoke. Eventually, heat-induced failure of fiberglass insulation on adjacent phases resulted in phase-to-phase arcing"" [i.e., aging].    7.       February 16, 2001: The owner reported that North Anna Unit 2 in Virginia had been forced to shut down due to leakage exceeding ten gallons per minute from the reactor coolant system. The owner determined  ""The cause of the stem packing material failure below the lantern ring is attributed to  aging "" [emphasis added].    8.       April 2, 2001: The owner reported that San Onofre Unit 3 in California automatically shut down after an electrical breaker failed and started a fire. The failed breaker was reportedly 25 years old and scheduled for inspection  next  year. The owner ""will implement modifications to appropriate  preventative maintenance  [emphasis added] procedures to address the apparent failure causes.""         Aging management programs are intended to monitor the condition of equipment and structures and implement repairs or replacements when necessary to prevent failures. The cited aging-related failures, occurring about once every 60 days, indicate beyond reasonable doubt that the aging management programs are inadequate because they are  not  preventing equipment failures. The NRC must ascertain the effectiveness of aging management programs—not merely the scope of these programs— before  granting license extensions.              Steam Generator Tube Cracking    Dr. Joram Hopenfeld, who recently retired from the NRC staff, raised concerns about the integrity of steam generator tubes to his management nearly ten year ago. The agency—which steadfastly  claims  that safety is its top priority—essentially ignored them until an accident last year at Indian Point 2. The ensuing public outcry and Congressional attention resulting from that accident, which was initiated when a cracked steam generator tube failed, forced the NRC to dust off Hopenfeld's concerns and finally look into them. The NRC asked its ACRS to evaluate the decade-old concerns.         The NRC's Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) issued a report in February 2001. [2]  The ACRS substantiated many of Dr. Hopenfeld's concerns. For example, the ACRS concluded:         ú          ""The techniques [used to look for cracked steam generator tubes] are not nearly so reliable for determining the depth of a crack, and in particular, whether a crack penetrates through 40% of the tube wall thickness."" [NRC's regulations do not allow a nuclear plant to start up with any steam generator tube cracked more than 40 percent of its wall thickness, but the methods used to inspect the tubes for cracks cannot reliably determine the depth of cracks.]    ú          ""The NRC staff acknowledged that there would be some possibility that cracks of objectionable depth might be overlooked and left in the steam generator for an additional operating cycle."" [Exactly what actually happened at Indian Point 2 to cause last year's accident.]    ú          ""Both the [NRC] staff and the author of the DPO [Dr. Hopenfeld] agree that the alternative repair criteria [used by the NRC staff to allow nuclear plants to continue operating with steam generator tubes known to be cracked] increase the probability of larger primary-to-secondary flows during the MSLB [main steam line break] and SGTR [steam generator tube rupture] accidents.""    ú          ""The [ACRS] also finds that this contention of the DPO [namely, that an accident at a nuclear plant with cracked steam generator tubes could cause those tubes to completely break] has merit and deserves investigation.""    ú          ""This seems to be a plausible contention [that an accident at a nuclear plant with cracked steam generator tubes could widen the cracks and result in larger leakage], and the staff has not produced analyses or test results to refute it.""    ú          ""The [ACRS] concluded that the issue of the possible evolution of severe accident to involve gross failure of steam generator tubes and bypass of the containment is not yet resolved … [and] that the issue needs consideration regardless of the criteria adopted for the repair and replacement of steam generator tubes.""    ú          ""Data available to the [ACRS] suggest that the constant probability of detection [of cracked steam generator tubes] adopted by the NRC staff is nonconservative for flaws producing voltage signals less than about 0.7 volts."" [In other words, the NRC staff assumes that methods used to find cracked tubes are much better than the data shows them to be.]    ú          ""The [ACRS] was unable to identify defensible technical bases for the [NRC] staff decisions to not consider the correlation of the iodine spiking factor with initial iodine concentration [when evaluating the potential offsite radiation dose consequences from accidents involving cracked steam generator tubes].""    ú          ""The [ACRS] found that the [NRC] staff did not have a technically defensible understanding of these processes to assess adequately the potential for procession of damage to steam generator tubes."" [In other words, the NRC staff has no sound basis for arguing that one broken tube will not cascade and cause the failures of other tubes.]    ú          ""The [NRC] staff has not developed persuasive arguments to show that steam generator tubes will remain intact under conditions of risk-important accidents in which the reactor coolant system remains pressurized. The current analyses dealing with loop seals in the coolant system are not yet adequate risk assessments.""    ú          ""In developing assessments of risk concerning these design basis accidents, the [NRC] staff must consider the probabilities of multiple tube ruptures until adequate technical arguments have been developed to show damage progression is improbable."" [In other words, the risk studies to date, which only consider failure of a single tube, may understate the true risk and therefore should not be relied upon.]         The concerns raised by Dr. Hopenfeld are extremely important safety issues. As the ACRS stated:         ú          ""Steam generators constitute more than 50% of the surface area of the primary pressure boundary in a pressurized water reactor.""    ú          ""Unlike other parts of the reactor pressure boundary, the barrier to fission product release provided by the steam generator tubes is not reinforced by the reactor containment as an additional barrier.""    ú          ""Leakage of primary coolant through openings in the steam generator tubes could deplete the inventory of water available for the long-term cooling of the core in the event of an accident.""         In the decade since Dr. Hopenfeld first raised his safety concerns, the NRC has allowed many nuclear plants to continue operating nuclear power plants with literally thousands of steam generator tubes known to be cracked. The ACRS concluded that the NRC staff made these regulatory decisions using incomplete and inaccurate information. After receiving the ACRS's report, the NRC staff considered Hopenfeld's concerns ""resolved"" even though it had taken no action to address the numerous recommendations in the ACRS report (enclosure 1).          The NRC must REALLY resolve Dr. Hopenfeld's concerns as soon as possible. In the interim, the NRC must stop making decisions affecting the lives of millions of Americans when it lacks ""defensible technical bases.""         Risk-Informed Regulation    Two of the NRC's four strategic goals are to maintain safety and to reduce unnecessary regulatory burden. The agency attempts to define ""unnecessary"" using plant-specific risk studies that purportedly draw a nice clean line between what is necessary and what is not. But UCS released a report titled ""Nuclear Plant Risk Studies: Failing the Grade"" last August detailing numerous flaws in the publicly available plant-specific risk studies. Among other flaws, we compared the risk study results for three sets of nearly identical plants and found that they varied widely—not because the risks were that disparate but because different assumptions and methods were used. Consequently, it is extraordinarily easy to move that nice clean line simply by tweaking a few input assumptions and have a burden appear as either necessary or unnecessary.          For example, the FitzPatrick nuclear plant in New York has a problem three or four years ago with a valve that must open following a certain accident to provide cooling flow to the reactor core. But the valve's motor did not develop sufficient thrust to move the valve against the high pressure that would occur if that accident happened. Fixing the valve was therefore a very necessary burden. Yet the plant's owner went back to the risk study and re-calculated the risk from that accident happening concurrently with a complete failure of the electrical grid and adjusted the line until the burden became ""unnecessary."" This example is not sharpening one's pencil because the accident in question happens most frequently when the electrical grid remains available. Thus, this vital safety system would not have functioned properly for the most likely accident scenario. [3]         More recently, the NRC staff allowed Fermi Unit 2 in Michigan to continue operating after the company broke one of its emergency diesel generator due to either incompetence or negligence. The company submitted a risk study to the NRC staff that showed the continued operation increased the threat of an accident. But the NRC staff discounted that quantified threat by saying that the unquantified threat from shutting down and then restarting the nuclear reactor would somehow pose an even larger threat. This NRC decision contradicts its own regulations, policies, and procedures and UCS has asked the NRC's Inspector General to investigate this matter (enclosure 2).         The plant-specific risk studies that UCS reviewed for our report are nearly ten years old, but they are the most recent risk studies that are publicly available. The NRC is allowing plant owners to reduce the testing frequency for emergency equipment or to continue operating with degraded equipment based on results from more recent risk studies. The previously cited ACRS report on Hopenfeld's steam generator tube integrity concerns indicates that the more recent risk studies remain inaccurate and incomplete. Members of the public and organizations like UCS cannot challenge these regulatory decisions because we lack access to the risk studies. The NRC's own regulations, policies, and procedures require such information to be publicly available, but it is not. And the agency continues to make regulatory decisions affecting the lives of millions of Americans in a vacuum. The NRC must require the flaws in the risk studies to be corrected  AND  make sufficient information about the corrected risk studies publicly available.         Nuclear Plant Security    The NRC's handling of physical security at nuclear reactors is another example of regulatory ineffectiveness. The NRC began force-on-force tests of security preparedness at nuclear power plants in the early 1990s. These tests pit a handful of simulated intruders against a plant's physical defenses and squadrons of armed security personnel. By 1998, these tests had revealed significant security weaknesses in about 47 percent of the plants tested. The NRC quietly discontinued the testing, but the ensuing public outrage forced the agency to re-institute the tests. Since the tests have been resumed, about 47 percent of the plants continue to have significant security flaws revealed. Last year, force-on-force tests at the Waterford plant in Louisiana and the Quad Cities plant in Illinois demonstrated serious security problems that warranted extensive repairs and upgrades. The owner of the Waterford spent more than $2 million fixing its inadequate security system.         Having been foiled in its attempt to secretly deep-six the security tests, the agency resorted to Plan B in which they will allow the plant owners to conduct the tests themselves, grade the tests themselves, and simply mail in the scores—virtually guaranteed to be high marks—to the NRC. If someone like Timothy McVeigh drove to a nuclear power plant with intentions of causing harm, the people living near that plant would better protected by security scoring 85 percent on a real test than 100 or even 110 percent on an open-book, take-home, self-scored test. The public deserves and must get that better protection than that provided by artificially inflated security test scores.         New Nuclear Plants    A new nuclear technology called the pebble-bed modular reactor is getting considerable mention as the type of nuclear reactor most likely to be built in the United States in the future. The pebble-bed reactor does offer certain safety advantages—at least, on paper. Proponents claim that the pebble-bed reactor cannot experience the meltdown-type accident as occurred at Three Mile Island in 1979. Perhaps, but can the pebble-bed reactor, which will use more graphite in each reactor module than is presently used in all existing US nuclear power plants combined, can on fire and burn as happened at Windscale in 1957 and Chernobyl in 1986? Can plant workers, either by mistake or by design, trigger an accident as occurred at the SL-1 nuclear reactor in 1961 and Dresden Unit 3 in 1974 and Browns Ferry in 1975? Can some unexpected component failure cause fuel damage, as occurred at Fermi Unit 1 in 1966?         The pebble-bed reactor is rumored to be competitive with other energy technologies. It appears from a preliminary design review that the proposed reactor achieves its economic advantages by replacing the steel-lined, reinforced-concrete containment structures used for our existing nuclear plants with a far less robust enclosure building. The NRC's own Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards characterized this as ""a major safety trade-off.""          The safety problem with the proposed ""containment-lite"" pebble-bed reactor design Is compounded by the existing security weaknesses. Imagine the consequences from a fertilizer truck bomb detonated next to a ""containment-lite"" reactor with millions of curies of lethal radioactivity to contaminate the environment for many decades. That would truly be a nuclear nightmare.         Cost projections by the nuclear industry must be taken with a grain of salt, if not an entire salt shaker. According to the US Department of Energy, the actual construction costs for 75 nuclear power plants started between 1966 and 1977 were more than three times higher than their estimated costs. [4]  Thus, claims that the projected costs of electricity from a proposed pebble-bed reactor are competitive with the actual costs of electricity from operating renewable energy technologies must be viewed with skepticism.         It cannot be overemphasized that a facility like the proposed pebble-bed modular reactor has never been constructed or operated in the world. Consequently, its expected performance characteristics are highly speculative. It would not be prudent at this time to place undue reliance on a risky technology with unproven safety performance. Nuclear experiments belong in the laboratory, not within the US electricity marketplace.         Conclusions and Recommendations    Nuclear power plants are inherently dangerous. If nuclear power is to play an expanded role in the future, it is imperative that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission become a consistently effective regulator. UCS believes that this goal is attainable. The Maintenance Rule (10 CFR 50.63) and the revised reactor oversight process demonstrate that the agency is capable of effective regulation. That capability must be extended across all of the NRC's oversight functions and consistently sustained. This transformation may require that the agency receive additional resources, particularly during the transformation phase. Because the agency is currently a fee-based agency, it may require legislative changes to supplement the existing resources with taxpayer money.          Failing to reform the Nuclear Regulatory Commission could have tragic consequences. As reported in  The Wall Street Journal  (enclosure 3), the 1986 accident at the Chernobyl nuclear plant cost the former Soviet Union several times the net benefits from all Soviet reactors ever operated. The price tag for the accident was placed at 170 to 215 billion rubles while the net benefits from every Soviet nuclear power plant was only 10 to 50 billion rubles. With the price of failure so very high, it is absolutely imperative that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission be a consistently—rather than occasionally—effective regulator.         If Congress wants an expanded role for nuclear power, it must provide the NRC with the resources needed for the agency to implement consistently effective regulatory programs and must also oversee the agency's reform efforts to verity that they are successful.                        [1]  Part 54, Requirements for Renewal of Operating Licenses for Nuclear Power Plants, of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

GX012-82-4762185	"Archived Press Releases               DOE-Supported Westinghouse AP600 Reactor Design Gains Final Design Approval from NRC   September 10, 1998          List    The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issued a final design approval to Westinghouse Electric Company on September 3, 1998, for its AP600 standard nuclear reactor design, which was developed in partnership with the Department of Energy (DOE).    Issuance of the final design approval completes the NRC's technical review of the application for design certification.  The NRC's detailed findings are contained in a 3,000-page ""Final Safety Evaluation Report,"" which is available from the Commission.    DOE (through the Office of Nuclear Energy, Science and Technology) and the U.S. nuclear industry cooperated in a successful effort to develop the AP600 and two other Advanced Light Water Reactor (ALWR) plant designs.  The other two plant designs -- the General Electric Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (GE-ABWR) and the ABB Combustion Engineering System 80+ -- were certified by the NRC in 1997.       The AP600 nuclear plant would be capable of producing 600 megawatts of electricity.  The plant, which can be assembled from modular components, features enhanced safety systems that rely on gravity and other natural processes to safely shut down the reactor or mitigate the effects of an accident, if one were to occur.    Westinghouse may choose to proceed with design certification of the AP600 through a rulemaking process.  Once the reactor is certified by the Commission, a utility could use the standardized design in an application for a combined construction permit and operating license.  This single-step permitting is an improvement over the two-step process used in the construction of the existing commercial reactors in the U.S.             TOP"

Known as          the Big Dig, the project includes a new tunnel under the harbor connecting          Logan airport and interstate I-90, the Mass. Turnpike. The first section          of the tunnel, finished in 1995, is named for Boston baseball hero Ted          Williams.                    Researchers from the Construction Occupational Health Program at the University          of Massachusetts Lowell have been conducting occupational health studies          on the Big Dig since 1992 under a mandate to improve health conditions          for workers in the regional construction industry. The research is part          of a nationwide consortium headed by the Center to Protect Workers' Rights,          the research, development, and training arm of the Building and Construction          Trades Department, AFL-CIO, and funded by the National Institute for Occupational          Safety and Health, part of the CDC.                     Full-time staff researchers and student research assistants have spent          countless hours on site observing, interacting with workers and dozens          of contractors, and seeking ways to reduce musculoskeletal injuries and          exposures to silica. The seven miles of tunnel that make up the project          are constructed mainly of concrete. Concrete is mostly made of sand and          sand is silica. Drilling, chipping, cutting, or otherwise abrading concrete          produces dust containing airborne crystalline silica. When inhaled, this          can cause silicosis, a deadly lung disease. While the dangers of silica          have been known since ancient times, the COHP's research has shown that          workers doing concrete construction are exposed to a much higher level          of silica than was known in the past. To prevent silica exposure and future          cases of silicosis, contractors need to plan ahead and provide proper          protection to workers.                     We first learned of this problem while watching the construction of the          Ted Williams Tunnel. We found workers on a scissor lift drilling approximately          17,000 holes in the concrete roof of the tunnel. We were told that hangers          would be epoxied into the holes to support the suspended ceiling ventilation          system. The workers doing the drilling were exposed to a mix of hazards          including silica dust and potential shoulder, neck, and back injuries          from using a heavy tool to drill overhead for hours at a time. It was          a very high hazard job.                     We also noticed that the workers had added their own accessories, or ""Bright          Ideas,"" 1  to make the job less hazardous. They had gone          to the hardware store and bought a household fan that they duct-taped          to the railing of the scissor lift to blow away the concrete dust that          was, as we now know, almost pure silica. They had also fashioned a pole          to hold up the drill and protect their shoulders and backs from injury.          We were told that this type of support is sometimes called a ""soldier          pole"" or an ""inverse drill press.""                     This tunnel consisted of 13 pre-fabricated tube tunnel sections. Each          section had been lined with concrete before being sunk and connected on          the harbor floor. We asked why the holes had to be drilled after the concrete          liner had been constructed and why the holes were not designed into the          lining in the earlier formwork stage. Typical answers were that it had          to be done this way and that no one had really thought about the problem          in the design phase. Engineers on site told us that they had not been          able to plan for the holes because they did not know where they would          be needed until they began installation of the ceiling ventilation system.                              We watched this job for more than two years and saw how hazardous and          difficult it was. We published a chapter in a book about the hazards involved. 2           While we continued to raise questions about the hazards of the ceiling          ventilation system design, it took about three years to get a meeting          with the engineers who made the decisions about the designs.                     At the meeting, the engineers said that we were not the only ones who          had raised questions about the design and that future designs had been          changed for reasons of health and safety, cost, and constructibility [ease          of construction]. As is often the case, the difficult and dangerous design          had also been very expensive. The new design eliminated the problem of          drilling holes for hangers by imbedding the supports for the ceiling ventilation          system in the tunnel roof during the concrete formwork stage of construction.          The first tunnel using the revised ceiling ventilation design, the I-90          Fort Point Channel tunnel, has been completed. According to Charlie Rountree,          safety and health manager for CA/T Managing Consultant Bechtel/Parsons          Brinckerhoff, the Ted Williams Tunnel ceiling ventilation system cost          about $55/sq. ft. The redesigned ceiling ventilation system cost about          $22/sq. ft. for a savings of approximately $33/sq. ft. in total installed          cost. Two additional tunnels under construction are expected to result          in similar savings.                     Unfortunately, it is not possible to count the savings from injuries that          did not happen. However, as Rountree said, ""We should always consider          safety and health, constructibility, and cost, in that order."" There          is no doubt that redesigning the tunnel ceiling ventilation system prevented          some workers from getting career-altering musculoskeletal injuries and          life-threatening silicosis.                     1 The COHP has published a series of ""Bright Ideas,"" construction workers'          health and safety innovations on the job.
