The USGS Annual Holiday Train Display began in 1989 as a simple LGB layout in front of the Christmas tree set up in the main hallway of the Eastern Mapping Center on the second floor of the USGS National Center.  By 1992 the exhibit had moved to its present location in the main auditorium.  The show now includes operating layouts with HO, S (American Flyer), O (Lionel), and G (LGB).  Many static displays related to railroads are also set up in the auditorium.  Organizations such as the Federal Railroad Administration, Amtrak, the National Association of Railroad Passengers, Maryland Department of Transportation, and Operation Lifesaver have provided displays and informational handouts.  The area outside the auditorium has exhibits highlighting the various missions of the USGS science disciplines (geology, geography, hydrography, and biology).  A Community Night includes interactive displays and activities especially for kids.  The train layouts have grown to the point that about 250 labor hours are required to set up and test the operating displays.  A core group of 6-8 volunteers do the set up on the layouts, usually on the weekend before the display opens.  About 10-15 individuals, many from outside USGS, man the exhibit during its four or five day run.  The core USGS volunteers represent Mapping, Geology, and Office of Program Support.  All of the layouts; buildings, track, cars, and locomotives, are owned by individuals who provide them for the display.  The average attendance is about 10,000 during a four-day exhibit.

GX007-81-1358866	Columbia/Eagle Bluffs Wetlands Monitoring Project     Joseph M. Richards, Hydrologist, Project Chief        The Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC)  and the  City of Columbia , Missouri, have initiated a project that is anticipated to be a milestone in the treatment of municipal sewage. As expansion of the Columbia wastewater treatment facility became necessary, constructed treatment wetlands were chosen instead of expanding the existing activated sludge facilities. The significance of the project is that the MDC agreed to accept the treated effluent from the  Columbia wetlands (52K image)  as a water source for managing up to 1,200 wetland acres on the MDC's 4,100-acre  Eagle Bluffs Wildlife Area (64K image),  a restored riverine wetland along the Missouri River.    Objective:      To evaluate changes in surface- and ground-water flow and quality as the    result of the construction of the effluent-wetland treatment system.   Click  here  for more details.    Cooperators:    The Columbia/Eagle Bluffs Wetland Monitoring Project is jointly funded through cooperative agreements among the Missouri Department of Conservation, the City of Columbia, Missouri, and the U.S. Geological Survey. The study is integrated with other studies operating at the Columbia/Eagle Bluffs Wetland Complex.      Contact address:    Joseph M.

Study area showing location of Tribal lands, data-collection sites, and major canals and levees. [ larger image ]            The need to determine future surface-water  flow requirements in the interior canal system of south Florida is being met with the successful implementation of strategic placed stream-flow and water-quality gaging sites in the interior of southern Florida. The multi-agency effort involves four entities that collect, analyze, and distribute information for water managers. In 1995 the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) established three monitoring sites south of Lake Okeechobee in an effort to accurately gage flows in canals entering and exiting Tribal lands, the Big Cypress National Preserve, and Water Conservation Area 3A in southern Florida. These flows are also being monitored to calculate nutrient loads in the canals that cross or border Tribal lands. Two of the gaging sites, L-28U and L-28IN, are located on the southern border of the Seminole Tribal lands along the L-28 canal and the L-28 Interceptor canal, respectively, west of Water Conservation Area 3A in Hendry County ( fig. 1 ). The third gaging site, L-28IS, is located along the L-28 Interceptor canal where flows enter the western lands of the Miccosukee Indian Tribe from the Big Cypress National Preserve in Collier County and has been discontinued.     Acoustic instrumentation, in lieu of standard methods for field data collection and flow computations, is used to quantify flows in the canals. Using the acoustic velocity meter (AVM), Acoustic Doppler Velocity meter (ADV), and the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), it is possible to more accurately gage flows in this type of environment because of new capabilities to quickly measure low or rapidly changing water velocities. Construction, instrumentation, and calibration of the flow gaging sites were completed by the  USGS  during 1996 and 1997. The South Florida Water Management District ( SFWMD ) installed flow-weighted samplers at the gaging sites for nutrient analysis in conjunction with the stream flow monitoring; the Seminole and Miccosukee Indian Tribes have serviced the flow-weighted samplers. Real-time telemetry instrumentation and programming assistance along with phosphorus and nitrogen load calculations have been provided by the  SFWMD .  ADCP calibration of the installed acoustic velocity meter indexes is ongoing and development of the ""sum of least squares regression"" has been provided for data processing at all sites and continues to be refined. Velocity data collected during the dry season has displayed a phenomenon known as acoustic refraction or ray bending produced by thermal stratification in the water column during extended periods of very slow vertical flow. Various installed electromagnetic and new Doppler mean velocity-indexing techniques have been tested and proven largely successful.     The L-28U site along the L-28 canal is used to monitor freshwater flows from the lands of the Seminole Tribe and to provide nutrient data load summaries. Average annual runoff of 63,930 acre-feet for the period from 1997 to 2001, represents about twice the inflow amount determined by the  SFWMD  at their upstream U.S. Sugar Outflow (USSO) site located on the northwestern border of the Seminole Tribal lands. The L-28IN site along the L-28 Interceptor canal is used to monitor flows from the lands of the Seminole Indian Tribe to the Big Cypress National Preserve and ultimately to Miccosukee Tribal lands as well as providing nutrient data for water-resources planning and management. Annual runoff averaged 53,140 acre-feet from 1997 through 2001. The L-28IS site along the L-28 Interceptor canal, discontinued September 1999, was used to monitor flows from the lands of the Seminole Indian Tribe and the Big Cypress National Preserve to the lands of the Miccosukee Indian Tribe. For the three years of operation this site also provided flows and associated nutrient load data for water managers, and was instrumental in bracketing and quality assuring the flow calibration conditions for the upstream L-28IN site. Average annual runoff at the site for the 1997-1999 periods was calculated to be 49,070 acre-feet.     Measuring flow-weighted nutrient loads requires extremely accurate flow-data collection combined with a highly coordinated nutrient collection and analysis procedure. A collaborative product that meets this need is provided as part of current efforts and has been documented in seven semi-annual progress reports presented to the  SFWMD /Seminole Working Group. An ancillary report was produced from funding sources outside of the  USGS  Placed Based Studies ( PBS ) program budget during the 2002 water year (Lietz, 2002). The report examines the feasibility of estimating concentrations and loads based both on  USGS  acoustic backscatter data and Seminole Tribe nutrient water quality data.

Study area showing location of Tribal lands, data-collection sites, and major canals and levees. [ larger image ]            The need to determine future surface-water  flow requirements in the interior canal system of south Florida is being met with the successful implementation of strategic placed stream-flow and water-quality gaging sites in the interior of southern Florida. The multi-agency effort involves four entities that collect, analyze, and distribute information for water managers. In 1995 the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) established three monitoring sites south of Lake Okeechobee in an effort to accurately gage flows in canals entering and exiting Tribal lands, the Big Cypress National Preserve, and Water Conservation Area 3A in southern Florida. These flows are also being monitored to calculate nutrient loads in the canals that cross or border Tribal lands. Two of the gaging sites, L-28U and L-28IN, are located on the southern border of the Seminole Tribal lands along the L-28 canal and the L-28 Interceptor canal, respectively, west of Water Conservation Area 3A in Hendry County ( fig. 1 ). The third gaging site, L-28IS, is located along the L-28 Interceptor canal where flows enter the western lands of the Miccosukee Indian Tribe from the Big Cypress National Preserve in Collier County and has been discontinued.     Acoustic instrumentation, in lieu of standard methods for field data collection and flow computations, is used to quantify flows in the canals. Using the acoustic velocity meter (AVM), Acoustic Doppler Velocity meter (ADV), and the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), it is possible to more accurately gage flows in this type of environment because of new capabilities to quickly measure low or rapidly changing water velocities. Construction, instrumentation, and calibration of the flow gaging sites were completed by the  USGS  during 1996 and 1997.

Real-time telemetry instrumentation and programming assistance along with phosphorus and nitrogen load calculations have been provided by the  SFWMD .  ADCP calibration of the installed acoustic velocity meter indexes is ongoing and development of the ""sum of least squares regression"" has been provided for data processing at all sites and continues to be refined.

Various installed electromagnetic and new Doppler mean velocity-indexing techniques have been tested and proven largely successful.     The L-28U site along the L-28 canal is used to monitor freshwater flows from the lands of the Seminole Tribe and to provide nutrient data load summaries. Average annual runoff of 63,930 acre-feet for the period from 1997 to 2001, represents about twice the inflow amount determined by the  SFWMD  at their upstream U.S. Sugar Outflow (USSO) site located on the northwestern border of the Seminole Tribal lands. The L-28IN site along the L-28 Interceptor canal is used to monitor flows from the lands of the Seminole Indian Tribe to the Big Cypress National Preserve and ultimately to Miccosukee Tribal lands as well as providing nutrient data for water-resources planning and management.

[ larger image ]            The need to determine future surface-water  flow requirements in the interior canal system of south Florida is being met with the successful implementation of strategic placed stream-flow and water-quality gaging sites in the interior of southern Florida. The multi-agency effort involves four entities that collect, analyze, and distribute information for water managers. In 1995 the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) established three monitoring sites south of Lake Okeechobee in an effort to accurately gage flows in canals entering and exiting Tribal lands, the Big Cypress National Preserve, and Water Conservation Area 3A in southern Florida. These flows are also being monitored to calculate nutrient loads in the canals that cross or border Tribal lands. Two of the gaging sites, L-28U and L-28IN, are located on the southern border of the Seminole Tribal lands along the L-28 canal and the L-28 Interceptor canal, respectively, west of Water Conservation Area 3A in Hendry County ( fig. 1 ). The third gaging site, L-28IS, is located along the L-28 Interceptor canal where flows enter the western lands of the Miccosukee Indian Tribe from the Big Cypress National Preserve in Collier County and has been discontinued.     Acoustic instrumentation, in lieu of standard methods for field data collection and flow computations, is used to quantify flows in the canals. Using the acoustic velocity meter (AVM), Acoustic Doppler Velocity meter (ADV), and the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), it is possible to more accurately gage flows in this type of environment because of new capabilities to quickly measure low or rapidly changing water velocities. Construction, instrumentation, and calibration of the flow gaging sites were completed by the  USGS  during 1996 and 1997. The South Florida Water Management District ( SFWMD ) installed flow-weighted samplers at the gaging sites for nutrient analysis in conjunction with the stream flow monitoring; the Seminole and Miccosukee Indian Tribes have serviced the flow-weighted samplers. Real-time telemetry instrumentation and programming assistance along with phosphorus and nitrogen load calculations have been provided by the  SFWMD .  ADCP calibration of the installed acoustic velocity meter indexes is ongoing and development of the ""sum of least squares regression"" has been provided for data processing at all sites and continues to be refined. Velocity data collected during the dry season has displayed a phenomenon known as acoustic refraction or ray bending produced by thermal stratification in the water column during extended periods of very slow vertical flow. Various installed electromagnetic and new Doppler mean velocity-indexing techniques have been tested and proven largely successful.     The L-28U site along the L-28 canal is used to monitor freshwater flows from the lands of the Seminole Tribe and to provide nutrient data load summaries. Average annual runoff of 63,930 acre-feet for the period from 1997 to 2001, represents about twice the inflow amount determined by the  SFWMD  at their upstream U.S. Sugar Outflow (USSO) site located on the northwestern border of the Seminole Tribal lands. The L-28IN site along the L-28 Interceptor canal is used to monitor flows from the lands of the Seminole Indian Tribe to the Big Cypress National Preserve and ultimately to Miccosukee Tribal lands as well as providing nutrient data for water-resources planning and management. Annual runoff averaged 53,140 acre-feet from 1997 through 2001. The L-28IS site along the L-28 Interceptor canal, discontinued September 1999, was used to monitor flows from the lands of the Seminole Indian Tribe and the Big Cypress National Preserve to the lands of the Miccosukee Indian Tribe. For the three years of operation this site also provided flows and associated nutrient load data for water managers, and was instrumental in bracketing and quality assuring the flow calibration conditions for the upstream L-28IN site. Average annual runoff at the site for the 1997-1999 periods was calculated to be 49,070 acre-feet.     Measuring flow-weighted nutrient loads requires extremely accurate flow-data collection combined with a highly coordinated nutrient collection and analysis procedure. A collaborative product that meets this need is provided as part of current efforts and has been documented in seven semi-annual progress reports presented to the  SFWMD /Seminole Working Group. An ancillary report was produced from funding sources outside of the  USGS  Placed Based Studies ( PBS ) program budget during the 2002 water year (Lietz, 2002). The report examines the feasibility of estimating concentrations and loads based both on  USGS  acoustic backscatter data and Seminole Tribe nutrient water quality data.

Since the flood, many local, State,  and Federal agencies have been involved in various aspects of flood recovery.  Late in 1993, representatives from the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the White House Office  of Environmental Policy issued a White House directive establishing an  interagency Scientific Assessment and Strategy Team (SAST) to provide  scientific advice and assistance to officials responsible for making decisions about flood recovery in the upper Mississippi River basin. The team developed and provided information to support the decision making process regarding both non-structural (natural floodplains) and structural (levees, dams, dikes) approaches to river basin management.    Specifically, the team compiled and organized information in existing data  bases from a host of Federal, State and local agencies to identify broad areas of the upper Mississippi River and lower Missouri River floodplains, that, from a scientific perspective, are most suitable for assessing alternative flood  control approaches.  It is anticipated that the data base developed also will be useful to states, as well as other Federal agencies to address their specific flood recovery problems and to develop an integrated  flood plain management plan for long-term protection and use of resources  within the flood plains.  The team also produced a series of maps and overlays that show base resource information and vulnerability to flooding.  In  addition, the team is preparing a report documenting the SAST data base, the  products, and the methods used to produce them.   The SAST, comprised of representatives from the Soil Conservation Service,  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National  Biological Survey, U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and Federal Emergency Management Agency, carried out its activities at the EROS Data Center.   The EROS Data Center was chosen to ""host"" this study because of their unique  experience in data management, image processing, geographic information systems technology, and application of ""geo-spatial"" data to resource management problems.  EDC provided considerable technical assistance to this study with support coming from the Science and Applications Branch, the Data Services  Branch, and the Computer Services Branch.     The Scientific Assessment and Strategy Team continues to collect data and  produce products in support of the interagency Floodplain  Management Review Committee.  These data will be placed in the public domain and made available to other scientists who require them for research and long-term  floodplain monitoring and management.

The USGS has measured floods and supplied streamflow data to the nation for more than 110 years and now has released a new fact sheet listing the most significant floods of the 20th century.  During the 20th century, floods were the number-one disaster in the United States in terms of lives lost and property damage, according to the new fact sheet by the USGS. Flooding has caused the deaths of more than 10,000 people since 1900. Property damage from flooding now totals over $1 billion each year in the United States. The fact sheet discusses 32 significant floods that occurred during the 20th century. The floods were determined to be significant based on a combination of factors including lives lost, and total damage and are broken down into six types of floods: large regional flooding, flash floods, storm surge floods, ice-jam floods, dam and levee failure and mudflow floods.   The USGS routinely makes many direct measurements during floods and after floods subside, said USGS research hydrologist and fact sheet author Charles Perry. We based this new fact sheet on more than 110 years of data that the USGS has collected.  The centurys deadliest flood occurred in Galveston, Texas, during a September 1900 Hurricane. As the superstorm rolled ashore along the Gulf Coast, more than 6,000 persons lost their lives in the monster hurricanes storm surge and wind. Ninety percent of the people killed in hurricanes drown as flood waters rise quickly from the storm surge and heavy rains.  Flash floods from intense thunderstorms are also deadly. In June 1972, 237 persons lost their lives along Rapid Creek during the Rapid City S.D. flood. Four years later in July 1976, 144 persons were killed by flash floods on the Big Thompson and Cache la Poudre Rivers in Colorado.  Nationwide, half of all flash flood deaths are related to automobiles. The fact sheet diagrams the usually fatal consequence of driving through floodwaters. Water only one foot deep flowing over a road can exert more than 500 pounds of lateral force, which sweeps an automobile into the much deeper water along the roadside, Perry said.  Floods are also the most costly of all natural disasters in the United States. In the spring and summer of 1993, long periods of excessive rainfall in the upper Mississippi River Basin flooded nine states, killed 48 people and resulted in record losses of more than $20 billion -- about half of these damages were to residences, businesses, public facilities, and transportation facilities. More than 55,000 homes were damaged or destroyed and 532 counties received federal disaster aid.  The USGS maintains more than 7,000 gaging stations throughout the United States, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to monitor streamflow. Real-time streamflow information for most of these stations can be accessed through the World Wide Web, providing flood warning for those in harms way. These gages can also be connected directly to warning devices in flash-flood prone areas. All streamflow information is provided by the USGS to various federal, state and local cooperating agencies as well as the general public. The information is available at  http://water.usgs.gov .  Copies of Fact Sheet 02400, Significant Floods in the United States During the 20th CenturyUSGS Measures a Century of Floods, by Charles A. Perry, are available from the USGS, Information Services, Box 25286, Federal Center, Denver, CO 802250286, or call 1 888ASKUSGS. The fact sheet may be viewed on the Web at:  http://ks.water.usgs.gov/Kansas/pubs/fact-sheets/  National real-time streamflow information from the USGS can be accessed through the Internet at:  http://water.usgs.gov/public/dwc/national_map.html  As the nations largest water, earth and biological science and civilian mapping agency, the USGS works in cooperation with more than 2,000 organizations across the country to provide reliable, impartial, scientific information to resource managers, planners, and other customers. This information is gathered in every state by USGS scientists to minimize the loss of life and property from natural disasters, to contribute to the conservation and the sound economic and physical development of the nations natural resources, and to enhance the quality of life by monitoring water, biological, energy, and mineral resources.  ***USGS***     In-depth information about USGS programs may be found on the USGS home page at  http://www.usgs.gov .

Acoustic instrumentation, in lieu of standard methods for field data collection and flow computations, is used to quantify flows in the canals. Using the acoustic velocity meter (AVM), Acoustic Doppler Velocity meter (ADV), and the Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), it is possible to more accurately gage flows in this type of environment because of new capabilities to quickly measure low or rapidly changing water velocities. Construction, instrumentation, and calibration of the flow gaging sites were completed by the  USGS  during 1996 and 1997. The South Florida Water Management District ( SFWMD ) installed flow-weighted samplers at the gaging sites for nutrient analysis in conjunction with the stream flow monitoring; the Seminole and Miccosukee Indian Tribes have serviced the flow-weighted samplers. Real-time telemetry instrumentation and programming assistance along with phosphorus and nitrogen load calculations have been provided by the  SFWMD .  ADCP calibration of the installed acoustic velocity meter indexes is ongoing and development of the ""sum of least squares regression"" has been provided for data processing at all sites and continues to be refined. Velocity data collected during the dry season has displayed a phenomenon known as acoustic refraction or ray bending produced by thermal stratification in the water column during extended periods of very slow vertical flow. Various installed electromagnetic and new Doppler mean velocity-indexing techniques have been tested and proven largely successful.     The L-28U site along the L-28 canal is used to monitor freshwater flows from the lands of the Seminole Tribe and to provide nutrient data load summaries. Average annual runoff of 63,930 acre-feet for the period from 1997 to 2001, represents about twice the inflow amount determined by the  SFWMD  at their upstream U.S. Sugar Outflow (USSO) site located on the northwestern border of the Seminole Tribal lands. The L-28IN site along the L-28 Interceptor canal is used to monitor flows from the lands of the Seminole Indian Tribe to the Big Cypress National Preserve and ultimately to Miccosukee Tribal lands as well as providing nutrient data for water-resources planning and management. Annual runoff averaged 53,140 acre-feet from 1997 through 2001. The L-28IS site along the L-28 Interceptor canal, discontinued September 1999, was used to monitor flows from the lands of the Seminole Indian Tribe and the Big Cypress National Preserve to the lands of the Miccosukee Indian Tribe. For the three years of operation this site also provided flows and associated nutrient load data for water managers, and was instrumental in bracketing and quality assuring the flow calibration conditions for the upstream L-28IN site. Average annual runoff at the site for the 1997-1999 periods was calculated to be 49,070 acre-feet.     Measuring flow-weighted nutrient loads requires extremely accurate flow-data collection combined with a highly coordinated nutrient collection and analysis procedure. A collaborative product that meets this need is provided as part of current efforts and has been documented in seven semi-annual progress reports presented to the  SFWMD /Seminole Working Group. An ancillary report was produced from funding sources outside of the  USGS  Placed Based Studies ( PBS ) program budget during the 2002 water year (Lietz, 2002). The report examines the feasibility of estimating concentrations and loads based both on  USGS  acoustic backscatter data and Seminole Tribe nutrient water quality data.

GX018-68-5710411	U.S. Geological Survey       Office of Outreach Rebecca Phipps   (703) 648-4460 For Release: Fri., Aug. 15, 1997 - 4:00 p.m. Chesapeake Bay Adivisory:  Water From Pocomoke River Will Be Tested For Toxics          The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is working with scientists from George Mason University and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to collect a water sample from the Pocomoke River and analyze the sample for a variety of commonly used pesticides.  The river was the site of a recent fish kill and the scientists are collecting the sample to determine if pesticide residues could have contributed to the fish kill.  The sample will be collected in the lower freshwater reaches of the Pocomoke River some time over the  next four days (Aug. 16-19, 1997) and analyzed in laboratories at George Mason University.         Reporters interested in making arrangements to view the sampling or in obtaining more information about the sampling should contact USGS hydrologist Robert Shedlock at 410-238-4203.         The scientists doing this work are part of an interagency team that will be conducting a study of toxic compounds in streams that drain into the Chesapeake Bay from the Eastern Shore of Maryland and Delaware.         USGS scientists are also participating in an interdisciplinary program studying the Chesapeake Bay Ecosystem - which includes the Pocomoke River -  and is closely coordinated with the Chesapeake Bay Program, a multi-agency effort for Bay restoration. The objectives of the ecosystem program are to better understand the effects of natural and human-induced activities on the water quality and living resources of the Bay and provide resource managers with information that is based on sound scientific investigations. Management implications of the scientific findings are provided so resource managers may evaluate the effectiveness of different nutrient-reduction strategies on water quality and the living resources in the Bay. The USGS has participated in the Chesapeake Bay Program since 1983.                                   * * * USGS * * *     For more information on USGS programs, check http://www.usgs.gov on the World Wide Web.

(Click on photo for larger version.)     The USGS Annual Holiday Train Display began in 1989 as a simple LGB layout in front of the Christmas tree set up in the main hallway of the Eastern Mapping Center on the second floor of the USGS National Center.  By 1992 the exhibit had moved to its present location in the main auditorium.  The show now includes operating layouts with HO, S (American Flyer), O (Lionel), and G (LGB).  Many static displays related to railroads are also set up in the auditorium.  Organizations such as the Federal Railroad Administration, Amtrak, the National Association of Railroad Passengers, Maryland Department of Transportation, and Operation Lifesaver have provided displays and informational handouts.  The area outside the auditorium has exhibits highlighting the various missions of the USGS science disciplines (geology, geography, hydrography, and biology).  A Community Night includes interactive displays and activities especially for kids.  The train layouts have grown to the point that about 250 labor hours are required to set up and test the operating displays.  A core group of 6-8 volunteers do the set up on the layouts, usually on the weekend before the display opens.  About 10-15 individuals, many from outside USGS, man the exhibit during its four or five day run.  The core USGS volunteers represent Mapping, Geology, and Office of Program Support.  All of the layouts; buildings, track, cars, and locomotives, are owned by individuals who provide them for the display.  The average attendance is about 10,000 during a four-day exhibit.

The aquifer characteristics compiled include hydraulic conductivity, recharge, water-level elevation, and aquifer boundaries.   The individual aquifer characteristic data sets are designed especially for use with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for computerized mapping and spatial analysis. The data sets may be used for a variety of purposes such as studies of water, environment, agriculture, and other related topics. These data sets were developed in cooperation with the State of Oklahoma, Office of the Secretary of Environment for an aquifer vulnerability study. The data sets are provided in nonproprietary Digital Line Graph (DLG) and ARC/INFO export file formats. (Use of trade names is for descriptive purposes only, and does not imply endorsement by the U.S. Government.)   No software is provided with these data sets. Users will need GIS software to use the data sets. The U.S. Geological Survey does not recommend or endorse any particular software package for use with these data sets.

(Click on photo for larger version.)     The USGS Annual Holiday Train Display began in 1989 as a simple LGB layout in front of the Christmas tree set up in the main hallway of the Eastern Mapping Center on the second floor of the USGS National Center.  By 1992 the exhibit had moved to its present location in the main auditorium.  The show now includes operating layouts with HO, S (American Flyer), O (Lionel), and G (LGB).  Many static displays related to railroads are also set up in the auditorium.  Organizations such as the Federal Railroad Administration, Amtrak, the National Association of Railroad Passengers, Maryland Department of Transportation, and Operation Lifesaver have provided displays and informational handouts.  The area outside the auditorium has exhibits highlighting the various missions of the USGS science disciplines (geology, geography, hydrography, and biology).  A Community Night includes interactive displays and activities especially for kids.  The train layouts have grown to the point that about 250 labor hours are required to set up and test the operating displays.  A core group of 6-8 volunteers do the set up on the layouts, usually on the weekend before the display opens.  About 10-15 individuals, many from outside USGS, man the exhibit during its four or five day run.  The core USGS volunteers represent Mapping, Geology, and Office of Program Support.  All of the layouts; buildings, track, cars, and locomotives, are owned by individuals who provide them for the display.  The average attendance is about 10,000 during a four-day exhibit.   Information on the show can be found at  http://www.usgs.gov/trains .

Areas included in this project            are the portions of the Upper Mississippi River, Ohio River, and Great            Lakes Basin that fall within USEPA Region 5.            Data are collected through partners such as the Upper Mississippi River            Basin Association and the Great Lakes Commission. These data are processed            at the  Upper Midwest Environmental            Sciences Center  (UMESC), where they are automated using Geographic            Information Systems (GIS) software. Once automated, spatial databases            can be displayed as hardcopy maps or interactive coverages. Atlas maps            depict environmentally sensitive areas, hydrology, economically sensitive            areas, tribal areas, potential spill sources, and transportation corridors            against a backdrop of scanned images from U.S. Geological Survey quadrangles.                                       UMESC ROLE:                        The UMESC provides technical support on cartographic requirements and            spatial database management needs, and is responsible for the development            of standardized GIS products for USEPA Region 5 to meet requirements            under the Oil Pollution Act. The UMESC uses its expertise in GIS and            remote sensing technologies to develop spatial databases that meet the            needs of planners and responders in the field.             In addition, the UMESC develops standards for map products in cooperation            with USEPA Region 5 and implements these standards in the production            of high-quality map displays. The UMESC serves as the central repository            site, or clearinghouse, for spatial data and the source of technical            support to the USEPA Region 5. The centralized database managed by UMESC            is made accessible via CD-ROM and the Internet.            The UMESC is also under license with the state resource agencies to            classify and mask the Natural Heritage Inventory data to produce GIS            layers acceptable for the mapping project.

GX005-30-2315185	Radon-222 Activities in the Ground Water of the Piedmont Physiographic Province,  Southeastern Pennsylvania      ABSTRACT     Water samples collected from 1986-98 from 912 wells in the Piedmont of southeastern  Pennsylvania were analyzed for radon-222 activity. Radon-222 activities ranged from  49 to 53,000 picoCuries per liter (pCi/L); the median activity was 1,400 pCi/L. The  proposed U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for radon-222  is 300 pCi/L, and the proposed Alternative Maximum Contaminant Level (AMCL) is 4,000 pCi/L.  Water from 89 percent of sampled wells exceeds the MCL, and water from 16 percent of sampled  wells exceeds the AMCL. The distribution of radon-222 activities differed among rock types  with elevated activities most frequently occurring in ground water in schists and quartzites.  The median radon-222 activity was highest for water samples from wells in schist (2,490 pCi/L)  with 94 percent and 27 percent of samples exceeding the MCL and AMCL, respectively.  The median radon-222 activity for water samples from wells in quartzites was 2,300 pCi/L  with 96 percent and 27 percent of samples exceeding the MCL and AMCL, respectively. The  median radon-222 activity was lowest for water samples from wells in carbonate rocks (630 pCi/L)  with 74 percent and 4 percent of samples exceeding the MCL and AMCL, respectively.

GX004-60-4901254	HYDROLOGIC INVESTIGATION AT THE AIW FRANK/MID-COUNTY MUSTANG SUPERFUND SITE,  CHESTER COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA     This project was done in cooperation with        The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency .      NEED FOR THE STUDY         The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency     requested the assistance of the USGS in the hydrogeological      investigation at the AIW Frank/Mid-County Mustang Superfund Site.  The primary purpose of the     hydrogeological investigation was the installation of monitor, observation, and extraction wells      for site remediation.      To aid the U.S. EPA in this investigation, the USGS ran borehole geophysical logs and borehole      television surveys in the wells and conducted aquifer and packer tests.      OBJECTIVE         Borehole geophysical logging, borehole television surveys, and hydraulic tests were performed     by the USGS to characterize the hydrogeology of the site.         APPROACH           Borehole geophysics       were used to:               Locate hydraulically active subsurface fractures         Determine strike and dip of hydraulically active subsurface fractures         Identify zones of flow within  wells         Measure the direction and rate of borehole flow within wells           The following borehole geophysical logs were run by the USGS:              Caliper            Natural gamma             Single-point electrical resistance              Fluid temperature              Fluid      resistively            Fluid velocity using a   heatpulse flowmeter              Acoustic logs using a borehole acoustic televiewer              The following hydraulic tests were performed by the USGS to characterize the hydrogeology of the site:           Slug tests          Aquifer tests           Aquifer isolation (packer) tests           REPORTS RESULTING FROM THIS STUDY           Conger, R.W., Goode, D.J., and Sloto, R.A., 2000, Evaluation of Geophysical      Logs and Slug Test, Phase II, at AIW Frank/Mid-County Mustang Superfund      Site, Chester County, Pennsylvania:      U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 99-452, 28 p.

Merritt              In the 1940's, the        area around Grossman Hammock was used for oil exploration activities, conducted        under terms of State Lease No. 1 of the Trustees of the Internal Improvement        Fund (a State board created in 1855 to promote the economic development        of the state's wetlands areas). The particular circumstances and purposes        leading to the drilling of the ""Grossman well"" in 1944 by a firm        called the Miami Shipbuilding Company were unclear at the time and have        not become clearer with the passage of time. According to the recollection        of N.D. Hoy (U.S. Geological Survey, retired), the firm was associated with        W.G. Blanchard, a sponsor of several oil exploration projects in southern        peninsular Florida during this period. Apparently, the driller had little        knowledge of the subsurface conditions that he was likely to encounter.        An individual named ""Mr. Starr"" began to visit offices of the        Florida Geological Survey and the U.S. Geological Survey to ask for information        and advice, and reported that ""freshwater with an odor of sulfur""        had been encountered at about 1,200 feet below land surface.       Herman Gunter, State        Geologist of Florida, then asked Garald G. Parker of the U.S. Geological        Survey in Miami to investigate ""Mr. Starr's well"" and to obtain        water samples for analysis. N.D. Hoy of the U.S. Geological Survey visited the site on December 23, 1944. Upon his arrival, he found water gushing from the well casing, which extended        1 to 2 feet above land surface in an otherwise undisturbed natural rocky        glades setting. All drilling equipment had been removed. Upon inquiry, he        was informed that drilling had been discontinued about 2 months earlier.        He was also told variously that the well was for oil exploration and for        the purpose of ""finding out what kind of water was down there.""        Years later, in 1969, a Grossman family member stated that the well ""was        a test prior to actual drilling"" of a deep oil well. In 1949, the Coastal        Petroleum Corporation drilled an 11,519-foot deep oil test well a short        distance away from the 1944 well. Only minute quantities of oil were found,        and the deep oil well was abandoned in the early 1950's.

The river forms part of the international boundary between the United States and Canada in southeastern Michigan and southern Ontario.  Drifting buoys were deployed on Detroit River to help investigate flow characteristics of four selected reaches as part of a source water assessment study of public water intakes.  The drifting buoys contained global positioning system (GPS) receivers to help track their movements following their deployment.  In some deployments, buoys were released across a transect at approximately uniform intervals to better understand flow patterns.  In other deployments, buoys were released in clusters to investigate turbulent dispersion characteristics.  Computer animations of buoy movements, which can be viewed through the Internet, are developed to help visualize the results of the buoy deployments.

GX037-21-10000849	"Water Resources     USGS Celebrates National Water Monitoring Day -- October 18 th ,    2002   View the Fact Sheet on-line:  Monitoring    Our Rivers and Streams  (USGS FS-077-02)   Learn    about USGS celebrations in your State!              October 18, 2002  was the 30th anniversary of the enactment        of the Clean Water Act. ( View        President Bush's Proclamation of the Year of Clean Water .) This date        marked a milestone in our Nation's efforts to protect our water resources.        As part of the "" Year of Clean        Water "" celebrations, spearheaded by the America's Clean Water Foundation,        USGS participated in National Water Monitoring, along side volunteers and        professionals interested in, and working on, water-related issues at the        watershed, State, and national levels. This day was a celebration, and featured        the value of monitoring and clean water; existing volunteer monitoring efforts;        public stewardship for watershed protection; and the many multi-organizational        partnerships.                  Field Presence Across    the U.S.:                                USGS personnel monitored chemical, biological and physical        aspects (such as stream flow or ground-water levels) in selected streams,        rivers, and ground-water resources across the Nation. In addition, some        USGS offices hosted Open Houses or participated in Clean Water Festivals        to allow the public to learn about USGS water projects and activities, such        as real-time streamflow measurements and chemical and biological sampling.        ( View a list of completed USGS activities by State ).                 Clean Water Measurements:                 The scope of measurements by USGS will vary according to        the objectives of each ongoing USGS project, but will typically include        the four measures specified for National Water Monitoring Day: pH,        temperature, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity. ( Why        are these measurements important? )                     Data Accessibility:                 USGS promotes the availability of  real-time         and historic  streamflow         and  water-quality  information,        as well as  WaterWatch  maps and graphs of water        conditions as compared to those over the last 30 years. This information        is available to all partners and local communities and will help to establish        a national hydrologic context for National Water Monitoring Day data.

GX024-10-12090232	The National Flood Frequency Program, Version 3:      A Computer Program for Estimating Magnitude and  Frequency of Floods for Ungaged Sites      Water-Resources Investigations Report 02-4168   Compiled by K.G. Ries III and M.Y. Crouse    This report is available as a pdf.    Abstract     For many years, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has  been developing regional regression equations for estimating flood magnitude and frequency at ungaged sites. These  regression equations are used to transfer flood characteristics  from gaged to ungaged sites through the use of watershed and  climatic characteristics as explanatory or predictor variables.  Generally, these equations have been developed on a Statewide or metropolitan-area basis as part of cooperative study  programs with specific State Departments of Transportation.      In 1994, the USGS released a computer program titled  the National Flood Frequency Program (NFF), which compiled all the USGS available regression equations for estimating the magnitude and frequency of floods in the United States  and Puerto Rico. NFF was developed in cooperation with the  Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Emergency  Management Agency. Since the initial release of NFF, the  USGS has produced new equations for many areas of the  Nation. A new version of NFF has been developed that incorporates these new equations and provides additional functionality and ease of use.      NFF version 3 provides regression-equation estimates  of flood-peak discharges for unregulated rural and urban  watersheds, flood-frequency plots, and plots of typical flood  hydrographs for selected recurrence intervals. The Program  also provides weighting techniques to improve estimates of  flood-peak discharges for gaging stations and ungaged sites.  The information provided by NFF should be useful to engineers and hydrologists for planning and design applications.      This report describes the flood-regionalization techniques used in NFF and    provides guidance on the applicability and limitations of the techniques. The    NFF software and the documentation for the regression equations included in    NFF are available at  http://water.usgs.gov/software/nff.html .

How a glacier moves, whether it is advancing or receding, and the temperature profile, all provide direct, observable evidence about our changing environment.  To detect subtle changes caused by nature and even more subtle changes caused by humans, the composition of glacial ice has been extensively studied.       The visible component of glacial ice is usually the first to be studied.  Natural events that are often visible in ice are volcanic eruptions.  When a volcano erupts, large quantities of ash and fine particulate matter are spewed into the atmosphere.  This matter spreads over the globe and is deposited.  Some of the matter becomes trapped in snow and later is transformed into glacial ice.   Other natural events visible in ice include ash from large forest fires, explosions in insect populations, and summer particulate loading to the glacial surface.  Each of these events provides additional information about the history of environmental change that is stored in the ice.   In many cases, though, the most revealing aspects of glacial ice are the components that cannot be seen, such as the chemical and trace-element compositions.  Glacial ice is routinely measured for major ion concentrations and also for concentrations of certain isotopes.  (Click here to learn more about  isotopes  .   Oxygen isotopes   reveal summer-winter patterns as well as warming or cooling trends.   Deuterium  ,  tritium  ,  carbon-14  ,  silicon-32  ,  chlorine-36  ,  iodine-129,   and  cesium-137  are other isotopes commonly preserved in glacial ice that reveal information about the past.  Click on each isotope to learn more about what it is, what analytical technique is used to detect it, and what we can learn from it.

My                                          research in Maryland is focusing on understanding                                          the sources and flux of suspended sediment                                          in select watersheds draining to the Chesapeake                                          Bay. This data will coincide with other                                          USGS efforts to understand sediment processes                                          in the tidal portions of Chesapeake Bay                                          that include shoreline erosion, sediment                                          transport in the Bay, and sediment resuspension                                          in the Bay. Information from all these                                          sediment processes will be used to understand                                          the relation of sediment delivery to sediment                                          deposition, effects on water clarity,                                          and effects on submerged aquatic vegetation                                          and other biota in the receiving tidal                                          tributaries.                                                                                     My research on arroyo systems in the Southwest                                          has focused on examining arroyo cut-and-fill                                          cycles in the Late Quaternary, documenting                                          arroyo channel changes in the historic                                          record (last 100 years), and applying                                          knowledge of arroyo dynamics and hillslope                                          erosion to watershed rehabilitation strategies.                                          Interpretation made from my research suggests                                          that over geologic time scales (~10,000                                          years) intrinsic processes may dictate                                          when conditions are right for arroyo cutting.                                          Depending on the state of channel conditions                                          (depth, width, channel slope, vegetation,                                          etc.) the arroyo may not have the correct                                          hydraulic conditions necessary for a climate                                          change to trigger incision. This hypothesis                                          that the state of the arroyo is important                                          is further supported by my research on                                          recent arroyo changes and climate changes                                          in New Mexico.

I am also                                          studying suspended-sediment characteristics                                          in humid-tropical watersheds in Puerto                                          Rico. The objectives of this research                                          are to understand the significant hydrologic                                          controls of suspended-sediment concentration                                          and how previous events affect sediment                                          concentrations. I am also interested in                                          how these controls on sediment characteristics                                          will change in basins of differing land                                          use (forest pasture, cropland, and urban).
