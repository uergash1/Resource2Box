Department Stats    Enduring Goals    Agendas/Minutes                    The District's administrative staff manages the business     side of the organization. These responsibilities include human resources,     finance, strategic planning, legislative advocacy, policy development,     procurement, liability, and legal. The District's Board of Directors and     administrative staff determine and implement strategies to effect an     effective, efficient, and economic service     delivery level.       By virtue of the name fire district it is obvious that the     primary responsibility of a fire district delivery system is to suppress     fires. This is of course why the District was created in the first place.     However, the Fire District Law contained within the State of California     Health and Safety code authorizes a fire district to provide much more in     scope of services to its constituency.       In addition to fire services, a fire district may also     provide:       · Rescue services      · Emergency medical response      · Hazardous materials emergency response      · Ambulance services (ALS transport services may not be delivered without     county     permission, unless ALS transport was a service provided prior to     1981).      · Any other services related to protecting life and property.       To assist districts in carrying out these services,     Fire District law also authorizes the following powers and duties:       · To acquire property, through eminent domain, necessary     for the delivery of its functions and services.       · To appoint employees necessary for the delivery of     services, establish their qualifications and duties and provide a salary     schedule for the performance of their duties, pursuant to state and federal     regulations governing employees and salaries.       · To enter into mutual-aid agreements with any city,     county, other fire districts, and private firms and corporations that     provide fire protection services.       · To establish rules and regulations for the     administration, operation, and maintenance of those services provided.       · To adopt and enforce a fire prevention code (in     accordance with Title 5 of the Government Code).

Plone makes heavy use of CSS, which means it is accessible to any internet browser,  but the design needs a   standards-compliant browser to look like we intended it .
