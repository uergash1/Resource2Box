Every 10 years, this is the impossible          task that the Commerce Department's Census Bureau takes on. Census 2000          was billed by the bureau as ""the largest peacetime effort in the history          of the United States."" You may recall some of the hoopla surrounding this          effort in late 1999 and early 2000 as the nation prepared for National          Census Day-April 1.                     Counting seems to be the central theme of the United States in 2000, whether          it be dimpled and pregnant chads or each citizen living from the tip of          Maine to the Aleutian Islands off the most western part of Alaska. If          you live in the United States, there's a good chance that you received          one of the 98 million census forms that were mailed out by the Census          Bureau, and on April 1 an adult in each American household was supposed          to fill out this form and send it in. More than eight months later, the          official tally is in. Census 2000 shows that the resident population of          the United States as of April 1, 2000 is 281,421,906. That is a 13.2 percent          increase over 1990, when 248,709,873 were counted. See the Census Bureau          for details.                     The census is required by the U.S. Constitution under Article 1 Section          2, and performed once a decade to do more than just satisfy our curiosity          about the number of people that live in the country. In this edition of          How Stuff Works, you'll learn how the census is actually taken, how its          results are used to distribute federal funds and what impact the census          has on the U.S. House of Representatives.                     What Exactly Is the Census and How Long          Has It Been Around?                     The concept of a census, or counting of residents, is an ancient one dating          to Biblical times. The first census ever taken in North America, historians          say, was in 1576, 200 years before America gained its independence from          the British. Spanish King Philip II, who then ruled the large region,          sent American Indians through what is now Mexico with a list of 100 questions.          The Indians spoke no Spanish, so they recorded the answers in hieroglyphs          (pictures) and made maps the same way. (They even showed one-way streets          with footprints!)                    Since 1790, national census information has been taken every 10 years          (in years ending in zero) because it is mandated by the U.S. Constitution          and necessary to determining each area's representation in the U.S. House          of Representatives. In 1790, George Washington signed the act into law.          (Interestingly, several states had been taking their own census earlier          and continued to do so in non-zero-ending years.) While the Constitution          describes the census simply as an ""enumeration of inhabitants,"" the census          has evolved over time into a more comprehensive-and more useful-process.          Now, we can learn much more about our population than just the number          of people living in the United States.                     According to Judy Hanna Green's book Finding Treasures in the U.S. Federal          Census in 1790, the population of the United States was just under 4 million-not          counting slaves or the untaxed Indians. (A primary goal of the first census          was to provide information on men eligible for the military. On the heels          of the Revolutionary War, the new American citizens were especially conscious          of the importance of a strong military. Later, during the War of 1812,          much of the 1790 census was destroyed by fire.)                     In the first national census, 17 U.S. marshals appointed 200 assistants.          They rode on horseback all over the nation to count people, writing with          quill pens (Read more about pen history as How a Ballpoint Pen Works!)          on any scraps of paper they could find. The cost of that census project          was $45,000!                     Technology began to become part of census taking in 1890. The Census Bureau          developed a new electrical machine that could add up responses to questions          after census workers punched holes in the right places for each answer.          Cards were then fed into a machine that totaled the result. It was bulky          but a great advance at that time-anything that sped up the process was          a help since some of the results must be ready nine months after Census          Day (more about that later).                     The first modern computer, called ENIAC, was invented in 1946 at the University          of Pennsylvania. This computer, which was really many machines working          together, took up a whole room. The system was ready in time for use in          parts of the 1950 census, and the Census Bureau ordered its own computer,          called UNIVAC. That technology has improved over the years and now high-speed,          supercomputers are available to assist the census.                    Today, this technology plays a major role in the processing and census          data. The major automation features for Census 2000 include data capture          systems designed to handle the use of ""respondent-friendly"" questionnaires.          The Census Bureau uses the National Processing Center and works with contractors          who operate three processing centers responsible for a variety of data          capture functions:                      A full data capture and processing system records an image of every          questionnaire.            Questionnaires returned by mail will be sorted automatically to ensure          timely capture of   critical information needed before the non-response          follow-up.            Optical mark recognition will be used for all check-box data items.                     Intelligent character recognition (ICR) will be used to capture write-in          character-based data   items.            A clerical keying operation will capture and resolve difficult ICR cases.                     A quality assurance review will be conducted on data keying and scanning          activities.                     Census Bureau officials say the use of electronic imaging and captures          data in 2000 reduced the logistical and staffing requirements that accompany          handling large volumes of paper questionnaires.                     Most of the U.S. Census was taken door-to-door until 1960, when census          officials recognized the inefficiency of this method in dealing with such          a fast-growing, increasingly diverse and mobile population. That's when          they decided to use the mail to distribute forms. In the 1970 census,          about 60 percent was taken by mail and in 1980, about 90 percent. However,          in 1990, when the Census Bureau tried to take about 94 percent of the          census by mail, one in three households failed to return the forms. That's          why the most recent decennial census was the focus of a major, nationwide          awareness campaign, officials say.                    But neither technology nor mail has replaced the all-important census          team members. Among the thousands of workers today are:                      Administrators-They determine how each division of the Census Bureau          will do its part in the   census.            Enumerators-They go door-to-door to gather information from residents          who have not   returned their census forms.            Statisticians-They make sure the Census Bureau's math is right.            Demographers-These people understand the statistics and have studied          what statistics tell   about American life.                     They analyze the census numbers, comparing them with numbers from earlier          censuses, and tell us important things about the future. Why Is the Census          Important? Participating in the census is in everyone's best interest,          because the information on the forms is used by decision-makers to determine          which communities, schools, hospitals and roads need federal funding.          Filling out your census form is also the best way to make sure people          like you are represented in the census.                     Here are just a few examples of important uses for census numbers:                      The federal government uses census numbers to allocate over $100 billion          in federal funds annually for community programs and services, such as          education programs, housing and community development, health-care services          for the elderly, job training and many more.                      State, local and tribal governments use census information for planning          and allocating funds for new school construction, libraries and other          public buildings, highway safety and public transportation systems, new          roads and bridges, location of police and fire departments and many other          projects.                      Community organizations use census information to develop social service          programs, community action projects, senior lunch programs and child-care          centers.                      Businesses use the numbers to decide where to locate factories, shopping          centers, movie theaters, banks and offices-activities that often lead          to new jobs.                      The U.S. Congress uses the census totals to determine how many seats          your state will have in the U.S. House of Representatives. In addition,          states use the numbers to allocate seats in their law-making bodies. President          Clinton will deliver the apportionment counts to the 107th Congress during          the first week of its regular session in January 2000. The reapportioned          Congress, which will be the 108th, will convene in January 2003. This          reapportionment of the 435 seats in the House of Representatives could          have important political implications.                     All that we learn about ourselves through the census will help the United          States succeed over the next millennium. It's also a great way to tell          our leaders who we are and what we need. If you need a closer-to-home          reason for completing your census form, the Census Bureau suggests that          you consider the following:                      You can help your community thrive. Does your neighborhood have a lot          of traffic congestion, elderly people living alone or over-crowded schools?          Census numbers can help your community work out public improvement strategies.          Non-profit organizations use census numbers to estimate the number of          potential volunteers in communities across the nation.                     You can make your government work for you. The hundreds of billions          of dollars in federal and state funds allocated each year mean important          things to you-things such as school lunch programs, hospitals and highways!          (Using census numbers to support their request for a new community center,          senior citizens in one New England community successfully argued their          case before county commissioners.)                      You can get help when you need it. Many 911 emergency systems are based          on maps developed for the last census. Census information helps health          providers predict the spread of diseases through communities with children          or elderly people. And when floods, tornadoes or earthquakes hit, the          census tells rescuers how many people will need their help.                      You can help American businesses. Census numbers help industry reduce          financial risk and locate potential markets. This means that businesses          are able to determine the marketability of potential products and come          up products you want.                      You can get information you and your family need. Although individual          records are held confidential for 72 years (more about that coming up!),          you can request a certificate from past censuses that can be used to establish          your age, residence or relationship-information that could help you qualify          for a pension, establish citizenship or obtain an inheritance. (In 2072,          your great-grandchildren may want to use census information to research          family history. Right now, your children may be using census information          to do their homework.)                     Will I Sacrifice My Privacy If I Complete          the Form?                     By law, the Census Bureau cannot share your answers with others, including          welfare agencies, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Internal          Revenue Service, courts, police and the military. Under the provisions          of Title 13 of the U.S. Code, census bureau workers who break this law          face up to five years in prison and $5,000 in fines. The law works-millions          of questionnaires were processed during the 1990s without any breach of          trust.                     This should also be reassuring: Did you know that the law required each          batch of census forms to remain private for 72 years? This is to encourage          honesty and accurate information. The rationale behind this law is that          little negative impact could happen after 72 years, since most of the          people listed would be gone. So, this means that the latest census available          to the public is the one taken in 1920.                     The process of microfilming and printing the census also takes a long          time to accomplish because of the 72-year wait and also by the sheer volume          of documents. (This process usually takes another two years or so to complete          and make ready for the public, according to bureau officials.)                     First results of Census 2000 will be the state population totals used          to reapportion the U.S. House of Representatives, which must be delivered          to the President in exactly nine months-by Dec. 31, 2000. More detailed          data used to redraw U.S. and state majority and minority leaders by April          1, 2001.                      How Does the Census Process Actually          Work?                     In early March 2000, 98 million census forms-both long and short forms-went          out in the mail to about 83 percent of the nation's residences. In addition,          census enumerators personally delivered about 22 million additional forms          to homes that lack street-name and house-number addresses, mostly in rural          and remote areas. These represent about 17 percent of the nation's housing          units. Hundreds of thousands of census takers and support personnel have          been hired to account for the anticipated 118 million housing units and          275 million people across the United States.                     The questionnaires were preceded by an advance letter sent a week or so          earlier. This letter gave residents the option of asking for questionnaires          in five languages besides English: Spanish, Tagalog, Korean, Chinese and          Vietnamese. Later this month (March), the Census Bureau then sent a reminder          card asking residents to mail back the form as soon as possible.                     During March of a census year, the Census Bureau conducts special operations          to count people with no fixed address or who live in dormitories, nursing          homes, prisons, shelters, trailer parks, transient housing and other groups          or non-standard housing.                     After April 1, census workers spend a couple of months trying to locate          and get information from households or families that failed to respond          by mail. If your questionnaire is incomplete, a census employee must contact          you to obtain the missing information. Then these answers are combined          with those on your questionnaire. It is these combined numbers-not your          individual answers-that are published.                     As census methodology has become more sophisticated, researchers have          begun to learn more about who responds and who doesn't. For example, the          overall non-response rate in 1990 was 25.3 percent. Researchers say response-or          lack of response-to the mailed 1990 Census questionnaires was highly correlated          with race and length of time at a residence. Researchers also said that          mail response to the 1990 Census was strongly related to family composition          (the number of parents in the home, the age of the single parent, etc.).                               How Can Homeless and Transient People          Be Counted?                     According to the Census Bureau, it enlists the help of local experts in          finding places where people without housing receive services, such as          emergency and transitional shelters, soup kitchens, regularly-scheduled          mobile food vans and targeted outdoor locations. Census workers go to          these locations to conduct the census.                     Partnerships with community-based organizations are essential to including          migrant and seasonal farm workers in the census. The Census Bureau seeks          the advice of local experts to find areas where migrant and seasonal workers          live and work, including unregistered labor camps, vehicles parked near          work sites and living areas along unnamed roads.                     Census takers interview people staying at campgrounds, fairs and carnivals          and marinas. Every person interviewed has the opportunity to report his          or her permanent address.                      Other Special Groups                     There are a number of other special groups that require special planning.          There are special procedures for ensuring that census information for          people living in remote areas is accurate. For example, in remote Alaska,          the census must be completed before the spring thaw. After the thaw, many          residents are away from their homes hunting or conducting other spring          activities. By then it is too late for counters to contact them.                     And the Census Bureau works with the Department of Defense and the U.S.          Coast Guard to identify living quarters on military installations and          ships. All ocean going, coastal and Great Lake ships take part in what          is known as the Census Maritime Enumeration. In addition, the Census Bureau's          plan accounts for military personnel and federal civilian government employees,          as well as their dependents, who are stationed overseas.                     When necessary, census takers assist residents who need help in completing          the forms. In some facilities, such as jails, the staff distributes census          questionnaires. These staff workers, like all census workers, are sworn          to protect the confidentiality of the individual.                     A complete set of residence rules telling where students, nursing home          residents, military personnel and others are counted can be found on the          Census Bureau's Web site.                      What About Children? Are They Counted?                              While considerable attention has been devoted to the undercount for the          U.S. population overall and to specific sub-groups such as young black          men in inner cities, less attention has been given to the undercount of          children.                     In an attempt to help remedy that problem, the Census Bureau has provided          more than 300,000 Census in Schools kits throughout the country. The purpose          of the kits is to increase participation in the census among children          and parents. ""In 1990, many parents did not record children on their census          questionnaire,"" Bureau Director Kenneth Prewitt said. ""This program is          one way we hope to ensure that every child is counted. We hope parents          will urge their schools and that teachers will urge their principals to          take part in the Census in Schools program.""                     The program provides students with a take-home letter explaining to parents          the importance of an accurate census. The letter is available in English,          Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, Tagalog and Korean. Additional take-home          materials provide recreational census activities for students to complete          with their parents. Sent to the schools in February, each program teaching          guide contains lesson plans that address map literacy, community involvement          and information management. Kits are available for grades K-4, 5-8, 9-12.          Custom designed teaching kits were sent to schools in Puerto Rico, the          U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the          Northern Mariana Islands. (Scholastic Inc. helped to develop the program's          teaching materials most of which can be downloaded from the bureau's website.)                               What Is the Form Like?                     In 2000, the Census Bureau sent out about 83 million short forms (with          seven questions) and 15 million long forms (with 52 questions). Prewitt          says the short form asks for less information than is found on your driver's          license and takes about 10 minutes to complete. The long form takes about          38 minutes, he estimates. Although the rate varies according to population          density, in most areas about 5 out of 6 homes will receive the short form,          while the remaining 1 out of 6 will receive the long form. (In some rural          areas, as many as every other home may receive this long form, because          a larger sample is needed to ensure that these towns and counties get          the same detailed information as more densely populated areas.)                     The questionnaires have room for information on six household members.          If you have more than six living in your home, you should fill in the          additional names, and a Census Bureau representative will contact you          for more information.                     The short form-the shortest in 180 years-contains six population questions          and one housing question. The long form has 31 population questions (including          the six short-form population questions) and 21 housing questions (including          the short-form housing questions). Questions are included on the census          questionnaire only if they serve a legal or programmatic need, according          to census officials. (For information on these reasons, see the Census          Bureau's Web site.)                     For the first time, the 2000 census allowed you to identify yourself as          being more than one race. Participants in the census had the choice of          checking off as many race categories as they wished. Hispanics may be          of any race; therefore, there is one question on Hispanic origin and another          race.                     The only additional documents you need to help you complete the form are          income tax forms and property tax and homeowners' payment records. (Only          a few figures are needed.)                      What If I Have Questions About My Form?                              The Census Bureau will help you. Start by looking at these Help and Information          sites. In addition to the Census Bureau's very comprehensive Web site,          there are also questionnaire assistance centers in your community, and          a toll-free telephone number to call for assistance is written on the          form you received in the mail. If you've lost your form or didn't receive          one, you can call your local or regional center to find out where to get          one.                     When you think about it, participating in Census 2000 is being a part          of history in the making.

Since the early 1800s, however, policy makers have recognized that   an accurate census can provide other valuable information to improve the policy   process. Today, policy makers at all levels of government, as well as private   businesses, households, researchers, and nonprofit organizations, rely on an   accurate census in myriad ways that range far beyond the single fact of how   many people live in each state. This report provides a brief overview of these   uses.                   FEDERAL GOVERNMENT USES    Monitoring compliance with     Federal law.  Questions on ancestry, gender, race, Hispanic origin, language     spoken at home, place of birth, citizenship and year of entry provide critical     information for monitoring compliance with the Voting Rights Act, the Civil     Rights Act, and other anti-discrimination and affirmative action plan     requirements.    Assessing economic well being.  Accurate census     data are critical for developing accurate assessments of economic well-being     for the Nation as a whole as well as for different racial, ethnic, and regional     populations.    Assisting families and low-income populations.      Accurate census data are critical for programs that aim to identify areas     eligible for housing assistance and rehabilitation loans; housing subsidies;     job training and employment services; energy cost assistance; and community     economic development. Accurate census data also are critical to allocating     funds for supplemental food programs and other social services for women and     children.    Assisting the elderly, the disabled, and veterans.      Accurate census data are required to determine and forecast the number of     persons eligible for benefits based on age, such as Social Security and     Medicare and to forecast the number of persons eligible for Social Security     disability benefits. They are necessary to develop baselines for reducing     employment barriers faced by persons with disabilities and to allocate funds     for vocational education and rehabilitation programs for disabled workers.     Accurate census data are required to determine where to build veterans     hospitals, to establish baselines for veteran population projections, and to     report to Congress on the needs of selected groups of veterans, such as     Vietnam-era and female veterans.    Education.  The accuracy of     census data affects the allocation of funding for numerous Federal education     programs such as vocational and adult education.    Other.  Census     data on farm residence help USDA assess housing conditions and needs on farms.     Information on place of work and journey to work helps the Federal government     formulate national transportation and energy-use policies.               STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT USES    Drawing legislative     boundaries.  Decisions on redistricting and the determination of state and     local voting district boundaries require accurate census data.        Education.  Accurate census data are critical to local government     agencies and school boards trying to determine the need for new schools,     including what type (elementary, middle, or high school).        Infrastructure, public health and environmental protection, and program     planning.  Numerous state and local government planning responsibilities     depend on accurate census data, including determining the need for schools,     highways, public transportation, hospitals, libraries, and police and fire     protection. Water and sewage disposal information helps identify needs for     water purification, treatment, or sewage facilities. Farm data are used to     allocate funds to land grant colleges, for cooperative extension activities,     and for grants to agricultural experiment stations. Accurate census data make     for better planning and implementation of a variety of programs, including     education and training, health, education, and social services. Accurate census     data help public health officials perform tasks such as locating areas in     danger of ground water contamination and waterborne diseases. They help     environmental agencies analyze energy consumption, identify conservation     opportunities, and forecast energy needs.    Disaster relief.      Accurate census information helps local governments predict transportation     needs in disaster recovery and contingency planning initiatives. The data help     governments and relief agencies in assessing the amount of displacement and the     shelter and recovery needs of populations affected by natural disasters such as     floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, and earthquakes.    Assisting families,     low-income populations, the elderly, the disabled, and veterans.  Accurate     census data are necessary for appropriate state implementation of Federal     programs for these groups in areas such as housing assistance, energy cost     assistance, community development, and employment and social services. Accurate     census data also help city and community officials pinpoint areas that need     special programs such as meals-on-wheels and social service agencies identify     special needs such as telephone access in case of medical emergency.               BUSINESS USES    Product development and marketing.      Accurate census data on where people of different ages live helps businesses of     all kinds to develop and market their products. For example:                      Manufacturers of baby products such as baby food, clothes,       diapers, and toys, and manufacturers of maternity clothes and greeting cards       need accurate information on children as they develop and market their product       lines, as do television producers of children’s programs and planners of       large family amusement parks.               Architects, contractors, and real estate firms need accurate       information on the size and composition of households and their housing as they       design, build, and sell houses and apartments.               Producers of consumer durables such as television sets, washing       machines, and home furnishings benefit from accurate information on households       and their characteristics.               Accurate census information on language spoken at home helps       television and radio stations define foreign language service areas and       marketing companies develop products and services tailored to those who speak       languages other than English.               Forecasting demand.  Businesses forecasting demand for their     products require accurate census data to develop these forecasts. Utilities     depend on accurate census data to develop long-range plans for new facilities     and networks.        Location decisions.  A variety of business location decisions     are improved by accurate census data. Examples include: businesses seeking to     pinpoint areas to gauge potential markets for locating new stores, plants, or     warehouses; businesses interested in finding sites having a labor force with     certain education characteristics; building developers and contractors     selecting sites for new housing developments; and businesses seeking to     pinpoint areas of a city for locating new restaurants specializing in     particular types of ethnic food.        Providing equal opportunities and achieving compliance with     Federal law.          Accurate census data help businesses set up and monitor affirmative     action and anti-discrimination plans. And they help companies to comply with     anti-discrimination legislation such as the Equal Employment Opportunities     Act.        Examples of Business Use of Census Data.  Newspaper accounts     and census questionnaires provide examples of businesses that use census data.       Numerous small businesses responded to a request for examples of     business uses of census data, but so too did some large companies. For example,     one large fast-food chain reported that for the past 20 years they had relied     on decennial censuses to perform market analysis and determine site locations     for new restaurants. The company also has used the Census Bureau’s TIGER     Line files (a digital map database) to merge their own proprietary information     with the detailed social and economic data from the decennial census for small     geographic areas for use in its corporate planning.        Around the time of the last census, a prominent newspaper ran a lead     article in its Business section entitled, ""For Business, Census is a Marketing     Data Motherlode."" The article noted how retailers, such as one large general     merchandise company, use the census to fine-tune neighborhood promotions; how a     large grocery chain used it to study potential sites for new stores; and how     one consumer products firm used it to estimate sales of diapers a decade out.     The article also described how banks use census data to provide a basic     demographic sketch of the neighborhoods around each of their branches.        Examples of uses of census data culled from a sample of monthly     activity reports from the Census Bureau’s Regional Office Information     Services Program include the following:                      An independent television station in Philadelphia that is using       ZIP code level data for a viewer profile to design program and advertising       strategies.               A foreign language newspaper distributor seeking increased       circulation in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut used census data to list       languages spoken at home in each county of the three states.               A major advertising firm used census data on languages spoken at       home in the Chicago area to develop a new advertising campaign for a       client.               A district sales office for an automobile manufacturer is using       ZIP Code and city profiles for a market analysis that will be used to help       local dealerships develop sales campaigns.               A real estate company in Colorado is using census data to       determine which languages to use on a series of instructional tapes on buying       and selling real estate.                      COMMUNITY GROUP USES         Delivering health, social, and educational services.  In many     cases, private social service agencies and community groups have the same needs     for accurate census data as state and local government agencies that provide     social services. Private groups benefit from accurate census data to set up and     administer assistance programs for children, teens, and older persons; to     provide services that reflect cultural differences; to teach English, and     conduct voter registration drives; to provide housing and job training for     displaced homemakers; to provide veteran support services and promote the need     for veteran services and facilities.        Disaster relief.  As with social services, non-governmental     organizations benefit from accurate census information in much the same way as     governments when planning for and responding to disasters like hurricanes,     tornadoes, floods, and earthquakes.               INDIVIDUAL USES        Location decisions.  Individuals can make better choices about     home-buying, job relocation, or starting a small business if they can take     advantage of accurate census information.               ACADEMIC RESEARCH USES         Accurate census data are vital to researchers in a wide variety of     endeavors. Some of the most important needs include the following:                      Any research requiring comprehensive information at the       neighborhood level must rely on the census, with its tract level       information.              Research on ethnicity or other research requiring reasonable       numbers of observations of relatively small population groups must rely on the       census.              The decennial census is the only consistent source of data for       researchers examining trends over periods of decades.              The census is the best source of information for research on       immigration and mobility.                      USES BY OTHER SURVEYS AND DATA COLLECTION        Serving as an important base for other surveys.  Data from the     decennial Census form a crucial input into the sample designs of other national     surveys such as the Current Population Survey (the source of the nation’s     unemployment statistics), the Survey of Income and Program Participation, the     National Crime Victimization Survey, the Survey of Recent College Graduates,     the Consumer Expenditure Survey (the source for expenditure weights used in     calculating the Consumer Price Index), and statistics complied by the National     Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) and the National Center for Health     Statistics (NCHS).        Calculating rates.  Data from other sources are combined with     data from the Census to compute rates of various indicators. For example, NCHS     uses its own survey data combined with Census data to calculate numerous vital     statistics and rates for health service utilization. Similarly, the Bureau of     Justice Statistics uses Census data to calculate imprisonment and victimization     rates, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation uses Census data to calculate     crime rates.        Creating national estimates.  Census data are used to adjust     surveys to be nationally representative. For example, the NCES uses Census data     to make its survey results on education indicators reflect the total United     States population.        Case Study: The Current Population Survey.  Information on the     labor force, employment, and unemployment is derived from the monthly Current     Population Survey (CPS). The March supplement to the CPS provides information     for calculating the poverty rate and measures of household and family income.     The accuracy of the CPS depends critically on the accuracy of census     information, because all of the population “controls” for a decade     are derived from the previous decennial census. These population controls are     then updated monthly using estimates of births, deaths, and migration. The BLS     has incorporated information about the undercount in the 1990 census into the     CPS.        BLS Commissioner Abraham has advised Census Director Prewitt that if     the BLS had not incorporated the undercount, and, instead, used the official     1990 census population estimates used for apportionment, its estimate of the     working age population would have been too low by 2.1 million. Labor force     information for persons of Hispanic origin and blacks would have been affected     disproportionately because these groups make up three-fourths of persons not     counted in the official statistics. Without information on the undercount, BLS     says its estimates of the overall level of employment and unemployment would     have been too low, and the geographic and demographic distribution of     unemployment (and other measures) shown in their data would have been     inaccurate. Moreover these errors would have persisted for (at least) the next     10 years.         Unemployment statistics from the CPS are included in the allocation     formulas used to distribute funds in many Federal programs. Use of inaccurate     population estimates could cause a shift of several percent in a state’s     allocation. Many Federal programs are tied to the poverty rate, which could     also be affected by inaccurate population counts. This and other information     derived from the CPS affects evaluations of such initiatives as welfare reform,     health insurance legislation, and minimum wage legislation.

GX026-36-9166617	"The Uses of Census Data: An Analytical Review         April 1, 2000      A Report by the Council of Economic Advisers        PDF Version of Report     PDF Information     (34 kb)           OVERVIEW:        Constitutionally, the purpose of the decennial census is to ensure an   accurate apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives based on state   populations. Since the early 1800s, however, policy makers have recognized that   an accurate census can provide other valuable information to improve the policy   process. Today, policy makers at all levels of government, as well as private   businesses, households, researchers, and nonprofit organizations, rely on an   accurate census in myriad ways that range far beyond the single fact of how   many people live in each state. This report provides a brief overview of these   uses.                   FEDERAL GOVERNMENT USES    Monitoring compliance with     Federal law.  Questions on ancestry, gender, race, Hispanic origin, language     spoken at home, place of birth, citizenship and year of entry provide critical     information for monitoring compliance with the Voting Rights Act, the Civil     Rights Act, and other anti-discrimination and affirmative action plan     requirements.    Assessing economic well being.  Accurate census     data are critical for developing accurate assessments of economic well-being     for the Nation as a whole as well as for different racial, ethnic, and regional     populations.    Assisting families and low-income populations.      Accurate census data are critical for programs that aim to identify areas     eligible for housing assistance and rehabilitation loans; housing subsidies;     job training and employment services; energy cost assistance; and community     economic development. Accurate census data also are critical to allocating     funds for supplemental food programs and other social services for women and     children.    Assisting the elderly, the disabled, and veterans.      Accurate census data are required to determine and forecast the number of     persons eligible for benefits based on age, such as Social Security and     Medicare and to forecast the number of persons eligible for Social Security     disability benefits. They are necessary to develop baselines for reducing     employment barriers faced by persons with disabilities and to allocate funds     for vocational education and rehabilitation programs for disabled workers.     Accurate census data are required to determine where to build veterans     hospitals, to establish baselines for veteran population projections, and to     report to Congress on the needs of selected groups of veterans, such as     Vietnam-era and female veterans.    Education.  The accuracy of     census data affects the allocation of funding for numerous Federal education     programs such as vocational and adult education.    Other.  Census     data on farm residence help USDA assess housing conditions and needs on farms.     Information on place of work and journey to work helps the Federal government     formulate national transportation and energy-use policies.               STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT USES    Drawing legislative     boundaries.  Decisions on redistricting and the determination of state and     local voting district boundaries require accurate census data.        Education.  Accurate census data are critical to local government     agencies and school boards trying to determine the need for new schools,     including what type (elementary, middle, or high school).        Infrastructure, public health and environmental protection, and program     planning.  Numerous state and local government planning responsibilities     depend on accurate census data, including determining the need for schools,     highways, public transportation, hospitals, libraries, and police and fire     protection. Water and sewage disposal information helps identify needs for     water purification, treatment, or sewage facilities. Farm data are used to     allocate funds to land grant colleges, for cooperative extension activities,     and for grants to agricultural experiment stations. Accurate census data make     for better planning and implementation of a variety of programs, including     education and training, health, education, and social services. Accurate census     data help public health officials perform tasks such as locating areas in     danger of ground water contamination and waterborne diseases. They help     environmental agencies analyze energy consumption, identify conservation     opportunities, and forecast energy needs.    Disaster relief.      Accurate census information helps local governments predict transportation     needs in disaster recovery and contingency planning initiatives. The data help     governments and relief agencies in assessing the amount of displacement and the     shelter and recovery needs of populations affected by natural disasters such as     floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, and earthquakes.    Assisting families,     low-income populations, the elderly, the disabled, and veterans.  Accurate     census data are necessary for appropriate state implementation of Federal     programs for these groups in areas such as housing assistance, energy cost     assistance, community development, and employment and social services. Accurate     census data also help city and community officials pinpoint areas that need     special programs such as meals-on-wheels and social service agencies identify     special needs such as telephone access in case of medical emergency.               BUSINESS USES    Product development and marketing.      Accurate census data on where people of different ages live helps businesses of     all kinds to develop and market their products. For example:                      Manufacturers of baby products such as baby food, clothes,       diapers, and toys, and manufacturers of maternity clothes and greeting cards       need accurate information on children as they develop and market their product       lines, as do television producers of children’s programs and planners of       large family amusement parks.               Architects, contractors, and real estate firms need accurate       information on the size and composition of households and their housing as they       design, build, and sell houses and apartments.               Producers of consumer durables such as television sets, washing       machines, and home furnishings benefit from accurate information on households       and their characteristics.               Accurate census information on language spoken at home helps       television and radio stations define foreign language service areas and       marketing companies develop products and services tailored to those who speak       languages other than English.               Forecasting demand.  Businesses forecasting demand for their     products require accurate census data to develop these forecasts. Utilities     depend on accurate census data to develop long-range plans for new facilities     and networks.        Location decisions.  A variety of business location decisions     are improved by accurate census data. Examples include: businesses seeking to     pinpoint areas to gauge potential markets for locating new stores, plants, or     warehouses; businesses interested in finding sites having a labor force with     certain education characteristics; building developers and contractors     selecting sites for new housing developments; and businesses seeking to     pinpoint areas of a city for locating new restaurants specializing in     particular types of ethnic food.        Providing equal opportunities and achieving compliance with     Federal law.          Accurate census data help businesses set up and monitor affirmative     action and anti-discrimination plans. And they help companies to comply with     anti-discrimination legislation such as the Equal Employment Opportunities     Act.        Examples of Business Use of Census Data.  Newspaper accounts     and census questionnaires provide examples of businesses that use census data.       Numerous small businesses responded to a request for examples of     business uses of census data, but so too did some large companies. For example,     one large fast-food chain reported that for the past 20 years they had relied     on decennial censuses to perform market analysis and determine site locations     for new restaurants. The company also has used the Census Bureau’s TIGER     Line files (a digital map database) to merge their own proprietary information     with the detailed social and economic data from the decennial census for small     geographic areas for use in its corporate planning.        Around the time of the last census, a prominent newspaper ran a lead     article in its Business section entitled, ""For Business, Census is a Marketing     Data Motherlode."" The article noted how retailers, such as one large general     merchandise company, use the census to fine-tune neighborhood promotions; how a     large grocery chain used it to study potential sites for new stores; and how     one consumer products firm used it to estimate sales of diapers a decade out.     The article also described how banks use census data to provide a basic     demographic sketch of the neighborhoods around each of their branches.        Examples of uses of census data culled from a sample of monthly     activity reports from the Census Bureau’s Regional Office Information     Services Program include the following:                      An independent television station in Philadelphia that is using       ZIP code level data for a viewer profile to design program and advertising       strategies.               A foreign language newspaper distributor seeking increased       circulation in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut used census data to list       languages spoken at home in each county of the three states.               A major advertising firm used census data on languages spoken at       home in the Chicago area to develop a new advertising campaign for a       client.               A district sales office for an automobile manufacturer is using       ZIP Code and city profiles for a market analysis that will be used to help       local dealerships develop sales campaigns.               A real estate company in Colorado is using census data to       determine which languages to use on a series of instructional tapes on buying       and selling real estate.                      COMMUNITY GROUP USES         Delivering health, social, and educational services.  In many     cases, private social service agencies and community groups have the same needs     for accurate census data as state and local government agencies that provide     social services. Private groups benefit from accurate census data to set up and     administer assistance programs for children, teens, and older persons; to     provide services that reflect cultural differences; to teach English, and     conduct voter registration drives; to provide housing and job training for     displaced homemakers; to provide veteran support services and promote the need     for veteran services and facilities.        Disaster relief.  As with social services, non-governmental     organizations benefit from accurate census information in much the same way as     governments when planning for and responding to disasters like hurricanes,     tornadoes, floods, and earthquakes.               INDIVIDUAL USES        Location decisions.  Individuals can make better choices about     home-buying, job relocation, or starting a small business if they can take     advantage of accurate census information.               ACADEMIC RESEARCH USES         Accurate census data are vital to researchers in a wide variety of     endeavors. Some of the most important needs include the following:                      Any research requiring comprehensive information at the       neighborhood level must rely on the census, with its tract level       information.              Research on ethnicity or other research requiring reasonable       numbers of observations of relatively small population groups must rely on the       census.              The decennial census is the only consistent source of data for       researchers examining trends over periods of decades.              The census is the best source of information for research on       immigration and mobility.                      USES BY OTHER SURVEYS AND DATA COLLECTION        Serving as an important base for other surveys.  Data from the     decennial Census form a crucial input into the sample designs of other national     surveys such as the Current Population Survey (the source of the nation’s     unemployment statistics), the Survey of Income and Program Participation, the     National Crime Victimization Survey, the Survey of Recent College Graduates,     the Consumer Expenditure Survey (the source for expenditure weights used in     calculating the Consumer Price Index), and statistics complied by the National     Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) and the National Center for Health     Statistics (NCHS).        Calculating rates.  Data from other sources are combined with     data from the Census to compute rates of various indicators. For example, NCHS     uses its own survey data combined with Census data to calculate numerous vital     statistics and rates for health service utilization. Similarly, the Bureau of     Justice Statistics uses Census data to calculate imprisonment and victimization     rates, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation uses Census data to calculate     crime rates.        Creating national estimates.  Census data are used to adjust     surveys to be nationally representative. For example, the NCES uses Census data     to make its survey results on education indicators reflect the total United     States population.        Case Study: The Current Population Survey.  Information on the     labor force, employment, and unemployment is derived from the monthly Current     Population Survey (CPS). The March supplement to the CPS provides information     for calculating the poverty rate and measures of household and family income.     The accuracy of the CPS depends critically on the accuracy of census     information, because all of the population “controls” for a decade     are derived from the previous decennial census. These population controls are     then updated monthly using estimates of births, deaths, and migration. The BLS     has incorporated information about the undercount in the 1990 census into the     CPS.        BLS Commissioner Abraham has advised Census Director Prewitt that if     the BLS had not incorporated the undercount, and, instead, used the official     1990 census population estimates used for apportionment, its estimate of the     working age population would have been too low by 2.1 million. Labor force     information for persons of Hispanic origin and blacks would have been affected     disproportionately because these groups make up three-fourths of persons not     counted in the official statistics. Without information on the undercount, BLS     says its estimates of the overall level of employment and unemployment would     have been too low, and the geographic and demographic distribution of     unemployment (and other measures) shown in their data would have been     inaccurate. Moreover these errors would have persisted for (at least) the next     10 years.         Unemployment statistics from the CPS are included in the allocation     formulas used to distribute funds in many Federal programs. Use of inaccurate     population estimates could cause a shift of several percent in a state’s     allocation. Many Federal programs are tied to the poverty rate, which could     also be affected by inaccurate population counts. This and other information     derived from the CPS affects evaluations of such initiatives as welfare reform,     health insurance legislation, and minimum wage legislation.

GX015-46-5419761	"Legal Authority for American Community Survey, B-289852, April 4, 2002              B-289852            April 4, 2002     The Honorable Bob Barr  Vice Chairman  Committee on Government Reform  House of Representatives      Subject:   Legal Authority for American Community Survey      Dear Mr. Vice Chairman:     This responds to your letter regarding the legal authority of the U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) to conduct the American Community Survey (ACS), a monthly survey of a sample of households that, beginning in 2003, is intended to replace the long form questionnaire for the decennial census in 2010.  You asked us to provide (1) the legal authority under which the Bureau is conducting the ACS, including any legislative history concerning the development and implementation of ACS, (2) the Bureau's legal authority to require recipients to respond to the ACS, and (3) information on any other federal government questionnaires or surveys that require similar specific, detailed personal information be provided to the government.     In order to respond to your questions, we examined various legislative materials such as public laws, committee reports and hearings, and the Congressional Record for references to the ACS, requested and received comments from the Department of Commerce (Commerce), and met informally with Commerce and Bureau officials to discuss these issues.  We also searched an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) database for surveys that require specific detailed personal information.  As discussed in detail below, we find that the Bureau has the authority under 13 U.S.C. §§ 141 and 193 to conduct the ACS.  Although there is little legislative action tracking this Bureau initiative, the Bureau clearly has authority to require responses from the public to this survey.  See 13 U.S.C. § 221.  The Bureau must still receive clearance for the ACS through the Paperwork Reduction Act process.  Finally, we found no other government surveys that respondents are required to respond to that ask specific, detailed personal information similar to that required by the ACS.       BACKGROUND     According to Commerce, the ACS, which is designed to replace the long form portion for future decennial censuses, tracks the questions asked in the long form questionnaire from the 2000 Census.  The long form questionnaire asked a sample of persons and households for information on population topics, such as ancestry, veteran status, disability, labor force status, and income, and housing topics, such as value of home or rent paid, size and age of structure, plumbing and kitchen facilities, and expenses for utilities, mortgage, and taxes.      The Bureau began conducting supplementary surveys of selected counties under its authority at 13 U.S.C. § 182 in 1996 using the ACS methodology to test the operational feasibility of collecting long form type data in a different methodology from that of the decennial census.  Beginning in 2003, the Bureau plans to expand the ACS nationwide in a yearly sample of three million households (250,000 each month) as part of its decennial census in order to move from a once-every-ten years activity to continuous data collection and data dissemination.  By starting in 2003, data will be available for areas and population groups of 65,000 or more beginning in 2004 and for small areas and population groups of less than 20,000 people beginning in 2008. [1]   According to Bureau officials, this will provide information on a timelier basis than is now currently available.  For example, the most current long form information available from the Bureau is from the 1990 Census, since the 2000 Census data will not be available until this summer.     According to Commerce, the ACS information will provide more current data to a number of federal agencies including the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Education, and the Food and Nutrition Service of the Department of Agriculture.      DISCUSSION     Article I of the United States Constitution requires an enumeration of the population every ten years ""in such Manner as they [Congress] shall by Law direct.""  U.S. Const. art. I, § 2, cl. 3.  To implement this Constitutional requirement, Congress enacted 13 U.S.C. § 141, which requires ""a decennial census of population as of the first day of April of such year . . . in such form and content as he [the Secretary of Commerce] may determine . . . .  In connection with any such census, the Secretary is authorized to obtain such other census information as necessary.""  Section 141 also authorizes the decennial census to include the use of sampling procedures and special surveys. [2]   The uses of census data have grown significantly beyond congressional apportionment of representatives in Congress into many other areas such as managing federal agencies, allocating federal aid and assistance, assisting local governments, and helping businesses. [3]   The courts have generally viewed the authority of Commerce and the Bureau to gather census information broadly. [4]    In a recent court decision,  Morales v. Evans , [5]  the court held that the questions and the long form from the 2000 census are constitutional.     In  Morales , the court first reviewed both the short form and the long form questions from the 2000 Census and traced the origin of each question from prior censuses.  The court noted the authority of the Bureau to collect more than headcount information, and then specifically addressed whether such collection violated the plaintiffs rights under the Fifth Amendment (due process), First Amendment (protection against compelled speech), and Fourth Amendment (unreasonable and illegal search).  In each instance the court found the collection of information related to governmental purposes and there was no basis for holding such collection unconstitutional.     While Census clearly has authority to conduct the ACS, we found no public laws, committee reports, or other congressional actions in which Congress has required the Bureau to develop and implement the ACS.  Two oversight hearings were held in 2000 and 2001 concerning the ACS, [6]  and Congress has provided funding over the past several years for this program under the caption of ""continuous measurement."" [7]   Commerce states that testing of the ACS has been part of the President's budget since 1996 and a pilot program has been funded since that time.  Commerce also points out that it has regularly kept Congress informed of the development and intended implementation of the ACS in the annual budget justification that accompanies the President's budget.  It is clear that Census was not reacting to congressional direction in developing the ACS but acting on its own initiative to address the costs associated with the collection of data in the decennial census and the timeliness of that data.      On the basis of the statutory authority cited above and the discretion recognized by the courts, we conclude that Commerce and the Bureau have the legal authority to conduct the ACS under 13 U.S.C. §§ 141 and 193.  This finding does not address the question of whether the data should be collected, but only whether there is sufficient legal authority to conduct this annual survey. [8]       With regard to the question of whether the Bureau may require recipients to respond to the ACS, Bureau officials stated that the ACS is conducted under sections 141 and 193, cited above, and that because responses to Census Bureau censuses and surveys are required under 13 U.S.C. § 221, responses to the ACS are mandatory.  Section 221 subjects recipients of a survey to monetary penalties for failure to answer questions on any survey conducted by the Bureau under certain authorities found in Chapter 5 of Title 13 of the United States Code.  These authorities include censuses of manufacturers and other businesses under section 131, the decennial census of population under section 141, and interim current data for collection of population data between each census under section 181.  Section 225 permits application of penal provisions in certain cases.  For example, the provision for imprisonment does not apply to the interim current data surveys under section 181, although it does apply to the decennial census.  13 U.S.C. § 225(b).  We note that the courts have held that there is a sufficient governmental interest to require the collection of census data and to assess penalties for the failure to comply. [9]   We conclude therefore that the Bureau may require responses to the ACS survey.  With regard to providing statutory references for each question on the survey which is ""required by federal law to manage or evaluate government programs,"" Commerce noted that each federal agency submits to the Interagency Committee for the ACS, led by OMB, its legal justifications for agency-specific topics and questions, and the questionnaire content is reviewed by the Interagency Committee.  Commerce has provided an extensive table of statutory authorities to justify each question, but the response from Commerce notes that additional information may be added or corrected by the agencies as Commerce prepares its submission of the ACS questionnaire under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) clearance process. [10]   Since this process for development of the ACS questionnaire is still underway, we cannot state as a matter of law whether the requisite statutory authority supports each question.  However, Commerce and the Bureau will be required under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. §§ 3506 and 3507 to demonstrate that this collection of information is necessary, is not duplicative, and is understandable to those who are to respond.     Finally, to determine what other federal government surveys require specific, detailed personal information, we used information provided by federal agencies on Form 83-I, the Paperwork Reduction Act submission to OMB. [11]   Agencies requesting clearance to collect information are required to report on this form the various characteristics of the collection including the following:  who the collection affects-e.g., individuals or households, businesses, or the federal government; whether responses to the collection are voluntary, required to obtain or retain benefits, or mandatory; and the purpose of the collection--e.g., program evaluation, general purpose statistics, regulatory, or compliance.     Using information provided by OMB, we found no other government surveys that respondents are required to fill out that request specific, detailed personal information similar to that required by the ACS.  The only information collections that met the conditions of being required or mandatory and affecting individuals or households for statistical or research purposes were those related to the 2000 decennial censuses, including the ACS.      CONCLUSION     For the reasons set forth above, the Bureau has authority under 13 U.S.C. §§ 141 and 193 to conduct the American Community Survey.  The Bureau also has authority to require responses from the public to this survey.       We trust that this responds to your request.  Should you have any questions, please contact Ms. Susan A. Poling at (202) 512-2667.  We are sending an identical letter to The Honorable Dan Burton Chairman, Committee on Government Reform.     Sincerely yours,  Anthony H.

GX024-95-2350898	"PREPARED STATEMENT OF        WILLIAM G. BARRON, Jr.        ACTING DIRECTOR, U.S. BUREAU OF THE CENSUS        Before the Subcommittee on the Census        Committee on Government Reform        U.S. House of Representatives        June 13, 2001          Mr. Chairman, Mr. Clay, and Members of the Subcommittee:      It is a pleasure to appear before you again and to testify at this second hearing on the American Community Survey.  The Subcommittee's leadership, Mr. Chairman, in providing a public forum for discussing the ACS is greatly appreciated.         The American Community Survey is Part of the Strategy for a Re-engineered 2010 Census      The ACS is one of three key components of our strategy for re-engineering the 2010 Census.  As Secretary Evans testified in a Senate hearing on March 28: ""While Census 2000 was an operational success and produced data of high quality, the process was costly, many people felt burdened by having to answer the long form questions, and the census was constantly at risk due to insufficient early planning and development, and disagreement on the design.""  If the Census Bureau has adequate resources early to build upon the successes of Census 2000 and to take advantage of lessons learned from Census 2000, then we can reduce operational risks for the 2010 Census, explore ways to further reduce the undercount and improve accuracy, provide more relevant and timely data throughout the decade, and contain costs.      While our strategic plan for the 2010 Census is still under development, we have identified what we believe are the three main components:  1) improving the accuracy of our geographic database and Master Address File, 2) eliminating the long form from the 2010 Census by collecting those data in the American Community Survey, and 3) re-engineering the census process through early planning.      We are planning improved geographic systems to ensure that there is a complete and unduplicated address list, that will facilitate automation and electronic data collection, and that will also provide the potential for significant efficiencies.  We plan to investigate the use of Global Positioning System technology and satellite mapping imagery to link addresses to physical locations, which will allow accurate updating and improvement of Census 2000 maps and address information.      The ACS will simplify the 2010 Census requirements and allow the Census Bureau to focus exclusively on the basic count of the population.  It will provide more current and more frequent detailed data for businesses and local, state, and federal policymakers for small geographic areas and allow the federal statistical system to keep pace with ever increasing demands for timely and relevant data.  Data users now must still use 1990 long form data, data that will be 12 years old next year, when we begin the release of Census 2000 long form data.  The ACS will allow federal policymakers, businesses, and state, local and tribal governments to make decisions using more current data and will improve the distribution of federal funds.       Early 2010 planning and development are necessary for a re-engineered process for the 2010 Census that takes advantage of the potential opportunities provided by having improved geographic systems and the ACS.      Mr. Chairman, in your opening remarks at last July's hearing on the ACS you said: ""Today we are here to begin the process of eliminating the problematic census long form."" The process of eliminating the census long form is well underway.  That is why the ACS is one of the three key components of the plan for re-engineering the 2010 Census.  It will allow us to eliminate the long form from the 2010 Census and collect data on congressionally mandated topics in an annual sample survey.        Census 2000 required the processing of more than 1.5 billion pieces of paper.  About 60 percent of  this paper was associated with the long form.  It took a lot of talent, time, money, and effort to process that much paper.  Implementing the vision, Mr. Chairman, of simplifying the decennial census by eliminating the long form will introduce opportunities for cost savings and improved coverage, and greatly enhance the Census Bureau's ability to streamline and modernize the census-taking process.      Replacing the long form with the American Community Survey will permit the Census Bureau to focus exclusively on conducting the basic count in 2010.  It will allow us to streamline data capture, accommodate more multiple language response, increase mail response, and lower field costs.  It will lead to better coverage of addresses in the census because it will require a continuously updated address list.  Ongoing interaction with local officials will allow us to avoid the just-in-time address updating operations for the 2000 Census.  The ACS will also provide current data to permit the Census Bureau to more effectively target areas where special procedures will be required in 2010.  We are also looking at ways to use the highly trained ACS field staff as a cadre of key supervisory staff for the 2010 Census.  Because they will have been collecting ACS data successfully in hard-to-enumerate areas, they will have developed relationships with local leaders that will prove invaluable in more completely enumerating the population in the 2010 Census.      Mr. Chairman, you asked that I address the issue of costs.  The Census Bureau recognizes that there are substantial up-front costs in the early years of the decade for this strategy.  For example, our preliminary estimate of the cost of the ACS for FY 2003, the first year of collecting data in every part of the country, is $131 million, subject, of course, to the regular budget process.  As I stated in my letter to you, Mr. Chairman, of April 19, 2001, there will be only 9 months of nonresponse followup field work in the first year, which lowers the cost somewhat compared with all future years. Our initial estimates of life-cycle costs will demonstrate cost neutrality when we compare the estimated cost of repeating Census 2000 to the estimated cost of a re-engineered 2010 Census, which includes the ACS, geographic system modernization, and early planning.  To achieve cost neutrality, and even have some potential for cost savings, while also providing so much more data throughout the decade, is a notable achievement.      A Balanced Design for the American Community Survey      Now, Mr. Chairman, I will turn to the ACS, and first describe how we worked with the statistical system and data users to balance issues related to cost, feasibility, data quality, and respondent burden in designing the program.  The ACS is not designed to provide a headcount.  That is what the decennial census is for.  The Census Bureau has a population estimates program to provide updated population totals for years following the most recent census.  The ACS will serve a similar role in providing updated population and housing characteristics.       Our goal in designing the ACS was to produce data comparable in quality to the decennial census long form for the smallest areas such as census tracts.  One decision was how many years should go into the moving averages that will replace the long form estimates.  We decided on a 5-year average for the ACS that will give more timely data throughout the entire decade, and will give much better information about change over time than a once-a-decade measurement.       Another decision was to determine how much sample was needed each year so that the 5-year averages would have a sample size to provide data of sufficient quality.  We chose a sample size of 3 million because that will meet our goal of producing data based on 5-year averages that are comparable to census long form data for the smallest areas such as census tracts.  These data will be available in 2008, 4 years earlier than from a 2010 long form, and they will be updated annually thereafter.  Moreover, the first data for communities of 65,000 people or more will be available in 2004, about 6 months after the 2003 data collection year ends, and every year thereafter.  The first data for communities with between 20,000 and 65,000 people will be available in 2006, and also updated annually after they are first available.        The Census Bureau will mail questionnaires to each address in the sample and will use purchased lists of telephone numbers to interview households that do not mail back their form.  We will select a one-in-three sample of the addresses not interviewed by mail or telephone and conduct personal visit interviews.  Since personal visit interviews are very expensive, this sub-sampling will reduce costs while providing the desired level of accuracy.  The quality of data is improved by using well-trained, permanent interviewers with computers to complete interviews.    Computer-assisted interviewing by telephone or in person allows the Census Bureau to incorporate consistency checks of the data into the collection process.  Data quality is further improved by the use of a permanent staff to code write-in entries for processing.      The American Community Survey will be based on making the most efficient use of existing systems and infrastructure. It will not require additional offices, but will be run out of our current regional offices.  Field interviewers, who work on other surveys in addition to the ACS, will use existing laptop computers, and laptops from Census 2000 can be used as replacements, to the extent possible.  As I noted in my letter of April 19, for FY 2003 the ACS will require about 1,230 full-time staff and 3,800 part-time staff.   We will not require special data capture centers, as that will be accomplished in our processing center in Jeffersonville, Indiana.   The Census Bureau is working to provide electronic versions of maps that will reside on the interviewers' laptops; this will reduce the massive requirements for paper copies of maps we encountered in the decennial census.  We do not anticipate, at this time, any advertising expenditures for the ACS because its small monthly sample size would make it inefficient to use mass marketing methods such as we needed for the decennial census.  We do expect to use community partnerships, which we have found to be very effective in the early test sites.        Mr. Chairman, you also asked whether the ACS would replace or incorporate any additional Census Bureau surveys.  While there are no current plans to replace any existing surveys, the ACS can help make the entire federal statistical system more efficient in a number of ways by improving existing programs.  They include the Current Population Survey, the National Crime Victimization Survey, and the Consumer Expenditure Survey.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics will use ACS data as part of its Local Area Unemployment Statistics program to make improved monthly estimates of unemployment. And the Census Bureau will use the ACS data, along with the Current Population Survey data and administrative records, to improve poverty estimates for school districts.         Data for Small Areas      The fact that the ACS sample size and design will not provide data for the smallest areas until 2008 has led some to raise the concern that the ACS may be treating rural areas and urban census tracts unfairly.  The Census Bureau takes this concern very seriously.  Indeed, we wish it were possible to begin providing small areas with high quality, current data right away.  But that would basically require replicating the decennial long form every year, and that is not acceptable in terms of costs or burden on respondents.  Once again, we are faced with balancing competing demands.      But the Census Bureau takes even the perception that small areas are being treated unfairly very seriously and has worked with data experts to allay those concerns.  For example, the Census Bureau contracted with WESTAT to bring together rural experts and get their suggestions for improving the ACS from the perspective of rural areas.  The group of a dozen experts, who met in May 1998, expressed strong support for the ACS and we are pursuing their suggestions for further research and changes that might make the ACS even more valuable to rural areas.      At last year's hearing, you heard from Congresswoman Jo Ann Emerson; Ms. Barbara Welty, representing the National Association of Towns and Townships; and Mr. Chuck Fluharty, Director of the Rural Policy Research Institute, on this issue and about the importance of having current data to support rural policy initiatives.  If I may quote from Mr. Fluharty's statement last year:       ""While some statistical limitations for rural areas within the American Community Survey may exist, the more timely, cost-effective multi-year estimates produced by ACS are far superior to existing data produced by the decennial Census.""      And this is the key point--even the smallest areas will have data 4 years earlier than they would if we had no ACS and included a long form in the 2010 Census.        So while concerns have been raised about data for small areas, the Census Bureau is confident that the current ACS design yields a major improvement over the existing situation.  We need to understand that the glass is more than half full and to fill it all the way would require unacceptable trade-offs in terms of costs and respondent burden.        Data for Small Population Groups      We have designed the American Community Survey to provide the same quality data as Census 2000 for all groups, regardless of size, and we plan to monitor the survey to ensure that this is the case.  As noted earlier, the ACS does not count the population; it estimates their characteristics.  To get accurate measurements, we need high response rates from all groups.      We have devoted considerable time to discussing the question of data for small population groups with our Race and Ethnic Advisory Committees.  We are evaluating their suggestions, together with our experiences collecting data from these groups in Census 2000.      Working closely with them, we will focus on techniques and strategies to ensure that small population groups participate in the survey.  We are exploring using language assistance guides similar to those used in Census 2000; revising the mailing package to elicit a better mail response rate; and placing public service announcements in newspapers and electronic media serving minority populations.        The permanent staff of field representatives will establish ongoing relationships with the communities they are working in, thereby enhancing trust and willingness to participate.      Timely and Relevant Data to Manage Federal and Local Programs      We believe that the American Community Survey is the cornerstone of the government's effort to keep pace with the country's ever-increasing demands for timely and relevant household data.  If we are to continue leadership in providing information to the knowledge society, we must invest in full development of the ACS.  In our web-based society of the 21 st  century, it is no longer acceptable that planners and policy-makers must use data that are up to 12 years out of date.      Eliminating the long form from the once-a-decade census will give us an incredible head-start toward having a successful 2010 Census at a reasonable cost.  Over the years, the long form included in the decennial census has met the Nation's need for detailed data essential for governing, by providing reliable, consistent data for small geographic areas once a decade.  To eliminate the long form without an alternative method of collecting detailed population and housing characteristics would leave the Nation with a knowledge void at a time when timely and accurate information is required to design and manage federal programs and distribute federal funds fairly.      Without an appropriate alternative to the decennial census long form--the ACS--Congress would not have the data to run the programs it has written into law.  It would not have a rudder to guide the ship of state.      The ACS will provide timely data to help the Congress, federal program managers, and the ""end users"" in every community in America.  It recognizes the continuing roles of the Congress and federal agencies, while also elevating the importance of partnerships with other levels of government and those directly affected by the decisions based on data.  Data collected by the ACS will help Congress evaluate and modify federal programs and will provide up-to-date information for congressional districts and states, as well as smaller areas, enabling services to be targeted to maximize the impact of available resources  at all levels of government.  The ACS will provide a critical new source of data that will allow the Congress to evaluate programs below the state level and determine accountability.  When fully implemented, it will collect data in every county, American Indian reservation, Alaskan Native area, and Hawaiian homeland, as well as Puerto Rico. Because data from the ACS will be available every year, Congress can determine change over time and measure the results of federal programs.  It means greatly improved annual estimates of population and housing characteristics and how they change over time.  The up-to-date estimates from the ACS will benefit, for example, welfare reform, funding for educationally disadvantaged children, and programs for the elderly.      The welfare reform legislation provides performance bonuses to states.  In some cases, no data are currently available to measure the results of state programs.  The ACS will collect the information about income and family structure that is needed to measure poverty and eligibility for benefits, as well as age, marital status, the presence of children, and educational attainment and school enrollment.  In addition, it will shed light on the results of state and local welfare-to-work initiatives.      The American Community Survey dramatically improves poverty estimates for groups such as children and the elderly, and provides current information on changes in family structure.   The Department of Education currently uses the estimates of poverty for children from the Census Bureau's Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates program in allocating annually over           $8 billion in Title I funds to school districts. The ACS will dramatically improve these estimates for school districts.  The ""Leave No Child Behind Act of 2001,"" currently under consideration in the Congress, specifically mentions the ACS as the source of data on the number of children with limited English proficiency--data to be used in administering grants to the States.      The ACS provides information about all age groups, including the current elderly population and the characteristics of people nearing retirement age.  This information is essential for projections about the needs and resources of people who are eligible to enter the retirement system and can help target screening programs for particular health conditions.      While I have focused on federal uses of the data today, the American Community Survey is providing current data from 21 of its 31 test sites to address real-life issues in rural and urban communities, and I think it's important to mention just a few illustrations of local uses.         A sparsely populated, rural county--Fulton County, Pennsylvania--is using the ACS data to develop an employment and training services system, a rural transportation system, and a ""Help Line"" for families to address health care and child care needs.          Bronx County, New York, will use ACS data to identify and develop intervention strategies for juvenile diabetes in special populations.        In Springfield, Massachusetts, community leaders and public safety officials are using ACS data to develop a youth violence prevention program for teens.        These are just a few examples of how having up-to-date information, instead of information that is 12 years old, will allow communities to provide services more efficiently.  ACS data are also being used to help localities meet federal program requirements.        Multnomah County, Oregon, will use ACS data as a source for enrollment forecasts that are used to justify support under various school programs.  In addition, Multnomah County used 1996 ACS data for a study of students who were in poverty, a critical input to several federal programs. And ACS data on the number and demographic characteristics of children and families receiving services are being used by the county to develop Head Start Community Assessment reports.       Next month, the we plan to issue additional data from the 21 test sites and national and state-level data from the nationwide operational test that collected data from a national sample of about 700,000 households.  We conducted this test--the Census 2000 Supplementary Survey--to ensure that the ACS can be conducted separately from, but during the same period as, a once-a-decade census.      Developing American Community Survey Content      In conjunction with the Office of Management and Budget, we have established a jointly chaired Interagency Committee charged with balancing respondent burden with the legitimate information needs of the Congress and the federal government.  The Interagency Committee is working on reviewing the content of the ACS in a process similar to what we've done for the decennial census long form.  OMB has asked relevant federal departments and agencies to document legal requirements for data, the level of geography needed, and for what population groups.  This information is expected to be complete by the end of August.        For 2003, we anticipate the questionnaire will be similar to the current ACS questionnaire.  Since the survey is designed to produce 5-year estimates, we believe the content should remain reasonably consistent over time.  We would plan to submit to the Congress in 2006 the revised content of the 2008 questionnaires, following the decennial model.  In the interim, and through the Interagency Committee, all questions will be reviewed, those no longer required will be dropped, others can be re-worded and tested, and congressionally mandated topics can be added.      There was considerable discussion of the long form last year as an ""invasion of privacy.""  This was partly because the long form was administered to about 20 million housing units all at one time.  The American Community Survey provides a different atmosphere and will reduce public concern about intrusiveness.        Instead of about 20 million housing units receiving the census long form all at one time, in each monthly survey, only 250,000 housing units will receive the ACS questionnaire at any one time.  This is 1 in every 480 households in any given month.  In any given year, only 1 in 40 households, or about 2.5 percent of the total, will receive the ACS questionnaire.        Instead of having a large army of temporary enumerators, the ACS field interviewers will be highly trained permanent staff who will be better prepared to deal with the public's questions about the form.  Our experience thus far with the ACS has been that our trained interviewers have achieved good cooperation with few complaints from the public.  They can explain that the confidentiality of the data is strongly protected, they are used only for statistical purposes--not for regulation or law enforcement--and each questionnaire item is linked to a federal program.       Having said that, the Census Bureau takes questions and concerns about intrusiveness and privacy seriously.  We are aware of the time pressures confronting people and of the concerns we all have about privacy and confidentiality.  We also recognize and respect those who have philosophical objections to government activities, government programs, and government data collection.  In fact, the Census Bureau has a 60-year history--going back to the 1940 census--of working to reduce the number of questions and the number of households that would have to answer the longer set of questions.  Before 1940, everyone was asked the ""long form"" questions; that year, some of the questions were asked of only one-in-four people.  For the 1960 Census,  the percentage of households that received the long form was still one-in-four, but this was reduced to one-in-six by the 1980 Census.  And in Census 2000, the short form was reduced to seven items--the shortest in 180 years.  Weighed against the ever increasing demands for new questions, including requests from the Congress, this is evidence of the Census Bureau's sensitivity to this issue.      Conclusion      In summary, Mr. Chairman, as part of the strategy to re-engineer the 2010 Census, the American Community Survey will improve the way we take the census by eliminating the long form, simplifying the 2010 Census requirements, and allowing the Census Bureau to focus exclusively on the basic count.  It will provide more frequent detailed data for all geographic areas regardless of size, so that the Congress and federal agencies will have up-to-date information to administer and evaluate programs.  And it will contribute to a more efficient statistical system and allow us to keep pace with ever increasing demands for timely and relevant data.      That concludes my testimony and I will now be happy to answer any questions."

HOT TIP  Can I find out from the Census Bureau how much of a particular product is sold by a particular kind of business establishment? For example, how much of the total sales of tobacco products is done by gas stations? Can I get this info for my state?  Yes, yes! The Census Bureau releases this information in our Merchandise Line Sales, one of the data series from the 1997 Economic Census. In January, we released the national report for retail trade (see RECENTLY RELEASED) and next month we'll release national, state, and metro data on CD-ROM along with a host of other substate data (see UPCOMING RELEASES). Incidentally, gas stations (including those with convenience stores) accounted for 37 percent of tobacco sales; supermarkets and grocery stores accounted for 24 percent; vending machines, less than 1 percent. Total tobacco sales? you ask. Approximately $37 billion in 1997.   BOOKMARK THIS!  Key Economic Indicators.

GX026-93-3565540	"Scientific Data Documentation       Master Area Reference File 2 (1980)       *SEE AREA REFERENCE FILE 2 DATASET NAMES FOR DSNs.   ABSTRACT    Summary   The Master Area Reference File (MARF) is the 1980 census counterpart of the  Master Enumeration District List (MEDList) prepared for the 1970 census.  It  links State or State equivalent, county or county equivalent, minor civil  division (MCD)/census county division (CCD), and place names with their  respective geographic codes.  It is also an abbreviated summary file  containing selected population and housing unit counts.   The second version of MARF (MARF 2) has the same geographic coverage as the  first MARF and includes the following additional information:  FIPS place  codes, latitude, and longitude coordinates for geographic areas down to the  BG/ED level, land area in square miles for geographic areas down to the  level of places or minor civil divisions (11 selected States) with a  population of 2,500 or more, total population and housing count estimates  based on sample returns, and per capita income for all geographic areas  included in the file.   Like the first version of MARF, MARF 2 will be available on a State-by-State  basis.   MARF 2 contains numeric codes and names for census geographic areas plus  100-percent and sample data for selected population and housing items.  The  file provides 100-percent counts for the total population, 5 race groups  (White, Black, American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut, Asian and Pacific Islander, Other  races), persons of Spanish origin, families, persons in group quarters, one-  person households, and total, occupied, and owner-occupied housing units.  In addition, total population and housing unit estimates and per capita  income based on 1980 census sample returns are included.  Latitude and  longitude coordinates are given for the approximate population centroid of  each geographic area down to the level of block group (BG) and enumeration  district (ED).  Land area in square miles is provided for geographic areas  down to the level of places and minor civil divisions (MCDs) (in 11 selected  States) with a population of 2,500 or more.

These maps are referred to as the Metropolitan Map     Series (MMS) when the maps cover standard metropolitan statistical areas     (SMSA's) and as the Vicinity Map Series (VMS) when the maps cover areas     not in an SMSA.  For a more detailed discussion of the MMS/VMS, see the     section in the technical documentation entitled ""1980 Census Maps.""      County Maps.  The maps cover all counties and county equivalents except     where the Metropolitan Map Series/Vicinity Map Series (MMS/VMS) sheets     cover an entire county.  Most county maps are based on maps supplied by     State transportation or highway departments on which the Bureau has     superimposed boundaries and identifiers for most areas for which data     are tabulated.  Insets to county maps are provided for some counties     that contain American Indian reservations.  For a more detailed     discussion on county maps, see the section in the technical     documentatio entitled ""1980 Census Maps.""      Place Maps.  Place maps are used for places not shown on MMS/VMS, and     show map features within the corporate limits of a municipality or     within boundaries established for a census designated place (CDP).  If     census boundaries and identifiers for an area adjacent to a place are     shown, the map is referred to as a place-and-vicinity map.

This file set includes data     shown in the sample tables of the PHC80-3 reports.  Files A and C     provide data for the same areas as files A and C of STF 1, excluding     blocks.  STF files 3A and 3C have been released.  These files are also     available on microfiche.  File 3B, a special tabulation contracted for     by a private organization, provides summaries for each 5-digit ZIP code     area within States, standard metropolitan statistical areas (SMSA's),     and counties.  STF files 3D, 3F, and 3G provide data for the same     geographic areas as the corresponding STF 1 files.  Most State STF 3D     files are available.  STF 3F and STF 3G files are being released on a     State-by-State basis.      STF 4 (Files A, B, and C) is the geographic counterpart of STF 2 and     contains approximately 8,500 cells of population and housing data, of     which approximately 3,500 are repeated for up to 39 race, Spanish     origin, and ancestry groups present in the tabulation area.  Data are     summarized for areas similar to those shown for STF 2, except that data     for places are limited to those with 2,500 or more inhabitants.  This     file set includes data shown in the PHC80-2, PHC80-1C, and HC80-1-B     reports.  STF 4A and B files are being released on a State-by-State     basis.      STF 5 (Files A and C) contains over 100,000 cells of population and     housing data estimated from the sample and provides highly detailed     tabulations for States, standard metropolitan statistical areas     (SMSA's), and counties and places of 50,000 or more inhabitants.  Most     subjects are cross-classified by five race and Spanish origin groups.     This file set includes data shown in the PC80-1-D and HC80-2 reports.     STF 5 is scheduled to be available in late 1983.      Census of Population and Housing, 1980:  Geographic Identification Code     Scheme.  The file lists names and numeric codes for States, counties,     county subdivisions (MCD's/CCD's), and places for which 1980 census data     were tabulated.  It includes much of the information from the PHC80-R5     Geographic Identification Code Scheme report.      Census of Population and Housing, 1980:  Equal Employment Opportunity     (EEO) Special File.  The file contains two tables.  Table 1 provides     detailed occupation (514 categories) by sex.  Table 2 contains years of     school completed by age and sex.  The data in both tables are     cross-classification by sex and Hispanic origin or race for     non-Hispanics.  These data are provided for States, the District of     Columbia, standard metropolitan statistical areas (SMSA's), counties,     and places with a population of 50,000 or more.      Census of Population and Housing, 1980:  Public-Use Microdata Samples.     Public-use microdata samples are computerized files containing records     for a sample of housing units, with information on the characteristics     of each unit and the persons in it.  These files do not contain names or     addresses, and geographic identification is sufficiently broad to     protect confidentiality.  There are three mutually exclusive samples     (each released by State, groups of States, or for the U.S.):  the A     sample including 5 percent, and the B and C samples each including 1     percent of all persons and housing units.  Three 1-in-1,000 samples were     also prepared, one each extracted from the A, B, and C samples.  Each     sample features a different geographic scheme.  The A sample focuses on     States, the B on SMSA's, and the C samples gives urban/rural components     for regions and divisions and identifies UA's.  Separate sets of county     groups are featured on the A and B samples.  Microdata files allow the     user to prepare customized tabulations.  All state files have been     released.      Census of Population and Housing, 1980:  P.L. 94-171 Population Counts.     The file, organized by State, provides count for total population, and     provisional counts for five racial categories and Spanish/Hispanic     origin.  Summaries are provided for the State, counties, minor civil     divisions (MCD's) or census county divisions (CCD's), incorporated     places or place segments within MCD's/CCD's, remainder of MCD's/CCD's,     election precincts in certain States or portions of certain States,     census tracts or block numbering areas, block groups and blocks or, for     areas that are not block numbered, enumeration districts (ED's).  The     figures presented in P.L. 94-171 may differ from those shown in STF 1.     The changes reflect corrections of errors found after P.L. 94-171 was     prepared.  Microfiche (and paper photo copy of microfiche) of the P.L.     94-171 Population Counts file is also available.      Census Software Package (CENSPAC).  CENSPAC is a generalized data     retrieval system developed by the Census Bureau for use with Census     Bureau statistical data files.  CENSPAC provides file processing     capabilities primarily for summary data files, but also provides some     features which apply to microdata files.  A manual describing the     software accompanies each file order ($140 from Customer Services     (Tapes) or may be purchased separately from Customer Services for $5.00.

File Structure and Geographic Coverage   For each geographic area presented on MARF, there is a 390-character census  logical record.  Each record begins with 252 characters of geographic  information and suppression indicators.  For a concise description of the  geographic coverage of MARF 2 see Appendix A.   Figure 1 presents an overview of the sequencing of records in MARF.  Although variations such as places split by minor civil divisions (MCD's),  MCD's which both have block numbering areas (BNA's) and unblocked areas, and  census tracts with both block groups (BC's) and enumeration distrits (ED's)  are not shown, these variations are explained in the following discussion of  each summary level record type appearing in MARF.   The State record (Summary Level 04) contains a summary for the State or  State equivalent.   The county record (Summary Level 11) contains a summary for each county or  county equivalent, including independent cities, within the State in FIPS  code sequence.   The minor civil division (MCD) / census county division (CCD) record  (Summary Level 12) contains a summary for each MCD/CCD within the county in  census code sequence.   The place or remainder-of-MCD/CCD record (Summary Level 13) provides a  summary for each place within the MCD/CCD in census place code sequence.   These may be places or, when places cross MCD/CCD boundaries, portions of  places.  A remainder-of-MCD/CCD record will be generated only if there is a  place in the MCD/CCD.  This record will cover all areas outside of places  and will have a pseudo place code of 9999.

When an area is tracted and block-numbered, a summary is      shown for each tract or tract portion within the MCD/CCD/place or      remainder of MCD/CCD.  Each tract summary is followed by a summary for      each BG within the tract or tract portion.  Tract summaries are in tract      code sequence, and BG summaries are sequenced by the BG number.   B.  Tract/BG/ED.  When a MCD/CCD is tracted and partially block-numbered,      there will be both BG and ED summaries for the tract or tract portion      within the MCD/CCD/place or remainder of MCD/CCD.  BG summaries will      precede those for ED's.  BG summaries are sequenced by BG numbers, and      ED summaries are sequenced by ED number and suffix.   C.  Tract/ED.  When an area is tracted but not block-numbered, a summary is      shown for each tract or tract portion within the MCD/CCD/place or      remainder.  Each tract summary is followed by the summary for each ED      within the tract or BNA portion.   D.  BNA/BG.  When an area is not tracted but is block-numbered, there will      be a summary for each BNA portion within the MCD/CCD/place or remainder,      followed by a summary for each BG within the BNA or BNA portion.   E.  Pseudo BNA/ED.  When the remainder of an untracted MCD/CCD is partially      blocked, the blocked portion will be shown as in D above and the      unblocked portion will be shown by a pseudo BNA (999999) followed by the      summary for each ED in the area.   F.  ED.  When an area is neither tracted nor block-numbered, a summary is      shown for each ED within the place, place segment, or MCD/CCD.  ED records      for the portion of MCD's/CCD's not covered by places will follow the      remainder of MCD/CCD summary record, if applicable.     DESCRIPTION OF POPULATION   Universe description =  All persons and housing units in the United States.    SUPPRESSION    Introduction  To maintain the confidentiality promised respondents and required by law,  the Census Bureau takes precautions to make sure that its public data, in  print or on tape, do not disclose information about particular individuals  or housing units; therefore the Bureau suppresses tabulations of  characteristics for very small groups of people or housing units.  On  summary tapes, zeroes are entered in suppressed cells.  However, a zero in a  cell does not automatically mean suppression.  Only by checking the  suppression flag field can it be determined if the zero in a specific item  is suppressed data or an actual count of zero.   The following discussion outlines the rules for suppression of  complete-count and sample data as it applies to the subject items on MARF2.    No Suppression   No Suppression   The following counts are never suppressed:                      Total population                     Total housing units                     Occupied housing units                     Count of persons and households in each race and                       Spanish origin group    Primary Suppression   Primary Suppression   Suppression of Population Characteristics.  Characteristics of persons other  than race or Spanish origin are shown only if the number of persons in a  geographic area meets minimum requirements.  For tabulations based on  complete-count data (e.g., number of persons in group quarters), there must  be 15 or more persons in the geographic area.  For tabulations based on  sample estimates (e.g., per capita income), there must be 30 or more persons  in the geographic area.   Suppression of Family, Household, or Occupied Housing Characteristics.  Characteristics of families, households, or occupied housing units are shown  if there are five or more occupied housing units within the geographic area  tabulated.   Suppression of Owner or Renter Characteristics.  Distributions of data for  owners or renters are shown when the number of owners is five or more and  the number of renters is also five or more.  Programming with Suppression   Suppressed data cells contain zeroes.  To distinguish between zeroes as  suppression and zeroes as valid data, occurrences of suppression are  identified by a series of flag fields in the geographic identification  portion of each logical record.  Programmers developing software should  include procedures to check these fields for the presence of suppression  and, if necessary, to flag the output of any cumulation which includes one  or more suppressed fields.   In reviewing the data dictionary, the programmer can determine which  suppression flags indicate suppression for particular items by checking  either the item description or the flag description.     DATA DICTIONARY (RECORD LAYOUT)    How to Use the Data Dictionary (Record Layout)   This computer-generated report documents the data contents and the record  layout of the file.  Below is a brief description of the information  provided for each data item.   The first line of each data item description gives the name, size/scale,  begin position, and the variable label.  Following those items, on  subsequent lines, are any applicable notes and value codes.  Each of these  items is defined below.       1.  Name.  This is an arbitrarily assigned 8 character identifier.  It          may be a mnemonic such as ""STATE"" or ""EDNUMBER"", or sequential          identifiers such as ""SUPFLO1"", ""SUPFLO2"", etc.       2.  Size/Scale.  The size of a data item is given in characters.  The          scale of a data item is given in integer powers of 10.  Implied          decimals or multipliers (in integer powers of ten only) are          indicated by a ""-"" or a ""+"" followed by a number.  For example,          123.45 would appear on the data tape as 12345, and the size/scale          value would be 5/-2.  A number recorded in thousands (12,345,000 for          example) would appear on the data tape as 12345 and the size/scale          value would be 5/+3.  Scale factors which are not an integer power          of ten are identified in the notes following the label, and in the          footnotes.       3.  Begin.  This is the location in the data record of the first          character of the data item.       4.  Data Type.  The type ""A"" indicates that the data item is represented          by an alphabetic or numeric code; ""N"" indicates that an actual          figure is provided.       5.  Description.  Following the Data Type is a description of the data          item.  This heading is not labeled on the data dictionary.  This          section also provides any relevant notes or footnote references.  In          addition, any value codes necessary for the data item are listed and          labeled here.   Note:  Since the standard geographic identification format for 1980 census  summary tapes is used on the MARF 2 file, all geographic identifiers are  included in the MARF 2 data dictionary.  However, the description indicates  if the identifier is not applicable to MARF 2.

BUREAU OF CENSUS PRODUCT REVIEW Summary Tape Files   Computer-readable data from the 1980 census include both summary data and  microdata.  Summary data include Summary Tape Files (STF's) 1 to 5, which  are generally comparable to the First Count through Sixth Count files from  the 1970 census.  In addition to the files in the STF series, other summary  data released by the Bureau include a P.L. 94-171 Population Counts file  used in reapportionment/redistricting, the Master Area Reference file which  provides geographic items from STF 1 and selected population and housing  items, and the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Special File containing  two tables, one on detailed occupation by sex and another on years of school  completed by age and sex.  All of these files contain data summarized to  various levels of geography.  Microdata files, on the other hand, contain  disclosure-free household and person records from the census.  These are  similar to the 1970 census public use sample files.   Summary Tape Files vary by level of geography, detail of information, and  whether they include 100-percent or sample data.  STF's 1 and 2 provide data  based on the set of census questions asked of all persons and housing  units.  STF's 3, 4, and 5 contain sample data or estimates based on the  responses of a sample of population and housing units.  In 1980, the  sampling rate was 1 in 2 in governmental units estimated to have less than  2,500 inhabitants and 1 in 6 elsewhere.  Overall, the sampling rate was  approximately 1 in 5.  The bureau's 1977 population estimates were used to  determine the sampling rate for a given area.   STF 1 provides the maximum possible geographic detail available from the  census:  data for individual blocks in block-numbered areas and for  enumeration districts outside block-numbered areas.  The lowest level of  geography provided by STF 2 is the census tract, or minor civil  division/census county division (MCD/CCD) and places of 1,000 or more  inhabitants in nontracted areas.  The lowest level for STF 3 is the block  group or enumeration district, while the smallest geographic unit for STF 4  is the census tract, or MCD/CCD and places of 2,500 or more inhabitants in  nontracted areas.  STF 5 contains summaries for States, standard  metropolitan statistical areas (SMSA's), SMSA central cities, other places  of 50,000 or more inhabitants, and counties of 50,000 or more inhabitants.   STF's 1 to 5 each consist of multiple files, each file featuring specific  levels of geography.  Figure 3 details the geographic levels on each STF.   For comparison purposes, STF 1 is similar in subject matter and geographic  detail to the First and Third Count files for 1970.  STF's 2 and 4 are  roughly comparable to the 1970 Second and Fourth Counts, respectively.  STF  3 is comparable to the 1970 Fifth Count, while STF 5 corresponds to the 1970  Sixth Count.

To determine which maps best define the  different geographic areas, compare the geographic coverage of each file  (see Appendix A) with the description of each type of 1980 census map (see  below).   There are five basic map types used in conjunction with the summary tape  files:  county maps, place maps, place-and-vicinity maps, American Indian  reservation maps, and Metropolitan Map Series (MMS) or Vicinity Map Series  (VMS).  Ordering information for these maps may be obtained from Data User  Services Division, Customer Services (Maps), Bureau of the Census,  Washington, D.C.   20233.   All five map types have several characteristics in common:       --To improve legibility, most 1980 maps are at a larger scale than          were the comparable 1970 maps.       --Symbols used for the various boundaries are consistent for all          five types of maps.       --Names, identifying numbers, and boundaries are shown where          appropriate on all maps for counties and equivalent entities, minor          civil divisions (MCD's) or census county divisions (CCD's), places,          American Indian reservations and Alaska Native villages, census          tracts or block numbering areas (BNA's) where present, enumeration          districts (ED's) (in those areas which are not block numbered), and          blocks.       --All maps show metric, feet, and mile scales.       --All maps containing block-numbered areas are available from the          U.S. Government Printing Office.   The following paragraphs present a brief description of each type of census  map.    County Maps  County maps are the backbone of the Bureau's map coverage.  Theoretically, with a complete set of these maps the overall picture of the  census geographic framework for the entire United States and its possessions  is shown.  Most maps in the county series are at a scale of 1 inch:1 mile.  Most county maps are created by superimposing boundaries for most areas for  which data are tabulated on base maps supplied by State transportation or  highway departments.  There are approximately 5,500 county map sheets for  1980.  The following geographic area boundaries are defined on county maps  where appropriate:  State, county, minor civil divisions (MCD's) or census  county divisions (CCD's), places, American Indian reservations, census  tracts or block numbering areas (BNA's), and enumeration districts (ED's) or  numbered blocks.  In addition, the locations of Alaska Native villages are  indicated.  Counties which are totally covered by Metropolitan Map Sheets  (MMS) do not have separate county maps.    Place Maps   For places not covered on MMS or VMS sheets where most of the  development is contained within the corporate limits of a municipality or  within the boundaries established for a census designated place (CDP), the  Bureau uses place maps.  The scale of the place maps varies from place to  place.  As with the county maps, most are created by superimposing  boundaries for most areas for which data are tabulated on base maps supplied  by local or State governments.  On the county map, shading is added to  indicate the area covered by the place map; i.e., the place map is regarded  as an inset to the county map.  There are about 11,800 place map sheets for  1980.  The geographic area boundaries defined on place maps are the same as  for county maps.    Place-and-Vicinity Maps   For places not covered on MMS or VMS sheets which  have areas of development outside the corporate limits of a municipality or  outside the boundaries established for a CDP, the Bureau uses  place-and-vicinity maps.  Also included in this category are maps of places  which have parcels of land that are not part of the city but are completely  surrounded by the city and where two or more places appear on the same map  sheet.  In all other respects, place-and-vicinity maps have the same  characteristics as place maps.  As with the place maps, all area covered by  the place-and-vicinity map is shaded on the county map and the  place-and-vicinity map is considered to be an inset to the county map.  There are about 4,500 place-and-vicinity map sheets for 1980.  The  geographic area boundaries defined on these maps are the same as those  specified for the county maps.    Indian Reservation Maps   The Census Bureau developed separate maps for 20  American Indian reservations which could not be depicted adequately on  county Maps; these maps are similar in format to county maps.  There are  approximately 100 American Indian reservation maps and these maps are  special insets to the county maps.  The geographic area boundaries defined  on these maps are the same as those specified for the county maps.    Metropolitan Map Series/Vicinity Map Series (MMS/VMS)   For the Nation's major built-up areas, the Bureau has developed its own maps  to provide uniform coverage of the densely settled portions of the counties  involved. these maps are referred to as the Metropolitan Map Series (MMS)  when the maps cover SMSA counties and as the Vicinity Map Series (VMS) when  the maps cover areas which are not in an SMSA.  The predominant scale for the  MMS and VMS is 1 inch:1,600 feet.  In selected areas with very dense  development, some sheets are at 1 inch:800 feet; conversely, some sparsely  settled areas are mapped at 1 inch:3,200 feet.  The MMS and VMS are  considered to be insets to the county maps and the areas covered by MMS and  VMS are shaded on county maps.  There are about 10,400 MMS and VMS sheets for  1980.  (In a few instances, these map sheets entirely cover a county, in  which case no separate county map exists.)  The geographic area boundaries  defined on the MMS are the same as those specified for county maps, but also  include urbanized areas.   In addition to the five types of ""outline"" maps described above, there are a  number of maps that are prepared and published as part of the various report  series.  As was the case with the maps previously described, the maps  included in the printed reports share common characteristics.  Both metric  and mile scales are shown.  Map scale and content are similar to 1970 except  where noted below; however, presentation has been improved to make the maps  more readable and consistent from series to series.   The County Subdivision Map Series consists of at least one map page for each  State showing the names and boundaries for the State, each component county  or equivalent entity, minor civil divisions (MCD's) or census county  divisions (CCD's), and all places, both incorporated and census designated.  For most States, the scale of the maps requires that they be presented in  sections.  For 1980, the boundaries (not just the locations) of places with  fewer than 2,500 inhabitants are shown for the first time.  In addition, the  name(s) of adjoining State(s) are shown along with a mark to indicate where  the State boundaries intersect.  These maps, which are based on the State  base maps of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Mapping Program  appear in PC80-1-A.  Single-sheet versions of the county subdivision map  series are published at the USGS scale of 1:500,000 (1 inch equals about 8  miles) for most States except Alaska and the outlying areas, and may be  fitted together to form multi-State maps.  For those States in which  American Indian reservations or Alaska Native villages are located, a  special version of the county subdivision map showing these entities appears  in PC80-1-B and HC80-1-A.   The Urbanized Area Outline Map Series consists of one or more map sheets for  each urbanized area (UA) defined on the basis of 1980 census results.  The  names and boundaries of all States, counties, MCD's/CCD's, and places on  each map are shown, plus the extent of territory defined as ""urbanized.""  These maps appear in PC80-1-A and HC80-1-A.  In 1980, the report for each  State containing part of a multi-State UA includes the map for the entire UA.   The State SCSA/SMSA Map Series shows county names and boundaries, names and  locations of all places with a population of 25,000 or more or designated as  the central city of an SMSA, and names and boundaries of standard  consolidated statistical areas (SCSA's) and standard metropolitan  statistical areas (SMSA's) in the State.  For 1980, the name of the capital  of the State is underlined.  These maps appear in PC80-1-A, B, C, D;  HC80-1-A, B; and HC80-2.   The Census Tract Outline Map Series covers each of the areas for which  tracts have been defined in 1980.  These maps show the boundaries and code  identification number for each tract; the names of streets or other features  used as census tract boundaries; and the names and boundaries for counties,  MCD/CCD's, and all places (not just those over 25,000 as in 1970).  Street  detail within the tracts is not shown.  Separate insets of larger scale than  the base maps are included for densely developed areas; however, fewer  insets are used than in 1970.  Scale varies from map to map.  For 1980,  tract outline maps were prepared for tracted counties outside SMSA's.  These  maps are published in PHC80-2 Census Tracts (Maps) and should appear  slightly ahead of the printed reports, PHC80-2 Census Tracts.   Map sets were printed for all block-numbered areas, grouped by SMSA and the  nonSMSA remainder of each State.  In addition to printed copies of the  county, place, place-and-vicinity, and Metropolitan Map Series/Vicinity Map  Series (MMS/VMS) sheets having block-numbered areas, there is an index map  depicting the extent of the block-numbered area for the SMSA and State.  The  SMSA Index to Block-Numbered Areas Maps show the extent of the SMSA; county,  MCD/CCD, and place names and boundaries; and the extent of block-numbered  area within the SMSA shown by means of shading.  The State Index to  Block-Numbered Areas Maps were prepared by superimposing the extent of all  block-numbered areas in the State over the county subdivision map.  This  index map also shows the boundaries of the SMSA(s) in the State so that the  reader can determine whether the data for any block-numbered area in the  State are available with the SMSA tabulations or the remainder-of-State  tabulations.     SAMPLING AN NONSAMPLING ERRORS   Certain numbers in this file (per capita income, estimates of total persons  and housing units) are based on a sample of questionnaire responses.  These  data are estimates of the actual figures that would have resulted from a  complete count and can be expected to vary from the complete-count result.  These estimates contain some amount of chance error and are subject to  sampling variability as well as nonsampling error.  A detailed discussion of  the 1980 census sample design and of the sample variability of these  estimates may be found in Appendix D of any PC80-1-C report, General Social  and Economic Characteristics of the Population.  In general, sample  estimates of total population and housing units will differ from the  corresponding complete census counts for geographic areas not composed of  entire counties.  When summed to the county level, however, these counts  should agree.   The remaining 1980 census population and housing counts shown in this file  were tabulated from the entries for persons on all questionnaires, these  counts are not subject to sampling error.  However, in any large-scale  statistical operation such as a decennial census, human and mechanical  errors do occur.  These errors are commonly referred to as nonsampling  errors.  Such errors include failure to include every household or person in  the universe, not obtaining all required information from respondents,  obtaining incorrect or inconsistent information, and recording information  incorrectly.  Errors can also occur during the field review of the  enumerators' work, the clerical handling of the census questionnaires, or  the electronic processing of the questionnaires.   In an attempt to reduce various types of nonsampling errors in the 1980  census, a number of techniques were introduced on the basis of experience in  previous censuses and in tests conducted prior to the census.  These quality  control and review measures were utilized throughout the data collection and  processing phases of the census to reduce undercoverage of the population  and housing units and to keep the errors at a minimum.  As was done after  the 1950, 1960, and 1970 censuses, there were programs at the conclusion of  the 1980 census to measure various aspects of the quality achieved in the  census.  Reports on many aspects of the 1980 census evaluation program will  be published as soon as the appropriate data are accumulated and analyzed.   A major component of the evaluation work is to ascertain, insofar as  possible, the degree of completeness of the count of persons and housing  units.  The Census Bureau has estimated that the 1970 census did not count  2.5 percent of the population.  For 1980, the Census Bureau's extensive  evaluation program encompassed a number of different approaches to the task  of estimating the coverage of the census.  Although these studies have not  been completed, at the time of this file's release, preliminary estimates  indicate that the rate of undercoverage in the 1980 census was reduced from  1970 census levels.     EDITING AND ALLOCATION OF DATA ITEMS   The objective of the census processing operation is to produce a set of  statistics that describes the population as accurately and clearly as  possible.  To meet this objective, certain unacceptable entries and blank  items were edited.   Editing.  In the field, questionnaires were reviewed for omissions and  certain inconsistencies by a census clerk or an enumerator and, if  necessary, a followup was made for missing information.  In addition, a  similar review of questionnaires was done in the central processing  offices.  As a rule, however, editing was performed by hand only when it  could not be done effectively by machine.   As one of the first steps in computerized editing, the configuration of  marks on the questionnaire column was scanned electronically to determine  whether it contained information for a person or merely spurious marks.  If  the column contained entries for at least two of the basic characteristics  (relationship, sex, race, age, marital status, Spanish origin), the  inference was made that the marks represented a person.  In cases in which  two or more basic characteristics were available for only a portion of the  people in the unit, other information on the questionnaire provided by an  enumerator was used to determine the total number of persons.  Names were  not used as a criterion of the presence of a person because the electronic  scanning was unable to distinguish an entry in the name space.   Allocation.  Allocations, or assignments of acceptable codes in place of  unacceptable entries, are needed most often when an entry for a given item  is lacking or when the information reported for a person or housing unit on  that item is inconsistent with other information for the person or housing  unit.  The usefulness of the data is considered to be enhanced through the  assignment of acceptable codes in place of blanks or unacceptable entries.   For housing data, the assignment is based on related information reported  for the housing unit or on information reported for a similar unit in the  immediate neighborhood.  For example, if tenure for an occupied unit is  omitted but a rental amount is reported for that unit, the computer edits  tenure to ""rented for cash rent.""  On the other hand, if the unit is  reported as rented but the amount of rent is missing, the computer assigns  the rent from the preceding renter-occupied unit that had a rental amount  reported.   The general procedure for changing unacceptable population entries is to  assign an entry for a person that is consistent with entries for other  persons with similar characteristics.  Thus, a person who is reported as a  20-year old son of the householder but for whom marital status is not  reported, is assigned the same marital status as that of the last son  processed in the same age group.  The allocation technique may be  illustrated by the procedure used in the assignment for an unknown age.  The  process is carried out in the following steps:       1.  The computer stores reported ages of persons by selected          characteristics, including sex, relationship, marital status, and          characteristics of other household members.       2.  Each stored age is retained in the computer only until a person          having the same set of characteristics and with age reported is          processed through the computer in the edit operation.  Then the age          of this succeeding person is substituted for the age previously          stored.       3.  When a person processed has no report of age, or the entry is          unacceptable, the age assigned to him or her is that which was          stored for the last person who otherwise has the same set of          characteristics.   Substitution.  The editing process also includes another type of correction,  namely the assignment of a full set of characteristics for a person or a  housing unit.  The assignment of the full set of housing characteristics  occurs when there is no housing information available.  If the housing unit  is determined to be occupied, the housing characteristics are assigned from  the previously processed occupied units.  If the housing unit is vacant, the  housing characteristics are assigned from the previously processed vacant  unit.   The assignment of a full set of characteristics for a person in a household  containing no information for all or most of the people, although persons  were known to be present, is done in the following manner.  A previously  processed household is selected as a substitute and the full set of  population characteristics for each substituted person is duplicated.  These  duplications fall into two classes:  (1) ""persons substituted due to  noninterview,"" e.g., a housing unit indicated as occupied but the occupants  are not listed on the questionnaire, and (2) ""persons substituted due to  mechanical failure,"" e.g., where the questionnaire page on which persons are  listed was not properly microfilmed.   The editing process ensures that the distribution of characteristics for  persons and housing units assigned by the computer corresponds closely to  the distribution of characteristics for persons and housing units actually  reported in the census.  Before the advent of the computer, this type of  process was not feasible and the distribution of characteristics to be used  for assignment purposes was drawn from the preceding census or another  source.   Specific tolerances are established for the number of computer allocations  and substitutions that are permitted.  If the number of corrections is  beyond tolerance, the questionnaires in which the errors occurred are  clerically reviewed.  If it is found that the errors resulted from damaged  questionnaires, from improper microfilming, from faulty reading by FOSDIC  (Film Optical Sensing Device for Input to Computers) of undamaged  questionnaires, or from other types of machine failure, the questionnaires  are reprocessed.     GLOSSARY    Introduction                               Concept Definitions   The following definitions were taken from the 1980 Census of Population and  Housing Users' Guide.  Since the items described here are only those which  appear in MARF 2, there may be references to other terms which are not  defined in this glossary.  A complete glossary is available in the Users'  Guide.    A-B   ALASKA NATIVE VILLAGES.  Alaska Native villages constitute tribes, bands,  clans, groups, villages, communities, or associations in Alaska which were  listed in sections 11 and 16 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act,  Public Law 92-203, or which met the requirements of the Act and which the  Secretary of Interior determined were, on the 1970 census enumeration date  (April 1), composed of 25 or more Alaska Natives.  This list was reviewed  and updated for the Census Bureau by the State of Alaska prior to the 1980  census, to specifically identify only those entities that were legally  recognized as Alaska Native villages.   Data summaries for Alaska Native villages are included in STF's 2B, 2C, 4B,  and 4C, and reports PC80-1-B and -C and HC80-1-A and -B.  Population and  housing counts for Alaska Native villages are scheduled to be included in a  supplementary report (PC80-S1 series).  In addition, a population subject  report (PC80-2 series), featuring additional data on Alaska Native villages  is also planned.  Data for each Alaska Native village can be derived from  MARF, MARF 2, STF 1A, and STF 3A by identifying the component ED(s), and  summarizing the data should multiple ED's be involved.  (NOTE-  Eklutna  Native Village is in a blocked area; therefore, data can be derived from  block group (BG) summaries for the village.)  Each Alaska Native village has  been assigned a unique 3-digit code by the Bureau which appears in the  reservation code field.   Alaska Native villages will be identified on the Alaska subdivision maps in  the PC80-1-B and HC80-1-A reports.  Alaska Native villages are also shown on  Metropolitan Map Series, place, and county maps.  It should be noted that  Alaska Native villages do not have boundaries that are defined by legal  descriptions, and therefore the boundaries shown on the census maps are only  indicative of the approximate extent of a village; for those that correspond  to a city or census designated place, the limits of such places are  construed to coincide with the extent of the Alaska Native village.   Historical comparability:  Data are not available from previous censuses for  Alaska Native villages.  Some cities and ""unincorporated places"" (referred  to as ""census designated places"" in 1980) which were identified in the 1970  census may correspond to 1980 Alaska Native villages, but may not have  identical boundaries.

American Indian reservations are areas with  boundaries established by treaty, statute, and/or executive or court order.  The reservations and their boundaries were identified for the Census Bureau  by the bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and State governments.  Federal and  State reservations are located in 33 States and may cross State, county,  minor civil division/census county division, and place boundaries.  In  tabulations for reservations, tribal trust lands outside the boundaries of  reservations (off-reservation) are not included as part of the reservations  (see below).   Preliminary evaluation of the 1980 census data suggest that counts for a few  reservations may be subject to certain limitations or nonsampling errors.  Although the various field and computer operations undergo a number of  quality control checks to ensure accuracy of the data, available evidence  indicates that nonsampling errors are substantial for a small number of  reservations.  For example, a few reservations have a relatively high  substitution rate.  A listing of reservations where characteristics for 20  percent or more of the persons or housing units in the 1980 Census were  substituted are shown in PC80-1-B reports, Appendix D, ""Accuracy of the  Data.""  (For a fuller discussion of nonsampling errors, see the Users' Guide  chapter 6, ""Data Limitations,"" report appendixes on ""Accuracy of the Data,""  or the ""Technical Information"" section in tape technical documentation.)  Additional evaluation of the 100-percent counts for reservations is being  completed and a fuller explanation will be published in a 1980 census  supplementary report, series PC80-S1, ""Population and Housing Unit Counts  for American Indian Areas and Alaska Native Villages:  1980.""   Each American Indian reservation was assigned a unique 3-digit code by the  Bureau.  Enumeration districts (ED's) and block groups (BG's) which are  inside boundaries of reservations are designated with an ""N"" in the ED  prefix field in tape files.   Data summaries for American Indian reservations are included in STF's 2B,  2C, 4B, and 4C, and reports PC80-1-B and -C and HC80-1-A and -B.  Population  and housing counts for reservations are scheduled to be included in a  supplementary report (PC80-S1 series).  Also, a population subject report  (PC80-2 series) presenting additional data on American Indian reservations  is also planned.  Summaries on tape and in PC80-1-B and HC80-1-A show data  not only for the reservation totals, but also for parts of reservations that  cross State or county boundaries.  Reservation data can also be derived from  MARF, MARF 2, STF 1A, and STF 3A by the addition of component ED or BG  summaries.  Maps outlining reservation boundaries are included in the  PC80-1-B and HC80-1-A reports.  Reservation boundaries are also shown on  Metropolitan Map Series, place, and county maps.   Historical comparability:  Data on 115 American Indian reservations were  published in the 1970 census subject report, American Indians, PC(2)-1F.  However, 1980 data may not be comparable to 1970 information because of  boundary changes, improvements in geographic identification, new enumeration  techniques, and other procedural changes made for the 1980 census.   AMERICAN INDIAN SUBRESERVATION AREAS.  Entities known as ""areas,""  ""chapters,"" ""districts,"" ""segments,"" or ""communities"" are associated with  some American Indian reservations and were identified for the Census Bureau  by tribal governments or the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA).  In a few  cases, such subreservation areas extend beyond reservation boundaries or are  located entirely outside the reservation (off-reservation.  American Indian  subreservations recognized for the 1980 census are identified by a unique  3-digit code.   Data for subreservations are not summarized in regular census tabulations;  however, subreservation data can be obtained from the Census Bureau on a  cost-reimbursable basis from a special tabulation.  (For further information  regarding subreservation areas, please write Population Division, Racial  Statistics Branch, Bureau of the Census, Washington, D.C.  20233.)   Historical comparability:  American Indian subreservation areas were not  identified separately in previous censuses.   AMERICAN INDIAN TRIBAL TRUST LANDS.  Some American Indian reservations have  tribal trust lands in the vicinity of the reservation.  The Bureau of Indian  Affairs identified these areas for the 1980 census.  Tribal trust lands are  located outside the reservation boundary (off-reservation) and are  associated with a specific reservation.   Population and housing counts for tribal trust lands are scheduled to be  included in a supplementary report (PC80-S1 series).  Additional information  for these areas may be included in special reports or unpublished  tabulations.  Also, such data can be obtained from the Census Bureau on a  cost-reimbursable basis from a special tabulation.  (For further information  regarding the geography for tribal trust lands, please write to Population  Division, Racial Statistics Branch, Bureau of the Census, Washington, D.C.  20233.)   Historical comparability:  Tribal trust lands were not identified in  previous censuses.   AREA, LAND.  See LAND AREA.   ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER POPULATION.  See RACE.   BARRIO.  See PUERTO RICO AND OUTLYING AREAS.   BLACK POPULATION.  See RACE.   BLOCK.  Normally a rectangular piece of land, bounded by four streets.  However, a block may also be irregular in shape or bounded by railroad  tracks, streams, or other features.  Blocks do not cross the boundaries of  counties, census tracts, or block numbering areas (BNA's).  They may cross  place boundaries and the boundaries of minor civil divisions (MCD's).  When  blocks cross place boundaries and, in 20 States (see figure 4, column 3)  when they cross MCD boundaries, separate statistical summaries are presented  for each part of the block.   Census blocks are normally compact units, but there are important  exceptions.  For example, in some suburbs, houses cluster around  cul-de-sacs.  In these areas a census block may be fairly large since only  those features that serve as the perimeter of an enclosed area are treated  as block boundaries.  Also, in those rural areas where they are numbered,  blocks may include many square miles, depending on the frequency of  intersections of roads, rivers, mountain ridges, or other physical features.   Census data are tabulated by block in all urbanized areas (UA's) and  generally for some territory extending beyond the UA boundaries.  Data also  are tabulated by block in incorporated places with 10,000 or more  inhabitants outside UA's, and in other areas which contracted with the  Census Bureau for the preparation of block statistics.  Places outside of  UA's are included in the block statistics program if they met the 10,000  population criterion in the 1970 census, in official Bureau estimates  through 1976, or in a special census taken on or before December 31, 1977.  Block coverage for qualifying places is within boundaries as of January 1,  1980.  Five States contracted for the preparation of block statistics for  all of their territory, both urban and rural, not already in the block  statistics program. These States are Georgia, Mississippi, New York, Rhode  Island, and Virginia.   A block is identified by a 3-digit code which is unique within census tract  or, where tracts do not exist, BNA.  Since separate summaries are provided  for the parts of a block split by a place boundary or, in 20 States, an MCD  boundary, tape users often will need to specify the place or MCD code, along  with other codes, to retrieve data for a block.  Blocks are defined on  detailed census maps:  Metropolitan Map Series (MMS), Vicinity Map Series  (VMS), place maps, and county maps.  The extent of block statistics coverage  is reflected on maps by the presence of the 3-digit block number and the  absence of ED boundaries and numbers.   On census maps, when a block boundary ignores a minor physical feature, such  as a railroad track, a ""fishhook"" (   ) across the feature indicates that  the block includes area on both sides of the feature.  Alternatively, the  separate parts of such a block may have identical block numbers, each  followed by an asterisk.   The maps used for enumeration activities were, of necessity, obtained  several years prior to the census and therefore do not reflect recently  constructed streets.  Only those features shown on the maps can serve as  block boundaries.   Statistics were collected for approximately 2.6 million blocks in the 1980  census.  Block statistics are included in PHC80-1 Block Statistics  microfiche series and in file B of Summary Tape File 1 (STF 1B).   Historical comparability:  In 1970 block statistics were prepared for UA's  (and some territory beyond) located in SMSA's existing at the time of the  census, as well for contract areas.  Unlike 1980, they were not prepared for  places of 10,000 population or more outside UA's unless done under contract,  nor for UA's in not-yet-defined SMSA's.   Some blocks defined for 1970 will have new boundaries in 1980, primarily  those on the edges of UA's and other areas of new development where the  street patterns have changed.  To help the user notice a change wherever a  block has been redefined by splitting or other adjustment, the 1970 block  number will generally not be reused.  Where blocks were recognized for the  1970 census, their boundaries and numbers generally will be the same in  1980, except for a few areas where blocks were renumbered by local  GBF/DIME-File coordinating agencies in order to define more desirable block  groups.   BLOCK GROUP (BG).  A combination of numbered census blocks that is a  subdivision of a census tract or block numbering area (BNA) and is defined  in all areas for which block statistics are prepared.  (In areas where  blocks are not numbered, ED's are used instead of BG's.)   BG's are not outlined on census maps, but are defined as that set of  numbered blocks sharing the same first digit within a census tract or BNA.  For example, Block Group ""3"" within a particular census tract would include  any blocks numbered between 301 and 399.  In most cases, the numbering would  generally involve substantially fewer than 50 blocks, since gaps are  occasionally left in the numbering; e.g., Block 312 might be followed by  Block 316.   BG's are defined within census tract or BNA.  They may cross, and be split  by, the boundaries of minor civil divisions (MCD's) or census county  divisions (CCD's), places, congressional districts, urbanized areas, and  Indian reservations.  When this occurs, statistical summaries (data records)  are provided for each component or part.  To avoid mistaking a component  summary for a complete BG summary, users should carefully study census maps  to note any BG's split by place, MCD or CCD, urbanized area, and Indian  reservation boundaries.  Congressional district (CD) boundaries are not  shown on census maps, so the maps will not be of use in detecting BG's split  by CD boundaries.   BG summaries observe boundaries of some areas (specifically, CCD's and, in  10 States, MCD's) which are ignored in summarizing data for the block  statistics presentations in reports and on tape.  As a result, it will  occasionally be necessary to add BG components together to match the sum of  blocks in the same hundreds series.   Statistics will be prepared for almost 200,000 BG's.  BG data, together with  data for ED's, appear on STF's 1A and 3A, and in any corresponding  microfiche.  There are no printed data for BG's.   Historical comparability:  In areas where BG's were tabulated in 1970, many  1980 BG's will be the same as their 1970 counterparts, with exceptions  occurring primarily in areas where tract boundaries have changed or where  substantial development has taken place.  Also, BG parts, created when BG's  are split by the boundaries of higher level areas, will change if such  boundaries have changed.   Many areas with BG's in 1980 had data reported by ED's in 1970, a change  occasioned in part by the expansion of the block statistics program, and in  part because ED's were used for tabulation purposes in 1970 instead of BG's  in some block numbered areas.  Where BG's have replaced ED's, there will be  little comparability between 1970 ED's and 1980 BG's.   BLOCK NUMBERING AREA (BNA).  An area defined for the purpose of grouping and  numbering blocks in block-numbered areas where census tracts have not been  defined--typically, in non-SMSA places of 10,000 or more population and in  contract block areas.  BNA's do not cross county boundaries.  They are  identified by census tract-type numbers ranging from 9901.00 to 9989.99  which are unique within a county.  While BNA numbers are similar to census  tract numbers, BNA's are not census tracts and are not included in STF's 2  or 4.   BNA's may be split by the boundaries of places, MCD's, and CCD's.  Statistical summaries appear in STF 1B and PHC80-1 Block Statistics  microfiche series for the component parts of BNA's created when BNA's are  split by the boundaries of places and, in 20 States, MCD's.  (See figure 4,  column 3.)  Such component summaries appear in STF 1A and 3A when BNA's are  split by the boundaries of CCD's in 20 States (see figure 4, column 1) and  MCD's in 10 other States and Puerto Rico.   Historical comparability:  While BNA's were also used in previous censuses,  any historical comparability is generally coincidental.   BOROUGH (IN ALASKA).  See COUNTY.    C-G   CENSUS AREA (IN ALASKA).  See COUNTY.   CENSUS COUNTY DIVISION (CCD).  A statistical subdivision of a county,  roughly comparable to a minor civil division (MCD).  CCD's are defined in 20  States (see figure 4, column 1) which do not have MCD's suitable for  reporting census statistics (i.e., the MCD's have either lost their original  significance, are very small in population, have frequent boundary changes,  and/or have indefinite boundaries).  CCD's are established cooperatively by  the Census Bureau and both State and local government authorities.  They are  generally defined by boundary features that seldom change and can be easily  located, such as roads, rivers, and powerlines.   The Census Bureau has assigned each CCD, alphabetically sequenced within  county, an incremental unique 3-digit numeric code.  The National Bureau of  Standards has assigned each CCD, alphabetically sequenced within State, an  incremental unique 5-digit numeric FIPS ""place"" code.   CCD boundaries are represented on detailed census maps, such as place maps  and county maps.  In addition, CCD outlines appear at a small scale on maps  published in several 1980 reports.  Statistics for about 5,500 CCD's appear  in STF's 1A, 2B, 3A, and 4B, and in PC80-1-A and -B and HC80-1-A reports.   Historical comparability:  In 1980, CCD's are defined in one fewer State  than in 1970--North Dakota returned to the use of its MCD's (townships).  However, 1980 data for North Dakota's 1970 CCD's are available in STF 1E.  In the past, cities with 10,000 or more inhabitants generally were defined  as separate CCD's.  When these cities annexed territory, CCD boundaries also  had to be adjusted.  For 1980, many of these CCD boundaries were revised to  conform with census tract boundaries where tracts exist, and permanent  physical features elsewhere, in an attempt to minimize future CCD boundary  adjustments.  Many CCD's which changed boundaries between 1970 and 1980 are  noted in footnotes to table 4 of the PC80-1-A reports for States with CCD's.   CENSUS SUBAREA.  A statistical subdivision of a ""census area"" or borough  (county equivalent) in Alaska.  Census subareas take the place of minor  civil divisions (MCD's or census county divisions (CCD's).   Historical comparability:  In 1970, Alaska county equivalents were called  ""divisions,"" and some were subdivided further.  Some of the census subareas  used in the 1980 census approximate the 1970 divisions or their subdivisions.   CENSUS TRACT.  A small statistical subdivision of a county.  Tracts  generally have stable boundaries.  When tracts are established, they are  designed to be relatively homogeneous areas with respect to population  characteristics, economic status, and living conditions.  Tracts generally  have between 2,500 and 8,000 residents.  All standard metropolitan  statistical areas (SMSA's) recognized for the 1980 census have census  tracts.  Most of these SMSA's are completely tracted, but seven SMSA's newly  created as a result of the 1980 census include outlying counties which are  not tracted.  In addition, an estimated 3,000 census tracts have been  established in 221 counties outside SMSA's.  Five States and the District of  Columbia are entirely tracted:  Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, New Jersey,  and Rhode Island.  In all, there are over 43,300 census tracts for the 1980  census (excluding 465 in Puerto Rico).   Census tract boundaries are established cooperatively by local Census  Statistical Areas Committees and the Census Bureau in accordance with  guidelines that impose limitations on population size and specify the need  for visible boundaries.  Geographic shape and area size of tracts are of  relatively minor importance.  Tract boundaries are established with the  intention of being maintained over a long time so that statistical  comparisons can be made from census to census.  Census tracts observe county  lines and cover all of the territory within each tracted county.  Within a  county, tract boundaries may be split by other geographic boundaries.   Census tracts are identified by a 4-digit basic code and may have a 2-digit  suffix, e.g., 6059.02.  On tape, the decimal is implied.  Many census tracts  do not have a suffix.  In such cases, tapes give the 4-digit code followed  by two blanks.  Leading zeros in a tract number (e.g., 0025.02) do not  appear on the maps (e.g., 25.02.).   Tract numbers are always unique within a county, and, except for the New  York SMSA, are also unique within an SMSA.  All valid census tract numbers  are in the range 0001 to 9899.99; a number between 9901 and 9989.99 denotes  a block numbering area (BNA).   Census tract boundaries are shown on all detailed census maps, such as place  maps and county maps.  In addition, census tract outline maps are being  created for each SMSA and each tracted county outside SMSA's.  Tract outline  maps show only those streets and physical features which serve as census  tract boundaries.  In addition, the boundaries of places, MCD's, CCD's,  counties, and States appear on tract outline maps.   Census tract data are presented in STF's 1A, 1B, 2A, 3A, and 4A, and in  PHC80-2 Census Tracts reports.  In STF's 1A and 3A, tract data are presented  in hierarchial sequence within place within MCD or CCD.  In a case where a  tract is split by place, MCD, or CCD boundaries, the tape files will have  summaries for each of its parts.  To get data for the whole tract, it will  be necessary to add up the components.  In STF 1B the situation is similar  except that MCD boundaries are observed in only 20 States and Puerto Rico.  (See figure 4, column 3.)  MCD boundaries in the other 10 States with MCD's  and CCD boundaries in the remaining 20 States are ignored.  In the major  summaries for census tracts--those in STF's 2A and 4A and in PHC80-2 Census  Tracts reports--tract summaries observe the boundaries of places of 10,000  or more population.  Separate summaries provide totals for split tracts.   Historical comparability:  Census tracts are defined with an overall goal of  census-to-census comparability.  Some 1970 tracts have been subdivided due  to increased population, but the new tracts can be recombined by the user  for comparison with 1970 tracts.  This affects about 8 percent of all 1970  tracts.  Other changes have included combinations of two or more small 1970  tracts (less than 1 percent of all 1970 tracts) and adjustments to tract  boundaries where old boundary features have disappeared or better boundaries  (e.g., freeways) have come into being.  In a few areas, local Census  Statistical Areas Committees undertook extensive redefinition of census  tracts.   Census Tracts reports, PHC80-2, include 1970-1980 tract comparability tables  showing 1980 tracts which were split, combined, or had boundary realignments  affecting areas with 100 or more people along with the 1970 tracts or parts  of tracts to which they correspond.  The list is presented both ways:  1970  tracts in terms of 1970 counterparts, and 1980 in terms of 1970  counterparts.  Since the affected parts of individual tracts (e.g.,  individual blocks) are not specified, the comparability list essentially  serves to draw attention to areas which should be studied further on 1980  and 1970 maps, preferably those which show detail by block.   Both the number of tracted counties and the number of census tracts  increased by over 20 percent between 1970 and 1980.  The reporting of data  for split tracts has also increased.  Whereas 1970 Census Tracts reports  gave data for tract parts created when tracts were split by the boundaries  of only those places with 25,000 or more population, 1980 reports observe  boundaries of places as small as 10,000.  1980 STF's 2 and 4 present data  for the components of split tracts, as well as for whole tracts, whereas  their 1970 counterparts did not provide separate summaries for the  components of split tracts.   CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT (CBD).  An area of very high land valuation  characterized by a high concentration of retail businesses, service  businesses, offices, theaters, and hotels, and by a high traffic flow.  A  CBD follows census tract boundaries, i.e., it consists of one or more whole  census tracts.  CBD's are identified only in central cities of SMSA's and  other cities with a population of 50,000 or more, and are designated by  local Census Statistical Areas Committees in consultation with the Census  Bureau.  However, some eligible cities have chosen not to participate in the  CBD delineation program.  CBD's do not extend beyond the boundaries of the  city.   The CBD's now recognized were delineated for the 1977 Economic Censuses.  The Bureau does not plan to prepare 1980 statistics for CBD's, but users may  derive data by aggregating data for component census tracts or smaller  areas.  Records for such areas are indicated on most machine-readable files.   Historical comparability:  At the time of the 1970 census, CBD's were  defined only in cities of 100,000 or more persons.   CENTROID, POPULATION.  See POPULATION CENTROID.   CENTRAL CITY.  See STANDARD METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREA; URBANIZED AREA.   CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT.  One of the 435 State or sub-State areas from which  persons are elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.  Two sets of  congressional districts are recognized in 1980 census products.  Districts  of the 96th Congress (1979-1980) which were also in effect for the 97th  Congress (1981-1982) are summarized on STF 1A and STF 3A.  Districts of the  98th Congress (1983-1984) reflecting redistricting based on the 1980 census,  are summarized on STF 1D and STF 3D and in series PHC80-4, Congressional  Districts of the 98th Congress.   The PHC80-4 reports, issued by State, include a map of the State showing  congressional district boundaries in relation to county outlines.  More  detailed maps follow showing selected congressional district boundaries in  cases where the State map cannot delineate the congressional districts with  sufficient clarity.  These maps have been republished in the Congressional  District Atlas for the 98th Congress.  Congressional district boundaries are  not shown on detailed 1980 census maps.   Historical comparability:  Districts of the 96th Congress were the same as  districts for the 93rd Congress for all but 4 States:  New York, California,  and Texas, which were redistricted for the 94th Congress; and Tennessee, in  which one boundary change took effect for the 95th Congress.  1970 data for  these congressional districts were published in Congressional District Data  (CDD) report series for the 93rd and 94th Congresses, but not including the  later change for Tennessee.  The Congressional District Data Book  republished CDD reports for the 93rd Congress.   COUNTY.  The primary political and administrative subdivision of a State.  In Louisiana, such divisions are called parishes.  In Alaska, 23 boroughs  and ""census areas"" are treated as county equivalents for census purposes.  Several cities (Baltimore, Maryland; St. Louis, Missouri; Carson City,  Nevada; and 41 Virginia cities) are independent of any county organization,  and thereby constitute primary divisions of their States and are treated the  same as counties in census tabulations.   County boundaries are shown on most census maps.  A 3-digit Federal  Information Processing Standards (FIPS) county code identifies each county  uniquely within State.  Counties are numbered in alphabetic sequence, with  independent cities numbered separately at the end of the list.   There are 3,215 counties and county equivalents (including 78 in Puerto  Rico) recognized for the 1980 census.  Tabulations for all counties appear  in STF's 1 through 4, and in PC80-1-A, -B, and -C, HC80-1-A and -B and  PHC80-3 reports.  Tabulations for counties of 50,000 or more inhabitants  appear in STF 5.   Historical comparability:  A number of changes have occurred to county  boundaries since 1970.  A new set of county equivalents (boroughs and census  areas) has been defined for Alaska, and in some cases these county  equivalents differ considerably from the census divisions recognized for  1970.  In addition, there are minor changes in counties for South Dakota and  Hawaii.  In Virginia, county boundaries have changed as a result of the  creation of new independent cities or annexations by independent cities.  Most other changes represent minor adjustments of the boundaries between  counties.  Those counties which changed boundaries between 1970 and 1980 are  noted in footnotes at the end of table 4 of the PC80-1-A report for each  State.   COUNTY EQUIVALENT.  See COUNTY.   DIVISION (CENSUS GEOGRAPHIC).  A census geographic division is one of the  nine groups of States which are subdivisions of the four census geographic  regions of the United States.  Census geographic divisions are identified by  a 1-digit code which is also the first digit of the 2-digit census  geographic code for each State in the division.   Historical comparability:  Census divisions have remained unchanged since  the 1910 census, except for the expansion of the Pacific Division to include  Alaska and Hawaii.   ECONOMIC SUBREGION (ESR).  A grouping of State Economic Areas (SEA's) which  brings together those SEA's which are most closely related in terms of their  economic and social characteristics.  The areas were first defined following  the 1950 census and updated after the 1960 census.  To achieve such  homogeneity, State boundaries are frequently crossed.  The 510 SEA's are  grouped into 121 ESR's.  A 3-digit numeric code is assigned to each ESR.  No  data summaries will be prepared for ESR's, although the ESR code appears on  the geographic records of the summary tape files.   Historical comparability:  ESR boundaries have remained the same since 1960.   See also:  STATE ECONOMIC AREA (SEA).   ENUMERATION DISTRICT (ED).  An area used in the 1980 census for data  collection activities and as a tabulation area where blocks are not  present.  ED's do not cross the boundaries of legal or statistical areas;  for example, census tracts, MCD's/CCD's, places, counties, congressional  districts, and States.  Because of these constraints, they vary widely in  population size, although they do not generally exceed a population of 1,600  in areas where the census was taken by mail, or a population of 1,000 in  areas where the census was taken by conventional enumerator canvassing.  The  population limits are designed so that an ED generally represents a  reasonable workload for one enumerator.  About 1,000 jurisdictions in 47  States participated in a program for local definition of ED's.  In areas  without blocks, ED's are the smallest unit of census geography for which  statistics are prepared.   ED boundaries are shown on MMS/VMS, place, and county maps in areas where  there are no block numbers.  ED's are identified by a 4-digit number (except  that leading zeros, when they occur in ED numbers, do not appear on the  maps).  An ED number may be followed by a one-letter alphabetic suffix.  The  suffix is used to identify subdivisions of ED's made during data collection  and processing activities where the original ED proved to be too populous  for an efficient work unit, or to accommodate a revision to a place or other  boundary made after January 1, 1978 in mailout/mailback areas or January 1,  1979 in conventional census areas.  An ED number may also have a one-letter  prefix indicating that the ED is of a special type (e.g., an American Indian  reservation), but the prefix is not necessary for unique identification of  the ED.  ED numbers do not repeat within a county.  Any ED may be uniquely  identified by accompanying its ED code with the 2-digit State code and  3-digit county code.   Statistics will be prepared for about 100,000 ED's.  ED data, together with  data for BG's, appear on STF's 1A and 3A and corresponding microfiche.  In  addition, ED data appear on STF 1B to complement the summaries for blocks.  There are no printed data for ED's.   Historical comparability:  Many areas which were covered by ED's in 1970 are  summarized in terms of blocks and BG's for 1980.  In some cases, it may be  possible to add up blocks to approximate the 1970 ED's, based on detailed  comparison of 1980 and 1970 maps.   In areas covered by ED's for 1980, enumeration considerations dictated ED  size and design, and historical comparability does not normally enter into  consideration.   ESKIMO POPULATION.  See RACE.   FAMILY.  Two or more persons, including the householder, who are related by  birth, marriage, or adoption and who live together as one household; all  such persons are considered as members of one family.  (Persons not in  families and not inmates of institutions are classified as unrelated  individuals.)  Families are defined using responses to the complete-count  household relationship question.   If the son/daughter of the person or couple who maintain the household and  the son's or daughter's spouse and/or children are members of the household,  they are treated as part of the householder's family.  A roomer/boarder and  his/her spouse who are not related to the person or persons who maintain the  household, or a resident employee and his/her spouse living in, are not  counted as a family, but as individuals unrelated to the householder.  Thus,  a household can contain only one family for purposes of census tabulations.   A person maintaining a household alone, or two or more unrelated persons are  regarded as a household but not as a family.  Thus, some households do not  contain a family.   (In certain Census Bureau surveys (e.g., CPS) before 1980, families as  defined here are referred to as ""primary families.""  The term ""secondary  family"" refers to a resident family unrelated to the householder, such as a  roomer and his/her spouse.  Tabulations of families from such surveys  include secondary families.)   Historical comparability:  A similar definition for family was used in  1970.  In 1960, secondary families were also identified.  In 1960, secondary  families were also identified.   GROUP QUARTERS, PERSONS IN.  Persons in living arrangements, such as nursing  homes or rooming houses, which are not households.  Group quarters status  was determined on a complete-count basis.   Two general categories of persons in group quarters are recognized.       Inmate of institution.  A person under care or custody at the time of      enumeration.  Inmates are persons in such facilities as homes, schools,      hospitals, or wards for the physically or mentally handicapped; persons      in hospitals or wards for mental, tubercular, or chronic diseases;      persons in homes for unmarried mothers; persons in nursing,      convalescent, and rest homes for the aged and dependent; persons in      orphanages; and persons in correctional institutions.  These persons are      enumerated as residents of an institution--regardless of their length of      stay in the particular place and regardless of the number of people in      the places.  Some tabulations include data by major types of      institutions (home for the aged, mental hospital, correctional      institution, and other institutions).       Other persons in group quarters.  Persons living in group quarters who      are not inmates of institutions.  Rooming and boarding houses, communes,      farm and nonfarm workers' dormitories, convents or monasteries, and      other living quarters are classified as ""other"" group quarters if there      are 9 or more persons unrelated to the person listed in column 1 of the      census questionnaire; or if 10 or more unrelated persons share the      unit.  Persons residing in certain other types of living arrangements      are classified as living in ""other"" group quarters regardless of the      number or relationship of people in the unit.  These include persons      residing in military attacks, on ships, in college dormitories, or in      sorority and fraternity houses; patients in general or maternity wards      of hospitals who have no usual residence elsewhere; staff members in      institutional quarters; and persons enumerated in missions, flophouses,      Salvation Army shelters, railroad stations, etc.    H-O   Historical comparability:  In 1970, 6 or more unrelated persons living  together were classified as group quarters; for 1980 that requirement was  raised to 10 or more unrelated persons.   See also:  HOUSEHOLD, PERSONS IN.   HISTORIC AREAS OF OKLAHOMA (EXCLUDING URBANIZED AREAS).  The historic areas  of Oklahoma consist of the former reservations that had legally established  boundaries during the period 1900-1907.  These reservations were dissolved  during the 2- to 3-year period preceding the statehood of Oklahoma in 1907.  The former reservation boundaries are used for planning purposes by tribes  and the Federal government.  In the census, the entire area encompassing the  former reservations was identified (except for parts inside urbanized areas  as approximated in preparation for the 1980 census); individual former  reservations were not identified separately.   The historic areas of Oklahoma (excluding urbanized areas) were assigned a  unique 3-digit code by the Bureau which appears in the reservation code  field.  Enumeration districts (ED's), block groups (BG's), and/or portions  of BG's that comprise the historic areas (excluding urbanized areas) are  designated with an ""A"" in the ED prefix ield in tape files for Oklahoma.   Historical comparability:  Historic areas of Oklahoma (excluding urbanized  areas) were not identified in previous censuses.   HOUSEHOLD, PERSONS IN.  The number of persons living in the housing unit.  All occupants are counted--not just those related to the householder, but  also any lodgers, roomers, boarders, partners, wards, foster children, and  resident employees who share the living quarters.   Figures for ""persons in households"" match those for ""persons in units"" in  tabulations based on complete-count data.  In sample tabulations, they may  differ because of the weighting process.  The phrase ""persons in household""  is used for population tabulations, ""persons in unit"" for housing items.  ""One-person households"" and ""persons living alone"" are synonymous.   See also:  FAMILY.   HOUSING UNIT.  A house, apartment, mobile home or trailer, group of rooms,  or single room occupied as a separate living quarter or, if vacant, intended  for occupancy as a separate living quarter.  Separate living quarters are  those in which the occupants live and eat separately from any other persons  in the building and which have direct access from the outside of the  building or through a common hall.   The occupants may be a single family, one person living alone, two or more  families living together, or any other group of related or unrelated persons  who share living arrangements (except as described in the definition of  Group Quarters, Persons In).  For vacant units, the criteria of separateness  and direct access are applied to the intended occupants whenever possible.  If that information cannot be obtained, the criteria are applied to the  previous occupants.  Both occupied and vacant housing units are included in  the housing inventory, except that recreational vehicles, caves, boats,  tents, railroad cars, and the like are included only if they are occupied as  someone's usual place of residence.  Vacant mobile homes are included  provided they are intended for occupancy on the site where they stand.  Vacant mobile homes on dealers' sales lots, at the factory, or in storage  yards are excluded from the housing inventory.  Housing unit status was  determined on a complete-count basis.   Historical comparability:  The first Census of Housing in 1940 established  the ""dwelling unit"" concept.  Although the term became ""housing unit"" and  the definition has been modified slightly in each succeeding census, the  1980 definition is essentially comparable to previous censuses.  In 1970,  the definition of a housing unit stipulated that the occupants live and eat  separately and have either direct access or complete kitchen facilities.  For 1980, direct access is required; the alternative of complete kitchen  facilities has been dropped.  In 1970, vacant mobile homes were not  counted.  In 1980, vacant mobile homes as included in the housing inventory  if they intended for occupancy where they stand.  Also in 1970, units with  six or more unrelated persons living together were classified as group  quarters; for 1980 that requirement was raised to ten or more unrelated  persons.   See also:  GROUP QUARTERS, PERSONS IN; OCCUPANCY STATUS; TENURE.   LAND AREA.  Land area measurements are calculated to the nearest hundredth  of a square mile for States, counties, county subdivisions with a 1980  census population of 2,500 or more (for the States of Connecticut, Maine,  Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania,  Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin only), county subdivisions with a 1980  census population of less than 2,500 that are within an SMSA (for the States  of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and  Vermont only), and places with a 1980 census population of 2,500 or more.   In contrast to population centroids on MARF 2, only whole-place land area  totals are repeated on all ""part"" records for a place split by higher-level  geography.  The land area field is blank for:  (1) the ""balances"" of county  subdivisions and; (2) on the county subdivision record immediately preceding  the place record for a place of 2,500 or more population that also is  treated as a county subdivision.  The decimal point is shown in the data for  this field.  Figures are right-justified without leading zeros.  The value  for land area in square kilometers can be obtained by multiplying the square  miles figure by 2.59.   MINOR CIVIL DIVISION (MCD).  A primary political and administrative  subdivision of a county.  MCD's are most frequently known as townships, but  in some States they include towns, magisterial districts, and similar  areas.  A few counties have some territory not organized into MCD's; such  ""unorganized territory"" is treated as one or more MCD's for census purposes.   MCD's are used for census purposes in 29 States (see figure 4, column 2).  In 20 of the remaining States, CCD's are used in lieu of MCD's and in  Alaska, census subareas are used.  In the District of Columbia, quandrants  are used.  In Puerto Rico, ciudades, pueblos, and barrios are used.   The Census Bureau has assigned each MCD, alphabetically sequenced within  county, an incremental unique 3-digit numeric code.  In addition, MCD's in  11 States (those noted in column 4 of figure 4) have a 4-digit ""MCD sequence  number"" which allows MCD's to be sorted into alphabetical sequence within a  State.   MCD boundaries are represented on all detailed census maps.  In addition,  MCD outlines appear on small-scale maps published in PC80-1-A and -B and  HC80-1-A reports and in conjunction with the PHC80-2 series.  There are more  than 26,000 MCD's recognized for the 1980 census.   Statistics for all MCD's appear in STF's 1A, 2B, 3A, and 4B, and in PC80-1-A  and -B and HC80-1-A reports.  In 20 States (specified in column 3 of figure  4), many MCD's serve as functioning general-purpose governments, and these  active MCD's are included in PHC80-3 Summary Characteristics for  Governmental Units and Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas.  All MCD's  in block-numbered areas of these States are included in the PHC80-1.  Block   Statistics microfiche series and STF 1B.  Finally, in 11 States (all 9  States in the Northeast region, plus Michigan and Wisconsin), MCD data are  published in a manner parallel to that of places of the same population size  in tables of PC80-1-B and -C and HC80-1-A and -B.  (See figure 4, column 4.)   Historical comparability:  CCD's were used in North Dakota in 1970, but for  1980 that State returned to the use of its townships.  A number of MCD's in  other States have changed boundaries.  Changes have resulted from municipal  annexations, mergers or dissolutions of MCD's, and other causes.  There are  seven States where MCD boundaries have changed substantially:  Arkansas,  Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Nebraska, Virginia, and West Virginia.  MCD's which have changed boundaries between 1970 and 1980 are noted in  footnotes to table 4 of PC80-1-A reports for States with MCD's.   MUNICIPIO.  See PUERTO RICO and OUTLYING AREAS.   OCCUPANCY STATUS.  The classification of all housing units as either  occupied or vacant.  The item was determined on a complete-count basis.       Occupied.  A housing unit occupied as the usual place of residence of a      person or group of persons living in it at the time of enumeration, or      by occupants only temporarily absent such as on vacation.  A household      consists of all the persons who occupy a housing unit as their usual      place of residence.  If all the persons staying in the unit at the time      of enumeration have their usual place of residence elsewhere, the unit      is classified as vacant.  Complete count figures on households and      occupied housing units should match--although sample estimates of      households and occupied units may differ because of weighting.       Vacant.  A housing unit with no one living in it at the time of      enumeration, unless its occupants are only temporarily absent.  If, at      the time of enumeration, the unit is temporarily occupied solely by      persons who have a usual residence elsewhere, it is classified as vacant.   Historical comparability:  Similar data have been collected since 1940.   OTHER RACES.  See RACE.   OWNER-OCCUPIED HOUSING UNITS.  See TENURE.    P-R   PACIFIC ISLANDER POPULATION.  See RACE.   PARISH (IN LOUISIANA).  See COUNTY.   PER CAPITA INCOME.  Per capita income is the mean or average income computed  by aggregating the total income for every man, woman, and child in a  particular population group or geographic area.  It is derived by dividing  the total income by the total population.   Care should be exercised in using and interpreting per capita (mean or  average) values for small geographic areas or population groups.  Since per  capita income amounts are strongly influenced by extreme values in the  distribution, they are especially susceptible to the effects of sampling  variability, misreporting, and processing errors.   PERSONS IN HOUSEHOLD.  See HOUSEHOLD, PERSONS IN.   PLACE.  A concentration of population which may or may not have legally  prescribed limits, powers, or functions.  Most of the places identified in  the 1980 census are incorporated as cities, towns, villages, or boroughs.  In addition, census designated places (called ""unincorporated places"" in  earlier censuses) are delineated for 1980 census tabulations.  There are  about 23,000 places recorded in the 1980 census.  Places do not cross State  boundaries.       Incorporated place.  A political unit incorporated as a city, borough      (excluding Alaska and New York), village, or town (excluding the New      England States, New York, and Wisconsin).  In most States, incorporated      places are subdivisions of the MCD or CCD in which they are located; for      example, a village located within and legally part of a township.  In      some States, incorporated places are independent of surrounding      townships or towns and therefore are also treated as MCD's.  In a few      States, the pattern is mixed.  Almost 4,000 incorporated places cross      MCD/CCD and/or county boundaries.       There are about 20,000 incorporated places recognized in the 1980 census.       Census designated place (CDP).  A densely settled population center      without legally defined corporate limits or corporate powers or      functions.  Each CDP has a definite residential nucleus with a dense,      city-type street pattern, and ideally should have an overall population      density of at least 1,000 persons per square mile.  In addition, a CDP      is a community that can be identified locally by place name.  Boundaries      of CDP's are drawn by the Census Bureau, in cooperation with State and      local agencies, to include, insofar as possible, all the closely settled      area.  In the 1980 census, statistics are tabulated for each CDP with      5,000 inhabitants or more if located in an urbanized area (UA) with a      central city of 50,000 or more and for each CDP of 1,000 inhabitants or      more if in a UA with no central city of 50,000 or more.  Some      CDP's--notably in the Northeast--coincide with MCD's.  In STF's, these      are treated as both places and MCD's, but in printed reports they are      shown only in MCD tables to avoid duplication.  Outside of UA's,      statistics are tabulated in the 48 States and Puerto Rico for CDP's of      1,000 or more, in Hawaii for CDP's of 300 or more, and in Alaska for      CDP's of 25 or more.       There are approximately 3,400 CDP's recognized in the 1980 census.   Incorporated place and CDP boundaries are shown on all detailed census  maps.  For tracted areas, boundaries of all places are shown on census tract  outline maps.  County subdivision maps, at still smaller scale, also show  boundaries for places.   A 4-digit numeric code is assigned by the Census Bureau to each place in  alphabetic sequence within State.  ""Place description"" codes will also  generally accompany place records.  These codes indicate whether or not a  place is incorporated, as well as represent certain other information about  the place.  A 5-digit Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code  is also assigned to each county subdivision (MCD/CCD) and place in the 1980  census (as well as to a variety of non-census areas, such as airports and  parks).   Data are summarized for all places in STF's 1A and 3A and PC80-1-A reports.  For places with 1,000 or more inhabitants, data are summarized in STF 2B,  and PC80-1-B and HC80-1-A reports.  For places with 2,500 or more, data are  summarized in STF 4B, PC80-1-C, and HC80-1-B reports.  In PHC80-3 reports,  data are given for all incorporated places.  In the PHC80-2 Census Tracts  reports and STF's 2A and 4A, summaries are presented only for places with  10,000 or more inhabitants located in tracted areas.  Very detailed data are  presented for all places which are central cities of SMSA's in PC80-1-D  reports, and places with 50,000 or more inhabitants in HC80-2 reports.  STF  5 also provides detailed data for places of 50,000 or more.   The files and reports which sequence geographic units in hierarchial fashion  must account for the fact that places may cross the boundaries of counties,  MCD's, and CCD's.  Such reports and tapes, therefore, provide summaries for  the various parts of places created when places are split by the boundaries  of higher-level areas recognized in the hierarchy.  Specifically, place  parts within county and MCD or CCD are presented in STF's 1A and 3A, and  PC80-1-A.  Place parts within county and MCD are presented for 20 specified  States and Puerto Rico in STF 1B and PHC80-1 Block Statistics microfiche  reports, but the PHC80-1 reports include only places which have data  collected for blocks.  In the remaining 30 States, STF 1B and PHC80-1  reports subdivide places when split by county boundaries, but do not observe  MCD or CCD boundaries.   Historical comparability:  Sixty-eight percent of all incorporated places of  2,500 or more made changes in their boundaries between 1970 and January 1,  1980, which is the reference date for boundaries in the 1980 census.  In the  1970 census, ED boundaries were drawn so as to allow a user to aggregate  1970 data for each city of 2,000 or more inhabitants according to 1960  boundaries.  There will not be a corresponding capability in the 1980 census.   In the 1970 and earlier censuses, CDP's were referred to as ""unincorporated  places.""  The name was changed to make it more explicit that such places are  defined for census purposes, and to avoid confusion in States where many  ""unincorporated places"" are parts of incorporated towns or townships.  Many   CDP's have been redefined since 1970.  Incorporated places which were newly  incorporated or which changed boundaries between 1970 and 1980 are listed in  footnotes to table 4 of PC80-1-A reports.   POPULATION CENTROID.  MARF 2 provides geographic coordinates, expressed in  decimal degrees of latitude and longitude to four decimal places (decimal is  not shown), for the estimated population centroid of each tabulated  enumeration district (ED) and block group (BG).  The figures are  right-justified without leading zeros; directions (north latitude and west  longitude) are not shown.  Where a BG is split by higher-level geography  that appears on published maps--i.e., county subdivision, place, urbanized  area, American Indian reservation and Alaska Native village--coordinate  values are not provided for the entire BG, but only for each split piece.  Separate coordinates are not provided for the portions of a BG split by  congressional district (96th Congress) or American Indian reservation  subreservation area; that is, such BG records are all assigned the same set  of coordinates.   Population centroid coordinates are calculated either by an arithmetic  computer algorithm applied to block boundaries as recorded in digitized  GBF/DIME-Files or, elsewhere, digitized directly from a population centroid  that has been approximated manually.  A centroid must be located within its  ED/BG except where determined via the computer algorithm.  In cases where  there are irreconcilable discrepancies between census maps and census data  files, the coordinates are those of the area to which the population should  have been allocated or, if unpopulated, those of the next higher level of  geography associated with the nonmapped MARF record.   Coordinate values are provided for higher geographic levels (census tracts,  places, county subdivisions, counties, and States) based on weighted  averages of individual component ED and/or BG values.  In cases where all  the components of a higher-level geographic area had a population of zero,  an implied population of one was used in the averaging formula.  As with  BG's, MARF 2 does not provide coordinate values for entire census tracts or  places that are split by higher-level geography, but only for each split  part.  For a place that also serves as a county subdivision, the centroid  values duplicate on the county subdivision record immediately preceding the  place record.  Centroid coordinates are provided for the remainder of county  subdivisions; in some instances, these values will be located within a place  rather than in the ""remainder"" area.   PUERTO RICO AND OUTLYING AREAS.  In addition to the United States, the  decennial census covers Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Trust  Territory of the Pacific Islands (including the Northern Mariana Islands  which were legally part of the Trust Territory in 1980), the Virgin Islands  of the United States, and certain other small islands over which the United  States exercises sovereignty or jurisdiction.  Questionnaire design and the  questions asked were developed for Puerto Rico and each outlying area to  accommodate local conditions.  In the case of some small or  military-occupied islands, enumerations were not conducted; only population  counts obtained from U.S. Government records are published.   The geographic subareas for which statistics are reported vary.  Some of  those noted below are defined in this glossary; others will be defined in  1980 census reports for the areas.       American Samoa:  villages, district subdivisions, districts, and islands.       Guam:  census designated places and election districts.       Puerto Rico:  blocks; ED's and BG's; census tracts and block numbering      areas; zonas urbanas and aldeas; subbarrios; barrios, ciudades, and      pueblos; municipios; and SMSA's and SCSA's.       Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (including the Northern Mariana      Islands):  census designated places, municipal districts, municipalities      and islands, and administrative districts.       Virgin Islands:  places, census subdistricts, and islands.       Other islands:  no subdivisions.   Data for Puerto Rico and its subdivisions will appear in reports and tapes  in generally the same pattern as for States and their subdivisions.  Data  for outlying areas will appear in 1980 Census of Population, Volume 1, and  1980 Census of Housing, Volume 1, reports, and on STF's 1 and 3.   Historical comparability:  The Canal Zone was not included in the 1980  census because it was no longer under U.S. jurisdiction.   Race, all persons were asked to identify themselves according to the  following race categories on the 1980 questionnaire:  White, Black or Negro,  American Indian, Eskimo, Aleut, Japanese, Chinese, Filipino, Korean, Asian  Indian, Vietnamese, Hawaiian, Guamanian, Samoan, and other.  The ""other""  category includes Malayan, Polynesian, Thai, and other groups not included  in the specific categories listed on the questionnaire.  This item was asked  on a complete-count basis.   The concept of race as used by the Census Bureau reflects  self-identification by respondents; it does not denote any clear-cut  scientific definition of biological stock.  Since the 1980 census obtained  information on race through self-identification, the data represent  self-classification by people according to the race with which they identify  themselves.  For persons with parents of different races who could not  provide a single response to the race question, the race of the person's  mother was used; however, if a single response could not be provided for the  person's mother, the first race reported by the person was used.   Edit and review operations were performed during the complete-count  tabulations; write-in responses were reviewed in an attempt to classify  entries in specific categories, where appropriate.  For instance, if the   ""Other"" circle was marked with a write-in entry ""Caucasian,"" then the  response recoded as White.  (Additional examples are noted below.)  However,  all such cases were not specified in the complete-count processing.  During  the processing of sample questionnaires, a more thorough review and  additional editing was done to resolve inconsistent or incomplete  responses.  Also, during the processing of sample questionnaires, write-in  entries for the ""Other"" category were assigned specific codes, which were  included on the person's basic record in the census detailed tape files.   Asian and Pacific Islander write-in entries, such as Indo-Chinese,  Cambodian, or Polynesian, included in the ""Other"" category during  100-percent processing, are collectively tabulated and shown as ""Other Asian  and Pacific Islander"" in the census sample tabulations; this group, ""Other  Asian and Pacific Islander,"" will be included in the broader Asian and  Pacific Islander category in all sample tabulations by race.  This shift of  ""Other Asian and Pacific Islander"" entries out of the ""Other races"" category  in sample tabulations and the recoding of write-in entries in the ""Other""  category to specific categories where appropriate will affect the  comparability between complete-count and sample data for some groups in  certain geographic areas.       White.  Persons who indicated their race as White, as well as persons      who did not classify themselves in one of the specific race categories      listed on the questionnaire but entered a response such as Canadian,      German, Italian, Lebanese, or Polish.  (Persons who did not classify      themselves in one of the specific race categories but wrote in entries      such as Cuban, Puerto Rican, Mexican, or Dominican were included in the      ""Other races"" category; in the 1970 census most of these persons were      included in the ""White"" category.)       Black.  Persons who indicated their race as Black or Negro, as well as      persons who did not classify themselves in one of the specific race      categories, but reported entries such as Black Puerto Rican, Hatian,      Jamaican, Nigerian, or West Indian.       American Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut:            American Indian.  Persons who indicated their race as ""Indian           (American)"" or who did not indicate a specific race category but           reported the name of an Indian tribe.            Eskimo.  Persons who indicated their race as ""Eskimo.""            Aleut.  Persons who indicated their race as ""Aleut.""       Asian and Pacific Islander:  In complete-count tabulations, includes all      of the groups listed below except ""Other Asian and Pacific Islander.""      In sample tabulations, it includes all of the groups listed below.            Japanese.  Persons who indicated their race as Japanese, as well as           persons who did not classify themselves in one of the specific race           categories, but entered a response such as Nipponese or Japanese           American.            Chinese.  Persons who indicated their race as Chinese, as well as           persons who did not classify themselves in one of the specific race           categories, but reported entries such as Cantonese, Formosan,           Taiwanese, or Tibetan.            Filipino.  Persons who indicated their race as Filipino, as well as           persons who did not classify themselves in one of the specific race           categories, but entered a response such as Filipino American or           Philippine.            Korean.  Persons who indicated their race as Korean, as well as           persons who did not classify themselves in one of the specific race           categories, but reported a response such as Korean American.            Asian Indian.Persons who indicated their race as Asian Indian, as           well as persons who did not classify themselves in one of the           specific race categories, but reported entries such as Bengali,           Bharati, Dravidian, East Indian, Goanese, Hindu Indic, Kashmiri, or           South Asian.            Vietnamese.  Persons who indicated their race as Vietnamese, as           well as persons who did not classify themselves in one of the           specific race categories, but reported a response such as Vietnam.            Hawaiian.  Persons who indicated their race as Hawaiian.  In the           State of Hawaii, all persons who reported ""Part-Hawaiian"" were           included in this category.            Guamanian.  Persons who indicated their race as Guamanian, as well           as persons who did not classify themselves in one of the specific           race categories, but reported an entry such as Chamorro or Guam.            Samoan.  Persons who indicated their race as Samoan, as well as           persons who did not classify themselves in one of the specific race           categories, but entered a response such as American Samoan or           Western Samoan.            Other Asian and Pacific Islander.  In sample tabulations only,           persons who reported Cambodian, Hmong, Indo-Chinese, Laotian,           Pakistani, Polynesian, Fiji Islander, Tahitian, Thai, or similar           responses.  Census basic records include codes for over 50 separate           groups within this category.  In complete-count tabulations, this           group is part of the ""Other races"" category described below.            Other (Race n.e.c. ""not elsewhere classified"").  Includes all other           races (except ""Other Asian and Pacific Islander"" groups) which were           not included in the specific categories listed on the           questionnaire.  For example, persons reporting in the ""Other"" race           category and providing write-in entries such as Eurasian,           Cosmopolitan, Inter-racial, or a Spanish origin group (e.g.,           Mexican, Cuban, or Puerto Rican) were included in Race, n.e.c.           (NOTE-  These groups were also included in the ""Other"" race           category in complete count tabulations.  However, other Asian and           Pacific Islander groups are included in the ""Other"" category in           100-percent tabulations only.)  STF 3, STF 4, and public-use           microdata samples separately identify, as a subcategory within           ""Race, n.e.c.,"" persons who wrote in an entry implying Spanish           origin.  Such entries are not necessarily consistent with responses           in the Spanish origin question.            In a few tables in which data for American Indian, Eskimo, Aleut,           and Asian and Pacific Islander are not presented separately, the           ""Other"" category encompasses all race categories not shown           separately.            In some tabulations, the ""other"" or ""Race, n.e.c."" category is           omitted to save space; data for this category are derivable by           subtracting the sum of the specified race categories from the total.   On certain printed tables, where space is limited, data for persons of  Spanish Origin are presented alongside data for up to four major race  groups.  In such situations, users should not be misled by the proximity of  these two types of data.  Spanish origin is not a race category, and persons  of Spanish origin may be of any race.  Tabulations in a number of sources  present data separately for race categories (.e.g, White, Black, and  ""Other"") for persons not of Spanish origin.  In addition, the number of  Spanish-origin persons is given by race.   Limitations:  In previous censuses, undercoverage of the population has been  associated with race.  The 1970 census missed Blacks at a much higher rate  than Whites.  The Bureau has not prepared undercoverage rates for races  other than White or Black, because vital records and other sources of  relevant statistics do not consistently distinguish among other races.   Historical comparability:  Questions on ""race"" or ""color"" have been asked in  each census since 1970.  In 1970, when persons with parents of different  races were in doubt as to their classification, the race of the father was  used.  In 1980, the race of the mother was used for persons who could not  provide a single response.  The 1970 category ""Negro or Black"" has been  retitled ""Black or Negro.""  Individual categories for Vietnamese, Asian  Indian, Guamanian, and Samoan were added.  In 1970, the categories Eskimo  and Aleut appeared only on questionnaires used in Alaska; they were replaced  by Hawaiian and Korean in all other States.  In 1980, all four categories  appeared on the questionnaire.  As a result of the additions, the 1980  questionnaire had 14 specific race categories instead of 8 as in 1970.   In 1970, persons who did not report a specific race but wrote in Hispanic  categories such as ""Mexican,"" ""Puerto Rican,"" or ""Cuban"" in the race  question were assigned to White; for 1980 these persons remain in the ""Other  races"" category.   See also:  SPANISH ORIGIN.   REGION (CENSUS GEOGRAPHIC).  A large group of States which is a first-order  subdivision of the United States for census purposes.  The four  regions--Northeast, North Central, South, and West--are delineated in figure  5.  Regions are identified by a 1-digit code.  Statistics for them appear in  U.S. Summary reports in almost every publication series, and in STF's 1C,  2C, 3C, 4C, and 5C.  The census regions have no relationship to the 10  Standard Federal Administrative Regions.    S-Z   SPANISH ORIGIN.  Determined by a complete-count question which asks  respondents to self-identify whether they are of Spanish origin or descent.  If, when interviewed, the person reported a multiple origin and could not  provide a single origin, the origin of the person's mother was used.  If a  single response was not provided for the person's mother, the first reported  origin of the person was used.   Persons marking any one of the four ""Spanish"" categories, i.e., Mexican,  Puerto Rican, Cuban, or other Spanish, are collectively referred to as  ""Persons of Spanish origin.""   In certain tabulations, persons of Spanish origin are further classified by  type:       Mexican.  Persons who indicated ""Mexican,  Mexican-American, Chicano,""      or wrote in an entry such as ""La Raza.""       Puerto Rican.  Persons who indicated ""Puerto Rican"" or wrote in an entry      such as Boricua.""       Cuban.  Persons who indicated ""Cuban.""       Other Spanish.  Persons who filled the circle for ""other      Spanish/Hispanic;"" or persons who wrote in an origin or descent      associated with Spain, the Dominican Republic, or any Central or South      America country except Brazil or a nonspecific Spanish group such as      ""Spanish surnamed"" or ""Spanish speaking.""   Preliminary evaluations of 1980 census data suggest some limited  misreporting of Spanish origin.  Available evidence indicates that the  misreporting may have occurred only in selected areas with relatively small  Spanish-origin populations, such as in some Southern States, but it is not  apparent in those areas with the largest concentrations of Spanish-origin  persons.  For a fuller discussion of the reporting in the Spanish-origin  item, see the 1980 census Supplementary Report, ""Persons of Spanish Origin  by State:  1980"" (PC80-S1-7).   Historical comparability:  The Spanish-origin question was asked on a  100-percent basis for the first time in 1980.  A similar question was asked  on the 1970 5-percent sample questionnaire.  For 1980, the category ""no, not  Spanish/Hispanic"" appeared first (the corresponding category appeared last  in 1970).  Also, the terms ""Mexican-American"" and ""Chicano"" are added to the  term ""Mexican.""  The category Central or South American,"" included in 1970,  has been dropped.   Although a question on Spanish origin was included in 1970, it was not the  major identifier used to classify the Hispanic population in the 1970 census  as it is in 1980.  Depending on the section of the country, 1970 census data  for ""Persons of Spanish Heritage"" were variously defined as ""Persons of  Puerto Rican Birth or Parentage"" (in New York, New Jersey, and  Pennsylvania); as ""Persons of Spanish Language or Spanish Surname"" (in  Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas); and as ""Persons of  Spanish Language"" (in the remaining 42 States and the District of  Columbia).  ""Spanish Language"" referred to those persons who in 1970  reported Spanish as their mother tongue, as well as persons in families in  which the household head or spouse reported Spanish as his or her mother  tongue.   STANDARD CONSOLIDATED STATISTICAL AREA (SCSA).  A large concentration of  metropolitan population composed of two or more contiguous standard  metropolitan statistical areas (SMSA's) which together meet certain criteria  of population size, urban character, social and economic integration, and/or  contiguity of urbanized areas.  Each SCSA must have a population of one  million or more.  Thirteen SCSA's were in existence at the time of the 1980  census.  They were defined by the Office of Management and Budget According  to criteria published by that office in Standard Metropolitan Statistical  Areas:  1975.  Four additional SCSA's have been defined based on 1980 census  results.  Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas:  1975.  Four additional  SCSA's have been defined based on 1980 census results.   SCSA's are identified by a 2-digit numeric code.  Summaries for SCSA's  appear in many reports and in STF's 1C, 2C, 3C, 4C, and 5C.  Summaries are  generally provided for SCSA totals and for within-State parts of SCSA's.   Historical comparability:  The original 13 SCSA's were designated in 1975.  For the 1960 and 1970 censuses, the Census Bureau recognized two ""Standard  Consolidated Areas"" (SCA's), which encompassed metropolitan complexes around  New York and Chicago.   In 1983, the SCSA concept will be replaced by the new Consolidated  Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA) concept, with somewhat more flexible  criteria, as spelled out in the Federal Register, January 3, 1980.  These  changes will not affect publication of the 1980 census data for SCSA's.   STANDARD METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREA (SMSA).  A large population nucleus  and nearby communities which have a high degree of economic and social  integration with that nucleus.  Each SMSA consists of one or more entire  counties (or county equivalents) that meet specified standards pertaining to  population, commuting ties, and metropolitan character.  In New England,  towns and cities, rather than counties, are the basic units and should be  substituted for ""counties"" where counties are cited below.  SMSA's are  designated by the Office of Management and Budget.   Data products from the 1980 census will report on 323 SMSA's:  (1) 287  defined before January 1, 1980 (including 4 in Puerto Rico); and (2) an  additional 36 (including one in Puerto Rico) established as a result of 1980  census population counts.  The 36 new SMSA's were designated when 1980  counts showed that they met one or both of the following criteria:       1.  Included a city with a population of at least 50,000 within its          corporate limits, or       2.  Included a Census Bureau-defined urbanized area (which must have a          population of at least 50,000) and a total SMSA population of at          least 100,000 (or, in New England, 75,000).   An SMSA includes a city and, generally, its entire UA and the remainder of  the county or counties in which the UA is located.  An SMSA also includes  such additional outlying counties which meet specified criteria relating to  metropolitan character and level of commuting of workers into the central  city or counties.  Specific criteria governing the definition of SMSA's  recognized before 1980 are published in Standard Metropolitan Statistical  Areas:  1975, issued by the Office of Management and Budget.   With two exceptions, each SMSA has one or more central cities, up to a  maximum of three, and the names of these cities comprise the title, and of  the SMSA.  The Nassau-Suffolk, NY SMSA has no central city, and the title of  the Northeast Pennsylvania SMSA does not contain the names of and three  central cities:  Scranton, Wilkes-Barre, and Hazleton.   SMSA's are identified by a FIPS 4-digit numeric code, which follows the  alphabetic sequence of SMSA names.  SMSA's are outlined on small-scale maps  in several 1980 report series.  SMSA data appear in most 1980 census  publications and summary tape files.  Many SMSA's cross State boundaries,  and reports in several series provide summaries for the State parts of  multi-State SMSA's, as well as SMSA totals.  Summary tape files present data  only for State parts of SMSA's, except for the ""national"" files:  STF's 1C,  2C, 3C, and 4C.   Historical comparability:  A comparison of 1970 and 1980 census products  reveals two types of changes in metropolitan territory.  First, 69 new  SMSA's were created from previously nonmetropolitan territory:  36 were  defined in 1981 based on 1980 population counts and 33 were defined between   1973 and 1979 based on current population estimates.  (An additional  SMSA--Rapid City, SD--was provisionally recognized based on population  estimates, but it did not qualify according to 1980 census data.)   The second component of change to metropolitan territory between 1970 and  1980 was the redefinition of many of the SMSA's which were recognized in  1970 census tabulations.  Of the 247 1970 SMSA's, 101 were redefined in 1973  based on 1970 census commuting data, most by the addition of one or more  counties (or towns and cities in New England).  In addition, one SMSA was  redefined by the addition of one area and the deletion of another (Wichita  Falls, Texas), one was subdivided (Nassau-Suffolk SMSA was created from a  part of the New York SMSA), four pairs of SMSA's were combined into single  SMSA's (for example, Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas), and four SMSA's lost area  that was added to other SMSA's.  In addition, the names of several SMSA's  were changed in 1973, one in such a way that the SMSA code also changed (San  Bernardino-Riverside-Ontario to Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario,  California).   Since SMSA's are always defined in terms of whole counties (towns or cities  in New England) for which extensive data are available, users can usually  compile figures for comparisons over time.   In 1983, SMSA boundaries will be re-evaluated using 1980 census data on  commuting, labor force, population density, type of residence, and  population growth, according to new criteria spelled out in the Federal  Register, January 3, 1980 (vol. 45, no. 2, pt. VI).  At that ime, new  outlying counties may be added or existing ones deleted, some area titles  will be changed, some new central cities will be designated, some areas may  be consolidated, and a few new SMSA's may be created.  Further, the term  ""standard metropolitan statistical area"" will be shortened to ""metropolitan  statistical area"" (MSA).  These changes will not affect publication of 1980  census data for SMSA's.   STATE.  The major political unit of the United States.  The District of  Columbia is treated as a State-equivalent in all 1980 census data series.  Puerto Rico is also, except that it does not appear in the P.L. 94-171  population counts file.  American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, the  remainder of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and the U.S. Virgin  Islands are treated as State equivalents for the presentation of data from  1980 census volume 1 reports, but data for these areas will be available on  computer tape only on STF's 1 and 3.  States are identified by a 2-digit  FIPS code which follows the alphabetic sequence of State names (including  the District of Columbia), and by a 2-digit census geographic State code,  the first digit of which identifies the census division of which the State  is a part.  Puerto Rico and the outlying areas have FIPS codes numerally  following the State codes.   Historical comparability:  There have been no significant changes to State  boundaries in the last decade.  Data for the Northern Mariana Islands are  reported separately from the remainder of the Trust Territory for the 1980  census.   See also:  PUERTO RICO AND OUTLYING AREAS.   STATE ECONOMIC AREA (SEA).  A single county or group of counties within a  State, which is relatively homogeneous with respect to economic and social  characteristics.  The grouping of the 3,103 counties or county equivalents  in 1950 into SEA's was the product of a special study prepared by the Bureau  of the Census in cooperation with the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and  several State and private agencies.  Boundaries were drawn in such a manner  that each economic area had certain significant characteristics which  distinguished it from adjoining areas.  There are 510 SEA's.   SEA's are identified in census tabulations on computer tape by a 2-digit  numeric code or a 1-digit alphabetic code, assigned sequentially within the  State; however, no 1980 data are tabulated for SEA's.   Historical comparability:  SEA boundaries have remained largely unchanged  since they were defined in 1950.  In 1950, 501 areas were defined; in 1960,  509; and in 1970, 510.   See also:  ECONOMIC SUBREGION (ESR).   TENURE.  The classification of all occupied units as either owner-occupied  or renter-occupied.  This item was asked on a complete-count basis.       Owner-occupied.  A housing unit is ""owner occupied"" if the owner or      co-owner lives in the unit even if the unit is mortgaged or not fully      paid for.       Renter-occupied.  All occupied housing units which are not      owner-occupied, regardless of whether or not cash rent is paid by a      member of the household.  (""No cash rent"" units, a subcategory of      renter-occupied, are separately identified in rent tabulations.  Such      units are generally provided free by friends or relatives, or in      exchange for the services of, for example, a caretaker, minister, tenant      farmer, or sharecropper.)   Historical comparability:  Tenure has been collected since 1890.  In 1970,  the question on tenure also included a category for condominium and  cooperative ownership.  In 1980, condominiums are identified in a separate  question.   TOWN/TOWNSHIP.  See MINOR CIVIL DIVISION.   TRACT.  See CENSUS TRACT.   UNITED STATES.  This designation includes the 50 States and the District of  Columbia.  STF's and most report series (usually in a separate U.S. Summary  report) provide data summarized for the United States.   URBAN AND RURAL (POPULATION).  Urban and rural are type-of-area concepts  rather than specific areas outlined on maps.  As defined by the Census  Bureau, the urban population comprises all persons living in urbanized areas  (UA's) and in places of 2,500 or more inhabitants outside UA's.   The rural population consists of everyone else.  Therefore, a rural  classification need not imply farm residence or a sparsely settled area,  since a small city or town is rural as long as it is outside a UA and has  fewer than 2,500 inhabitants.   The terms urban and rural are independent of metropolitan and  nonmetropolitan designations; both urban and rural areas occur inside and  outside SMSA's.   Historical comparability:  Except for the minor relaxation of UA criteria  discussed below, urban and rural definitions have been consistent since  1950.  Within small counties, measurements of urban and rural populations  over time may be significantly affected by the increase or decrease of a  place's population across the 2,500 population threshold, e.g., the increase  of 1 person to a place of 2,499 results in an increase of 2,500 to the  county's urban population.   URBAN FRINGE.  See URBANIZED AREA.   URBANIZED AREA (UA).  A population concentration of at least 50,000  inhabitants, generally consisting of a central city and the surrounding,  closely settled, contiguous territory (suburbs).   The UA criteria define a boundary based primarily on a population density of  at least 1,000 persons per square mile, but also include some less densely  settled areas within corporate limits, and such areas as industrial parks  and railroad yards, if they are within areas of dense urban development.  The density level of 1,000 persons per square mile corresponds approximately  to the continuously built-up area around a city.  The ""urban fringe"" is that  part of the UA outside of a central city.   Typically, an entire UA is included within an SMSA.  The SMSA is usually  much larger in terms of territory covered and includes territory where the  population density is less than 1,000.  Occasionally, more than one UA is  located within an SMSA.  In some cases a small part of a UA may extend  beyond an SMSA boundary and possibly into an adjacent SMSA.  A few 1980 UA's  will be defined in areas which do not meet the criteria for SMSA  designation.  UA's may cross State boundaries.  In a few cases, a UA does  not include all of an ""extended"" city, that is, a city which is determined  to have a significant amount of rural territory.   UA's are identified by 4-digit codes, which follow the alphabetic sequence  of all UA names.  When a UA has the same name as an SMSA, the UA code is the  same as the SMSA code.  UA boundaries are shown on final MMS/VMS maps, and  at much smaller scale on UA outline maps in PC80-1-A and HC80-1-A reports.   Historical comparability:  Because UA's are defined on the basis of  population distribution at the time of a decennial census, their boundaries  tend to change following each census to include expanding urban development.   The criteria have been fairly constant since 1950, although in each decade  some new refinements have been added.  For the 1970 census, in which 252  UA's were recognized, it was necessary for the central city to have a  population of 50,000 or more, or for there to be ""twin cities"" with a  combined population of 50,000 and with the smaller city having at least  15,000.  In 1974, the criteria were liberalized to allow UA recognition to  certain cities between 25,000 and 50,000, and this resulted in 27 new  urbanized areas.  For 1980, no minimum population size is required for a  central city.   WARD.  Political subdivision of a city used for voting and representation  purposes.  For 1980, in approximately 900 places of 10,000 inhabitants or  more and approximately 300 nonblock-numbered places, ward boundaries were  observed in the definition of enumeration districts (ED's).  For these  areas, users may prepare ward data by summarizing ED data.  In areas with  block statistics, users may prepare ward data by summarizing block data.   Historical comparability:  Population counts for wards in places with a  population of 10,000 or more appeared in Supplementary Reports, PC-S1, in  1960 and 1970.   WHITE POPULATION.  See RACE.

Want a profile of potential customers in your neighborhood?  Answers to these and other questions can be found by using the data compiled by the 2000 Census - if you know how and where to look.                   Two public workshops on ""Using Census 2000 Data for Your Individual Needs"" are being offered on Oahu in March that are designed to help maximize the new Census 2000 data.                     ""These workshops will be especially valuable for those needing information on small areas of the state,"" said DBEDT Director Seiji Naya.  ""We now have a wide range of data available for Hawaii's many ethnic groups down to the census block level.""                   The workshops will highlight the uses of census data for                                      Business site locations and marketing;                  Funding proposals;                  Analyzing neighborhoods for social service delivery and planning;                  Studying communities for needs assessment.                                  Comprehensive ethnic data are also available for small areas of the state.  For instance, through the census you can find such detailed information as the number of:                                      Male and female Native Hawaiians in Nanakuli;                  Single-parent Japanese families in Hilo;                           Korean children in the 96813 zip code area;           Filipino homeowners in the Puhi-Hanamaulu area; and much more.                                  The census workshops will present an in-depth look at data from Summary File 1, which contains such characteristics as household relationship, sex, age, race, Hispanic origin, tenure, and vacancy characteristics for all households in your geographical area of interest.  The workshops will also look at newly released data from Summary File 2 for Hawaii, which provides the same type of characteristics as Summary File 1 but by detailed race groups such as Native Hawaiian, Japanese, Samoans, Filipinos, Koreans and other groups down to block levels.                    Data access through the Internet will also be emphasized in these sessions.  The Internet is the primary method being used by the Census Bureau to distribute its Census 2000 data.  Users are now able to extract the data they need through their office or home computers using a menu-driven system on the Census Bureau Internet site.  Only 10 percent of the Census 2000 data will be published in hard-copy form, so learning to access data on the Internet is critical.                   The agenda will include:                                      Basic census terminology and Hawaii census geography;                  Description and applications of the Summary File 1 & 2 data;                  Obtaining information for your own needs - generating small area profiles, finding state rankings, locating computer maps;                  Demonstration of the Census Bureau's Internet site and other sites containing Census 2000 data;                  Preview of the social and economic data to be released later this year;                  Schedule of Census 2000 products to be released; and                  Local sources of Census 2000 data.                                  Social and economic data for Hawaii from the Census 2000 are not yet available, but will be released later this year.  Workshop participants will learn about the type of data that will be forthcoming  (i.e., income, language spoken at home, educational attainment, occupation), the level of geography for the data, what format the data will be released in, timetable, and other information.                   The workshop presenter will be Mr. Jerry Wong, Information Specialist with the L.A. Regional Office of the Census Bureau.  Mr. Wong has been with the Census Bureau for 23 years and has worked on three decennial censuses.  He has extensive experience working with and educating community groups, businesses, elected officials and the media of the demographic and economic uses of census data.                   The workshops are being co-sponsored by DBEDT's Hawaii State Data Center, the Hawaii Small Business Development Center, and the Los Angeles Regional Office of the U.S. Census Bureau.

GX237-20-6381544	"BUREA U OF THE CENSUS  Bureau of the Census Mission Statement To be the preeminent collector and provider of timely, relevant, and quality data about the people and economy of the United States.  T  he Bureau of the Census's mission is built around its large-scale surveys and censuses. This involves the full range of activities required to produce data, including survey and questionnaire design and data collection, processing, and dissemination. Research and data analysis will directly support the Census Bureau's capabilities to conduct large-scale surveys and censuses. Through strategic planning, the Census Bureau evaluates how best to accomplish this mission. The strategic plan provides a framework for articulating program goals and builds these goals through consensus. The planning process promotes synergy, innovation, and eff iciency, and represents a better way of doing business. The goal of the Census Bureau is to provide the best mix of timeliness, relevancy, quality, and cost for the data collected and services provided. The data provided by the Census Bureau shape important policy decisions that help improve our nation's social and economic conditions: Census data are used to distribute hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funding. Census data provide the basis for estimating the gross domestic product and leading economic indicators. Census data determine the apportionment of Congressional seats, as mandated in the Constitution. Census data inform about education, income, poverty, and health insurance coverage. National, state, and local governments use Census data to formulate policy. Large cor porations and local businesses use Census data to devise their business plans. To accomplish its mission, the Census Bureau depends on actions that: Provide the U.S.'s off icial measures on monthly unemployment, income, poverty, and health insurance coverage, as well as economic indicators that include housing starts, retail and wholesale trade sales, international trade, manufacturers' shipments, orders, and inventories, and quarterly estimates of cor porate prof its. Provide the statistical foundation and benchmark measures against which most data-based decisions and activities take place. Reengineer the 2010 Decennial Census of Population and Housing to be more eff icient and cost-effective, provide richer and more timely data, and reduce risk in meeting constitutional and legislative mandates.  FY  2002  PERFORMANCE  REPORT  119   BUREA U OF THE CENSUS  Invest in statistical methodological research and new technologies to improve cur rent operations and prepare for the future. Continue to provide strict security of census information, address privacy issues, and foster program goals while maintaining conf identiality of census information.  Priorities/Management Challenges To deliver high value, the Bureau must target measurement on those trends and segments of our population and economy most critical to continued U.S. success and prosperity. During FY 2002, the Census Bureau focused activities in these areas through a variety of priority program efforts that continue and improve ongoing statistical programs. They included distributing Census 2000 data, planning the 2010 Census, obtaining cyclical economic data through the Economic Censuses and the Census of Governments, and completing data collection for the 2001 American Community Survey (ACS). Greater resistance to authority, continued decline in trust of government, and a greater demand for quality have complicated the Census Bureau's data gathering efforts and ability to maintain or increase response rates. The Bureau will have to continually demonstrate its expertise in educating the public on the quality and security of its data, and its ongoing sensitivity to anonymity and privacy issues. Surveys have shown that more people feel they have less time available to do what they need to do, including work, sleep, look after their families, and enjoy leisure. The Census Bureau will consider new approaches to saving customers' time and reduce respondent burden to ensure that the customers' needs are met. The Census Bureau will continue environments. The Bureau must use and timely information on emerging of criminal and/or malicious access to improve the use of technology in data collection, processing, and dissemination state-of-the-art technology to stay ahead of the demand from policy makers for accurate economic and societal trends. As always, the Census Bureau will mitigate the possibility to all of its networks and data.  The Census Bureau's mission is ""to be the preeminent collector and provider of timely, relevant, and quality data about the people and economy of the United States. "" This mission has and will continue to be the Bureau's focus as the environment in which it works changes. FY 2002 Performance In FY 2002, the Census Bureau had three goals and seven measures. Of those seven measures, the Bureau met all of them. The performance measures focused on providing and improving cur rent measures of the U.S. population, economy, and governments; timely release of Decennial Census products; and the implementation of the 2010 Decennial Census. Census Bureau performance in FY 2002 included meeting the target for the percentage completion of its housing unit address list. Having a complete housing unit address list is critical for conducting an accurate 2010 Decennial Census. The Bureau has also successfully released 2001 data from the long form transitional database, which is important for the implementation of the ACS. The Census Bureau successfully met all the measures associated with the goals in the FY 2002 Annual Performance Plan.  120  FY  2002  PERFORMANCE  REPORT   BUREA U OF THE CENSUS  Targets and Performance Summary See individual Performance Goal section for further description of each measure.

(This goal has been reworded since the publication of the FY 2000 Annual Program Performance Report (APPR) and FY 2002 Annual Performance Plan (APP). This goal was previously worded as:""Develop relevant, accurate and timely, national and community economic and household statistics for decision-making"")  Corresponding Strategic Goal Strategic Goal 1: Provide the information and the framework to enable the economy to operate eff iciently and equitably.  Rationale for Performance Goal Demographic Statistics: The Census Bureau's demographic statistics program staff is responsible for developing plans and programs to collect, process, and disseminate information from surveys and censuses on the population and its characteristics, and on the size and characteristics of the housing inventory. The Bureau undertakes analytical research on emerging issues and trends, such as the condition of children and the elderly, the employment of disabled individuals, and the characteristics of immigrants. Directing and coordinating technical and developmental work on the collection and analysis of data by race, Hispanic origin, and ancestry are major responsibilities. This work results in reports on the characteristics of special population groups and on American Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Village areas. An important aspect is examining reporting issues, such as er ror or bias in these data. Off icial statistics on income, poverty, and health insurance coverage, as well as longitudinal data on income and program participation that federal agencies use to develop, modify, and monitor income transfer programs, come from demographic programs. Especially important are data necessary to determine the impact of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, often called welfare reform. Demographic program staffers conduct much of the foundational analysis and research underlying the U.S. Off ice of Management and Budget's (OMB's) decisions on national statistical standards on topics such as occupational classif ications, metropolitan areas, and race and ethnicity. The demographic programs also plan and conduct surveys and special censuses, funded by other federal agencies that focus on topics of national importance, such as unemployment, crime, health, education, and consumer expenditures.  FY  2002  PERFORMANCE  REPORT  125   BUREA U OF THE CENSUS  Economic Statistics: The Bureau's economic statistics program staff is responsible for statistical programs that count and prof ile U.S. businesses and government organizations in a rapidly evolving economic environment. This includes conducting Economic Censuses and a Census of Governments every f ive years; car rying out more than 100 separate surveys monthly, quarterly, and annually, including principal economic indicators; producing voluminous merchandise export and import statistics monthly; accomplishing extensive compilations of administrative records; and undertaking numerous research and technical studies. In addition, economic statistics program staffers conduct a number of surveys under reimbursable agreements with other federal agencies such as the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the National Center for Education Statistics, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, the Federal Reserve Board, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The major activities of the economic statistics programs include: Providing statistics that are critical to understanding cur rent conditions in the U.S. economy, including principal federal economic indicators Producing economic statistics that provide seventy-f ive percent of the source data used in preparing gross domestic product estimates, one of the nation's most important barometers of cur rent economic activity Providing information on the labor, capital, and material inputs to, as well as the outputs of, the nation's manufacturing, mining, and construction industries Conducting company-based surveys for the collection of f inancial data, including data on capital investment, income, payroll, assets, and expenditures Collecting, processing, and compiling statistical data relating to U.S. merchandise trade (exports, imports, and transportation) with foreign countries and Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands; detailed trade information is available on both a monthly and annual basis for 17,000 import commodities and 10,000 export commodities Conducting annual sample surveys of state and local government f inances and employment and producing quarterly measures of taxes and government assets Conducting surveys for other government agencies related to federal, state, and local government activities Undertaking reimbursable activities (surveys and special tabulations) that take advantage of the economic program's processing infrastructure and core competencies. FY 2002 Performance The FY 2002 performance levels for all measures were achieved. In collaboration with business and government entities, the focus of activity for FY 2002 was the development of collection instruments. Specif ic activities included the printing of millions of report forms and the development of processing systems. The Census Bureau also developed an electronic reporting infrastructure to allow the option of electronic reporting of 3.5 million businesses and established a 24/7 Internet site to provide assistance to 2002 Economic Census respondents.  126  FY  2002  PERFORMANCE  REPORT   BUREA U OF THE CENSUS  During FY 2002, the Census Bureau's demographic statistics program staff successfully developed and implemented plans and programs to collect, process, and disseminate information from surveys and censuses on the population and its characteristics, and on the size and characteristics of the housing inventory. The 2001 data products for the thirty-one test sites for the American Community Survey (ACS) and the 2001 Supplementary Survey were published. Other surveys which measured housing characteristics, such as home ownership, income, poverty, family composition, and the socioeconomic characteristics of race and ethnic groups were successfully completed.

These measurements consist of a series of statistical measurements that def ine the precision of a survey--e.g., standard er ror, coeff icient of variation, and sample design effect. The customer and the Census Bureau jointly determine reliability specif ications before the survey is commissioned. FY 2002 Performance The FY 2002 performance level for this measure was achieved. Reliability measurements are fundamental to the success and customer acceptance of Census Bureau survey information. We maintain these reliability measures as the surveys are conducted and their results are released  Measure 1b: 1) Household Response Rate for the Current Population Survey, the National Crime Victimization Survey, and the American Housing Survey. 2) Response Rate for the National Health Interview Survey. 3) Household Response Rate for the Survey of Income and Program Participation FY 1999 Target1 Actual Met/Not Met 100% 100% Met  FY 2000 100% 100% Met  FY 2001 100% 100% Met  FY 2002 100% 100% Met  (This measure has been reworded since the publication of the FY 2000 Annual Program Performance Report (APPR) and FY 2002 Annual Performance Plan (APP). This measure was previously worded as: ""Percentage of household surveys with initial response rates > 90%."") 1  See italicized statement above regarding rewording of the measure and recharacterization of the associated targets. The Bureau met 100% of the stated target of obtaining response rates better than 90%. For FY2002, this measure included response rates for the Current Population Survey, the National Crime Victimization Survey, the American Housing Survey, and the American Community Survey.  FY  2002  PERFORMANCE  REPORT  127   BUREA U OF THE CENSUS  Explanation of Measure Maintaining a high response rate for household surveys ensures that the Bureau's survey information is always reliable, comparable, and widely accepted by customers over the longer term. Since the sample design, interview content, length, and respondent rules vary by survey and are cor related with response rates, our target measures are different: (1) The Cur rent Population Survey (CPS), the National Crime Victimization Survey, and the American Housing Survey, can maintain a ninety percent or better response rate. These households have rotating address-based panels and are usually contacted by a Field Representative (FR) in person when they f irst enter the sample and remain in sample for repeated visits over a prescribed period of time. The rotating design also ensures that there is a mix of new and returning households which serves to stabilize response rates over time. FRs can make subsequent contacts by appointment and by telephone if the respondent wishes. Households that move are not followed; the new occupants are eligible for the interview. This methodology, coupled with an interview lasting from ten to forty minutes depending on the household size, is conducive to maximizing response rates. However, response rates across all surveys, regardless of design and content, have been declining in recent years as we compete with other surveys and demands on the public's time. (2) The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) uses a different design in that a household is in the sample only once, the FR has a short interval of time to conduct the interview, and the average interview length is sixty minutes, hence the lower target response rate of eighty-seven percent. (3) The Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) is on average a sixty-minute household interview and collects information on income, assets, transfer program participation, and various other socio-economic topics. Since 1996, the SIPP has had ""abutting"" rather than overlapping panels which means that at any given time, all households have been in sample for the same time period, i.e., there is no replenishment of sample as in the CPS, NCVS, and AHS designs. In addition, respondents are interviewed every four months, are encouraged to consult their records and to report their social security number to ensure accurate data, and are followed to new locations if they move during the life of the panel which is usually three to four years. These design features, particularly the requirement to follow original household members, have contributed to shar p declines in panel response rates in recent years. The Census Bureau has taken several steps to maximize response such as monetary incentives, redesigned introductory letters and materials, and enhanced FR training. The target response rates consider the age of the panel in the appropriate year. The FY 2001 performance level for this measure was achieved as the measure was then worded. In FY 2001, the initial response rates for the Cur rent Population Survey, the National Crime Victimization Survey, the American Housing Survey, and the American Community Survey were all greater than ninety percent. There were no changes to the FY 2002 Performance Plan, but beginning in FY 2003 the measure was expanded to include longitudinal surveys for which the high initial response rates are diff icult to maintain over time. FY 2002 Performance The FY 2002 performance level for this measure was achieved. The Census Bureau was able to achieve an initial response rate of ninety percent or greater for our cross-sectional household surveys. This measure excludes household expenditure surveys. These response rates are developed during the data collection phase of the survey.  128  FY  2002  PERFORMANCE  REPORT   BUREA U OF THE CENSUS  Measure 1c: 1) Release Data Products from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and 2) the Survey of Program Dynamics (see the ""Explanation of Measure"" Section for Data Products List) FY 1999 Target Actual Met/Not Met 5% time decrease 9% time decrease Met  FY 2000 Maintain FY 1999 actual time achieved Maintained FY 1999 actual time achieved Met  FY 2001 Maintain FY 1999 actual time achieved Maintained FY 1999 actual time achieved Met  FY 2002 Maintain FY 1999 actual time achieved Maintained FY 1999 actual time achieved Met  (This measure has been reworded since the publication of the FY 2000 Annual Program Performance Report (APPR) and FY 2002 Annual Performance Plan (APP). This measure was previously worded as: ""Percentage reduction from time of data collection to data release for selected household surveys."")  Explanation of Measure The Bureau has achieved optimal release times for many long-standing household surveys; for example, the Bureau releases data from the American Housing Survey nine months after collection. Other household surveys have different schedules based on their designs. This measure addresses newer surveys and survey supplements, such as SIPP and the Survey of Program Dynamics (SPD). For SIPP, the Bureau was able to maintain the nine percent time reduction that was established in FY 1999 (the SPD was not part of the measure in FY 2001 or FY 2002). SIPP collects a ""core"" of data items on detailed income, program participation, and work experience at four-month intervals from a cohort of households that are in the sample for approximately three years. Each four-month interval is refer red to as a ""wave"" of interviewing and in addition to the core items, questions measuring other aspects of household economic and social well-being are included as ""topical modules"" during each wave. The core data supplies longitudinal (studies in which variables relating to an individual or group of individuals are assessed over a period of time) measures over the life of the panel while the topical module data supplies cross-sectional (studies that focus on phenomena that occur during a precise time interval, such as a calendar year) measures at one or more points in time. SPD -- The SPD is a follow-on survey conducted with SIPP respondents from the 1992 and 1993 panels who were last interviewed in 1995 and 1996, respectively, to comply with the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, commonly known as the 1996 Welfare Reform Act. FY 2002 Performance The FY 2002 performance level for this measure was achieved. The bureau was able to maintain the production time schedule as was achieved in FY 1999 for SIPP and SPD. This schedule was established as part of the project management tools for the programs. Measure 1d: Release Principal Economic Indicators FY 1999 Target Actual Met/Not Met New  FY 2000 New  FY 2001 New  FY 2002 100% on time 100% on time Met  (This measure has been reworded since the publication of the FY 2000 Annual Program Performance Report (APPR) and FY 2002 Annual Performance Plan (APP). This measure was previously worded as: ""Percentage of principal economic indicators released as scheduled."")  FY  2002  PERFORMANCE  REPORT  129   BUREA U OF THE CENSUS  Explanation of Measure This was a new specif ic performance measure for FY 2002. The Census Bureau provides statistics that are critical to understanding cur rent conditions in our economy. These statistics include the principal federal economic indicators that drive national monetary policy, federal economic policymaking and investment, and business decisions. These principal economic indicators include the Advance Retail Sales; Manufacturing and Trade: Inventories and Sales; Monthly Wholesale Trade; Advanced Report on Durable Goods, Manufacturers' Shipments, Inventories, and Orders; Construction Put in Place; Quarterly Financial Report (QFR): Manufacturing, Mining, and Wholesale Trade; New Residential Construction; New Residential Sales; QFR: Retail; Housing Vacancies; and the U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services, jointly released with the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). Previously, the U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services measure was reported in the BEA's Annual Program Performance Report and Annual Performance Plan with reference to the Census Bureau's data collection and processing responsibilities. OMB statistical directive no. 3 requires that data for Census Bureau principal economic indicators be released within prescribed time periods. For most monthly indicators this means that they must be made available within one month of the end of the reference period, and for the quarterly indicators within two and a half months. Release dates for these indicators are available online at www.census.gov/epcd/econ/www/indijun.htm. Our goal is to release all 116 monthly and quarterly principal economic indicators on time. FY 2002 Performance During FY 2002, all principal economic indicators were released on time. The Census Bureau's principal economic indicators are among some of the most important and closely followed statistics generated by the federal statistical system. These indicators provide government policymakers and private decisionmakers with timely information about the cur rent performance of the U.S. economy. During FY 2002, all principal economic indicators were released on time.  Program Evaluation The Census Bureau's statistical program evaluations are numerous and ongoing. One measure the Bureau uses to determine data reliability is initial response rates. One measure the Bureau uses to determine timeliness is the elapsed time from data collection to data release. The following are some examples of Census Bureau program evaluations.  Demographic Statistics The Census Bureau regularly generates quality prof iles and management reports for both reimbursable and Bureau-sponsored demographic surveys. These prof iles and reports provide statistical measures of reliability and note compliance with or accomplishment of project tasks. Economic Statistics Evaluation of programs by the economic statistics staff has led to better measures of capital expenditures by U.S. companies, improved the Bureau's ability to capture data on e-commerce activities, clarif ied the information companies can provide on their pollution abatement activities, and periodically documented, as required by OMB, the statistical rigor of the methodologies used to produce the principal economic indicators.  130  FY  2002  PERFORMANCE  REPORT   BUREA U OF THE CENSUS  Performance Goal 2: Provide the statistical foundation and benchmark measures of the population, economy, and government that meet the needs of policy makers, federal, state, and local governmental agencies, businesses and the public. (This goal has been reworded since the publication of the FY 2000 Annual Program Performance Report (APPR) and FY 2002 Annual Performance Plan (APP). This goal was previously worded as:""Conduct the Decennial Census (FY 2000, FY 2001, and FY 2002"")  Corresponding Strategic Goal Strategic Goal 1: Provide the information and the framework to enable the economy to operate eff iciently and equitably.  Rationale for Performance Goal The Census Bureau's benchmark programs are a major source of baseline information upon which most data-based decisions and activities take place. Whether gathered through the Decennial Census of Population and Housing, the upcoming 2002 and 2007 Economic Censuses and the 2002 and 2007 Census of Governments, or the Intercensal Demographic Estimates that provide baseline demographic information in between the decennial censuses, the Census Bureau's Benchmark programs are where everyone turns to for information. The demographic programs provide the data used by the states and other agencies to allocate nearly $200 billion dollars in federal funds each year, conduct the analyses that underlie the statistical def initions and standards used by the entire federal government in policy decisions, and establish the baseline sample units that underlie virtually every survey conducted in the United States by both private and public sectors. The economic statistics programs count and prof ile U.S. businesses and government organizations in a rapidly-evolving economic environment. They include conducting an Economic Census and a Census of Governments every f ive years. The Economic Census covers all nonagricultural sectors of the economy, publishes data on the activities of more than twenty-two million businesses and more than 1,100 industries, and provides detailed geographic information. As a complement to the sectoral Economic Census program components, the Census Bureau also conducts a series of related programs to collect information on topics of special interest, for example, minority and women-owned businesses, the characteristics of the nation's trucking fleet, business expenses, the flow of commodities, and the economies of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands. The Census of Governments represents the primary source of facts about the structure and function of the public sector of the U.S. economy. It provides essential information to Congress and federal agencies for planning and evaluating programs that involve intergovernmental relationships. The census contributes an important element for constructing composite national economic measures, such as gross domestic product, the Bureau of Economic Analysis's input-output tables that measure market sectors, and the Federal Reserve Board's flow of funds accounts that provide time-series data of f inancial flows in the economy. The Census of Governments' f indings supply vital analytical tools for a wide variety of data users. Among the most prominent are state and local government off icials, educational organizations, criminal justice organizations, public interest groups, private industry, economic research agencies, and the media.  FY  2002  PERFORMANCE  REPORT  131   BUREA U OF THE CENSUS  Performance Goal 2 focuses on the major conduct and dissemination milestones for the 2002 Economic and Government Censuses and providing improved demographic intercensal estimates. Specif ic performance goals and measures related to these activities include Publishing and disseminating data from the 2002 Economic Census and the 2002 Census of Governments on a timely, scheduled basis Mailing Survey of Business Owners forms for the 2002 Economic Census FY 2002 Performance During FY 2002, measures for this goal were successfully met. During FY 2002 the Census Bureau continued to produce and deliver data products from Census 2000. This includes Summary File 3 (SF3), which consists of over 800 detailed tables of Census 2000 social, economic, and housing characteristics compiled from a sample of approximately nineteen million housing units that received the Census 2000 long-form questionnaire. The Census 2000 SF3 tables have been produced signif icantly earlier in the census cycle relative to previous decennial censuses. The SF3 f iles are used for the distribution of federal funds each year as well as a myriad of other public and private sector planning and decision-making uses. All planned data product releases for FY 2002 were completed on schedule.

This measure was previously worded as: ""Disseminate Census 2000 products."")  Explanation of Measure Providing releases of Census 2000 products on schedule is critical to the institutions and individuals responsible for managing or evaluating federal programs. The releases are also needed to meet legal requirements stemming from U.S. court decisions, such as the Voting Rights Act. The data collected and released are as much a part of the nation's infrastructure as highways and telephone lines. Federal dollars supporting schools, employment services, housing assistance, highway construction, hospital services, programs for the elderly, and more are distributed based on Census data. For example, twenty-two of the twenty-f ive largest federal funding grant programs in f iscal year 1998 were responsible for $162 billion being distributed to state, local, and tribal governments. About half of this money was distributed using formulas involving Census population data, according to the General Accounting Off ice. The Bureau expects that at least $182 billion and housing will be distributed annually based on formulas using Census 2000 data.  Program Evaluation The continued dissemination of data products to federal, state, local and tribal governments, as well as to users in the private and public sectors make them available for countless applications. Some uses of the data include the resolution of population and boundary issues, and the distribution of federal dollars to states and localities to meet their needs.  132  FY  2002  PERFORMANCE  REPORT   BUREA U OF THE CENSUS  Performance Goal 3: Re-engineer the 2010 Decennial Census to be more efficient and cost effective, provide richer data, improve coverage, and reduce risk in meeting constitutional and legislative mandates. (This goal has been reworded since the publication of the FY 2000 Annual Program Performance Report (APPR) and FY 2002 Annual Performance Plan (APP). This goal was previously worded as: ""Def ine--through consultations, policy assessment, planning, research, experiments, and evaluations--the plan for the 2010 Census"")  Corresponding Strategic Goal Strategic Goal 1: Provide the information and the framework to enable the economy to operate eff iciently and equitably  Rationale for Performance Goal Despite the fact that Census 2000 was an operational success, it was conducted with high costs and at great operational risk. In 2010, the job will be even more complex. Given the rapid demographic and technological changes experienced in recent years and the strong expectation that such changes will continue to accelerate, once-a-decade data collection and updating operations are no longer suff icient. Without a more systematic, timely, and integrated planning and design strategy, the data collection mission of the Census Bureau, especially of the 2010 Census, will be jeopardized. The Census Bureau has developed a strategy to meet this challenge. The strategy for the 2010 Census is to reduce operational risks, improve accuracy, provide more relevant data, and contain costs. Based on the fundamental approach of redesigning the 2010 Census, there are three interdependent components of this strategy: Implementation of the American Community Survey (ACS) to collect decennial census long-form information on an ongoing basis to provide for yearly/annual data products Modernization of The Master Address File/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) address and geographic database that takes advantage of space-based technologies, such as satellite and aerial imagery and geographic information system (GIS) data from state, local, and tribal governments, to bring the MAF/TIGER system into alignment with Global Positioning System (GPS) information Systematic development, testing, and implementation of a short form only 2010 Census design that takes advantage of the opportunities offered by an enhanced MAF/TIGER and the American Community Survey. The Census Bureau planned implementation of the American Community Survey in 2003 so that by 2010 the Bureau can provide a reliable replacement for the long-form portion of the 2010 Census. The Census Bureau started exploring this design option after by limiting it to the collection of the basic data needed for Bureau would meet the data requirements of federal agencies a Continuous Measurement program. Although time did not the 1990 Census with the objective of simplifying Census 2000 apportionment and redistricting. Under this design, the Census as well as those of users outside the federal government through permit the development of a Continuous Measurement program  FY  2002  PERFORMANCE  REPORT  133   BUREA U OF THE CENSUS  for Census 2000, developmental work was commissioned with an eye toward the 2010 Census. This work has continued resulting in the design of a system that can meet not only the federal mandates for data, but also can meet them with more timely and accurate data. This data collection effort, the American Community Survey, is a way to both improve coverage of the census (by way of operational simplif ication) and to reduce the operational risks of the census. The American Community Survey will provide the timely information needed for critical economic planning by governments and the private sector. In our information-based economy, federal, state, and local decision makers and private business and nonprof it organizations need cur rent, reliable, and comparable economic data to chart the future. The American Community Survey will provide up-to-date prof iles of U.S. communities every year beginning in 2004, providing policymakers, planners, and service providers in the public and private sectors with information every year--not just once every ten years. MAF/TIGER Modernization--The f ive objectives of the MAF/TIGER Enhancements Program are to: 1 2 3 4 5  cor rect the locations of all streets, other map features, and required structures; develop a modern processing environment; enhance geographic partnerships; develop new methods to update the address list in predominately rural areas; and fully integrate quality assurance measures into the geographic and MAF/TIGER systems and databases to meet the needs of the 2010 Census (including the American Community Survey) and related early testing activities.  The new processing environment is needed to modernize a homegrown geographic database and to take advantage of commercially-available practices and technologies. The MAF/TIGER Enhancements Program will allow the ACS and the 2010 Census to take advantage of GPS technology and mobile computers to improve on outdated and er ror-prone methodologies, while substantially expanding geographic partnerships at the state, local, and tribal levels to maintain the completeness and accuracy of the information in the address and geographic systems that are essential for a successful 2010 Census. Ongoing address and geographic partnership programs coupled with technological improvements such as a GPS-linked system will help reduce the level of address duplication and geographic misassignment that was evident in Census 2000. Procedures will be streamlined and made more eff icient by providing f ield staff with tools and technology that enable them to greatly reduce such er rors in the 2010 Census. The 2010 Census will be armed with a more comprehensive, timely, and accurate address list--one of the best predictors of a successful census--without the added complexity, risk, and costs of last minute address list-building operations. 2010 Census planning, development, and testing--The objective of 2010 Census planning, development, and testing is to conduct early testing and prototyping of new and streamlined activities to take advantage of the fact that long form data will be collected by the ACS and therefore will not be needed as part of the 2010 short form collection effort; the MAF/TIGER Enhancement Program which will provide the Bureau with a system that is in GPS alignment; the results of the Census 2000 testing, experimentation, and evaluation program; and new research to build on the success of Census 2000.  134  FY  2002  PERFORMANCE  REPORT   BUREA U OF THE CENSUS  Both the MAF/TIGER Enhancements Program and the American Community Survey are integral to a successful 2010 Census and, therefore, integral to the Census Bureau's planning activities. In addition, based on lessons learned from Census 2000, developing a design infrastructure that leads to early operational testing is crucial. This will require strong leadership, expert planning, sophisticated integration efforts, and oversight support. A major task is the development of the strategic framework to guide (1) interactions among the three components, (2) risk identif ication and management, (3) product development, (4) analysis of operational alternatives, (5) development of the research agendas, (6) integration of solutions into a logical design, and (7) plans for testing. FY 2002 Performance The FY 2002 performance levels for all measures were achieved. The Census Bureau completed the initial steps required for MAF/TIGER modernization including preparing a plan and systems to measure housing unit coverage. In FY 2002 the Bureau signed its f irst major contract with the Har ris Cor poration in the effort to re-engineer the 2010 Decennial Census for the MAF/TIGER Accuracy Improvement Project. Also in FY 2002, the Census Bureau successfully completed data collection for the 2001 ACS and the 2002 ACS through September, 2002. The Census Bureau completed all necessary data collection and data processing activities to be ready for expanding the ACS for 2003 into every county in the U.S. and every municipio in Puerto Rico.

This measure was previously worded as: ""Percentage completion of housing unit address list."")  Explanation of Measure Cor rectly locating every street and other map features in the MAF/TIGER database is critical to providing geographic products and services that meet the accuracy expectations of the 2010 Census f ield data collection staff, the Census Bureau's data product customers, and the needs of The National Map/Homeland Defense effort. The Census Bureau's f ield staff has reported extensive diff iculties in completing address list updating and verif ication tasks, and in f inding addresses and streets that required follow-up visits in Census 2000. Many local or tribal governments that participated in the Census 2000 geographic partnership programs and many potential customers for MAF/TIGER geographic products have told the Census Bureau that they would not consider future geographic partnership or use without substantial improvements in location accuracy.  FY  2002  PERFORMANCE  REPORT  135   BUREA U OF THE CENSUS  FY 2002 Performance This performance measure was met. The Census Bureau has prepared an initial plan for measurement of housing unit coverage in the Master Address File (MAF). This plan documents the systems (Administrative Records System, Locatable Address Conversion System, Global Positioning System, Automated Listing and Mapping Instrument System) and data sources (Delivery Sequence Files, National Health Interview Survey f iles, Rural Directory f iles, E-911 f iles) that will provide the basis for developing the f ield procedures required to begin future data collection activities.

Met  Actual  Met/Not Met  (This measure has been reworded since the publication of the FY 2000 Annual Program Performance Report (APPR) and FY 2002 Annual Performance Plan (APP). This measure was previously worded as: ""Release 2001 data from LFTB."")  Explanation of Measure The Census Long-Form Transitional Database (LFTDB) is the key to replacing the Census long form with the ACS. As part of the Decennial Census operations in FY 2000 and FY 2001, the Bureau has been conducting the LFTDB evaluation study. The FY 2002 plan for the LFTDB is a critical part of the transition to using data from the ACS as a national program beginning in FY 2003 (a performance measurement commitment in the Department of Commerce FY 2000FY 2005 Strategic Plan). When the ACS becomes a comprehensive national program, community prof iles will be available every year rather than every ten years. These vastly improved data will enable the U.S. government to distribute billions of dollars much more eff iciently and to more effectively evaluate federal programs. FY 2002 Performance Census completed all data collection for the 2001 LFTDB by January 2002. Data collection was completed across all three modes of collection with an overall response rate exceeding ninety-f ive percent. The data products also were produced, but the Census Bureau decided to delay release of these products until November 2002 because of the potential confusion with Census 2000 sample data products being released during the latter part of FY 2002.  136  FY  2002  PERFORMANCE  REPORT   BUREA U OF THE CENSUS  Census Data Validation and Verification The Bureau of the Census conducts an annual review of the performance data to ensure that projected targets are met. Data are verif ied by comparison with past release dates for those targets involving data release measures. The survey data tabulations are compared to publicly reported methodological standards for its surveys to verify that the specif ied measures are attained for targets involving reliability measures. During this process, signif icant deviations from projected targets, if any, are discussed with the appropriate program areas so that changes can be implemented to help meet the Census Bureau's performance goals. In some cases, information is manually checked against actual paper f iles (when available) to ensure the accuracy of information. Additionally, documentation is reviewed and a determination is made on its adequacy and suff iciency to support claims that outcomes and outputs have been achieved.

GX025-03-11218003	"PREPARED STATEMENT OF      KENNETH PREWITT      DIRECTOR, U.S. BUREAU OF THE CENSUS      Before the Subcommittee on the Census      Committee on Government Reform      U.S. House of Representatives      April 5, 2000        Mr. Chairman, Mrs. Maloney, and Members of the Committee:      It is a pleasure to be here today, 4 days after Census Day, to report on the status of Census 2000.  When I last testified, the focus was on whether the Census Bureau could pull off the many complex and massive operations--questionnaire mailout and delivery, telephone questionnaire assistance, reminder card, data capture--that would occur between early March and now.  Mr. Chairman, all of these operations were conducted successfully with no major problems that would put the census at risk.          We successfully delivered some 24 million questionnaires to housing units in the update/leave areas on schedule.             The U.S. Postal Service completed the delivery of some 98 million questionnaires to housing units in mailout/mailback areas.           Telephone questionnaire assistance (TQA) has worked well since we became fully staffed.  We have about 6,000 agents working in 22 centers and they have answered nearly 5 million calls since TQA became active on March 3.             The U.S. Postal Service completed the delivery of 120 million cards reminding people to mail back their census forms.           Data capture operations are performing well, without any major problems.             Other operations, which I will discuss later, have also begun on schedule and are progressing.       In short, Mr. Chairman, the Census Bureau is keeping its part of the civic bargain.  Operations are progressing on schedule, within budget, and without any disabling problems.  Now the census is in the hands of the people and we hope they will answer the call to civic duty and respond.  This is one of the few cases where the personal decisions of individuals could have a tremendous impact on governmental operations.  The Congress has made response to the census mandatory.  We will make repeat calls and visits to every housing unit that does not mail back a questionnaire.   I urge everyone to help his or her community have the most complete count possible.       In your letter of invitation, you ask for  The status of nationwide mail response rates and what those rates translate into for the Nonresponse Followup (NRFU) workload, hiring, other operations, and associated costs.   As of this writing, the national mail response rate as posted on the Internet is 55 percent.  The current estimates for nonresponse followup workload, hiring, and costs are based on achieving a 61 percent mail response rate; as you can see, we are not there yet. It is not too late for people to mail back their form, but time is running out.  April 11 is the cutoff date for identifying housing units that have not mailed back a questionnaire so we can include them in the nonresponse followup workload.  We will continue to receive and process mail returns after that date.  On April 17, we will produce a late mail return file that we will transmit to the local census offices so they can delete those addresses from their nonresponse followup assignments.       On March 27, we successfully posted mail response rates on our Internet site-- www.census.gov , have updated the numbers every day since, and will continue to do so daily until April 11.  We will post final mail response rates on April 18.  In January, Secretary Daley and I announced a new initiative to encourage grassroots participation in Census 2000 in every town, city, county, state, and tribal area in the nation.  We are calling this initiative ""How America Knows What America Needs.""  We are providing local elected officials with tools to use in encouraging their constituents to complete and mail back their census forms and to cooperate with enumerators.  These tools include sample news releases, articles, talking points, and other written materials; a dedicated website to enable participants to obtain updated information and download promotional materials; and a toll-free number to allow elected officials to call for additional information.  We are also challenging communities to increase their overall response rates in Census 2000 by at least five percentage points over their 1990 level.  We are calling this component  '90 Plus Five , which means we are encouraging a 70 percent national response rate--the 65 percent from 1990 plus 5.  Obviously, we have not reached that goal nationally, but some jurisdictions have or will reach their goals.   A second component of ""How America Knows What America Needs"" is called  Because You Count.   This   component is aimed at increasing cooperation with census enumerators when they come knocking on doors.  Our goal with the ""How America Knows What America Needs"" initiative is to convert the census into a civic event of the highest order.      Operational Update      In your letter of invitation, you asked for  The status and a brief overview of the Census 2000 operational time line, and readiness for key activities and dates that lay ahead.      The next big operation is the nonresponse followup, which I will talk about at some length later.  Let me just take a few minutes now, to provide additional details about operations we recently completed or started.        We began the update/leave operation on March 3, as planned.  Census enumerators left questionnaires at approximately 24 million housing units in areas (including Puerto Rico) that have several different address types.  These areas are mostly in small towns and rural areas where address systems have less geographic structure.   Local census offices conducting update/leave operations had sufficient staff and some 70,000 enumerators were hired for this operation. We sent regional and headquarters staff, as needed, to troubleshoot in those few local census offices that experienced problems.  This operation is complete and on schedule.      Telephone questionnaire assistance (TQA) also began on March 3 and will run through June 8 and outbound calling from the TQA sites as part of our coverage edit program will continue into mid-June.  There are 7 toll-free telephone numbers (in English, Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Tagalog, and TDD) where people can call to get assistance in filling out their questionnaire, get replacement questionnaires, get language assistance guides, or provide their census questionnaire information.  As I mentioned earlier, we have answered nearly 5 million calls.   Just over 4 percent of calls were unable to get through; almost all of those were on the first two days after questionnaires were delivered in mailout/mailback areas.  There was a higher volume of calls earlier than expected but we moved quickly to increase staff so that we could successfully handle the calls.  There were also some early problems in validating the questionnaire data that was taken over the telephone; these problems have now been resolved.       As you will recall, in our advance letter, we also provided an opportunity for those who want a form in Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, or Tagalog to request one.  We have received about 2.5 million such requests, the vast majority for the Spanish form, and this is an indication that the advance letter worked.         From March 13 through March 15, the U.S. Postal Service successfully delivered questionnaires to some 98 million addresses in what we call mailout/mailback areas of the country.  These addresses are generally in urban areas but can occur in small and mid-sized towns and even some rural areas.  There were some instances where households received duplicate questionnaires.  This occurred because during all the overlapping processes used to build the Master Address File, we wanted to minimize the chance that we would eliminate an address that should be retained.  We have procedures in place to eventually remove these duplicate addresses from our files before the final census data are tabulated.      Also beginning March 13, and continuing throughout March and April, census enumerators are visiting about half a million housing units in list/enumerate areas, in an operation similar to that initiated in Alaska on January 19.   These are remote, sparsely populated areas where it is not efficient to compile a precensus address list.  At the time enumerators visit each housing unit, they are listing the unit and completing a questionnaire.  Also at this time, we began the update/enumerate operation, which is conducted in communities with special enumeration needs and where most housing units may not have house number and street name addresses.  These areas include selected American Indian Reservations, unincorporated Spanish-speaking communities along the border of Texas and Mexico ( colonias ), and resort areas with high concentrations of seasonably vacant housing units.  Both of these operations progressed more slowly than we anticipated at the start, but we are confident that we will be able to complete these operations on time.      Beginning on March 20, we mailed out a reminder card to those housing units we are asking to return a form by mail.  Many had already mailed back their forms, but this reminder hopefully spurred others to do so as soon as possible.   That mailing was also completed successfully.      Last week, we completed the service based enumeration, with the goal of including in the census those people without conventional housing who might be missed in the regular enumeration procedures.  On the evening of March 27, census enumerators interviewed people in shelters, on March 28 at soup kitchens and mobile food van stops, and on the early morning of March 29 at targeted outdoor locations.  We enumerated about 22,000 such places over the course of the three days.        On the evening of March 31, we conducted the transient night operation, which is designed to enumerate people at locations where residents are highly transient in nature, such as campgrounds and parks, commercial or public fairs, carnivals, marinas, racetracks, and recreational vehicle parks.  This operation will extend until April 14 for a few very large and relatively stable Transient Night locations.      Beginning April 1 and continuing until May 6, we expect to count about 7 million people in about 125,000 special places during group quarters enumeration.  These are people living in such places as college and university dormitories, hospital and prison wards, migrant farm camps, and nursing homes.   From April 4 to May 4, we will also conduct the enumeration of land-based and shipboard military personnel and people aboard U.S. flag-bearing merchant vessels--about 1,000 ships and over 500 military reservations in all.  This group includes all U.S. land-based military personnel, their dependents living on base, and U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard ships not deployed or assigned to foreign ports.      In your letter of invitation, you asked about  The status   of data capture systems for all four sites.  Data capture operations began shortly after the first questionnaires were delivered in update/leave areas and the volume of returned questionnaires picked up significantly with the delivery of forms in mailout/mailback areas.  Data capture is working very well and we are aware of no serious problems at this point.  We have checked in about 67 million questionnaires and we have scanned about 24 million of them.  Scanning accuracy, which is over 99%, has exceeded our expectations and we are also maintaining a very high level of keying accuracy.       You also asked about  Preparation and issues concerning Internet response to Census 2000 questionnaires and tabulation processes.   Internet data collection and questionnaire assistance began on March 3.  Internet data collection will operate until April 15 and Internet questionnaire assistance will end the first week of June.  We have received nearly 50,000 responses through the Internet. Some respondents have experienced problems completing the questionnaire through the Internet.  This is primarily due to a bug in their browser and not caused by the website itself.  If they are unable to get through after trying a different browser, we have recommended that they fill out and mail back their paper form.       Your letter also asked about  Status and issues confronting Questionnaire Assistance Centers and Be Counted sites.   Questionnaire Assistance Centers opened on March 8 and will be open through April 14.  There are no major problems related to QAC's at this time.   We have provided assistance to over 100,000 individuals in the QAC operation.  Approximately 15,000 volunteers and 11,000 paid clerks have been assigned to staff the QAC's.  To maximize use of staff, we have eliminated redundant sites and currently have 24,000 in operation.      Be Counted forms became available on March 31 at approximately 19,000 sites in addition to the QAC's, where they are also available.  The Be Counted sites are not staffed, but clerks are assigned to set them up, restock them, and close them after April 11.      Your letter also asked about  Any difficulties confronting Local Census Offices.   None of the 520 LCO's is experiencing problems that have prevented normal operations.  The tornado last week in downtown Ft. Worth, Texas, did not harm the office, but staff were prevented from entering the downtown section of the city for the next few days.  Some LCO's are reporting minor problems with their telephone systems and headquarters staff are working closely with the General Services Administration and telecommunications service providers to resolve the problems.  At present, all systems are up and running.      At the last hearing, I reported problems with a New York City LCO.  GSA sought another location but no suitable site could be found.  GSA has now assumed many services to assure the office is able to perform its work.  Basic housekeeping services are being provided by a GSA contractor. An extermination service has solved the rodent problem and the water leak has been fixed.  We are now working on getting an elevator into working order for freight and employees who need assistance and in the meantime are using an elevator in an adjacent facility.             Nonresponse Followup      Mr.  Chairman, the nonresponse followup (NRFU) operation is the largest, most complex, and most costly operation in Census 2000.  NRFU is scheduled to begin April 27 (enumerator training begins April 24) and will continue for 10 weeks until the first week of July.  Extending NRFU beyond that date would not only increase census costs, it could lead to a reduction in data quality.  Experience teaches us that the longer we are in the field and the farther we get from Census Day, the more the quality of respondents' answers deteriorates.  Therefore, our goal is to complete NRFU in 10 weeks.  This is an ambitious schedule, but as I describe below, we have productivity goals and multiple quality checks built into the process.  And we will stay in the field as long as it takes to complete this process.      You asked about  The status of the hiring process for NRFU.   We believe we have a sufficiently large recruiting pool to fill all positions.  While we have met our national goal of having 2.4 million qualified applicants well in advance of our April 19 th  target date, we are continuing to accept applications and to actively recruit in local areas where we have not yet met our recruiting goals.  This targeted approach will ensure that we have sufficient enumerators in all areas of the country.  We have selected supervisory staff for NRFU and about one-third of the enumerators.  We will complete selection of enumerators over the next three weeks.      I would now like to describe in some detail the enumerator's job and our procedures for assuring the quality and completeness of their work.        Each NRFU enumerator is assigned a specific area in which to work, called an assignment area, and is given a binder of addresses in that area that includes all those addresses for which we have not received a completed questionnaire.  Because houses without numbers and street name addresses can be difficult to find, enumerators in rural areas also receive maps that have the housing unit locations spotted on them.  The NRFU enumerator must go to each address in the assignment area to complete the appropriate questionnaire (either short form or long form) for the housing unit and its occupants.        If the current household lived at the address on Census Day, the enumerator interviews a household member at least 15 years of age and completes the assigned questionnaire.  If the unit was occupied by a different household on Census Day, the enumerator completes a questionnaire for the occupants who lived there on Census Day by interviewing a knowledgeable person, such as a neighbor.  If the current occupants were not enumerated elsewhere, the enumerator will also complete a census questionnaire for them for their Census Day address.      If the housing unit was vacant on Census Day, the enumerator completes appropriate housing questions on the questionnaire by interviewing a knowledgeable person, such as a neighbor or apartment house manager.  If the housing unit was demolished or otherwise nonexistent under census definitions, the enumerator completes a questionnaire that provides the reason why the unit should be deleted from the census address list, by interviewing a knowledgeable respondent such as a neighbor or apartment house manager.      The enumerator must make up to six attempts to complete a questionnaire.  If no one is home at an occupied housing unit, the enumerator obtains as much information as possible about how to contact the occupants from a neighbor, building manager, or another source.  The enumerator also leaves a notice at the address that they have visited and provides a telephone number so the occupant can call back.  The enumerator then makes up to two additional personal visits (3 in all) and three telephone attempts at contacting the household before obtaining as much information as possible to complete the questionnaire from a knowledgeable source.  Enumerators are instructed to make their callbacks on different days of the week and at different times of day. The enumerator must maintain a record of callbacks that lists each type of callback made (telephone or personal visit) and the exact date and time it occurred.  Enumerators are expected to obtain complete interviews but must obtain at least the status (occupied or vacant) and the number of people living in the unit.  If the enumerator submits a questionnaire that contains this minimal level of data, the crew leader must check the enumerator's record of callbacks for the housing unit to determine that procedures were properly followed.  The crew leader also holds these cases for possible further followup to obtain more complete data.      Supervisors, called crew leaders, meet daily with each enumerator to pick up and check completed work.  These meetings enable crew leaders to monitor progress and quality.   Crew leaders are expected to make sure that the enumerators produce quality work at a rate of 1 to 1.5 completed questionnaires per hour depending on the type of area the LCO covers.  Crew leaders check each completed questionnaire for completeness and accuracy.        In order to prevent falsification of the data by enumerators, a percentage of each enumerator's work is verified for accuracy by a reinterview staff.  This staff verifies a sample of each enumerator's work and may also verify additional questionnaires from enumerators whose work differs significantly from that of other enumerators working for the same crew leader.  An enumerator who is discovered falsifying data is dismissed immediately and all the work must be redone by another enumerator.      Daily production levels begin to decrease toward the end of NRFU.  Sometimes enumerators completed the easier cases first, finished the work closest to their homes first, or believed that the quicker they finished their assignment, the sooner they would be out of work.  In order to bring the NRFU to closure within the scheduled 10 weeks, we implement a procedure known as ""final attempt.""  When the area covered by a crew leader has completed 95 percent of its workload, the crew leader consolidates the remaining work and gives it to the most productive and dependable enumerators.  These enumerators then make one final visit to each outstanding NRFU address and to some of the housing units for which only minimal data was earlier collected to complete as much of the questionnaire as possible.  Final attempt must resolve all outstanding cases within a few days, but NRFU is not over until a questionnaire is completed and checked into the local census office for every unit.        Long Form Questionnaire    Now, I want to address concerns you are hearing from some Members and constituents about the Census 2000 long form.  We take these questions and concerns seriously.  We are aware of the time pressures confronting people in our overworked and over stressed society and of the concerns we all have about privacy and confidentiality.  I am confident that once the public understands that their answers are protected by law, that every question asked in the census serves an important purpose, and that every question has a specific federal legislative or judicial mandate or requirement, they will perform their civic duty to respond to the census.  Failure to collect the data on the long form would prevent agencies from carrying out existing laws and could result in loss of benefits to local communities.      I mentioned earlier the importance of answering the census, whether one has the short form or the long form.  I also want to stress that Title 13 of the United States Code not only requires respondents to answer the census, but also requires the U.S. Census Bureau to maintain the strictest confidentiality of the data collected.  The law forbids the Census Bureau from giving an individual's information to anyone else--not the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, or the Immigration and Naturalization Service; not local governments, or police or landlords.  All census employees are subject to severe fines and imprisonment if convicted of violating this law.  I understand that many people have deep distrust about providing information to the government.  At a time of increasing concerns about the security of our personal data, people will understandably want to know why the data are needed, what they will be used for, and how they will be protected.  Answers to census questions are confidential because the Congress has provided iron-tight protections to the data and serious penalties for those who are not vigilant in protecting the data.        Concern with overburdening respondents with too many questions led the Census Bureau to introduce a long form on a sample basis into the 1940 census, and we have used this     approach in each decennial census since then.  The selection of a sample, based on established     scientific methods, means that not everyone is asked every question; the large majority receive     only a short form.  Thus, the need for information is met with much less burden on the public than if everyone had to answer the questions on the long form .        In particular, the long form for Census 2000 includes the questions asked on the short form and additional questions, for a total of 52.  In contrast, the long form included 57 questions in 1990, and 81 questions in 1940.   This is the shortest long form the Bureau has ever used.      The questions on the long form provide essential data so that decision makers can help move our rapidly growing and economically complex country in the 21st century.  Every question on the form serves an important purpose.  Let me just give a few examples.        The answers to the question on a telephone in the home are used to help plan local 911 emergency services and, in response to the Older Americans Act, to provide emergency and healthcare services to areas with relatively more homebound seniors who do not have telephone service.        The answers on plumbing facilities are used by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to administer housing programs and by local communities to apply to the federal government for community development funds.        The answers to the question on income are used to allocate Title 1 education funds to school districts with high rates of student age poverty.        The information on how long it takes to commute to work is used by federal, state, local, and private transportation planners who design new roads, bus routes, mass transit systems, and manage traffic congestion, as well as for the distribution of federal transportation funds.        The information on disability is required to help design and deliver public and private services to the elderly and disabled.        The data on veterans' status are used to plan the location of veterans' hospitals and cemeteries and for the delivery of veterans '  healthcare and nursing services.      The law requires that, three years prior to Census Day, the Census Bureau report to Congress the subjects proposed for inclusion in the census.   The Census Bureau reported this information to Congress in a letter and accompanying materials dated March 28, 1997.  The law also requires that we report to Congress the specific questions we intend to ask two years prior to Census Day, and we did that on March 30, 1998.  The materials we submitted to Congress describe each question we included on the long form and, more   importantly, provide detailed legal citations that indicate that each item is mandated or required by congressional legislation or federal judicial decisions.      Accurate census data also provide the underpinnings for other federal surveys and data collections.  The decennial census forms the sampling base for other national surveys and is used to compute rates of various indicators.  Therefore, it is directly linked to the statistical system's     ability to provide current unemployment data; to provide data for making cost of living adjustments; to calculate numerous vital statistics and rates for health service utilization; to calculate crime, imprisonment, and victimization rates; and the like.       Only one new subject is included in the long form for Census 2000:  grandparents as caregivers.  This addition complies with legislation passed in the 104th Congress requiring that the decennial census obtain information about grandparents who have primary responsibility for care of grandchildren.       We intend for Census 2000 to be the last decennial census to include a long form.  The American Community Survey, scheduled for nationwide implementation in 2003, is one of the most important improvements in federal statistics, and it is the cornerstone of our effort to keep pace with ever increasing demands for timely and relevant data.  The American Community Survey will revolutionize the way we take the decennial census by making the next one simpler and making it possible to provide detailed socioeconomic and housing data throughout the decade.        There were no viable alternatives to having a long form for Census 2000.  No other data source could provide all the information the Nation needs in a cost-effective manner.  But, in the long term, the American Community Survey will replace the long form by Census 2010.      Without the Census 2000 long form and the American Community Survey during the next decade, the federal government would not have the data currently required to allocate billions of dollars in federal funds for education programs, veterans' services, programs to reduce unemployment and stimulate economic growth, public healthcare, and services for the elderly.  The states and local governments would not have the data they need to help them plan new school construction, occupational and vocational education programs, programs to assist the elderly and the disabled, highway safety and public transportation systems, the location of police and fire department personnel, and rural development.        If there were no long form in Census 2000, each federal agency would have to undertake its own data collection efforts to fill the gap.  The burden on respondents would actually increase; moreover, this would be an inefficient use of federal dollars.  Alternatively, if the agencies did not conduct their own data collections, they would be forced to use ever more outdated  information from the 1990 census.       Mr. Chairman, that concludes my testimony and I will be happy to answer any questions."
GX024-87-1334539	"PREPARED STATEMENT OF      KENNETH PREWITT        DIRECTOR, U.S.   BUREAU OF THE CENSUS        Before the Subcommittee on the Census        Committee on Government Reform        U.S. House of Representatives        July 20, 2000          Mr. Chairman, Mrs. Maloney, and Members of the Subcommittee:      I am pleased to be here today to discuss the American Community Survey (ACS).  The ACS, part of our Continuous Measurement program, is the single most important improvement in federal household statistics since the middle of the last century and I believe it is the cornerstone of our effort to keep pace with ever increasing demands for timely and relevant data.  If the Census Bureau and the Congress are to continue leadership in providing information to the knowledge society, we must invest in full development of the ACS.  In our web-based society of the 21 st  century, where information is increasingly available at the public's fingertips, it is no longer acceptable that planners and policy-makers must use data that are up to 12 years out of date. Not only will the ACS provide more frequent detailed data for small geographic areas, but it will also revolutionize the way we take the decennial census.      NATIONAL DATA NEEDS        To understand fully the need for the ACS, we must discuss it in the context of the United States' longstanding need for detailed social, economic, and housing data to further the business of governing.  The very first census in 1790 went beyond the bare constitutional need for a headcount.  Since 1820, each census has included questions that describe the condition of our society and economy.  In fact, it is no coincidence that ""statistics"" and ""state"" share the same common root.  As the United States grew to become a powerful nation, statistics came to play an increasingly larger role and, by the late 1800's, the compendious census questionnaires reflected that.  The 20 th  century can be described as the first ""measured century,"" and this helped to build our democracy and our free economy.      The Census Bureau introduced a long form on a sample basis into the 1940 census, and we have used this approach in each decennial census since then.  The selection of a sample, based on established scientific methods largely developed by Census Bureau professionals in the 1930's, means that not everyone is asked every question; the large majority receive only a short form, thus, lessening the burden on the public.   The long form for Census 2000 includes the questions asked on the short form and additional questions, for a total of 52.  In contrast, the long form included 57 questions in 1990, and 81 questions in 1940.        Over the years, the long form included in the decennial census has met the Nation's need for detailed data essential for governing.  The decennial census long form has provided reliable, consistent data for small geographic areas--as small as city neighborhoods--and it has done so in a very efficient manner.  So why are we here today talking about an alternative to the long form?      In the early 1990's, two streams of argument converged to make a powerful case that change was needed.  First, was the demand from a wide variety of data users, including those in Congress, for more timely and relevant data than that provided by a long form collected only once every 10 years.  I will talk more about this need for up-to-date information later.  Second, was the idea that the long form was a drag on the decennial census, a complication in carrying out the constitutional purpose of the census to obtain the most complete and accurate count of the population possible.  The solution was to simplify the census by eliminating the long form.      To eliminate the long form without an alternative method of collecting detailed population and housing characteristics would have been irresponsible.  Every question has a specific federal legislative or judicial mandate or requirement.  When the Census Bureau reported to Congress on March 30, 1998, as required by law, on the specific questions that would be asked in Census 2000, the Census Bureau provided selected citations from about 130 laws that use specific long form items, and that was not a complete list.  As one example, there are 25 citations alone for the disability questions.  These include the Americans with Disabilities Act; the Rehabilitation Act; the Disabled Veterans Outreach Program; the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance Program; and the Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act.  Without the decennial long form or an appropriate alternative, such as the ACS, Congress would not have the data it mandated to run the programs it has written into law.  In effect, the Congress would not have a rudder to guide the ship of state.  Indeed, we are aware of at least 35 new bills that have been introduced in the 106 th  Congress that would require long form data.      The ACS, then, is the statistical community's alternative to the decennial census long form.  If fully funded and implemented it will lead to a simpler decennial census, provide more timely and relevant data, and also lead to more widespread efficiencies throughout the federal statistical system.  I would like to discuss each of these items in more detail now.                HOW THE ACS WILL REVOLUTIONIZE AMERICAN STATISTICS        A Simpler Decennial Census      If the ACS is fully implemented, we can eliminate the long form as part of the 2010 decennial census.  As I mentioned earlier, elimination of the decennial census long form has been one of the key goals in developing the ACS.   If the Census Bureau has the resources to conduct early planning, it will be able to re-engineer many aspects of the decennial census with a view to achieving cost savings related to not having a long form, enhancements to our geographic programs, and changes in other interrelated areas, such as forms design, printing, labeling, questionnaire delivery, enumerator training, nonresponse followup, data capture, data editing, and data tabulation.  Estimates of potential cost savings are currently being examined and will be presented to the Administration as soon as available and, subsequently, to the Congress as part of the FY2002 appropriations cycle.      The ACS will also permit the Census Bureau to focus exclusively on conducting the basic count. The ACS will lead to better coverage of addresses in the census because it will require a continuously updated address list and ongoing interaction with local officials.  The ACS will also provide updated data to permit the Census Bureau to more effectively target areas where special procedures will be required.  As I have previously testified, the data used to determine hard-to-enumerate areas for Census 2000 was 1990 data.  This did help, but up-to-date data would have been of much greater value.  Census Bureau staff are also looking at ways to use the highly trained and seasoned ACS field staff as a cadre of key supervisory staff for the 2010 census.  Because they will have been collecting ACS data successfully in hard-to-enumerate areas, they will have developed relationships with local leaders that will prove invaluable in conducting the 2010 census.  So, in simplifying the decennial census by eliminating the long form, we also introduce opportunities for substantial cost savings and improved coverage.      I also believe the ACS, spread out as it is over 120 months, will reduce public concern about privacy.  The long form for Census 2000 seems to have caught many people by surprise, with the result that there has been considerable discussion of the long form as an ""invasion of privacy.""  I believe this was partly due to the way the long form was administered to some 20 million housing units all at one time.  The ACS provides a different atmosphere and, thus, different opportunities than the census.      Instead of 20 million housing units receiving the census long form all at one time, in each monthly survey, only 250,000 housing units will receive the ACS questionnaire at any one time.  Instead of having a large army of temporary enumerators, the ACS field interviewers will be highly trained permanent staff who will be better prepared to deal with the public's questions about the form.  As I said at an earlier hearing, I am confident that once the public understands that their answers are protected by law and that every question asked serves an important purpose, they will perform their civic duty to respond.  In fact, our experience thus far with the ACS has been that our trained interviewers have achieved good cooperation with few complaints from the public.  I believe it is hard to sustain the argument that government data collection is an invasion of privacy when there are such strong protections of the data, when they are used only for statistical purposes--not for regulation or law enforcement--and when each questionnaire item is linked to a program that the people's representatives have enacted.      Having said that, the Census Bureau takes questions and concerns about intrusiveness and privacy seriously.  We are aware of the time pressures confronting people and of the concerns we all have about privacy and confidentiality.  We also recognize and respect those who have philosophical objections to government activities, government programs, and government data collection.  Our Nation has struggled with these profound issues from its inception.  I do not believe the Congress has invaded privacy by establishing government programs to help people or by requiring good data to administer those programs, but I respect the views of those who do.  I also pledge that the Census Bureau will do all it can to work with the Congress as you struggle with these weighty issues.  It is not up to the Census Bureau to decide what kind of society we should be or even whether we should have timely and relevant data to make that vision possible.  It is our role, however, to inform the Congress about the most efficient, effective, and modern ways to collect the data, once the Administration and the Congress have determined which data are necessary.  That is what we are doing today by presenting our plans for the ACS.      I want now to say a word about the process for developing ACS content, which I expect to involve an active partnership between the Congress, federal agencies,  and the statistical community.  Currently, the ACS content closely resembles the Census 2000 long form.  That's because, as I will explain in more detail later, we need to compare responses to the ACS with those from Census 2000.  We need to understand how differences in data collection methods between the two affect the results.  But we also realize that what is justified for a once-a-decade data collection needs to be reassessed.      One step in this reassessment will be the Interagency Committee on the American Community Survey, which the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has established and which met for the first time last week.  This group will be the primary mechanism for proposing changes to the ACS questionnaire.  The group will work with all the departments and agencies in the Executive Branch to examine whether information is needed for small geographic areas (census tracts, small towns, and rural counties) to determine how frequently the data are needed.      Close collaboration with the Congress will be another factor in determining ACS content, and I look forward to any suggestions you may have for how we can accomplish this.  One problem we all share is how to balance concerns about minimizing respondent burden with requests for additional information.  Just as some in Congress want minimal data collected, others have expressed the need for additional questions.  The only new question added to Census 2000--that concerning grandparents as caregivers--was required as part of the welfare reform legislation.  The Census Bureau determined that the data should be collected on a sample basis, although some Members supported asking it of all households.  And, there was a sense-of-the-Senate resolution expressing concern about an item that had been moved from the short to the long form.  So we must always look for ways to balance these competing pressures and we look forward to working with the Congress to do that.      Timely and Relevant Data for Small Geographic Areas      In addition to permitting improvements to the decennial census, the ACS will provide timely and relevant data for small geographic areas.  Data users have demanded more timely data that provide consistent measures for all areas.  Decennial census data are already out-of-date 2 years after the census is taken--when long form data are first released--and their relevance declines with every passing year.  The ACS will provide essentially the same information every year that the decennial census has provided only once every 10 years.  In this new century, especially with the trend to devolution of responsibilities from the federal to the state and local level, communities will need accurate, timely information to chart their social and economic condition.  And federal agencies need these data to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the programs that are funded at the national level but designed and implemented by states and localities.       The ACS is not designed to provide a headcount.  That is what the decennial census is for.  The Census Bureau has a population estimates program, conducted in partnership with the Federal State Cooperative Program for Population Estimates, to provide updated population totals for years following the most recent census.  The ACS will serve a similar role in providing updated population and housing characteristics, which, among other uses, would enable the allocation of billions of government and business dollars among states, communities, and population groups.      The ACS will also provide timely data to help federal program managers and the ""end users"" in every community across America.  It recognizes the continuing roles of Congress and federal agencies while also elevating partnership with other levels of government and those directly affected by the decisions based on data.        Let me give one example at the Federal level:  The Individuals with Disabilities Act allocates the federal portion of the cost of educating children with disabilities based upon a formula that includes disability information now gathered on the decennial census long form.  As you know, this information becomes outdated quickly.  The last long form data (from the 1990 census) on children with disabilities in the 1989-1990 school year will continue to be used until the 2002 or 2003 school year--after a complete generation of students has come and gone.  They reflect the situation of older children, teenagers, and young adults--individuals who are at least 10 years old today.  None of the children 9 years old or younger who receive assistance from this program were included in the 1990 census.  In the next decade, with the ACS, this problem of using old data will be solved because up-to-date information will capture the changes in characteristics between censuses.            Similarly, the ACS can identify changes in an area's population and give an up-to-date statistical picture that communities can use to:         track the well-being of children, families, and the elderly;       determine where to locate new highways, schools, and hospitals;       show a new or relocating corporation it has the workforce the company needs;       evaluate the quality of available housing;       evaluate programs such as welfare and workforce diversification; and       monitor and publicize the results of their programs.      The up-to-date data that we will issue from the ACS will help communities establish goals using objective information, increase program accountability by measuring results, and measure program performance for future planning.  It will enable communities to see how they are doing compared with others, to identify problems and find solutions, and to make programs more flexible to meet the needs of different groups in the community.      Let me give one specific example of how ACS is already proving itself more useful than the decennial census long form at the community level because it is updated and available every year instead of just once a decade.  In Oregon, grants and tax credits are provided to developers of affordable housing and housing designed for the elderly and disabled.  To obtain grants, developers have to demonstrate need based on demographic characteristics such as the numbers of low-income, elderly, or disabled households, or the size of other disadvantaged populations.  This detailed information comes only from long-form type questions.  In the past few years, a developer wanting to qualify for such grants would only have had 1980 and 1990 long form data available.  Because of concern that extrapolations of such data would not reflect current conditions, the Population Research Center (PRC) of Oregon State University was asked to determine the need for low-income multi-family housing.      Knowing that the ACS had recently been conducted in Multnomah County, Oregon, the PRC devised an assessment tool to compare results from trend analysis based on 1980 and 1990 long form data with results from the 1996 ACS.  They compared findings on age, race and ethnicity, household size and type, employment status, income, vacancy and tenure of housing units, gross rent, gross rent as a percentage of household income, quality and age of housing, and other related variables.  This comparison showed that many of the actual changes in the area would not have been identified by extrapolating based on 1980 to 1990 trends.  Data from the 1996 ACS showed a need for more affordable housing units, whereas the 1980-1990 trend data did not indicate any need.      A More Efficient Statistical System      The ACS offers the potential for dramatic improvement in the infrastructure of the federal statistical system.  It is now costly and time consuming to create samples for new surveys or to adjust samples for existing surveys to provide data to meet the needs of policymakers in unforeseen areas.        The ACS can make the entire federal statistical system more efficient by serving as a screening mechanism for new surveys.  One example in which the ACS is already doing this is with the National Epidemiological Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions, which the Census Bureau conducts on a reimbursable basis for the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.  This survey is designed to gauge alcohol consumption, as well as to provide psychiatric classifications of alcohol use disorders.  Ultimately, the data are helpful in determining the causes of alcoholism, and in understanding the behavior patterns and potential treatments or other courses of action to help sufferers, their families, and ultimately, society combat this disease.  In 2001, this survey will become the first to use data from the ACS to draw its sample and expects to realize a major efficiency by eliminating the need for interviewing a large number of households just to find the target population groups.  For example, by using race and ethnicity information collected by the ACS, we can easily include the sample target groups with no additional respondent burden or field work.      The ACS can also be a valuable resource to avoid or reduce the cost of new surveys.  For example, once the ACS completes a stable year of initial operations, it could add questions on health insurance coverage, and could meet the Congress's expressed need for data on children's health insurance coverage more efficiently than expanding other surveys or adding a new one.  This is a good example of how the ACS can be a valuable tool to help Members of Congress get reliable data about emerging issues.  Instead of having to develop entirely new surveys, the ACS --often in combination with existing national surveys--would be able to deal promptly with such emerging data needs.        In addition to consulting with the Office of Management and Budget and other federal statistical agencies in developing the ACS, we have worked closely with representatives of state and local governments and private organizations, who also find data collected for federal purposes of immense value.  Collaboration with private contractors has been extremely valuable for Census 2000 and we plan to explore ways to reap benefits for ACS as well.  Finally, we are also working with our colleagues from private sector survey, research, and data dissemination organizations.  Representatives from these organizations were involved in early ACS product development meetings and serve on our standing professional advisory committees.  Our standing advisory committees will have a major emphasis on the ACS during the next decade and we have private sector representation on these committees.  Up-to-date small area address counts from ACS operations will be beneficial to private companies conducting surveys, small area data on characteristics, such as race and ethnicity, will help them stratify their area samples, and general-purpose data products from the ACS will allow the private sector to develop new specialized data products that contain current, rather than outdated, information.          HOW ACS WORK IS PROGRESSING        Mr. Chairman, in your letter of invitation you asked a number of technical questions about how the ACS will be conducted.  I would like to address those questions now in the context of     describing what the ACS is, what work has been completed thus far, and the plans for full implementation.        Progress and Plans for the ACS      I want to begin by talking briefly about what the ACS is not.  It should not be viewed as a ""baby"" decennial census.  The decennial census requires the careful building of a massive infrastructure of offices, equipment, staff, advertising, and the like--all the things that I have discussed with you over the last several months.  The ACS will not require additional offices, but will be run out of our regional offices.  Field interviewers, who work on other surveys in addition to the ACS, will use existing laptop computers, and laptops from Census 2000 can be used as replacements.  We will not require special data capture centers, as that will be accomplished in our processing center in Jeffersonville, Indiana.  We will use the Master Address File for drawing the sample, although a critical element in the overall success of the ACS will be the ability to keep the MAF up-to-date and accurate over the decade and the Census Bureau is building in processes to do that.  We are working to provide electronic versions of maps that will reside on the interviewers' laptops; this will reduce the massive requirements for paper copies of maps we encounter in the decennial census.  We do not anticipate, at this time, any advertising expenditures for the ACS because its small monthly sample size would make it inefficient to use mass marketing methods such as we needed for the decennial census.  We will expect to use community partnerships, which we have found to be very effective in the early test sites.  So the ACS will be based on making the most efficient use of existing systems and infrastructure.      The ACS is a large monthly household survey conducted using mailed questionnaires, telephone interviews, and visits from the Census Bureau's field representatives.  Sample cases for the ACS will be selected using the Master Address File, which, as I said, will be kept up to date throughout the decade.  The Census Bureau will mail questionnaires to each address in the sample and will use purchased lists of telephone numbers to interview households that do not mail back their form.  We will select a one-in-three sample of the addresses not interviewed by mail or telephone and conduct personal visit interviews.  For those households that do not respond by mail, the quality of data is improved by using well-trained, permanent interviewers with computers to complete interviews.  Computer-assisted interviewing allows the Census Bureau to incorporate consistency checks of the data into the collection process.  Data quality is further improved by the use of a permanent staff to code write-in entries for processing.      When the ACS reaches full implementation in 2003, there will be approximately 250,000 housing units in each monthly survey or about 3 million per year.  The ACS will produce annual data on content items equivalent to the decennial census long form for all communities in the country, including small areas such as census tracts, small towns, and rural counties.  The first data for communities of 65,000 people or more will be available in 2004, about 6 months after the 2003 data collection year ends, and every year thereafter.  The first data for communities with fewer than 65,000 people will be available over the following 2-5 years because it will take that long to accumulate sufficient sample size for these smaller areas.  By 2008, 4-5 years before detailed data could be expected to be available from the 2010 census, the first data will be available for the smallest areas and groups.  It will be updated annually from then on.      Over the last 5 years of phased-in testing, the Census Bureau has demonstrated the feasibility of the ACS methodology.  Prototype testing of the ACS began in 1996 in four American communities.  By 1999, the number of sites involved in these small scale tests had risen to 31; these 31 sites consist of 36 counties.  The ACS has one of the most successful household response rates of any demographic program conducted by the Census Bureau.  The final weighted response rate for the 31 sites is over 97 percent.        Next week, the Census Bureau will release data for 21 of the 31 sites included in the ACS in 1999.  The data being made available for these sites include long form topics such as housing, education, employment, and income. Comparable data will not be available from Census 2000 until 2002 and 2003.   Appendix 1 illustrates the kind of data that will be available by showing a profile from a recent ACS data release.      Data are being collected in the same 31 sites this year, using the $20 million in the FY2000 appropriations for this purpose.  The work is conducted out of the Census Bureau's regional offices and involves about 150 field representatives, most of whom also work on other surveys.  An operational test to ensure that the ACS can be conducted separately from, but during the same period as, a decennial census, is also underway this year.  This operational test is collecting data over 12 months using the ACS questionnaire from a national sample of about 700,000 households in some 1,200 counties.  This operation involves about 1,100 field representatives, again, most of whom work on other surveys.      These data will also contribute to a comparison with data from Census 2000 that is necessary because there are differences in methods and definitions between the census and the ACS.  Moreover, decision makers will want to compare an area's data to those from Census 2000.  Comparisons using data from the operational test and from the 31 sites are essential to determine how much measured change between Census 2000 and future years of the ACS is real and how much is due to operational differences between the ACS and the census.        Data for Small Areas and Groups      The fact that the ACS sample size and design will not provide data for the smallest areas and population groups until late in the coming decade has led some to raise the concern that the ACS may be treating rural areas unfairly.  This concern was expressed in report language in earlier appropriations bills.  The Census Bureau takes this concern very seriously.  Indeed, we wish it were possible to begin providing small areas and groups (and this is not just rural areas but urban census tracts and smaller population groups, whether urban or rural) with high quality, current data right away.  But that would basically involve replicating the decennial long form every year, and that is not acceptable in terms of costs or respondent burden.  Once again, we are faced with balancing competing demands.      But the Census Bureau takes even the perception that rural areas are being treated unfairly very seriously and has worked with rural data experts to allay those concerns.  The Census Bureau contracted with WESTAT to bring together rural experts and get their suggestions for improving the ACS from the perspective of rural areas.  The group of a dozen experts, who met in May, 1998, expressed strong support for the ACS and provided several suggestions for further research and changes that might make the ACS even more valuable to rural areas.      The Census Bureau has also worked with the Rural Policy Research Institute, based in Columbia, Missouri.  Their Executive Director, Chuck Fluharty, has co-authored a paper presented to the Congressional Rural Caucus entitled ""The Importance of the American Community Survey for Improved Rural Community Policy.""  We have also worked with local planners in two of the smaller rural sites among the 31 sites--Otero County, New Mexico, and Fulton County, Pennsylvania.  Even with the understanding that they will receive data later than large urban areas, planners in both of these counties strongly support ACS because it will eventually give them annually updated, current information each and every year--a much better situation than they have now.      So while concerns have been raised about data for rural areas, the Census Bureau believes that the current ACS design is widely seen as a major improvement over the existing situation.      CLOSING        Mr. Chairman, I appreciate this first opportunity to discuss the ACS in some detail before the Subcommittee.  I hope we will have many more opportunities to brief you on this innovative development.  The ACS represents the best that the Census Bureau and the entire statistical system, working together, can achieve when new strategies are required to address current and future data needs.   Over the last several months, we have had extensive discussions about Census 2000.  Much work is yet to be done on Census 2000, but it is not too early to begin looking to the future.  The ACS is that future and the future is already here.      I credited the cooperation and civic responsiveness of the American people for helping us have a good census.  When we begin releasing data from Census 2000, we will begin to give something back to the American people for all they've done.  The ACS will continue to give data throughout this coming decade.  At the Census Bureau, we like to talk about the census as a ""snapshot"" of the American people at one point in time; if that is so, then the ACS will be a streaming video of what is going on in our country.  It will provide data users who have to make decisions every day, not just every 10 years, the data they need.  Mr. Chairman, that concludes my testimony.  I will now answer any questions."

The U.S. Bureau of the Census generates two sets of files specifically        related to the topics of commuting to work and work location. Most Census        products deal with employed persons by where these persons reside. The        transportation files are unique in that considerable data is provided        about employed persons by where the persons work. One set of files has        traditionally been called the Journey-to-Work data. The other set of files        is the Census Transportation Planning Package (CTPP). Selected tables from        these files have been placed on this web site. The data selected is        primarily county-level data. The CTPP data is also released at the traffic        analysis zone (TAZ) level. In this Region, the Data Analysis Subzones        (DASZ) are equivalent to TAZs. Persons needing TAZ (DASZ) data from the        CTPP should contact MRCOG. Additional data, as it is released by the        Census, will be added to this site throughout the summer of 2003.

GX024-79-4797064	PREPARED STATEMENT OF     CHARLES LOUIS KINCANNON  DIRECTOR  U.S. BUREAU OF THE CENSUS    Before the Subcommittee on Technology, Information Policy, Intergovernmental Relations   and the Census     U.S. House of Representatives    Tuesday, 13 May 2003    Good morning. On behalf of the Census Bureau, I would like to thank you, Mr. Chairman, and the House Subcommittee on Technology, Information Policy, Intergovernmental Relations, and the Census for inviting me to testify this morning. This is an important opportunity to bring the subcommittee up to date on the progress that the Census Bureau has made with the American Community Survey. It is also important to highlight the role of the American Community Survey in a successful decennial census in 2010. After all, these components of a redesigned 2010 census serve one goal: to provide data that will meet the needs of America in the 21st century.     The American Community Survey is a critical component for a successful census in 2010. The American Community Survey will deliver useful, relevant data, comparable to the long form, updated every year instead of every ten years. The American Community Survey will allow for the elimination of the long form in the decennial census, allowing the Census Bureau to focus its entire effort in 2010 on the complete and accurate enumeration of every person living in America.      This count is the basic responsibility of the decennial census as prescribed in the Constitution; yet, the decennial census has never focused solely on the task of counting every person. The census has always focused on current needs for timely, relevant data. Significant policy decisions are supported, opposed, and evaluated according to data. The decennial census is the bedrock for the nation''s statistical programs, providing the most detailed measurement of the nation''s population and housing at every level of geography.     Data from the decennial census are authoritative because they are accurate, reliable, and consistent throughout the entire nation. They are trusted throughout the government to make important decisions affecting the daily lives of every person living in America. Each year, approximately $200 billion of the money that Congress appropriates is allocated through funding formulas that rely in part on decennial census data. Poverty rates, marital status, household composition, educational attainment, median household income, median property valuesaffect the range of opportunities and options available to every neighborhood and community. The ability of first responders ---- fire, police, and rescue ---- to respond effectively is affected by data from the decennial census. For example, the Department of Agriculture helps many rural communities each year through the Community Facilities Loan program. This program can help volunteer fire companies to purchase new equipment, to replace aging equipment. It depends in part on poverty data from the census.    The question for today is whether the existing system of delivering data for every state, reservation, county, city, town, and census tract only once a decade can meet the expectations and demands of this nation.     This is a rapidly changing nation with urgent needs for timely data. In Florida, for example, during the 1990s, the population expanded substantially, changing the composition of many communities. In Brandon, for instance, the number of people who do not speak English at home more than doubled ---- from approximately 5000 in 1990 to 11,000. Closer to Washington, DC, Loudoun County was among the fastest growing counties in the nation ---- the population grew by 96 percent from 1990 to 2000, meaning much more than just traffic congestion on Route 7. The school system, in an attempt to try to keep pace with the needs of a growing student population, had already taken its own census before the long form results for 2000 were published.    The good news is that the Census Bureau is moving to improve dramatically the way that we deliver crucial and important characteristic data. With the American Community Survey, we will eliminate the long form by collecting these data every year. While this will change the way that we get our information, we will continue to provide the long form-type data that are used throughout government and the private sector. The real difference is that, once fully implemented, the American Community Survey will offer updated data every year for every neighborhood in the country.      The 2004 President''s budget includes funding to implement the American Community Survey at full sample next year, in the final quarter of 2004. This will provide tract level data comparable to the long form two years before long form data could possibly be available from the decennial census in 2010. The American Community Survey will provide data for areas and groups of 65,000 persons or more even earlier, in 2006. This means there will be detailed characteristic data for areas such as New York City, including each of the five boroughs, Los Angeles, Sacramento, Dallas, St. Louis, Atlanta, Hillsborough County, Tampa, as well as Warren County, Ohio and Brockton, Massachusetts in 2006. Detailed summary data at the national level for large minority groups, including Blacks, American Indians, Asians, Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders, and Hispanics will also be available. And, in many cases, the Census Bureau will be able to provide similar summaries for these communities at the state or city level where the population size can support such data every year from 2006 on.     In 2008, we will start providing data for every county, town, and community between the sizes of 20,000 and 65,000 persons. This means there will be summary data for Gila County, Arizona; Port Huron, Michigan; Bethel Park, Pennsylvania; Hudson, New Hampshire; and Redmond, Washington, and they will be updated every year thereafter.     The tract level data will be available in 2010. The Federal Reserve Board uses these tract level data to prepare disclosure statements and reports on mortgage lending by financial institutions. The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act requires these data. The data are used to evaluate the lending practices of banks to determine whether they meet the credit needs of low and moderate-income neighborhoods, as part of the Community Reinvestment Act. These data are critical to ensuring that lending practices are fair and equitable, to encouraging home ownership, and to establishing stable communities.     The American Community Survey will produce tract level information based on data gathered from three million households each year and averaged over five years. There are two basic distinctions from the long form, however, with regard to data quality. On the one hand, because the five-year aggregations of the American Community Survey will involve fewer household cases than a long form, there will be a higher sampling error in the estimates. However, we believe that this will be offset by more complete responses to the American Community Survey questionnaire that the permanent staff of field representatives will collect.     The American Community Survey uses permanent, experienced employees for telephone and field non-response follow-up. During the decennial census, an enormous temporary workforce must come into existence, be trained, and finish its work within a matter of weeks. In 2000, this meant reaching 42 million housing units in nine weeks. The training that the Census Bureau provided was adequate but of necessity limited. The American Community Survey, on the other hand, will benefit from the training and education of the Census Bureau''s permanent field staff.     Even in the context of the success of Census 2000, the Census Bureau was aware that the operational boundaries of the traditional census were stretched as never before. Knowing this, and anticipating the range of changes taking place throughout this country, has motivated the Census Bureau to develop a new and innovative strategy. This strategy, known as the 2010 Reengineered Census, includes the American Community Survey, modernization of the Master Address File and TIGER®® [Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing] system, and a short form-only census in 2010. The components of this strategy are inextricably linked to one another.     The development of the American Community Survey, along with modernization of the Census Bureau''s geography systems, has enabled the Census Bureau to plan a short form-only census, and we are now well along a path to ensure their success. Moreover, the dramatic advantages of having both the American Community Survey and a fundamentally redesigned, short-form census in 2010 will cost the American taxpayer less than a traditional, long-form decennial census. Our current estimates indicate that three components of the 2010 Census will cost approximately $11.2 billion. However, if we change course right now and revert to a traditional census, the cost will increase to more than $12 billion and perhaps much more.     Our success will rely on your support for the President''s 2004 budget and on our ability to continue early planning and testing for the 2010 census. The American Community Survey is a high return investment in America''s future. It will mean yearly data for growing and changing communities throughout America. Even as we speak, there are thousands of local elected officials and planners struggling to balance diverse community needs; they are trying to establish priorities and invest in the future in an era of constrained budgets. For many communities, the American Community Survey will illuminate the difference between the past and the present, understanding this is the key to being able to move confidently to the future.     Thank you and I would be happy to answer your questions
GX024-76-0954362	"PREPARED STATEMENT OF        HONORABLE DONALD L. EVANS        SECRETARY OF COMMERCE        Before the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation        United States Senate        March 28, 2001                       Mr. Chairman, Senator Hollings, and Members of the Committee:       It is a pleasure to appear before this Committee again and, on this occasion, to discuss with you Census 2000.      Census 2000: An Invaluable Achievement     I have said that the 2000 Census is the most accurate census this nation has ever conducted.  A Constitutional mandate, censuses  have been conducted every 10 years since 1790 -- 22 times in all.  So the success of Census 2000 is a remarkable achievement.  It is attributable to the hard work and dedication of the professional staff at the Census Bureau and all the hundreds of thousands of people, including thousands of your constituents, who worked on Census 2000. I commend them all.  We are indebted also to the American public, whose response exceeded expectations; to the thousands of Census partner organizations; and to the Congress, for your oversight, support, and vision in providing sufficient resources to conduct Census 2000.       This is an exciting period for those who want facts to bolster their understanding of our nation's people.  The Census Bureau began to roll out the results of Census 2000 just three months ago, with the release of the state population totals used for apportionment. Again meeting the schedule set by the Congress, by the end of this week, the Census Bureau will have released for all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, population data--by age, race, and Hispanic Origin--that will be used to redraw legislative districts.       Not only do these current data releases allow the redistricting process to begin, but these are the first data from Census 2000 for counties, cities, towns, townships, and smaller geographic areas. They are the first race and ethnicity data from Census 2000, and the first to show the effect of multiple race reporting.  Not a day has gone by in the last month without numerous news stories about the increasing diversity of our population and about which areas are growing in population and by how much.  I share the fascination: These data tell us so much about ourselves, our neighbors, our great country.  This gold mine of information will continue to yield a wealth of information as the Census Bureau prepares and releases much more data over the next two years.  All of this attention focused on population data reminds us what an important national resource we have in the census.      Census 2000: An Operational Success     Census 2000 was an operational success. The Census Bureau met or exceeded its goals, including meeting the mandated deadlines for releasing data for use in apportionment and       redistricting.  This success can be attributed to the Congress' commitment to provide full funding for a number of improvements, including unprecedented outreach programs to groups that historically had the highest undercounts :         Marketing and Partnerships:   First, the Census Bureau implemented a multi-faceted, aggressive marketing and partnership program to encourage householders to include themselves in the census, by completing and mailing back their census forms.  Based on the experience of declining response rates over the preceding three censuses, the Bureau had anticipated that fewer  households would return forms by mail in Census 2000.  Partnerships--140,000 in all--with state, local, and tribal governments; community and advocacy groups; the private sector; religious organizations; educational institutions; and the Congress were key to building support and removing obstacles to participation in the census.  The Bureau successfully implemented paid advertising for the first time in Census 2000, placing over $100 million in media buys designed to educate and motivate the public to respond.  Paid advertising also allowed the Census Bureau to target ads to groups that had been undercounted at higher rates in past censuses.            Educating Families :  As part of the Census in Schools program, the Census Bureau provided lesson plans, wall maps, and take-home materials to classroom teachers so they could teach lessons on the census.       User Friendly Questionnaires:  The Census Bureau designed the questionnaires so that they would be easier to read and fill out.  The Bureau also sent advance letters and reminder cards before and after the questionnaires were mailed out to increase response.  The Bureau further offered multiple ways to respond, to ensure everyone had a chance to include themselves in the census. These included printing questionnaires in six languages and making available upon request materials in 49 languages to assist people in completing the questionnaire.                  These cumulative outreach efforts were successful.  The expected mail response rate of 61 percent was significantly exceeded, reaching about 65 percent by the start of the field operation to follow up on homes for which a questionnaire was not returned.         Staffing :   The Census Bureau hired and retained enough highly skilled temporary staff,  throughout the course of the census, to complete all operations on time.  Because of a resourceful recruiting plan, research on pay rates and recruiting, and the attractive wages that the Census Bureau could offer because of the full census funding that the Congress provided, the Census Bureau was able to recruit some 3.7 million job candidates and eventually hire 960,000 people over the course of the census.  Over 500,000 worked on the operation to follow up on those homes for which a questionnaire was not returned, and, through their hard work, the Census Bureau was able to complete the enormous task of  personally visiting 42 million homes slightly ahead of schedule.       Quality Checks:   Because of the timely completion of the follow-up operation, the Census Bureau had the time and resources to conduct other operations designed to improve coverage, including  additional re-enumeration efforts in selected areas.  The Census Bureau called these operations ""Quality Counts.""  Based on Census Bureau experience and using various quality indicators, the Census Bureau identified about 10 percent of the Nation's homes that it believed should be visited again in these review, verification, and clean-up operations.  If it had not conducted these additional operations, the Census Bureau would have provided an incomplete enumeration of the population.  The ""Quality Counts"" operations helped improve coverage and the census count.         Technology:   For Census 2000, the Census Bureau used digital imaging and optical-character recognition technology for the first time to recognize handwritten answers in addition to marked circles or boxes.  This was a vast improvement over previous computer systems and allowed the Census Bureau to process the data faster and introduce quality assurance steps to be sure they had captured the data accurately.  During the peak of questionnaire receipts, the Census Bureau's data capture centers processed 3.3 million forms a day.  Each bit of information on the captured census forms was transmitted over secured lines to the Census Bureau headquarters, where staff performed quality control checks to ensure they had complete data.  The improved data capture systems, with the ability to capture names, also meant that the      Census Bureau could offer multiple options for responding to the census with confidence that it could find and remove duplicate responses.      The Result:  A Highly Accurate Headcount     The operational improvements not only contributed to the ability to meet legal deadlines,  but more importantly they also produced an improved count.  The Census Bureau conducted an independent survey of approximately 314,000 housing units--called the Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation (A.C.E.)--that was designed to measure net census coverage.  It was also designed to measure differences in coverage rates for key groups.       The first chart attached to this testimony illustrates the remarkable job the Census Bureau did in counting people in Census 2000.  According to current estimates from the A.C.E., Census 2000 achieved a net coverage rate for the total population of 98.82 percent.  Even better, the estimated coverage rates for individual groups were also very high. The coverage rate for Non-Hispanic Blacks was 97.83 percent; for Hispanics, 97.15 percent; for American Indians and Alaska Natives on Reservations, 95.26 percent; for American Indians and Alaska Natives off Reservations, 96.72 percent; for Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders, 95.40 percent; for Non-Hispanic Asians, 99.04 percent; and for Non-Hispanic Whites, 99.33 percent.  The A.C.E. results thus support the conclusion that Census 2000 achieved both reduced net and differential undercoverage from 1990 census levels.         Attached are two additional charts showing estimated net undercount rates for key groupings of the population for 1990 and 2000.  Chart 2 shows net undercount rates for the total population and race and Hispanic-origin groups.  Chart 3  shows net undercount rates for age and sex groups, owners, and renters.       The A.C.E. estimates that the net national undercount was reduced from the 1990 census rate of 1.61 percent to 1.18 percent for Census 2000, a reduction of about one-fourth.  This reduction is substantial and reflects high census quality.  The A.C.E. further found that not only was the net undercount reduced, but there was a substantial reduction in the undercount rates for certain groups and in the differential undercount.  In 1990, minorities, renters, and children were differentially undercounted, that is, undercounted at higher rates than the population as a whole.  While these groups still have higher undercount rates, the differential has dropped considerably.       The estimated undercount rate for Non-Hispanic Blacks was cut by about half  -- it dropped from 4.57 percent in 1990 to 2.17 percent in 2000; and the estimated undercount rate for Hispanics dropped by about 40 percent from 4.99 percent to 2.85 percent.  The undercount rate for American Indians and Alaska Natives on Reservations in Census 2000 was 4.74 percent, a reduction of about 60 percent from the 12.22 percent published for 1990.  For American Indians and Alaska Natives off Reservations, Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders, and Non-Hispanic Asians, Census 2000 showed undercount rates of 3.28 percent, 4.60 percent, and 0.96 percent, respectively. The undercount rate for renters has dropped from 4.51 percent to 2.75 percent and for children has been reduced by about half from 3.18 percent to 1.54 percent.      The Question of Statistical Adjustment     Throughout the planning for Census 2000, a major issue of concern to the Census Bureau was whether the results of the A.C.E. could be used to make the census counts more accurate.  In June 2000, the Census Bureau Director preliminarily decided that using the A.C.E. for this purpose was generally feasible, but to reach a final decision, it would be necessary to consider operational data to validate the successful conduct of the A.C.E., to assess whether the A.C.E. measurements of undercount are consistent with historical patterns of undercount and independent demographic analysis benchmarks, and to review measures of quality. (1)   The Bureau has long used demographic analysis as an independent check on the quality of the count. Unlike the A.C.E., which is a sample survey, demographic analysis uses records and estimates of births, deaths, legal immigration, and Medicare enrollments, and estimates of emigration and net undocumented immigration to estimate the national population, separately from the census.       A team of Census Bureau professionals--called the Executive Steering Committee for A.C.E. Policy or ESCAP-was formed to conduct the evaluation to determine whether using the A.C.E. to adjust the census figures would improve the results for use in redistricting.  After extensive meetings and staff work and the review of many analytic reports, the ESCAP completed its report (2) , and Acting     Director Barron submitted that report and recommendation, along with his recommendation, to me on March 1, 2001.       As a member of the ESCAP and as Acting Director, Mr. Barron concurred with and approved the ESCAP's recommendation that unadjusted census data be released as the Census Bureau's official redistricting data.  The ESCAP reached its recommendation because it was unable, based on the data and other information it had at the time, to conclude that the adjusted data were more accurate for use in redistricting.       The ESCAP found that both the census and the A.C.E. were of very high quality.  The primary reason for arriving at its conclusion that unadjusted data should be released was the apparent inconsistency between A.C.E. and demographic analysis.  The demographic analysis estimates are significantly lower than both Census 2000 and the A.C.E. estimates for important population groups.  The ESCAP investigated this inconsistency extensively, but in the time available could not adequately explain it.  The ESCAP noted that the inconsistency between the demographic analysis estimates and the A.C.E. estimates is most likely the result of one or more of three scenarios:       First, that the 1990 census and the associated coverage measurement methodologies together undercounted the population by a significantly greater amount and degree than previously believed, but that Census 2000 included portions of this previously unenumerated population.       Second, that demographic analysis may not have accounted for the full population growth between 1990 and 2000.       Third, that Census 2000, as corrected by the A.C.E., overestimates the Nation's population.        The Census Bureau must further investigate these concerns before it can recommend that adjustment would improve accuracy of data for purposes other than redistricting.  It is also investigating other potential errors that could affect the accuracy of the adjusted numbers.  All of these issues are discussed in detail in the ESCAP's report, which we are making available for the record.       After receiving the Census Bureau's recommendation,  I thoroughly reviewed the ESCAP's report and supporting materials, and I obtained advice from a diverse group of prominent, non-government statisticians and demographers, in addition to the advice of the Census Bureau professionals.   On March 7, I announced my decision to release the unadjusted data for use in the redistricting process.  In making my decision, I followed a process that was transparent, reasonable and fair, and took full account of the view of career professionals and outside experts.       I should emphasize that ESCAP could not have resolved the critical questions about use of adjusted data prior to the April 1 deadline for completing release of redistricting data to the states, or even soon thereafter.  I am confident that the Committee did all that it could, and that it reached the only reasonable conclusion.      The Road Ahead to Census 2010     As I have said many times, Census 2000 is the most accurate in our nation's history.  But we cannot rest on our laurels.  The Census Bureau has already begun looking toward 2010.         While Census 2000 was an operational success and produced data of high quality, the process was costly, many people felt burdened by having to answer the long form questions, and the census was constantly at risk due to insufficient early planning and development, and disagreement on the design.  If the Census Bureau has adequate resources early to build upon the successes of Census     2000, then it can reduce operational risks for the 2010 census and explore ways to further reduce the undercount.         In a letter of January 17, 2001, from Mr. Chris Mihm of the General Accounting Office to my predecessor, Secretary of Commerce Norman Mineta, Mr. Mihm announced that Census 2000 had been removed from the GAO's list of high-risk Federal government programs.  That Census 2000 was on this list is a reminder of the great challenges the Census Bureau faced and overcame in conducting a successful census.  In his letter, Mr. Mihm stated:       ""As the Bureau plans for the 2010 Census, it will be important for the Department of Commerce to ensure that the Bureau completes its evaluations of key census operations as      planned, and in a timely manner, explores innovative options that could help ensure a cost-effective headcount in 2010.""       Completing Census 2000 evaluations will shed further light on what worked well or did not work in this census.  To build on the success of Census 2000, to reduce operational risk, and to reduce the undercount even further, the Census Bureau must improve the accuracy of its geographic database and Master Address File, eliminate the long form from the decennial census by collecting those data in the American Community Survey, and reengineer the census process through early planning.  The improved geographic systems will ensure that there is a complete and unduplicated address list and will facilitate automation and electronic data collection.       In this regard, the American Community Survey will provide more frequent detailed data for small geographic areas and allow the Federal statistical system to keep pace with ever increasing demands for timely and relevant data.  And it will revolutionize the way we take the decennial census by simplifying the 2010 census requirements and allowing the Census Bureau to focus exclusively on the basic count.  However, early 2010 planning and development is necessary for a re-engineered process for the 2010 census, taking advantage of opportunities provided by having improved geographic systems and the American Community Survey.       As reflected in the President's budget, details of which will be released shortly, the Administration supports the Census Bureau's 2010 efforts.  I look forward to working with Members of this Committee, other interested Committees and Members of Congress,  to define and provide appropriate support for the total Census 2010 effort. We cannot delay, as every day brings us closer to what will be an even greater challenge to capture our increasingly diverse, vibrant population.         Mr. Chairman, that concludes my testimony.  I will be pleased to answer any questions you may have.     1.

ENUMERATION AND RESIDENCE RULES In accordance with census practice dating back to the first U.S. census in 1790, each person was to be enumerated as an inhabitant of his or her ``usual residence'' in Census 2000. Usual residence is the place where the person lives and sleeps most of the time. This place is not necessarily the same as the person's legal residence or voting residence. In the vast majority of cases, however, the use of these different bases of classification would produce substantially the same statistics, although there might be appreciable differences for a few areas. The implementation of this practice has resulted in the establishment of rules for certain categories of people whose usual place of residence is not immediately apparent. Furthermore, this practice means that people were not always counted as residents of the place where they happened to be staying on Census Day (April 1, 2000). United States Enumeration rules. Each person whose usual residence was in the United States was to be included in the census, without regard to the person's legal status or citizenship. As in previous censuses, people specifically excluded from the census were citizens of foreign countries temporarily traveling or visiting in the United States who had not established a residence. Americans temporarily overseas were to be enumerated at their usual residence in the United States. With some exceptions, Americans with a usual residence outside the United States were not enumerated in Census 2000. U.S. military personnel and federal civilian employees stationed outside the United States and their dependents living with them, are included in the population counts for the 50 states for purposes of Congressional apportionment but are excluded from all other tabulations for states and their subdivisions.

Other Americans living overseas who were not affiliated with the U.S. government were not included in the census. Residence rules. Each person included in the census was to be counted at his or her usual residence the place where he or she lives and sleeps most of the time. If a person had no usual residence, the person was to be counted where he or she was staying on Census Day. People temporarily away from their usual residence on Census Day, such as on a vacation or business trip, were to be counted at their usual residence. Armed forces personnel in the United States. Members of the U.S. Armed Forces were counted at their usual residence (the place where they lived and slept most of the time), whether it was on or off the military installation. Family members of armed forces personnel were counted at their usual residence (for example, with the armed forces person or at another location). Personnel assigned to each Navy and Coast Guard vessel with a U.S. homeport were given the opportunity to report an onshore residence where they usually stayed when they were off the ship. Those who reported an onshore residence were counted there; those who did not were counted at their vessel's homeport. Personnel on U.S. flag merchant vessels. Crews of U.S. flag merchant vessels docked in a U.S. port, sailing from one U.S. port to another U.S. port, or sailing from a U.S. port to a Puerto Rico port were counted at their usual onshore residence if they reported one. Those who did not were counted as residents of the ship and were assigned as follows:  The U.S. port, if the vessel was docked there on Census Day.  The port of departure, if the ship was sailing from one U.S. port to another U.S. port, or from a U.S. port to a Puerto Rico port. Crews of U.S. merchant ships docked in a foreign port (including the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam), sailing from one foreign port to another foreign port, sailing from a U.S. port to a foreign port, or sailing from a foreign port to a U.S. port were not included in the census. People away at school. College students were counted as residents of the area in which they were living while attending college, as they have been since the 1950 census. Children in boarding schools below the college level were counted at their parental home. People in institutions. People under formally authorized, supervised care or custody, such as in federal or state prisons; local jails; federal detention centers; juvenile institutions; nursing or convalescent homes for the aged or dependent; or homes, schools, hospitals, or wards for the physically handicapped, mentally retarded, or mentally ill; or in drug/alcohol recovery facilities were counted at these places. People in general hospitals. People in general hospitals or wards (including Veterans Affairs hospitals) on Census Day were counted at their usual residence. Newborn babies were counted at the residence where they would be living. People in shelters. People staying on Census Day at emergency or transitional shelters with sleeping facilities for people without housing, such as for abused women or runaway or neglected youth, were counted at the shelter. People with multiple residences. People who lived at more than one residence during the week, month, or year were counted at the place where they lived most of the time. For example, commuter workers living away part of the week while working were counted at the residence where they stayed most of the week. Likewise, people who lived in one state but spent the winter in another state with a warmer climate (``snowbirds'') were to be counted at the residence where they lived most of the year. C2 Data Collection and Processing Procedures U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000   People away from their usual residence on Census Day. Temporary, migrant, or seasonal workers who did not report a usual U.S. residence elsewhere were counted as residents of the place where they were on Census Day. In some areas, natural disasters (hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, and so forth) displaced households from their usual place of residence. If these people reported a destroyed or damaged residence as their usual residence, they were counted at that location. People away from their usual residence were counted by means of interviews with other members of their families, resident managers, or neighbors. Puerto Rico Enumeration rules. Each person whose usual residence was in Puerto Rico was to be included in the census, without regard to the person's legal status or citizenship. As in previous censuses, people specifically excluded from the census were citizens of foreign countries temporarily traveling or visiting in Puerto Rico who had not established a residence. Americans usually living in Puerto Rico but temporarily overseas were to be enumerated at their usual residence in Puerto Rico. Americans with a usual residence outside Puerto Rico were not counted as part of the Puerto Rico resident population. Residence rules. Each person included in the census was to be counted at his or her usual residence the place where he or she lives and sleeps most of the time. If a person had no usual residence, the person was to be counted where he or she was staying on Census Day. People temporarily away from their usual residence were to be counted at their usual residence. People who moved around Census Day were counted at the place they considered to be their usual residence. Armed forces personnel in Puerto Rico. Members of the U.S. Armed Forces were counted at their usual residence (the place where they lived and slept most of the time), whether it was on or off the military installation. Family members of armed forces personnel were counted at their usual residence (for example, with the armed forces person or at another location). Personnel assigned to each Navy and Coast Guard vessel with a Puerto Rico homeport were given the opportunity to report an onshore residence where they usually stayed when they were off the ship. Those who reported an onshore residence were counted there; those who did not were counted at their vessel's homeport. Personnel Puerto Rico Puerto Rico Those who on U.S. flag merchant vessels. Crews of U.S. flag merchant vessels docked in a port, sailing from one Puerto Rico port to another Puerto Rico port, or sailing from a port to a U.S. port were counted at their usual onshore residence if they reported one. did not were counted as residents of the ship and were attributed as follows:   The Puerto Rico port if the vessel was docked there on Census Day.  The port of departure if the ship was sailing from one Puerto Rico port to another Puerto Rico port or from a Puerto Rico port to a U.S. port. Crews of U.S. merchant ships docked in a foreign port (including the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam), sailing from a Puerto Rico port to a foreign port, or sailing from a foreign port to a Puerto Rico port were not included in the census. People away at school. College students were counted as residents of the area in which they were living while attending college, as they have been since the 1950 census. Children in boarding schools below the college level were counted at their parental home. People in institutions. People under formally authorized, supervised care or custody, such as in federal or state prisons; local jails; federal detention centers; juvenile institutions; nursing or convalescent homes for the aged or dependent; or homes, schools, hospitals, or wards for the physically handicapped, mentally retarded, or mentally ill; or in drug/alcohol recovery facilities were counted at these places. Data Collection and Processing Procedures U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  C3   People in general hospitals. People in general hospitals or wards (including Veterans Affairs hospitals) on Census Day were counted at their usual residence. Newborn babies were counted at the residence where they would be living. People in shelters. People staying on Census Day at emergency or transitional shelters with sleeping facilities for people without housing, such as for abused women or runaway or neglected youth, were counted at the shelter. People with multiple residences. People who lived at more than one residence during the week, month, or year were counted at the place where they lived most of the time. For example, commuter workers living away part of the week while working were counted at the residence where they stayed most of the week. People away from their usual residence on Census Day. Temporary, migrant, or seasonal workers who did not report a usual Puerto Rico residence elsewhere were counted as residents of the place where they were on Census Day. In some areas, natural disasters (hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, and so forth) displaced households from their usual place of residence. If these people reported a destroyed or damaged residence as their usual residence, they were counted at that location. People away from their usual residence were counted by means of interviews with other members of their families, resident managers, or neighbors. MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THE CENSUS 2000 PLAN The Census Bureau prepared the Census 2000 plan to ensure the most accurate decennial census legally possible. This plan included data collection from 100 percent of households and housing units. In addition, the plan included an extensive statistical operation to measure and correct overall and differential coverage of U.S. residents in Census 2000. This operation consisted of a scientific sample of approximately 300,000 housing units and used regional groupings to generate corrected counts. To ensure that Census 2000 will be both more accurate and more cost-effective than the 1990 Census, the Census Bureau reviewed its procedures with input from a wide array of experts. In addition, the Census Bureau and Department of Commerce officials held more than 100 briefings for the members of Congress and their staff on the plan for Census 2000. The result has been an innovative departure from past practices that substantially increased overall accuracy and addressed the differential undercount of children, renters, and minorities. At the same time, the new methods of enumeration saved money and delivered results more quickly. The major components of the plan for Census 2000 included: 1. The Master Address File To conduct Census 2000, the Census Bureau needed to identify and locate an estimated 118 million housing units in the Nation. The Census Bureau accomplished this goal by developing and maintaining the Master Address File (MAF). This vital operation took place with the assistance of the U.S. Postal Service (USPS); other federal agencies; tribal, state and local governments; community organizations; and by an intensive canvass of selected areas. The resulting file was more comprehensive than ever before. In 1990, the Census Bureau relied on address lists purchased from vendors. As these lists were originally generated for marketing purposes, they proved to be less accurate in low-income areas. As a result, during the 1990 census, housing units were missed often enough to contribute notably to the undercount problem. Plans for Census 2000 were designed to address weaknesses found in the 1990 address list. The Census 2000 MAF started with the USPS address list, a list that does not discriminate against certain areas because of their marketing potential. Partnerships with state and local officials, community organizations, and tribal governments also played an important role in making sure the MAF is accurate; the local officials who knew the areas best helped develop the MAF. Finally, the Bureau made intensive efforts to create address lists in rural areas well in advance of the census. C4 Data Collection and Processing Procedures U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000   City-style addresses. The USPS uses the term ``city-style'' for an address such as ``123 Main Street,'' even though such an address may occur in small towns and increasingly along country roads. In areas where the USPS delivers mail primarily to city-style addresses, the Census Bureau created the MAF by combining addresses from the 1990 Census Address Control File with those addresses in the USPS Delivery Sequence File (DSF). The DSF is a national file of individual delivery point addresses. As part of a cooperative agreement, the USPS provided the Census Bureau with updated DSFs on a regular basis. The Bureau then located these addresses in its computer mapping system called TIGER (Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing). If an address could not be located, the location was researched and resolved through an office operation or through assistance from local partners. As a result of this research, the Bureau identified new features and corrected and added address ranges to the TIGER database. Noncity-style addresses. In late 1998 and early 1999, the Census Bureau launched a comprehensive effort to canvass areas where most residences did not have city-style addresses. Over 30,000 canvassers visited approximately 22 million residences without a street address to enter their locations in the TIGER system. The combination of innovative use of computer data and technology along with these visits allowed the Bureau to construct the most accurate address list ever, giving field enumerators more time to meet other challenges presented by the 2000 count. Remote areas. In a few extremely remote and sparsely settled areas, census enumerators created the address list at the time of the initial census data collection while canvassing their assignment area and picking up or completing unaddressed questionnaires that the USPS previously had delivered to each household. Nontraditional living quarters. A separate operation built an inventory of all facilities that were not traditional living quarters; for example, prisons and hospitals. The Bureau interviewed an official at each location using a Facility Questionnaire. The responses to the questionnaire identified each group quarters and any housing units associated with the location. The Bureau classified each group quarters and its associated housing units at the location according to whether they would be enumerated as part of special place enumeration or through regular enumeration. The Bureau added these group quarters and housing units to the MAF and linked them to the TIGER database. Local government partnerships. The Bureau relied on local knowledge to build the MAF. State, local, and tribal governments; regional and metropolitan planning agencies; and related nongovernmental organizations were encouraged to submit locally developed and maintained city-style address lists to the Census Bureau to enhance the MAF. The Bureau matched the local lists both to the MAF and TIGER database and verified the status of each newly identified address through ongoing matches to updated address information from the USPS, other independent sources, and its own field operations. The Local Update of Census Addresses (LUCA) program was a partnership that allowed local and tribal governments to designate a liaison to review the portion of the MAF that covered their jurisdiction to help ensure its completeness. After processing the LUCA input, the Census Bureau provided feedback on the status of the adds, deletes, and corrections of addresses to the liaisons. The updated address list then was used to deliver census questionnaires. 2. Public Outreach and Marketing In 1990, the mail response rate dropped in spite of the Census Bureau's support of a public service announcement (PSA) effort that aired donated advertisements. Part of this drop was caused by the Bureau's inability to ensure that PSAs were broadcast at optimum times and in appropriate markets. An evaluation of the 1990 PSA campaign noted that the ads were seldom placed at optimal times because decisions about when to air PSAs rested with local radio and television stations. Sixty percent of the U.S. population received 91 percent of the census advertising impact; 40 percent received only 9 percent. Based on its studies of prior outreach campaigns, the Bureau concluded that the professional control of a paid media campaign would produce the best results. Census 2000 launched a vigorous public outreach campaign to educate everyone about the importance of being counted. Among the improvements in public outreach and marketing were: Data Collection and Processing Procedures U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  C5   Partnerships/targeted community outreach. The Census Bureau built partnerships with local and tribal governments, businesses, and community groups to get the word out, to endorse the census, and to encourage constituents to respond. Beginning in 1996 and expanding in 1998, the Bureau hired government and community specialists to build relationships with local community and service-based organizations, focusing on groups representing traditionally undercounted populations. The Bureau deployed an extensive outreach program to reach schools, public sector employees, American Indians, and religious organizations. Businesses, nonprofit groups, and labor organizations also were asked to endorse participation and to publicize the census through employee newsletters, inserts with paychecks, and through communications with members and local chapters. Direct mail. The census questionnaire and related materials delivered to individual addresses carried the same themes and messages as the overall campaign. Public relations. The Census Bureau used public meetings and the news media to inform the public about the value of the census and to encourage response. Communications specialists were assigned to each field office to perform media outreach, to respond to media inquiries, and to coordinate the dissemination of the Census 2000 message. In many communities, the Census Bureau established local broadcaster/news director committees to emphasize Census 2000 to television viewers and radio listeners through broadcast segments and editorials in newspapers. Paid advertising. The Census Bureau planned a targeted campaign to reach everyone through ads in newspapers, magazines, billboards, posters, radio, and television. A private advertising firm designed and implemented the Census 2000 advertising campaign. The Census Bureau conducted a first-ever paid advertising campaign, including a national media campaign aimed at increasing mail response. The campaign included advertising directed at raising mail response rates among historically undercounted populations, with special messages targeted to hard-to-enumerate populations. Advertising also focused on encouraging cooperation during the nonresponse follow-up procedures. Media public relations. The Census Bureau assigned media specialists to the regional census centers to cultivate local press contacts and respond to local media inquiries. Promotion and special events. A variety of special events, including parades, athletic events and public services television documentaries were cosponsored by state, local, and tribal governments and by community organizations and businesses to motivate people to respond. More ways to respond. In 2000, in addition to mailing the census questionnaires, the Census Bureau made the forms available in stores and malls, in civic or community centers, in schools, and in other locations frequented by the public. A well-publicized, toll-free telephone number was available for those who wished to respond to the census by telephone. People also had the option to respond to the short form via the Internet. Multiple languages. In 2000, as in all prior decennial censuses, questionnaires were in English (the Census Bureau has made Spanish-language questionnaires available in the past). However, for the first time in a decennial census, households had the option to request and receive questionnaires in five other languages (Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Tagalog, and Vietnamese). In addition, questionnaire assistance booklets were available in 49 languages. 3. Questionnaire Mailout/Mailback In Census 2000, the questionnaire mailout/mailback system was the primary means of census-taking, as it has been since 1970. The short form was delivered to approximately 83 percent of all housing units. The short form asked only the basic population and housing questions, while the long form included additional questions on the characteristics of each person and of the housing unit. The long form was delivered to a sample of approximately 17 percent of all housing units. USPS letter carriers delivered questionnaires to the vast majority of housing units that had city-style addresses. In areas without such addresses, enumerators hand delivered addressed census questionnaires to each housing unit. In very remote or sparsely populated areas, enumerators visited each housing unit and picked up or completed unaddressed questionnaires that the USPS previously delivered to each unit. C6 Data Collection and Processing Procedures U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000   4. Collecting Data on Populations Living in Nontraditional Households During a decennial census, the Census Bureau not only counts people living in houses and apartments, but also must count people who live in group quarters and other nontraditional housing units, as well as people with no usual residence. These units include nursing homes, group homes, college dormitories, migrant and seasonal farm worker camps, military barracks or installations, American Indian reservations, and remote areas in Alaska. Some of the methods that were used for these special populations are listed below:  The Census Bureau designed an operation for Census 2000 called Service-Based Enumeration (SBE) to improve the count of individuals who might not be included through standard enumeration methods. The SBE operation was conducted in selected service locations, such as shelters and soup kitchens, and at targeted outdoor locations.  Another special operation counted highly transient individuals living at recreational vehicle campgrounds and parks, commercial or public campgrounds, marinas, and even workers' quarters at fairs and carnivals.  The Census Bureau worked with tribal officials to select the appropriate data collection methodologies for American Indian reservations.  Remote areas of Alaska, often accessible only by small airplanes, snowmobiles, four wheel-drive vehicles, or dogsleds, were enumerated beginning in mid-February. This special timing permitted travel to these areas while conditions are most favorable.  The Census Bureau worked with the Department of Defense and the U.S. Coast Guard to count individuals living on military installations, and with the U.S. Maritime Administration to identify maritime vessels for enumeration. 5. Collecting Long Form Data to Meet Federal Requirements The census is the only data gathering effort that collects the same information from enough people to get comparable data for every geographic area in the United States. The Census Bureau has used the long form on a sample basis since 1940 to collect more data, while reducing overall respondent burden. The Census 2000 long form asked questions addressing the same 7 subjects that appeared on the short form, plus an additional 27 subjects which were either specifically required by law to be included in the census or were required in order to implement other federal programs. 6. Retrieving and Processing the Data From the Returned Forms The Census Bureau contracted with the private sector to secure the best available data capture technology. This technology allowed the Census Bureau to control, manage, and process Census 2000 data more efficiently. The Census 2000 Data Capture System has been a complex network of operational controls and processing routines. The Census Bureau recorded a full electronic image of many of the questionnaires, sorted mail-return questionnaires automatically, used optical mark recognition for all check-box items, and used optical character recognition to capture write-in character based data items. The system allowed the Census Bureau to reduce the logistical burdens associated with handling large volumes of paper questionnaires. Once forms were checked in, prepared, and scanned, all subsequent operations were accomplished using the electronic image and data capture. 7. Matching and Unduplication One of the main goals of Census 2000 was to make it simpler for people to be counted by having census forms available in public locations and providing multiple language translations. Responses also were accepted over the telephone and, for the short form only, on the Internet. These options made it easier for everyone to be counted, but increased the possibility of multiple responses for a given person and household. Advances in computer technology in the areas of computer storage, retrieval, and matching, along with image capture and recognition, gave the Census Bureau the flexibility to provide multiple response options without incurring undue risk to Data Collection and Processing Procedures U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  C7   the accuracy of the resulting census data. Unduplication of multiple responses in past censuses required massive clerical operations. Modern technology allowed the Census Bureau to spot and eliminate multiple responses from the same household. 8. Geographic Database Development--TIGER The Census Bureau's TIGER (Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing) system provided the geographic structure for the control of the data collection, tabulation, and dissemination operations for Census 2000. The TIGER system links each living quarter to a spatial location, each location to a specific geographic area, and each geographic area to the correct name or number and attributes. The database constantly changes; for example, when new streets are built and the names and address ranges of existing streets change. To ensure that the TIGER database is complete and correct, the Census Bureau works with other federal agencies; state, local and tribal governments; and other public and private groups to update both its inventory of geographic features and its depiction of the boundaries, names, and attributes of the various geographic entities for which the Census Bureau tabulates data. The Census Bureau obtains updates to the features in the TIGER system, including associated address ranges, from its various address list improvement activities, from partnership efforts like the Local Update of Census Addresses (LUCA) program, from digital files provided by some local and tribal governments, and from local and tribal governments in response to a preview of the census map of their jurisdictions. As a part of updating the TIGER system, the Census Bureau conducted boundary surveys in 1998 and 1999 to determine the boundaries that were in effect on January 1, 2000, which were the official Census 2000 boundaries for functioning governments. The Census Bureau also relied on other programs to update the TIGER boundaries data, including a program that allowed local or tribal officials to review proposed Census 2000 boundaries a program that allowed local and tribal participants the opportunity to delineate Census 2000 participant statistical areas (block groups, census county divisions, census designated places, and census tracts) and additional programs that offered participants the opportunity to identify other areas for which the Census Bureau would tabulate data (for example, traffic analysis zones). 9. Field Offices and Staffing The Census Bureau opened a national network of temporary offices from which employees collected and processed the data for Census 2000. Establishing the office network required, for most offices, the leasing of office space, purchasing furniture and equipment, purchasing and installing computer hardware and software, and establishing voice and data line connections. The plan for the office structure included:  12 Regional Census Centers (RCCs). Through a network of Census Field Offices, the RCCs managed all census field data collections operations, address listings, and address list enhancement for city-style address areas; coordinated the LUCA program; produced maps; updated TIGER; worked with local participants in the Public Law 94-171 Redistricting Data Program; and recruited temporary staff.  402 Census Field Offices (CFOs). Opened in September 1998, these offices helped with address listing; conducted local recruiting; and performed clerical review of completed field address listing work.  520 Local Census Offices (LCOs). These offices produced enumerator maps and assignments; conducted local recruiting; conducted outreach and promotion; conducted group quarters and service-based enumeration activities; conducted update/leave and list/enumerate operations; conducted nonresponse follow-up, coverage improvement follow-up, and address verifications; and performed the block canvass operations.  3 New Data Capture Centers (DCCs). These centers checked in mail returns, prepared questionnaires, and conducted data capture.  1 National Processing Center (NPC). In addition to performing the functions of a Data Processing Center, it processed address listing data and performed coding of questionnaire data. C8 Data Collection and Processing Procedures U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000   To conduct a successful Census 2000, the Census Bureau recruited and tested hundreds of thousands of applicants for a wide range of positions, such as local census office managers, enumerators, partnership specialists, media specialists, and clerks. This required an extraordinary recruiting effort throughout the country. Every job applicant was required to pass a written test and was screened for criminal history. Applicants selected for employment had to take an oath of office and sign an affidavit agreeing not to disclose census information. Many factors converged to present the Census Bureau with unprecedented challenges in hiring, retraining, and training the necessary employees for Census 2000. To address this challenge, the Census Bureau implemented several new approaches:  Innovative methods of setting pay and incentives.  Expanding the potential labor force by working with other federal agencies and state agencies to reduce barriers presented by various income transfer programs, and encouraging recipients of these programs to work for the Census Bureau. Consistent with these efforts, the Census Bureau hired more welfare-to-work employees than any other federal agency.  Earlier and expanded training for enumerators. 10. Data Collection: Basic Enumeration Strategy To ensure that the Census Bureau obtained a completed questionnaire from every household, or as close to that as possible, the Census Bureau developed a ten-part, integrated enumeration strategy.  The first part of this strategy ensured that a questionnaire was delivered to every housing unit, by one of three data collection methods:  Mailout/mailback. U.S. Postal Service delivered questionnaires to every ``city style'' housing unit with a street name and house number.  Update/leave. Census enumerators delivered questionnaires to housing units without street names and house numbers to be mailed back, mainly in rural areas, and corrected and updated the address list and maps for any additions or errors.  List/enumerate. In remote and sparsely populated areas, enumerators visited every housing unit and completed the enumeration as delivered.  The second part of this strategy provided people with assistance, as needed, to complete and return their questionnaires.  Telephone questionnaire assistance (TQA). The Census Bureau operated a toll-free TQA system, in English, Spanish, and several other languages, providing automated touch-tone answers to common questions, personal operator answers to those requesting it, and special service for the hearing impaired to assist them in completing a short form. Callers also could request a questionnaire.  Internet. Respondents were able to access an Internet Web site to both receive assistance and, for short forms, submit their responses.  Questionnaire assistance centers. The Census Bureau opened Walk-In Questionnaire Assistance Centers in convenient locations to assist respondents with filling out questionnaires in person. Bilingual staff was available in these centers.  Questionnaire assistance guides. languages. Questionnaire Assistance Guides were available in 49   The third part of this strategy provided a means for people who believed they had not received a questionnaire or were not included on one. Part of this operation was targeted to members of historically undercounted groups. The major element of this operation was the distribution of ``Be Counted Questionnaires.'' The Census Bureau distributed these questionnaires at public locations, such as Walk-In Questionnaire Assistance Centers and some public and private facilities, staffed with bilingual competencies when appropriate. These forms were available in English, Spanish, Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Tagalog. Data Collection and Processing Procedures U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  C9    The fourth part of this strategy was designed to enumerate people who did not live in traditional housing units, including group quarters situations, such as nursing homes and college dormitories; people living in migrant farm worker camps, on boats, on military installations; and federal employees living overseas. This part of the strategy was expanded further because the Census 2000 Dress Rehearsal results indicated that, compared to 1990, many more people did not live in traditional housing units.  Group quarters enumeration. This operation identified the location of all group living quarters and made advance visits to each group quarter. Census staff listed all residents in April 2000 and distributed questionnaire packets.  Transient night operation. Transient Night enumerated people living a mobile lifestyle by visiting and interviewing people at racetracks, commercial or public campgrounds and those for recreational vehicles, fairs and carnivals, and marinas.  Remote Alaska enumeration. This operation sent out enumerators to deliver and complete questionnaires for people living in outlying or remote settlements in Alaska.  Domestic military/maritime enumeration. The Census Bureau, in cooperation with the Department of Defense and U.S. Coast Guard, identified living quarters and housing units on military installations and ships assigned to a U.S. home port and used appropriate enumeration methods.  Overseas enumeration. The Census Bureau, in cooperation with the Department of Defense and other departments, counted federal employees assigned overseas (including members of the armed forces) and their dependents, for apportionment purposes.  The fifth part of this strategy targeted people with no usual residence or address. This operation was conducted at selective service locations, such as shelters and soup kitchens and nonsheltered outdoor locations.  The sixth part of this strategy deployed special data collection methods to improve cooperation and enumeration in certain hard-to-enumerate areas.  Regional Census Centers used the planning database and their knowledge of local conditions to identify appropriate areas for targeted methods. A team of enumerators then went to targeted areas, such as areas with high concentrations of multiunit buildings, safety concerns or low enumerator production rates, and conducted team enumerations.  Mail response rates and maps were available to local and tribal officials so they could work with Census Bureau staff to identify low-response areas and implement additional outreach and publicity efforts and targeted enumeration efforts.  In partnership with local and tribal governments and community-based organizations, local census offices established Walk-In Questionnaire Assistance Centers in locations, such as community centers and large apartment buildings, to provide assistance in English, Spanish, and other and foreign languages.  The Be Counted Program made unaddressed questionnaires available in the Walk-In Assistance Centers and other locations.  Letters were mailed to managers of large multiunit structures and gated communities informing them of upcoming census operations.  In preidentified census blocks, census enumerators canvassed the blocks, updated the address list, and delivered and completed census questionnaires for all housing units.  In preidentified blocks originally classified as ``Mailout/Mailback'' areas, enumerators delivered the questionnaire and updated the address list (Urban Update/Leave).  The seventh part of this strategy, coverage-edit and telephone follow-up, reviewed completed questionnaires for potential missing, incomplete, or inconsistent data. C10 Data Collection and Processing Procedures U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000    Coverage edit. The Census Bureau checked completed questionnaires for discrepancies between the number of persons reported and the number of persons for whom information was provided, forms returned where population count was blank, and forms for certain households that contained complex living arrangements.  Follow-up. Telephone clerks contacted and reinterviewed the households with discrepancies identified after mail returns were data captured; field staff resolved discrepancies found on enumerator returned questionnaires.  Content edit. Computer operations identified missing or incomplete responses to population or housing units and used statistical imputation to complete the information.  The eighth part of this strategy, nonresponse follow-up (NRFU), was the effort to secure a response in Census 2000 from every housing unit and resident. One hundred percent of nonresponding households were followed up.  In the initial period, the Census Bureau used reminder publicity urging people to return their questionnaires.  Following the period of mail response, nonresponding households were identified and listed.  Enumerators visited all nonresponding addresses to obtain a completed questionnaire for each household.  In mailout/mailback areas, enumerators also followed up 100 percent of housing units identified as nonexistent or vacant by the U.S. Postal Service.  In update/leave areas, enumerators followed up 100 percent of housing units where the Census Bureau was unable to deliver questionnaires.  The Census Bureau conducted quality assurance checks of NRFU to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the operations.  The ninth part of strategy involved additional operations to improve the coverage of Census 2000.  In mailout/mailback areas, enumerators revisited addresses for which questionnaires were returned in NRFU reporting the housing unit as vacant or delete and which were not initially identified by the U.S. Postal Service as undeliverable as addressed.  In update/leave areas, enumerators revisited addresses for which a questionnaire was returned as vacant or nonexistent in NRFU, but the questionnaire was not returned as undeliverable during the update/leave operation.  In both mailout/mailback and update/leave areas, mail returns checked in but not data captured were rechecked and, if necessary, revisited.  The tenth part of this strategy was unduplication, which involved reviewing and selecting person information when more than one questionnaire data set was reported for a single address. Dress Rehearsal results showed that the multiple ways in which people could respond to the census increased the possibility of more than one response being submitted for a given person or household. Automated matching technologies allowed the Census Bureau to resolve situations where more than one form was received for an address. 11. Special Populations American Indian and Alaska Native Areas and Hawaiian Home Lands The Census Bureau based its strategy for enumerating the populations in the American Indian and Alaska Native Areas (AIANAs) and Hawaiian home lands on building partnerships for:  Address list development. The Census Bureau used U.S. Postal Service's Delivery Sequence Files in AIANAs and Hawaiian home lands where there were city-style addresses. In other areas, the Census enumerators used the ``update/leave'' method where a form is left with the respondent for return by mail. In more remote areas, the census enumerator actually delivered the Data Collection and Processing Procedures U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  C11   form and conducted the census interview all in one visit. Tribal governments had an opportunity to participate in the LUCA program. The Census Bureau worked with tribal officials to select the appropriate data collection methodology for each area.  Geographic programs. There were many programs available to review and define geographic areas (see Appendix A for more details).  Marketing. Census Bureau staff and tribal liaisons compiled lists of available media for paid advertising and promotion. The Census Bureau also enlisted the help of tribal liaisons and locally established ``Complete Count Committees'' to assist with promotional activities.  Field operations. The Census Bureau worked with tribal governments to assist in all levels of field operations, including training local staff in cultural awareness, assisting in recruiting efforts, and identifying locations for census questionnaire assistance centers.  Data dissemination. While most data were processed in the same way as data for rest of the nation, the Census Bureau worked with tribal governments to meet their data needs. Puerto Rico The Census 2000 operations in Puerto Rico were comparable to activities in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The Census Bureau worked in partnership with the government of Puerto Rico to ensure that Census 2000 data met the federal legal requirements.  Build partnerships at every stage of the process. The Census Bureau entered a Memorandum of Agreement with the governor of Puerto Rico which outlined mutual roles and responsibilities. In consultation with the government of Puerto Rico, census questionnaire content was developed to meet the legislative and programmatic needs of Puerto Rico. A separate advertisement and promotion campaign was conducted in Puerto Rico to build awareness of the census and boost participation. Address list development allowed Puerto Rico to participate in the LUCA program.  Census questionnaires. Census questionnaires were readily available in Spanish and also in English, if requested. In Puerto Rico, only update/leave method was used to distribute questionnaires. However, questionnaires also were placed in Walk-In Questionnaire Assistance Centers and other locations identified through consultation with local partners.  Use of technology. The Census Bureau made use of the same technological advances that were used in the United States. Many operations performed clerically in 1990 were automated. Data users have access to Census 2000 data products through the Internet using the American FactFinder (AFF) system. The AFF offers a separate user interface utilizing the Spanish language for Census 2000 Puerto Rico data.  Special techniques to improve coverage. The update/leave methodology for census data collection was used for the first time in Puerto Rico. Census enumerators updated the Master Address File for Puerto Rico while delivering questionnaires. Respondents had the opportunity to complete the census questionnaires and return them by mail. Island Areas The Census Bureau conducted the Census 2000 operations in American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands (collectively referred to as the ``Island Areas'') in partnerships with the government of each area. These partnerships ensured that Census 2000 data met federal legal requirements, as well as the specific needs of each area. The Census 2000 operations in the Island Areas were built around the following:  Data collection. Data collection in the Island Areas used the list/enumerate method. This decision was based on recommendations from Island Area representatives and an analysis of the various data collection methodologies. Unlike stateside list/enumerate procedures, the Census Bureau delivered Advance Census Reports before the list/enumerate operation and asked respondents to complete the form and hold it for enumerator to pick up. C12 Data Collection and Processing Procedures U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000    Build partnerships at every stage of the process. The Census Bureau developed and signed a Memorandum of Agreement with the governor of each Island Area that outlined mutual roles and responsibilities. In consultation with the governments of the Island Areas, census questionnaire content was developed to meet the legislative and programmatic needs of each Island Area. A separate advertisement and promotion campaign was developed for each Island Area to build awareness of the census and boost participation.  Census questionnaires. Census questionnaires and other forms were readily available to respondents in convenient locations identified through consultation with local partners.  Use of technology. The Census Bureau made greater use of the telephone to provide assistance to respondents with questions about Census 2000. Data users have access to Census 2000 data and products through the Internet using the American FactFinder system. 12. Telecommunications Support and Automated Data Processing Using dedicated links and other secure lines, the Census 2000 telecommunications network linked all census offices including: Census Headquarters in Suitland, Maryland, the 520 Local Census Offices, the 12 Regional Census Offices, the 12 Regional Census Centers, the Puerto Rico Area Office, the Maryland Computer Center in Bowie, the National Processing Center in Jeffersonville, Indiana, and the three contracted Data Capture Centers (Phoenix, AZ, Pomona, CA, and Essex, MD). The Census Bureau also established communication links with planned commercial telephone centers to assist with the Telephone Questionnaire Assistance program and the coverage edit follow-up program. The use of electronic imaging reduced the logistical and staffing requirements of handling large volumes of paper questionnaires. Some components of data capture were performed by private-sector partners. The Census Bureau used commercially available advanced hardware and software rather than limiting itself to creating in-house solutions. The most significant features of the Data Capture System included (1) work divided among four centers, (2) full electronic imaging and processing of questionnaires, (3) automated sorting of mailed responses, (4) optical mark recognition for check-box data, (5) optical character recognition for write-in data with automated processes to resolve difficult cases, and (6) quality assurance checks. 13. Quality Assurance To detect, correct, and minimize performance errors Bureau developed individual quality assurance plans errors in outcome, such as misprinted census forms, intelligent character recognition, inadequate training in critical census operations, the Census for all activities that could contribute to inaccurate maps or address lists, faulty of enumerators, and miskeyed entries.  14. The Census 2000 Dress Rehearsal in 1998 A good dress rehearsal is crucial to a successful census, and the key to any dress rehearsal is making it as much like the actual event as possible. The Census Bureau conducted Census 2000 Dress Rehearsal in three sites: Sacramento, California; Columbia, South Carolina along with 11 surrounding counties in north central South Carolina; and the Menominee American Indian Reservation in northeastern Wisconsin. Since the summer of 1996, the Census Bureau worked closely with local officials and community-based organizations in each of the three sites to plan and build the various infrastructures needed to ensure a successful dress rehearsal. These joint activities included refining the geographic database, building and refining the address list, and working with community and tribal organizations to plan effective outreach and promotion efforts. Also, the Census Bureau recruited staff in all three sites to complete address list development and verification. The dress rehearsal allowed for a thorough demonstration of the most critical procedures for Census 2000. These procedures included address list development; marketing and promotion; and data collection, processing, and tabulation. The dress rehearsal plan also demonstrated the use of statistical sampling in four major census operations: nonresponse follow-up, housing units designated as undeliverable as addressed by the U.S. Postal Service, integrated coverage measurement (ICM), and the long form survey. Data Collection and Processing Procedures U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  C13   15. Data Dissemination Through the Internet The census provides a wealth of data that researchers, businesses, and government agencies are eager to use. Taking advantage of modern computer and Internet capabilities, the Census Bureau planned to make data from Census 2000 more readily available than any previous decennial census data. The Census 2000 data are tabulated using the Data Products Production (DPP) system and disseminated using the American FactFinder (AFF) system on the Internet, in addition to CD-ROMs and DVDs. The AFF provides an interactive electronic system to allow data users to access data products, documents, and online help, as well as to build custom data products. The Census Bureau solicited the advice and recommendations of data users throughout the planning, design, and testing stages of the AFF system (initially known as the Data Access and Dissemination System (DADS)). The system is accessible to the widest possible array of users through the Internet and all available intermediaries, including the nearly 1,800 data centers and affiliates, the 1,400 Federal Depository libraries and other libraries, universities, and private organizations. It also allows users to create customized products, such as tables, charts, graphs, and maps for census geographic areas of their choice, and access metadata that provide documentation and explanatory information for data subjects and geographic areas. 16. Evaluation and Preparation for 2010 After the completion of Census 2000, the Census Bureau plans to conduct a variety of post census evaluation studies, as it has after all the previous censuses. These studies will help data users, both within and outside the Census Bureau, to assess the data and plan for the 2010 Census. The evaluation studies generally rely on demographic analysis, statistical methods, and ethnographic analyses. GLOSSARY 100-Percent Data Information based on a limited number of basic population and housing questions collected from both the short form and the long form for every inhabitant and housing unit in the United States. 100-Percent Edited Detail File (HEDF) Files composed of individual records of information on people and housing units for the 100-percent census data items from the census questionnaires. Estimation is included in these files. These files are used for tabulation purposes and are not released to the public. Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation (A.C.E.) The Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation (A.C.E.) is a survey designed to measure the undercount/overcount of the census. The A.C.E. was designed to assess the size and characteristics of the population missed or double-counted in Census 2000, similar to the originally planned Integrated Coverage Measurement (ICM) Survey. Advance Notice Letter/Reminder Card (ANL/RC) These are part of the questionnaire mailing strategy. In every area except list/enumerate, the Census Bureau sends an advance notice letter to every mailout address to alert households that the census form will be sent to them soon. Reminder Card is a postcard that is sent to addresses on the decennial Master Address File (see definition below) to remind respondents to return their census questionnaires or to thank them if they already have. All addresses in mailout/mailback areas receive a postcard. The Census Bureau also mails these postcards to postal patrons in update/leave areas. American FactFinder (AFF) An electronic system for access and dissemination of Census Bureau data. The system is available through the Internet and offers prepackaged data products and the ability to build custom products. The system serves as the vehicle for accessing and disseminating data from Census 2000 (as well as economic censuses and the American Community Survey). The system was formerly known as the Data Access and Dissemination System (DADS). C14 Data Collection and Processing Procedures U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000   Apportionment Apportionment is the process of dividing up the 435 memberships, or seats, in the House of Representatives among the 50 states. The Census Bureau has a dual responsibility in this connection. It conducts the census at 10-year intervals. At the conclusion of each census, the Census Bureau uses the results for calculating the number of House memberships each state is entitled to have. The latter process is the initial use of the basic results of each census. Be Counted Enumeration and Be Counted Form The Be Counted enumeration procedure targets areas that are traditionally undercounted. Unaddressed census questionnaires (Be Counted forms) are placed at selected sites where people who believe they were not counted can pick them up, complete them, and mail them to the Census Bureau. The sites are in targeted areas that local governments and community groups, in conjunction with the Census Bureau, identify as traditionally undercounted. Census 2000 Publicity Office (C2PO) An office at the Census Bureau which developed, implemented, and coordinated an integrated marketing program for Census 2000, including paid advertising, direct mail, public relations, partnerships, and local outreach. Census Address List Improvement Act of 1994 See Program for Address List Supplementation (PALS) below. Census Edited File (CEF) This file contains the 100-percent edited characteristics/records for all households and people in the census. The edits include consistency edits and imputation for items or persons where the data are insufficient. See descriptions for 100-percent data and census unedited file. Census Information Center (CIC) The Census Information Center Program (CIC) is the community-based component of the Census Bureau's data dissemination network. While census data are readily available on CD-ROM, the Census Bureau's Web site on the Internet, in its 12 Regional Offices, 1,400 Federal Depository Libraries, and 1,800 state and local government agencies participating in the State Data Center Program, the CICs provide access to local communities that might not have access through these traditional channels. CIC's goal is to provide efficient access to Census Bureau data and data products to organizations representing populations that have been traditionally undercounted in censuses and surveys. Census Unedited File (CUF) A file created by merging the control file for the decennial master address file with the decennial response file of unedited data after the primary selection algorithm has been applied. This file contains the final housing unit and person counts. It is used to generate apportionment data as well as related ``raw'' or unedited census data. Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) A method of data collection consisting of the interviewer asking questions displayed on a laptop computer screen and entering the answers directly into the computer. Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) A method of data collection using telephone interviews in which the questions to be asked are displayed on a computer screen and responses are entered directly into the computer. Data Collection and Processing Procedures U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  C15   Confidentiality The guarantee made by law (Title 13, United States Code) to individuals who provide census information regarding nondisclosure of that information to others. Confidentiality Edit The name for the Census 2000 disclosure avoidance procedure. Coverage Edit/Coverage Edit Follow-Up (CEFU) An edit performed on the mailback census response universe. Census staff make telephone calls to resolve forms that are incomplete or have other coverage discrepancies, such as a difference between the number of people reported in that household and the number of people for whom census information was provided on the form. This edit includes the large household follow-up. Coverage Improvement Adjustment This phrase was included in the table outlines and the technical documentation before the review, analysis, and recommendation on whether to adjust Census 2000 data for coverage improvement was completed. As the data are not adjusted, a zero (0) will appear. This phrase does not refer to any other outreach or collection operations which were introduced to improve coverage in Census 2000. Coverage Improvement Follow-Up (CIFU) A procedure for the traditional census in which housing units with conflicting status information are followed up. Data Access and Dissemination System (DADS) The system is now known as the American FactFinder (AFF). Data Capture Center (DCC) A decentralized facility that checks in questionnaires returned by mail, creates images of all questionnaire pages, and converts data to computer readable format. The DCCs also perform other computer processing activities, including automated questionnaire edits, work flow management, and data storage. There is one permanent DCC, the National Processing Center in Jeffersonville, Indiana. For Census 2000, the Census Bureau set up three temporary DCCs. The temporary facilities were provided and operated by a private contractor through the Data Capture Services contract. Data Capture System 2000 (DCS 2000) The DCS 2000 is a data capture system that is used to capture information from census forms. For Census 2000, this system processed more than 150 million incoming forms, digitally captured and processed billions of bits of information on the forms, converted automatically the image of the form to text-based data, and edited/repaired data that the system was unable to decipher automatically. Decennial Census The census of population and housing, taken by the Census Bureau in years ending in 0 (zero). Article I of the Constitution requires that a census be taken every 10 years for the purpose of reapportioning the U.S. House of Representatives. Decennial Master Address File (DMAF) The decennial version of the Master Address File has features for controlling and tracking the long- and short-term operations and programs of the Census 2000. The DMAF contains the processing status information to support document mailouts; data capture progress control, tracking, and reporting; and field enumeration processes (notably follow-ups). The DMAF is limited to addresses that the Census Bureau has successfully linked to the TIGER database. See Master Address File. C16 Data Collection and Processing Procedures U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000   Decennial Response File (DRF) Contains every response to the census from all sources. The primary selection algorithm is applied to this file to unduplicate people between multiple returns for a housing unit and to determine the housing unit record and the people to include at the housing unit. The DRF is then combined with the Decennial Master Address File to create the census unedited file (CUF). Delivery Sequence File (DSF) A computerized file containing all delivery point addresses serviced by the U.S. Postal Service (USPS). The USPS updates the DSF continuously as its letter carriers identify addresses for new delivery points or changes in the status of existing addresses. Demographic Analysis (DA) A method the Census Bureau uses to measure coverage at the national level. It differs from survey coverage estimates, such as Post-Enumeration Survey, Integrated Coverage Measurement, or Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation, in that it does not rely on case-by-case matching of census records. To produce an estimate of the total population, DA relies on administrative records to provide estimates of births, deaths, immigration, and emigration. DA provides estimates on the national level only. Derived Measures Census data products include various derived measures, such as medians, means, and percentages, as well as certain rates and ratios. Derived measures that round to less than 0.1 are normally indicated as 0. Disclosure Avoidance (DA) Statistical methods used in the tabulation of data prior to releasing data products to ensure the confidentiality of responses. Dual-System Estimation (DSE) The estimation methodology used for the Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation (A.C.E.). This operation uses a geographic sample of block clusters to find people missed by the census or A.C.E. and any errors from the census. The information is then processed using computer matching, clerical matching, and field follow-up to resolve discrepancies. Family A group of two or more people who reside together and who are related by birth, marriage, or adoption. Geocoding A code assigned to identify a geographic entity; to assign an address (such as housing unit, business, industry, farm) to the full set of geographic code(s) applicable to the location of that address on the surface of Earth. Group Quarters A facility where people live that is not a typical household-type living arrangement. The Census Bureau classifies all individuals not living in households as living in group quarters. There are two types of group quarters institutional (for example, correctional facilities, nursing homes, and mental hospitals) and noninstitutional (for example, college dormitories, military bases and ships, hotels, motels, rooming houses, group homes, missions, shelters, and flophouses). Heterogeneity Heterogeneity occurs when blocks of housing units assigned to sampling strata or groupings are not similar in terms of the likelihood of being included or missed by the census. Heterogeneity creates difficulty for the small area estimation process because the correction factor gets applied to all people with the specified characteristic in that sampling poststratum, even through some of them do not actually have the coverage characteristics. Data Collection and Processing Procedures U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  C17   Homogeneity The assumption of homogeneity expects that all people in a particular sampling stratum or grouping will be very much alike in terms of their likelihood of being included or missed by the census. The grouping of people in a particular stratum is called poststratum, such as all White, non-Hispanic male renters ages 18-22 in a rural area. A lack of homogeneity in a particular sample block is not an error, but it does create difficulty for the small area estimation process. This happens because the correction factor gets applied to all people with the specified characteristic in that poststratum, even though some of them do not exhibit the same coverage characteristics. Household Household refers to all of the people who occupy a housing unit. Housing Unit A housing unit is a house, an apartment, a mobile home or trailer, a group of rooms, or a single room occupied as a separate living quarters, or if vacant, intended for occupancy as a separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live separately from any other individuals in the building and which have direct access from outside the building or through a common hall. For vacant units, the criteria of separateness and direct access are applied to the intended occupants whenever possible. Imputation When information is missing or inconsistent, the Census Bureau uses a method called imputation to assign values. Imputation relies on the statistical principle of ``homogeneity,'' or the tendency of households within a small geographic area to be similar in most characteristics. For example, the value of ``rented'' is likely to be imputed for a housing unit not reporting on owner/renter status in a neighborhood with multiunits or apartments where other respondents reported ``rented'' on the census questionnaire. In past censuses, when the occupancy status or the number of residents was not known for a housing unit, this information was imputed. Internet Questionnaire Assistance (IQA) An operation which allows respondents to use the Census Bureau's Internet site to (1) ask questions and receive answers about the census form, job opportunities, or the purpose of the census and (2) provide responses to the short form. Interpolation Interpolation frequently is used in calculating medians or quartiles based on interval data and in approximating standard errors from tables. Linear interpolation is used to estimate values of a function between two known values. Pareto interpolation is an alternative to linear interpolation. In Pareto interpolation, the median is derived by interpolating between the logarithms of the upper and lower income limits of the median category. It is used by the Census Bureau in calculating median income within intervals wider than $2,500. List/Enumerate A method of data collection in which temporary field staff, called enumerators, list each residential address, spot the location of each on a census map, and interview the residents of the household during a single visit. This completes the census address list for these areas and provides the information needed to update the TIGER database and Master Address File (see definitions below). Local Update of Census Addresses (LUCA) A Census 2000 program, established in response to requirements of P. L. 103-430. It provided an opportunity for state, local, and tribal governments to review and update individual address information in the Master Address File and associated geographic information in the TIGER database before using the addresses for questionnaire delivery. This improved the completeness and accuracy of both computer files and the census. C18 Data Collection and Processing Procedures U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000   Long Form The decennial census questionnaire, sent to approximately one in six households, contains all questions on the short form, as well as additional detailed questions relating to the social, economic, and housing characteristics of each individual and household. Information derived from the long form is referred to as sample data and is tabulated for geographic entities as small as the block group level. Mailout/Mailback (MO/MB) A method of data collection in which the U.S. Postal Service delivers addressed questionnaires to residents who are asked to complete and mail back the questionnaire to the appropriate Census Bureau office. This method is used for more than 80 percent of all households (usually with city-style addresses). Master Address File (MAF) A computer file based on a combination of the addresses in the 1990 census address file and current versions, supplemented by address information provided by state, local, and tribal governments. The MAF is continually updated to provide a basis for creating the Census 2000 address list, the address list for the American Community Survey, and the address list for the Census Bureau's other demographic surveys. Metadata Information about the content, quality, condition, and other characteristics of data. Microdata Nonaggregated data about the units sampled. For surveys of individuals, microdata contain records for each individual interviewed; for surveys of organizations, the microdata contain records for each organization. Nongovernment Organization The partnerships developed during Census 2000 planning include national and local organizations and community groups that are not governmental entities. Nonresponse Follow-up A census follow-up operation in which temporary field staff, known as enumerators, visit addresses from which no response was received. Nonsampling Error Errors that occur during the measuring or data collection process. Nonsampling errors can be the most serious types of errors because they yield biased results when most of the errors distort the results in the same direction. Unfortunately, the full extent of nonsampling error is unknown. Decennial censuses traditionally have experienced nonsampling errors, most notably undercount, resulting from people being missed in the enumeration processes. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Technology that uses an optical scanner and computer software to ``read'' human handwriting. Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) Technology that uses an optical scanner and computer software to scan a page, recognize the presence of marks in predesignated areas, and assign a value to the mark depending on its specific location and intensity on a page. Data Collection and Processing Procedures U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  C19   Poststratum Information about the current occupants of each housing unit in the Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation (A.C.E.) survey found during the A.C.E. interview is used to form groupings called ``poststrata.'' This information, including the age of respondent, current owner/renter status, etc., is used to form homogeneous groupings and improve the estimation process. By contrast, the initial A.C.E. strata are formed using aggregate information about each block as of the 1990 census. Primary Selection Algorithm (PSA) Computer program applied to the decennial response file (DRF) to eliminate duplicate responses and to determine the housing unit record and the people to include at the housing unit. After this procedure, the DRF is merged with the Decennial Master Address File to create the census unedited file. Program for Address List Supplementation (PALS) A program providing all governmental units and regional and metropolitan agencies the opportunity to submit lists of individual addresses for their community to the Census Bureau for use in building the MAF. Ongoing submissions and feedback between the Census Bureau and local governments on this program, enabled by the Census Address List Improvement Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-430) help ensure the completeness and accuracy of the Master Address File and the TIGER database. Public Law (P.L.) 94-171 Public Law (P.L.) 94-171, enacted in 1975, directs the Census Bureau to make special preparations to provide redistricting data needed by the 50 states. Within a year following Census Day, the Census Bureau must send the data agreed upon to redraw districts for the state legislature to each state's governor and majority and minority legislative leaders. To meet this legal requirement, the Census Bureau set up a voluntary program that enables participating states to receive data for voting districts (e.g., election precincts, wards, state house, and senate districts) in addition to standard census geographic areas, such as counties, cities, census tracts, and blocks. Public Law (P.L.) 103-430 Public Law (P.L.) 103-430, enacted in 1994, amends Title 13, United States Code, to allow designated local and tribal officials access to the address information in the Master Address File to verify its accuracy and completeness. This law also requires the U.S. Postal Service to provide its address information to the Census Bureau to improve the Master Address File. Public Law (P.L.) 105-119 Public Law (P.L.) 105-119, enacted in 1997, directs the Census Bureau to make publicly available a second version of Census 2000 data that does not include the corrections for overcounts and undercounts measured in the Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation (A.C.E.). The format, timing, geographic levels, and price of the P.L. 94-171 and these data are identical. Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) An area that defines the extent of territory for which the Census Bureau tabulates public use microdata sample (PUMS) data. Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) Hierarchical files containing small samples (5% and 1%) of individual records from the census long form showing characteristics of the housing units and people included on those forms. C20 Data Collection and Processing Procedures U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000   Quality Assurance (QA) Quality assurance represents a broad philosophy and specific procedures that are designed to build quality into the system, constantly improve the system, and integrate responsibility for quality with production. Questionnaire Mailing Strategy For Census 2000, an advance notice letter, a questionnaire, and a reminder/thank you postcard were sent to every mailout address. Reapportionment The redistribution of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives among several states on the basis of the most recent decennial census as required by Article 1, Section 2 of the Constitution. See apportionment and redistricting. Redistricting The process of revising the geographic boundaries of areas from which people elect representatives to the U.S. Congress, a state legislature, a county or city council, a school board, and the like to meet the legal requirement that such areas be as equal in population as possible following a census. See apportionment and reapportionment. Sample Census Edited File (SCEF) A file containing 100-percent and sample characteristics for housing units and people in the long form sample. Processing for the SCEF includes merging the results of industry and occupation coding and place of work and migration coding, coding several other items, and weighting the long forms. Sample Edited Detail File (SEDF) A file containing 100-percent and sample characteristics for housing units and people in the long form sample. The file is used for tabulation purposes only and is not released to the public. Sampling Error Errors that occur because only a part of the population is being contacted directly. With any sample, differences are likely to exist between the characteristics of the sampled population and the larger group from which the sample was chosen. However, sampling error, unlike nonsampling error, is readily measured. Sampling Stratum A sampling stratum, as used in the A.C.E., is a grouping or classification that has a similar set of characteristics, based on the 1990 census. For example, one might define a stratum as all blocks in large central cities with a 1990 census population that was 30 percent or more Black renters. Scanner Equipment used to capture images from documents for the purpose of entering the information into an electronic format. For Census 2000, scanners replaced some keying operations. Seasonal/Recreational/Occasional Use A housing unit held for occupancy only during limited portions of the year, such as a beach cottage, ski cabin, or time-share condominium. Data Collection and Processing Procedures U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  C21   Separate Living Quarters Those living quarters in which the occupants live separately from any other individual in the building and which have direct access from outside the building or through a common hall. For vacant units, the criteria of separateness and direct access are applied to the intended occupants whenever possible. Service-Based Enumeration (SBE) An operation designed to enumerate people at facilities where they might receive services, such as shelters, soup kitchens, healthcare facilities, and other selected locations. This operation targets the types of services that primarily serve people who have no usual residence. Service Locations Locations where clients are enumerated during the service-based enumeration operation, such as emergency or transitional shelters, soup kitchens, regularly scheduled mobile food vans, and targeted nonsheltered outdoor locations. Short Form The decennial census questionnaire, sent to approximately 5 of 6 households, that contains population questions related to household relationship, age, sex, relationship, race, Hispanic origin, and tenure (i.e., whether home is owned or rented). The questions contained on the short form also are asked, along with additional questions, on the long form. Simplified Enumerator Questionnaire (SEQ) A questionnaire that enumerators use for transient, or T-night, enumeration and when conducting the nonresponse follow-up after the decennial census. Soup Kitchens Includes soup kitchens, food lines, and programs distributing prepared breakfasts, lunches, or dinners. These programs may be organized as food service lines, bag or box lunches, or tables where people are seated, then served by program personnel. These programs may or may not have a place for clients to sit and eat the meal. These are service locations. Special Place An institution that includes facilities where people live or stay other than the usual house, apartment, or mobile home. Examples are colleges and universities, nursing homes, hospitals, and prisons. Often the facilities that house people are group quarters, but they may include standard houses or apartments as well. Special Place Facility Questionnaire (SPFQ) A questionnaire used to interview an official at a special place for the purpose of collecting/updating address information for the special place and any associated group quarters and housing units, determining the type of special place/group quarters, and collecting additional administrative information about each group quarters at the special place. State Data Center (SDC) A state agency or university facility identified by the governor of each state and state equivalent to participate in the Census Bureau's cooperative network for the dissemination of census data. SDCs also provide demographic data to local agencies participating in the Census Bureau's statistical areas programs and assist the Census Bureau in the delineation and identification of statistical areas. C22 Data Collection and Processing Procedures U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000   Summary File (SF) A series of census summary tabulations of 100-percent and sample population and housing data available for public use on CD-ROM and the Internet. In 1990, these files were available on computer tapes and, as a result, were known as summary tape files (STF). Summary Table A collection of one or more data elements that are classified into some logical structure either as dimensions or data points. Tabulation Block A physical block that does not have any legal or statistical boundaries passing through it; or each portion of a physical block after the Census Bureau recognizes any legal or statistical boundaries that pass through it. Targeted Nonsheltered Outdoor Location (TNSOL) A geographically identifiable outdoor location open to the elements where there is evidence that people might be living without paying and who also do not usually receive services at soup kitchens, shelters, and mobile food vans. These sites must have a specific location description that allows a census enumeration team to physically locate the site and excludes pay-for-use campgrounds, drop-in centers, post offices, hospital emergency rooms, and commercial sites (including all-night theaters and all-night diners). Telephone Questionnaire Assistance (TQA) A toll-free service that was provided by a commercial phone center to answer questions about Census 2000 and the Census 2000 questionnaire and to take interviews from people who prefer to be interviewed over the telephone. Thematic Map A map that reveals the geographic patterns in statistical data. Title 13 (United States Code) The law under which the Census Bureau operates and that guarantees the confidentiality of census information and establishes penalties for disclosing this information. Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) A computer database that contains a digital representation of all census-required map features (streets, roads, rivers, railroads, lakes, and so forth), the related attributes for each (street names, address ranges, etc.), and the geographic identification codes for all entities used by the Census Bureau to tabulate data for the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas. The TIGER database records the interrelationships among these features, attributes, and geographic codes and provides a resource for the production of maps, entity headers for data tabulations, and automated assignment of addresses to a geographic location in a process known as ``geocoding.'' Transient Night (T-Night)/T-Night Enumeration (TNE) A method of enumeration in which Census Bureau staff enumerate people at transient locations, such as campgrounds at race tracks, recreational vehicle campgrounds or parks, commercial or public campgrounds, fairs and carnivals, and marinas. Enumerators conduct a personal interview using Simplified Enumerator Questionnaire. No vacant units are generated by this operation. Type of Enumeration Area (TEA) A classification identifying how the Census Bureau takes the decennial census of a geographic area. Examples of TEAs include (1) the area inside the ``blue line'' - this is the mailout/mailback and urban update/leave operations area, (2) address listing areas, (3) list/enumerate areas, and (4) remote areas of Alaska. Data Collection and Processing Procedures U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000  C23   Urban Update/Leave (UU/L) Update/leave procedures are used in targeted urban areas where mail delivery may be a problem, such as an apartment building where the mail carrier may leave the forms in a common area. Enumerators deliver census questionnaires for residents to complete and mail back, update the address register, and update the census maps. Usual Home Elsewhere (UHE) A housing unit that is temporarily occupied by a person(s) who has a usual home elsewhere. Usual Residence The living quarters where a person spends more nights during a year than any other place.

A big step toward the computer age occurred on this day in 1889 — as Herman Hollerith patented a tabulating machine.  It was designed to help process data gathered in the 1890 Census.  The increasing size of the population made it difficult to tabulate census returns by hand so that seats in the House of Representatives could be reapportioned on a timely basis.  Hollerith’s punch card concept worked so well it was used until the 1960s, and his firm later became IBM.  Today, computers are a mainstay at most jobs.

GX238-84-4185942	"Chapter 3  Local Census Statistical Areas Committees and Other Local Assistance Small-Area Geography Since the turn of the century, the Bureau of the Census has directed major efforts toward identifying geographic statistical units at the subcounty level that are sufficiently populous to provide statistically significant data. The Census Bureau has developed several programs to provide a geographic framework for the tabulation and analysis of demographic and economic data at a subcounty scale. The Census Bureau recognizes numerous legally defined geographic entities for data presentation purposes, entities that generally are well known, such as States, counties, cities, and townships, whose governments function to provide services to the people living and working within their borders. These governmental units, however, usually do not provide sufficient geographic coverage to give a comprehensive, detailed picture of the distribution of the population on the landscape, especially in highly populated counties. Moreover, many of these governmental units have frequently changing boundaries, vastly differing population densities, extensive variation in population characteristics, and wide-ranging area sizes. These situations make it difficult for data users to summarize and analyze census statistics. To meet the need for geographic areas that would effectively supplement and complement the legally established areas, the Census Bureau, in association with data users across the Nation, has devised several types of geographic entities that generally define small, relatively permanent geographic areas for which the Census Bureau can present statistics.  Purpose of Local Participation The division of counties, highly populated places, and other entities into small geographic areas based on their statistical significance, rather than on the basis of Census Bureau operational considerations alone, requires  Sources of Local Assistance 3-1   a knowledge of local geographic conditions and small-area variations in the physical environment and local demographic and economic characteristics. On a nationwide scale, this task is not only immense, but it requires expert local knowledge that generally is not available at the Federal level of government. The most widely used subcounty statistical entity is the census tract. Other small-area statistical geographic units of analysis devised by the Census Bureau include census county divisions (CCDs), unorganized territories (UTs), census designated places (CDPs), block numbering areas (BNAs), block groups (BGs), and census blocks.1 Originally, local census tract committees, now called Census Statistical Areas Committees (CSACs), assisted the Census Bureau in establishing and maintaining census tracts for use in presenting data from each census of population and housing. In addition, they served as local liaisons between data users and the Census Bureau. Later, these committees expanded their role slightly when they identified specific census tracts as central business districts (CBDs) for the census of retail trade. With the expanding scope of the Census Bureau's small-area geographic programs, the role of the CSACs expanded as well. During the 1970s, and even more so in the 1980s, the CSACs became advocates for, and very involved with, the delineation and review of several other small-area statistical geographic entities; areas that are no longer part of the inventory of small-area statistical geography: the data collection units for earlier decennial censuses, enumeration districts (EDs), and two entities used for several earlier censuses of retail trade, central business districts (CBDs), and major retail centers (MRCs). The 1990 census no longer required EDs, so the Census Bureau invited the CSACs to participate instead in the delineation of BGs in order to improve the usefulness of these areas to data users; although participation was optional, most committees participated to some degree. The rather limited geographic areas served by these committees, often only one or a few counties, left large expanses of territory with no local participation. This led the Census Bureau to seek partnership with State  3-2  Sources of Local Assistance   and tribal officials to oversee the local involvement in geographic area delineation and data user assistance. This chapter provides an overview of the specific technical functions performed by the CSACs, numerous State and other agencies, and tribal officials involved in delineating, reviewing, and maintaining small-area geographic units for purposes of data presentation. It also discusses the manner in which many of these committees, agencies, and officials operate, and their relationship to the Census Bureau's operations and to the opportunities posed by the automation of the Census Bureau's Geographic Support System.  Role and Function of Local Committees Development of Cooperative Efforts Dr. Walter Laidlaw, a clergyman, originated the concept of small, permanent geographic areas that retain their identity for long periods of time and are not subject to the vagaries of the location and relocation of boundaries of various legal entities. In 1905, he proposed dividing the city of New York into small, permanent geographic areas, later called census tracts. The Census Bureau adopted his plan as part of the 1910 decennial census. Beginning in the 1920s, Howard Whipple Green, a statistician in Cleveland, became a leading advocate of census tracts and other small areas. For more than 25 years, Green encouraged local citizens, via Census Tract Committees, to establish such areas and to use the resulting data for local applications. He actively promoted the Census Tract Committees as a mechanism for preparing census tract plans, and worked tirelessly to make data users aware of the value of small-area statistics. In 1931, the American Statistical Association (ASA) appointed Green chairman of its newly created Committee on Census Enumeration Areas. This committee, with the Census Bureau's support, encouraged the creation of census tracts in the most populous cities throughout the Nation. Although the establishment of census tracts has always been a matter of local initiative, the Census Bureau has, nonetheless, taken a keen interest in the work of the Census Tract Committees. In  Sources of Local Assistance  3-3   1934, it issued the Census Tract Manual, a set of instructions that specified the delineation procedures and prescribed standards such as a minimum population size and acceptable boundaries. Such guidelines assured that data could be gathered and published systematically and consistently for census tracts. The publication of the manual marked an important early effort on the part of the Census Bureau to promulgate its geographic standards at the local level. For further information about the Census Bureau's geographic standards, see Chapter 2, ""Geographic Overview,"" and Chapter 10, ""Census Tracts and Block Numbering Areas."" Expansion of Census Tract Committee Functions The functions of the committees gradually broadened through introduction by the Census Bureau of additional programs requiring the identification and delineation of new geographic units. One example of this increased local involvement occurred in the 1950s when the Census Bureau asked the Census Tract Committees to expand their functions by designating, for the census of retail trade, the whole census tract (or group of census tracts) that constituted the CBD of each metropolitan area. This expansion in functions was a direct recognition of the valuable work done by the committees on census tracts. Many committees also assisted in identifying MRCs even though these areas did not cover whole census tracts. This function continued with each of the economic censuses through 1982, after which, due to cost considerations, the declining relevance of CBD statistics, and a lack of local interest in identifying MRCs, the Census Bureau discontinued using CBDs and MRCs as standard data reporting units. For the 1950 census, the Census Bureau officially established the concept of the CDP, then known as an unincorporated place. The Census Bureau consulted with the Census Tract Committees on the identification and delineation of CDPs within their area of jurisdiction for the 1960 census, and included CDP delineation as a standard part of the responsibility of each committee for the geographic preparations in advance of the 1970, 1980, and 1990 censuses.  3-4  Sources of Local Assistance   For the 1960, 1970, and 1980 censuses, the Census Bureau offered local officials the opportunity to submit ED plans for consideration when it prepared field assignment maps. Some committees participated in this voluntary program, and the Census Bureau subsequently tabulated decennial census data for EDs. During the 1970s, a few committees became involved in the definition of BGs and the related numbering of census blocks through their work with the GBF/DIME-Files.2 In 1975, the Census Bureau recognized the broadening responsibilities of the Census Tract Committees by renaming them Census Statistical Areas Committees. For the 1980 census, the Census Bureau asked the CSACs to review its recommended revisions to CCD plans in metropolitan areas. The present status of the CSACs is the result of decades of evolution with increasing levels of participation in the delineation of small-area geographic units. Other Cooperating Agencies and Groups Although local census statistical areas committees are one of the most important groups involved in the definition of small-area geography, they are not the only ones. State, tribal, local officials and agencies who participate in the Census Bureau's geographic areas programs also play important roles. Over the years, their involvement has produced invaluable contributions to the Census Bureau's geographic framework of legal/administrative entities and statistical entities. By means of the Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS), the Census Bureau maintains an inventory of local general-purpose governments (counties, MCDs, and incorporated places) and obtains up-to-date information on their boundaries and status. The success of the BAS program is due to the cooperation of thousands of State, county, and municipal officials (see Chapter 9, ""Places""). Another cooperative effort is the 1990 Census Redistricting Data Program, in which 46 State governments identified their election districts, precincts, legislative districts, and wards--generically termed voting districts (VTDs)--in  Sources of Local Assistance  3-5   terms of census blocks, and were able to obtain statistical information from the Census Bureau's data tabulations (see Chapter 14, ""Voting Districts""). The jurisdiction of the CSACs is limited in most cases to the most highly populated areas; elsewhere, chiefly in nonmetropolitan areas, the Census Bureau relies on State agencies to help create, maintain, and update its framework of subcounty units. Their assistance has been particularly helpful in achieving consistent standards for BNAs, BGs, CDPs, and in States where they exist, CCDs (see Chapter 8, ""County Subdivisions,"" and Chapter 11, ""Census Blocks and Block Groups""). Some geographic entities are designed to identify geographic areas of special interest to indigenous populations, the American Indians and Alaska Natives. To establish these entities, the Census Bureau works with local tribal officials and native groups, as well as the appropriate Federal and State agencies (see Chapter 5, ""American Indian and Alaska Native Areas""). A similar approach is used for Puerto Rico and the Outlying Areas, where the geographic entities often differ from their stateside counterparts (see Chapter 7, ""Puerto Rico and the Outlying Areas""). An important service of the CSACs, State agencies, and tribal officials is to aid in the Census Bureau's efforts to publicize the significance of the decennial census and the other censuses and surveys, and to explain the statistical data and geographic entities available to data users. Another common function for many of these groups relates to making available to the Census Bureau the expert knowledge of their members on the sometimes complex relationship between the boundaries of legally established local entities and the Census Bureau's statistical entities.  Evolution of a Local Census Statistical Areas Committee Establishing a Census Statistical Areas Committee The Census Bureau encourages the existence and active participation of a local CSAC wherever local data users are willing to organize a committee to work on the delineation of small-area geographic entities for use in various Census Bureau programs. Members of a CSAC, representing a  3-6  Sources of Local Assistance   wide variety of public and private agencies and organizations, have extensive knowledge about the development of an area, its communities and neighborhoods, population shifts, land use, and other information pertinent to establishing or updating small-area geographic units. Moreover, they are in the best position to identify and resolve any conflicting local needs regarding the specific structure of the small areas for which both the Census Bureau and local agencies present data. The Census Bureau offers guidance on effective techniques for establishing CSACs. If requested, the Census Bureau will send a technical expert to speak at the formative meeting of a new or reactivated committee and to (1) advise them on the operating procedures other CSACs find successful, (2) explain the types of work the Census Bureau expects them to perform, and (3) describe how they can participate in the Census Bureau's geographic programs. In return, the Census Bureau requests that the CSAC provide information regarding its membership, and that it participate meaningfully in the geographic preparatory work for the Census Bureau's programs. The Census Bureau does not pay for any CSAC expenses; the work is all voluntary. For the local data user community, the primary benefit of the involvement of local committees in the geographic areas definition process results from the development of small, statistically significant areas of local interest for the presentation of census data. The fact that such local entities are statistically meaningful also helps both the casual and the national user. Further, as a result of their long-term familiarity with the Census Bureau's geographic programs, the members of the committees are in a position to acquire an understanding of the associated Census Bureau procedures. This enables them to serve as a conduit of accurate information from the Census Bureau to the local data user community. The committees also assist in keeping the Census Bureau informed of local data user needs. Experience suggests that the statistical areas work is accomplished most effectively when a CSAC establishes small working subcommittees to  Sources of Local Assistance  3-7   handle specific tasks. This organizational structure seems to work particularly well in large, multicounty metropolitan areas. In a typical situation, a subcommittee prepares a preliminary proposal for census tracts, BGs, CDPs, or other requested geographic areas using the Census Bureau's specifications, standards, criteria, and/or guidelines. In large multicounty metropolitan areas, a subcommittee often exists for each county. The subcommittee submits its proposals to the full CSAC, at which time each member has an opportunity to review and discuss all preliminary proposals and make recommendations for modifications. This in-depth review is an important part of the process because it helps to ensure that the proposal takes into consideration all important local statistical requirements. The Census Bureau assumes that all submitted recommendations have the approval of the majority of the CSAC. Composition of a Census Statistical Areas Committee The Census Bureau considers a CSAC to be an independent body representing a wide variety of public and private agencies and organizations, and it requires that all CSACs maintain an open membership policy and include a broad spectrum of local data users. The Census Bureau recommends that a CSAC be composed of at least five individuals who represent more than one agency in the community. For these reasons, the CSAC organizer should provide opportunities for all interested local agencies, organizations, and private citizens to participate. Often, the most effective members of a CSAC are people affiliated with agencies that use small-area statistics in the planning and operation of their organization. Typically, CSAC members are involved in city, county, and regional government agencies such as planning commissions, councils of government, public transportation authorities, boards of education, local housing authorities, health departments, police departments, welfare agencies, and boards of election. Other CSAC members often come from organizations such as chambers of commerce, colleges and universities, social agencies, church federations, real estate boards, banks, savings and loan associations, newspapers, radio and television stations, public utilities, advertising agencies, market research groups,  3-8  Sources of Local Assistance   and the local chapters of professional organizations including the American Marketing Association, the American Planning Association, and the American Statistical Association. Some CSACs have members from organizations such as State highway departments, insurance companies, neighborhood associations, local political organizations, and American Indian tribes. The Census Bureau encourages the CSACs to make their process open to all interested groups or people. The Census Statistical Areas Key Person The Census Bureau requires that each CSAC designate one individual from its membership to serve as the liaison with the Census Bureau. This individual, originally designated as the census tract key person, is called the census statistical areas key person, in keeping with the expanded role of the local committee. The Census Bureau never selects, appoints, or designates a key person; that is the committee's responsibility. Experience shows that the most important element in the successful formation and functioning of a CSAC is the willingness of one or more energetic, dedicated, and knowledgeable individuals to provide leadership, devote time to liaison activities, and coordinate organizational tasks such as arranging for meeting rooms, finding occasional clerical or typing help, and securing limited office space for the development of geographic proposals. The CSAC selects the key person, and the Census Bureau recognizes this person as the point of contact with the CSAC when information flows to or from the committee. The key person usually is, but does not need to be, the CSAC organizer. The designation of a key person is a requirement for official recognition of a CSAC by the Census Bureau. Most CSACs select a key person at the initial organizational meeting or soon thereafter. The designated individual serves as key person at the discretion of the committee. The Census Bureau will not automatically recognize the incumbent of a particular position within an agency as the key person. Typically, the key person functions as the chairperson of, or secretary to, the CSAC, but this is not necessarily the role in which all key persons  Sources of Local Assistance  3-9   function. To avoid misunderstandings and potential conflicts, the Census Bureau expects the key person to be responsible for transmitting CSAC correspondence to the Census Bureau. There are times when the Census Bureau, on very short notice, needs answers to questions concerning the CSAC's proposals or other local census-related matters; the Census Bureau expects the key person to be able to speak for the entire CSAC when there is need for such an immediate response. The Census Bureau sends all relevant correspondence, selected census publications, procedures and guidelines, and other work materials to the key person. The key person also serves as the local point of contact when CSAC members or other data users need Census Bureau statistics. Accordingly, the Census Bureau expects the key person to make available to all local data users any information provided by the Census Bureau as a resource for the CSAC. Furthermore, the Census Bureau will refer any agency or individual with questions about the locally delineated geographic entities or with suggestions for the revision of such areas to the appropriate key person. In some areas, the CSAC or the key person names a work contact in addition to the key person. Often, the work contacts serve as the chairpersons of the working subcommittees for each county in the larger metropolitan areas. If requested to do so by the key person, the Census Bureau will review procedures and discuss questions concerning geographic area proposals with the work contact rather than the key person. In areas where there was no local interest in establishing or reactivating a CSAC, the Census Bureau sought advice and suggestions from tribal officials and from State agencies designated by the State governors' offices. By means of their assistance, it was possible to establish BNAs, BGs, CDPs, and other geographic entities. In many instances these State agencies also were involved in the Census Bureau's State Data Center program.3 Only as a last resort did the Census Bureau have its own staff develop the geographic plans for an area.  3-10 Sources of Local Assistance   New Developments During the 1990s The traditional roles of the Census Bureau's geographic areas programs are (1) to support data collection operations, (2) to provide a spatial framework for the tabulation of the collected data, and (3) to assist in presenting the final results for tabulation and dissemination. These operations are an integral part of the census process. They are present at every level of census geography and encompass all types of geographic entities, whether large or small in population or area. Local cooperation often is an important element throughout these different stages of work, so it is vital that the CSACs, State agencies, and tribal officials share a keen appreciation of the process. Recent decades have brought major advances in automated systems. These advances have opened the door for many new applications of the Census Bureau's geographic units and maps. The Census Bureau recently completed an immense effort used initially for the 1990 decennial census, the automation of its geographic processes as part of the TIGER System. These processes include map production; the assignment of every housing unit, group quarters, and business establishment to its correct geographic location; the classification of that location to all appropriate geographic areas; the recording of boundaries and their associated names and codes, as well as a variety of cultural and physical features, into computer-readable form; and other geographic functions that support the Census Bureau's programs. This extensive project facilitated the preparation of all Census Bureau map series, including the maps used in the 1990 census field operations; permitted more flexibility in the presentation of geographic information on maps; and, most importantly, ensured consistency between the geographic information on the Census Bureau's maps and in its data presentations. It is already evident that this scheme has provided more opportunity for participation by the CSACs, State agencies, and tribal officials. As an example, the Census Bureau encouraged these groups to participate in the BG and CDP delineation programs for the 1990 census. To do so effectively, these groups needed to be aware of the Census Bureau's operational requirements for establishing, delineating, and numbering BGs and blocks. In this  Sources of Local Assistance 3-11   regard, the automation of the Census Bureau's geographic processes facilitated their work, but it also introduced important new tasks and challenges. From the TIGER data base, the Census Bureau provided the CSACs, State agencies, and tribal officials with computer-prepared base maps to use in their review of CDPs, American Indian reservations, trust lands, and other selected geographic entities. As in the past with the committees, preparations for the 1990 census relied on these groups to develop, and then review, an overall geographic plan for their area of jurisdiction or interest. Procedural manuals, developed by the Census Bureau for the 1990 decennial census, documented the technical details and specific tasks that it asked them to perform.  Future Cooperative Relationships Throughout the planning period preceding a census, there is a close working relationship and interchange of technical materials between each CSAC, State agency, appropriate tribal official, and the Census Bureau. It is not unusual for committees to become dormant after a decennial census has been completed. As the Census Bureau begins implementing plans for the next decennial census, it will seek to reactivate the CSACs. When requested, the Census Bureau provides guidance by mail, telephone, or a visit, as appropriate, on technical problems a committee, key person, or other participant may encounter. The Census Bureau also informs the CSAC routinely of additional and revised technical guidelines on smallarea geographic units developed during the planning for a census, reviews the proposed delineations, and, in some instances, revises the work (in consultation with the key person) in order to protect the integrity and comparability of the resulting statistics and/or to maintain a minimum standard on a national basis. The Census Bureau attempts to keep all participants informed of other Census Bureau activities occurring in each area so that they can function effectively as the census voice for their area; promotes communication on the subjects of census tracts, other geographic units, and the related  3-12 Sources of Local Assistance   data; and periodically may convene special meetings, sometimes in conjunction with meetings of professional associations. Before the 1980 census, the Census Bureau dealt with most CSACs, State agencies, and tribal officials directly from its headquarters outside of Washington, DC. For the 1990 census, the Census Bureau decentralized its geographic programs in an effort to be more responsive to local needs and interests. As a result, most CSACs, State agencies, and tribal officials now deal directly with the geographic staff in the Census Bureau's 12 regional offices.

ACTION: Notice of intent to review the standards currently used to define metropolitan areas and to propose standards for defining nonmetropolitan areas following the 2000 census.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  SUMMARY: OMB defines metropolitan areas (MAs) in the United States and Puerto Rico for statistical purposes, following published standards. Statistical purposes include the collection, tabulation, and publication of data by Federal agencies for geographic areas. Decisions related to the criteria used to define MAs are made by OMB in consultation with members of the Metropolitan Area Standards Review Committee (MASRC), a group representing various statistical agencies within the Federal Government. The last revision of the MA standards was issued in 1990 (see Appendix A). OMB currently is conducting a full review of the MA concept and standards.     This Notice describes potential revisions to the MA standards based on findings from the ongoing review. The Notice begins with a brief history of the standards and a discussion of why they may need to be revised. It then lists the findings of the review process to date, distinguishing between points of general agreement and questions still needing to be resolved. The Notice presents four approaches to defining metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas that answer in varying ways the unresolved questions.     Issues for Comment: OMB is interested in receiving comments from the public on (1) the suitability of the current standards, (2) principles that should govern any proposed revisions to the standards, (3) reactions to the four approaches outlined in this Notice, and (4) proposals for other ways by which to define metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. In particular, OMB seeks responses to the following key questions that will determine how metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas will be defined in the future:      What geographic unit should be used as the ""building block"" for defining areas for statistical purposes?      What criteria should be used to aggregate the geographic building blocks into statistical areas?      What criteria should be used to define a set of statistical areas of different types that together classify all the territory of the Nation?  DATES: Comments must be received on or before February 12, 1999.  ADDRESSES: Written comments should be submitted to James D. Fitzsimmons, Population Division, Bureau of the Census, Washington, DC 20233-8800; fax (301) 457-2644.

Summary of the Conference on New Approaches to Defining Metropolitan and Nonmetropolitan Areas  Part I. Background  A. What Is a Metropolitan Area?      Currently, an MA consists of a core area containing a large population nucleus, together with adjacent communities having a high degree of social and economic integration with that core. MAs generally include a city or a Census Bureau-defined urbanized area (UA) with 50,000 or more inhabitants. The county or counties that contain the large city or the UA are the central counties of the MA. Additional outlying counties are included in the MA if the counties meet specified requirements of commuting to or from the central counties and other selected requirements of metropolitan character. The term ""metropolitan area"" is a collective term that refers to metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), consolidated metropolitan statistical areas (CMSAs), and primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSAs). The current (1990) standards for defining MAs are included as Appendix A of this Notice.  B. What Is the Purpose of Defining Metropolitan Areas?      MAs are a Federal statistical standard designed solely for the preparation, presentation, and comparison of data. Before the MA concept was introduced in 1949 with Standard Metropolitan Areas (SMAs), inconsistencies between statistical area boundaries and units made comparisons of data from Federal agencies difficult. Thus, MAs are defined according to specific, quantitative criteria (standards) to help government agencies, researchers, and others achieve uniform use and comparability of data on a national scale.     OMB recognizes that some Federal and state agencies are required by statute to use MAs for allocating program funds, setting program standards, and implementing other aspects of their programs. In defining MAs, however, OMB does not take into account or attempt to anticipate any of these nonstatistical uses that may be  [[Page 70527]]  made of MAs or their associated data. Agencies that elect to use MAs for such nonstatistical purposes are advised that the standards are designed for statistical purposes only and that any changes to the standards may affect the implementation of programs. This policy was documented in OMB memorandum M-94-22, dated May 5, 1994, entitled ""Use of Metropolitan Area Definitions"" (see Appendix B).  C. How Has the Metropolitan Area Concept Evolved?      As early as the first years of the twentieth century, the Federal Government recognized the need to identify large cities and their surrounding areas as single geographic entities and to provide data at that scale for social and economic analysis. Before the adoption of the MA concept in the late 1940s, several other kinds of related geographic areas were defined. These areas were based on different criteria and used by Federal agencies for data reporting purposes. Among these areas were the following:     Industrial Districts. Perhaps the first extensive attempt by the Federal Government to define areas based on a metropolitan concept was the identification of industrial districts for the 1905 Census of Manufactures. The Census Bureau published manufacturing and population data for 13 industrial districts composed of minor civil divisions (MCDs).     Metropolitan Districts. When adopted by the Census Bureau in 1910, each metropolitan district generally comprised a central city of at least 200,000 persons and all adjacent MCDs with population densities of at least 150 persons per square mile. Beginning in 1930, metropolitan districts were defined for all cities of at least 50,000 persons, with the additional requirement that each metropolitan district have a population of at least 100,000. Metropolitan districts were defined in terms of population density; measures of functional integration (such as commuting) were not used.     Industrial Areas. Industrial areas were introduced by the Census Bureau in the late-1920s for the Census of Manufactures to provide a coherent, integrated unit for reporting data related to industrial activity. Each industrial area comprised a county containing an important manufacturing city and adjacent counties with significant concentrations of manufacturing industries. Each of these areas usually employed at least 40,000 factory wage earners. In 1931, there were 33 recognized industrial areas.     Labor Market Areas. Before 1950, labor market areas (LMAs) were defined by the Bureau of Employment Security and consisted of counties and MCDs. Since 1950, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has been responsible for defining LMAs. Current LMA definitions use MAs as starting points and consist of aggregations of counties (see below).     Lack of geographic comparability limited the use of data reported for these and other areas. In the mid-1940s, initial efforts to reconcile metropolitan districts and industrial areas failed, in part because of tensions between two groups, demographic data providers and economic data providers. The former wanted to continue using sub-county geographic building blocks to achieve greater precision and to maintain historical comparability with metropolitan districts. The latter had difficulty identifying precise locations of establishments below the county level and also had concerns about the availability and confidentiality of sub-county data.     The Interagency Committee on Standard Metropolitan Areas decided in March 1948 that counties would form the building blocks for SMAs. The Committee cited the greater availability of data for counties and concluded that use of a unit other than the county would restrict the amount of information available for SMAs and, consequently, would reduce the usefulness of the concept.     SMAs were first used for reporting data from the 1947 Census of Manufactures. The conceptual basis for the SMA was a community of nonagricultural workers who resided in and around a large city and were socially and economically linked with the central city as measured by commuting flows and telephone calls.     Changes to the standards since their adoption for the 1950 decennial census are detailed in Table 1. Few significant changes were made through the 1960s; those that were made affected the designation of central cities forming the cores of MAs. The standards became more complex in the 1970s and 1980s, in part to recognize the increasing variation in patterns of urban settlement. Requirements for central cities were adjusted for the 1980s, with the result that more cities were designated as central. Additional changes at that time meant MAs included fewer outlying counties, which needed to satisfy commuting requirements as well as a number of other criteria, including: population growth rate, percent urban population, percent of population living inside a UA, and overall population density. The 1990 (current) standards differ only modestly from those of the previous decade.     Since their adoption in the late 1940s, the MA standards have acknowledged that within states in New England, cities and towns are administratively more important than counties, and that a wide variety of data are compiled for these areas. For these reasons, cities and towns have been used as the building blocks of MAs in New England. The nonagricultural worker requirement that was present in the earlier standards was not applied in New England. Also, population density requirements differed between New England and elsewhere.     The standards for New England MAs remain different from the standards for the rest of the country. New England County Metropolitan Areas'county-based alternatives to the city-and town-based MAs of that region--were introduced in 1975 to facilitate comparisons between areas in New England and elsewhere.     In addition to MAs, other statistical area classifications currently are in use. These include:     Labor Market Areas. BLS currently defines LMAs, which are used for a variety of purposes, including reporting local area unemployment statistics. LMAs follow county boundaries except in New England, where towns and cities are the geographic building blocks. BLS defines major LMAs based on MSAs and PMSAs as defined by OMB. Outside of MAs, BLS defines small LMAs by aggregating counties (or towns) on the basis of commuting. LMAs are non-overlapping and geographically exhaustive.     Economic Areas. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) defines economic areas (EAs) for reporting geographically detailed economic data and for regional economic analysis. In delineating EAs, BEA identifies economic nodes. These nodes consist of 310 MSAs and PMSAs (NECMAs in New England) plus 38 nonmetropolitan counties. Each county not included in these nodes is analyzed to determine the node with which it is most closely associated. Measures such as commuting patterns and regional newspaper circulation are used to aggregate counties into ""component economic areas,"" which are then aggregated to form the final EAs. EAs are county-based, nonoverlapping, and geographically exhaustive.     In sum, the MA concept is part of an historical lineage of statistical geographic areas and is one of several  [[Page 70528]]  current areas used by Federal agencies for reporting data.  D. Why Should the Metropolitan Area Standards Be Reviewed for Possible Revision?      The MA standards, like other statistical standards, require review to ensure their continued usefulness. Previous reviews and revisions of the MA standards were completed in 1958, 1971, 1975, 1980, and 1990.     Comments received in recent years indicate there are four widely held opinions regarding the current MA standards that argue for their revision:      Many users believe the current standards are overly complex and burdened with ad hoc criteria. Simplifying the standards would improve the chances that the system and its associated data would be understood.      The MA concept has not changed significantly since 1950, yet population distribution and activity patterns in the United States have changed as a result of changes in transportation and other technologies, home/workplace relationships, and patterns of retail and other commercial location. Revised MA standards may better represent increasingly decentralized settlement and activity patterns.      Computer-related advances in data collection, storage, and analysis, especially in technologies related to data geocoding (data linked to its geographic location of occurrence), make it feasible to consider a sub-county unit as the basic geographic building block for constructing statistical areas to represent settlement.      MAs do not exhaustively classify the territory of the United States. As a result, social and economic linkages within the residual, nonmetropolitan territory are not taken into account appropriately in statistical data series.

Issues Posed by the Review      The MA standards are reviewed for possible revisions before each decennial census. The current review began early in this decade and already has included commissioned research, publications, presentations, discussions, and a conference (see Appendix C for notes from the 1995 ""Conference on New Approaches to Defining Metropolitan and Nonmetropolitan Areas""). This review process has elicited the views of Federal Government data providers, data users in the private and academic sectors, and other analysts who use MA data and definitions. Results to date include both points of general agreement and questions remaining to be resolved.  A. Points of General Agreement      There seems to be general agreement on the following:      The Federal Government should continue to define standard statistical areas at the metropolitan level.      Familiar components of settlement, such as those represented by today's MA definitions, should be in evidence in a new system.      Revised standards should broaden territorial coverage by including and officially recognizing nonmetropolitan components of the settlement system.      These statistical areas should be defined according to simplified standards that are applied consistently in all parts of the country using the same geographic building blocks.      If the revised standards define metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas using sub-county building blocks, an associated, alternative set of county-based areas also is desired.  B. Questions Remaining to Be Resolved  1. What criteria should be used to define areas that exhaust the territory of the Nation?     One criticism of the current MA standards is that they do not account for all of the territory of the United States. Although tremendous variation in settlement patterns exists throughout the country, the current system defines individual MAs and leaves all territory outside MAs simply as ""nonmetropolitan."" It has been suggested that all parts of the U.S. territory, from the most to the least populated, should be assigned to a statistical area at the metropolitan or nonmetropolitan level. One approach to account for more of the country's territory would define statistical areas around cores of some minimum size that contain less than the 50,000 population minimum required by current MAs. Reducing the required core population threshold for statistical areas, however, probably still would leave some residual territory, the amount dependent on the core size requirement.     Another approach would be to classify areas based on a measure of settlement form such as population density. This approach would account for all of the territory of the country, although some of the resulting statistical areas probably would be small in geographic extent, population size, or both.     A related issue is the classification of types of locales, such as inner city, suburban, exurban, and rural, and whether such types should be identified within metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. The definitions of MAs in the past have not included such categories.     2. What geographic unit should be used as the building block for defining statistical areas?     MAs currently consist of entire counties, except in New England where towns and cities form the building blocks. Problems with using counties in this capacity have been apparent since the earliest discussions of MAs, as revealed in this 1946 comment on the relative merits of the MCD-based metropolitan district program:     * * * [T]he metropolitan district, based on small subdivisions of a county, comes much closer to representing the central concept of a metropolis and its satellite territory than does the metropolitan county or group of counties. The metropolitan county arose as a mere approximation to the metropolitan district, made necessary by the fact that intercensus population data were compiled on a county rather than on a minor civil division basis. The use of smaller territorial units than metropolitan counties * * * leads to a much more precise analysis of labor and housing markets (Bureau of the Census 1946).     These observations are still pertinent today. Wide regional variation in county size presents a problem when comparing data for different MAs. Further, the large size of some counties can mask smaller, densely populated clusters of settlement, so that patterns of social and economic linkages within counties are difficult to recognize. The use of smaller geographic building blocks, such as county subdivisions or census tracts, might help alleviate these problems.     Although there were critical comments, a key advantage to using counties as the geographic building block also was apparent in the 1940s: a wide range of data is available for counties, with the result that areas composed of counties also have considerable data available for them. (The range of Federal Government data available at the county level that also is, or could be, available for smaller areas is under review.) Counties also are familiar to data users, and their relatively small number may be seen as an advantage. These issues are taken up in more detail in Part III.D. 3. What criteria should be used to aggregate the geographic units into statistical areas?     The current MA system is based on the observation that large urban centers have both form and function. The form, or structural component--what we see on the landscape--is measured using such variables as population size and density. Settlement form largely determines the identification of central cities and central counties. The functional component--interactions of people and activities among places as measured by daily commuting flows--is key to the identification of qualified outlying counties. Substantial agreement exists that population density (or possibly housing unit density) and daily commuting continue to be the best means for defining areas consistently nationwide. At the same time, however, many observers concur that both the structural and functional components of cities and their surroundings have changed significantly since MAs were first defined. These components also have grown increasingly complex and difficult to measure. Part IV presents a classification based solely on measures of form (see Part IV.D), as well as other classifications (see Parts IV.A, B, and C) based on a combination of measures of form (to identify central cores) and measures of function (to identify outlying areas integrated with the core). 4. Should the definition process follow strictly statistical rules, or should it take into account local opinion?     The current standards take local opinion into account in specified circumstances. Application of strictly statistical rules for definition purposes would have the advantage of minimizing ambiguity and making definition of areas less time-consuming. Consideration of local opinion, however, can provide room for accommodating some issues of local significance without impairing the integrity of the system.  [[Page 70533]]  5. What should be the frequency of updating?     In the past, many observers have argued for minimizing changes in area definitions during the course of a decade to ensure that data bases can be maintained consistently and economically. The counter- argument is that definitions should be updated to reflect changed conditions as rapidly as the data permit. The frequency of updating depends in part on decisions concerning basic geographic units, criteria for aggregation, and, ultimately, data availability. Recent practice has been to review areas annually on the basis of Census Bureau population estimates and special censuses.  Part III. Form and Function in Metropolitan and Nonmetropolitan Area Definitions      Metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas have characteristics that are structural, relating to population settlement form (population density, for instance, is a structural measure), and functional, reflecting geographic patterns of social and economic linkages that contribute to the development of an entire area (examples include daily commuting patterns and shopping trips). If a metropolitan and nonmetropolitan classification is purely structural, such as would be the case with areas based solely on population density (and as was the case with metropolitan districts before 1950), then only the degree of settlement is considered. Settlement form sometimes corresponds to patterns of activity and can serve as a surrogate for functional elements. If a system is purely functional and defined solely by measuring activity, then there is no clear depiction of the urban center from which influences arise and around which activity takes place. Current MAs make use of both structural and functional measures.     This portion of the Notice addresses the topics of functional integration, metropolitan character (structural characteristics), central cores, and geographic units used to define metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. Throughout this discussion, the phrase ""metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas"" means those areas defined around urban centers of varying size and complexity. ""Metropolitan"" refers to those areas defined around larger cores (current MAs have cores with at least 50,000 population); ""nonmetropolitan"" refers to areas defined around smaller cores. These terminology conventions are for the immediate purposes of this discussion.  A. Functional Integration  1. Introduction     MAs have represented areas of urban influence extending beyond city limits. The concept of the MA--a core area containing a large population nucleus, together with adjacent areas that have substantial measurable interactions with that core--relies heavily on the notion of functional integration in determining geographic extent. This section discusses metropolitan and nonmetropolitan area functional integration, identifying commuting as the most appropriate indicator of functional integration. 2. Increasing Complexity of Commuting Patterns     The functional measure used in the MA standards has been the daily journey to work. Commuting identifies the extent of each MA in an equitable and uncomplicated way. By establishing place-to-place links between workers' homes and places of employment, commuting has provided a measure of the economic interactions within an area. MAs are units with distinctive identities based, in part, on where people live and where they go to work.     Recently, however, some scholars have suggested that as the United States becomes more interdependent, both internally and with the rest of the world, the concept of metropolitan functional integration needs to be examined more closely (Berry 1995). In addition, the increasing popularity of working at home raises questions about the relevance of commuting in defining metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas.     Researchers (Fisher and Mitchelson 1981, Lewis 1983, Gordon and Richardson 1996, Dear and Flusty 1998) have commented on the growing complexity of metropolitan form and commuting patterns. Harvey (1989) and Fishman (1990) have noted changes in urban form that reflect larger economic forces. These changes call into question the dominance of a large population center over adjacent communities that have high levels of social and economic interactions with the center. Others, like Pressman (1985) and Castells (1989), have identified a new, broader functional integration, citing a variety of technological innovations, including: (1) the expansion of cellular phone and Internet use; (2) the global supremacy of American entertainment, news, and advertising; (3) the market swings driven by political events in distant countries; (4) the migration of factory out-sourcing and back-office operations to low-wage countries; and (5) the speed and flexibility of global finance and ability to move large sums of money around the world instantaneously. All of these developments suggest a change whereby individual places and areas become less important than the network structure itself, and small places become single nodes in a complex system of social and economic linkages created and organized under constantly shifting economic and political circumstances. These innovations point to the growing interdependence of places in general and some blurring of individual place identities.     It is equally clear, however, that the Nation remains the sum of many economic and social parts. Local and regional economies and labor markets continue to show different specialities and levels of performance. Local and regional character still exists, built in part upon identification of place of residence or work and awareness of the locality's history and geography.     The challenge in defining metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas is to select appropriate functions or activities that capture economic and social integration within areas and the differences between areas. Before reconsidering commuting as a measure of functional integration, the following section discusses alternative measures of spatial interaction. 3. Alternative Measures      The Internet provides the newest major medium for information flows across the United States. The aspatial nature of the Internet, however, poses difficulties for measuring functional integration, which assumes the ability to identify the origins and destinations of flows. The origin of each Internet session--the location of the user--generally is identifiable, but the destination is unclear: is it the location of the service provider, the location of the server on which a web page resides, or the physical location of the owner of the web page? Although Internet use generally involves a telephone call to a specific provider location, this is only to gain access to the wider web; the distance between the user and the location of the owner of the accessed web page is unimportant. Because the link between a user and a web page recedes into the background, such linkages defy identification as measures of functional integration between communities.      Telephone traffic patterns were used in early MA definitions until commuting data became more widely  [[Page 70534]]  available and standardized. Issues concerning telephone service coverage largely have disappeared in recent decades.      Cellular telephone systems provide a measure of the functional extent of metropolitan and some nonmetropolitan areas and highlight the role played by highway corridors. Coverage is uneven, however, due to competition between companies and the spatial segregation of different companies' customers. Standardizing the rapidly changing information about users and coverage areas is difficult.      Media markets, or penetration patterns, offer an image of regions to marketers and advertisers, but many of the data are proprietary and exhibit uneven coverage. The advent of the Internet, national editions of newspapers, and cable and satellite television blurs the traditionally local flavor of media markets.      Consumer spending could, in principle, provide a view of the functional extent of regional and metropolitan areas. Consumer expenditure surveys, however, do not provide much data for individual metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas because of limited sample sizes.     In general, these alternative measures of functional integration are not as useful as commuting patterns because they: (1) sometimes depend on data that are not collected by Federal agencies and that may be subject to errors of unknown kind and magnitude; (2) sometimes are not generally accessible by the public (i.e., the measures are proprietary, sometimes copyrighted or for sale); (3) are without observations that are evenly distributed across the U.S. territory; and (4) are not measurable in terms of specific, common geographic units. 4. Continued Usefulness of Commuting Patterns as a Measure     Notwithstanding criticism of continued reliance on information about the daily journey to work, it remains the most reliable and broadly available measure of functional integration for two principle reasons:      Commuting to work is still a significant activity for the vast majority of workers. Recent years have seen a rise in alternative work-residence arrangements. Shortened or irregular work weeks, flextime, full-and part-time work at home, and telecommuting some or all of the time are gaining in importance. The Census Bureau reported a 55 percent increase in those working at home between 1980 and 1990, from 2.2 million to 3.4 million workers. Still, those working at home represented only three percent of all workers in 1990. Ninety-seven percent of workers still commute to work and have separate location spheres for place-of-work and place-of-residence. This long-term pattern reflects the nature of many jobs, for instance, where service provision is location-specific or product manufacture occurs in a fixed location.      The spatial patterns of commuting are more complex today than in previous decades, but no less important. The spatial structure of the urban environment is less consistently monocentric than was the case in the early part of the twentieth century. Given the diffusion of persons and jobs away from the core, commuting patterns are less likely to resemble a hub-and-spoke model than a polycentric structure of multiple employment nodes serving a region's needs. The increased complexity of these patterns, however, has not meant a decrease in their importance.     Over time, commuting patterns in many areas have become more complicated to delineate. Jobs have followed people out of the central city (and the central county), but the traditional urban core, with an employment-intensive central business district, still exists amidst high job growth in suburban areas. Commuting often is multidirectional, with no single dominant flow. The net commuting flow between any two areas may be quite low, while the gross flows may be substantial.     Work is still a dominant organizing activity in most people's lives. While urban settlement form has changed, the basic movement of workers traveling to a different location from where they live continues. The geographic extent of metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas ""depends upon the commuting range, itself historically determined by social and technological conditions"" (Harvey 1989). The journey-to-work activity is nearly universal, even as the geographic nature of commuting has changed in recent decades. The challenge is to model and measure the current nature of commuting patterns to delineate metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas.  B. Metropolitan Character  1. Introduction     Since SMAs were first defined in 1949, counties have needed to exhibit, in addition to integration (as measured by commuting), other attributes referred to collectively as ""metropolitan character"" to qualify as outlying. As the March 1958 MA standards noted, ""The criteria of metropolitan character relate primarily to the attributes of the county as a place of work or as a home for a concentration of non-agricultural workers."" In practice, this has meant an emphasis primarily on population density as one aspect of what makes an outlying county ""metropolitan."" This section addresses the suitability of including measures of metropolitan character--focusing on population density--in standards for defining areas in the next decade. 2. Density and Other Measures of Metropolitan Character     The initial inclusion of population density in the MA criteria reflected some common, contemporary assumptions about U.S. settlement patterns in 1949:      An easily understood built environment: cities were densely settled centers of population and economic activity set against a backdrop of sparsely settled territory.      Population density as a proxy for distance from the central business district: population density declined as distance from an urban center increased.      Relationship of distance from the urban center and population density with social, economic, and cultural attributes of the population: urban and rural communities, for example, were understood to be different in characteristics ranging from industry and occupation to educational attainment and family size.      Most important, metropolitan form and function were invariably linked; that is, metropolitan territory that was linked socially and economically necessarily had visible landscape characteristics and was typified by high relative population density.     Five decades of urban, suburban, and exurban growth may have subsequently altered the meaning of ""metropolitan character."" Since 1949, additional measures of metropolitan character--rapid population growth, percentage of urban population, and presence of UA population-- have been added to the standards to measure other important attributes. Up-to-date MA standards should continue to reflect the evolving nature of settlement patterns and demographic characteristics in the United States. Change in this aspect of the standards is not new: for example, the 1980 MA standards eliminated a metropolitan character criterion pertaining to non-agricultural workers; the steep drop in agricultural employment nationwide had made such a criterion irrelevant.     Enormous variation in population density still exists in the United States, from the densely populated sections of  [[Page 70535]]  some older cities to the sparsely settled areas of the interior West. An increasing share of the Nation's population, however, resides in a built environment that is of neither extremely high nor extremely low density. The percentage of the population living in rural areas has declined from approximately 29 to 24 since 1950, and the percentage of the population living in central cities of metropolitan areas has declined from 33 to 31 despite increases in the number of central cities. In contrast, the percentage of the Nation's population living within MAs but outside central cities has doubled, from 23 to 46. The Nation's population steadily has been moving away from landscapes of population density extremes, both high and low.     Population growth in nonmetropolitan America is occurring predominantly in the smaller cities and towns, particularly in areas adjacent to or near MAs. One consequence of this growth of intermediate density areas is a blurring of many of the sharp differences in population density that once existed between urban and rural areas or between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas.     Improvements in communications technology and transportation infrastructure also have blunted the differences between high-density and low-density areas. In the past, telephones, well-paved roads, and railroads connected rural areas with their urban markets, but the friction of distance was much higher than today; ideas and cultural attitudes traveled according to weekly, monthly, and seasonal rhythms.     In 1949, settlement form still was intertwined closely with function. Areas having high population densities also were those that were linked closely with urban centers. The 1949 SMA standards were written before the construction of interstate highways and could not have anticipated the changes in commuting and settlement patterns brought about by high-speed highways. These highways improved access to rural, low density areas that previously were beyond the scope of most urban influences and daily commuting. With less expensive long distance telephone service, interstate highways providing quick and easy access to cities and towns, satellite uplinks and commercial television broadcasting nationally, and the Internet, population density is a less significant variable. Population density no longer correlates with differences in industry, occupation, family structure, and other variables to the extent that it did 30 to 50 years ago. It is more difficult to argue that sparsely settled areas must meet different criteria of integration with central cores than areas with higher population densities. Consequently, population density has become less relevant as a direct measure of ways in which communities are linked socially and economically.  C. Central Cores  1. Introduction     Cores of metropolitan regions continue to be vital centers of activity even as the decentralization of many economic and social functions continues. Central business districts contain significant clusters of government facilities; corporate headquarters; finance, insurance, and real estate firms; entertainment complexes; and services that cater to these facilities. Many establishments located in suburban areas provide services to central city clients and depend heavily upon them. While the core has changed over time, it remains a key component of metropolitan regions.     The MA standards always have explicitly incorporated central cores as one of the major components in the definition of individual areas (see Table 1). Two kinds of changes in central core requirements are under consideration--changing minimum population requirements and changing criteria for the definition of cores. 2. Changing Minimum Population Requirements     One option under review would raise the minimum population level for the definition of MA cores from 50,000 to 100,000. Doubling the current threshold would take into account the significant increase (over 100 percent) in the Nation's population since 1930 (the first year in which the 50,000 person minimum was used in identifying cores of metropolitan districts) and the consequent relative decrease in the significance of a core of 50,000 population. The new threshold would facilitate greater comparability with another major statistical data set, the public use microdata samples (PUMS) from the decennial census, which are used extensively by researchers examining metropolitan and nonmetropolitan issues (Fotheringham and Pellegrini 1996).     Along with an increase in minimum population size for MA cores, the classification would be expanded to address smaller cores as well. By including provision for one or two additional sets of areas, the new standards could better account for gradations in population focused around urban centers of varying size throughout the United States. If MA cores were to have a minimum of 100,000 persons, then other sets of areas could be defined using cores of (1) at least 10,000 persons and less than 50,000 persons, and (2) at least 50,000 persons and less than 100,000 persons. Identifying coherent nonmetropolitan areas based around smaller population centers provides a potential improvement for analysts and researchers who are dissatisfied with a system that leaves nonmetropolitan areas largely undifferentiated. 3. New Criteria for Defining Cores     In addition to using places and Census Bureau-defined UAs based on population and population density to define metropolitan or nonmetropolitan cores, at least four other criteria could be used. One alternative would be to use housing unit density as the primary defining characteristic. A second alternative would be to combine two characteristics, population and employment. This would involve calculating ratios that compare the number of individuals employed in a geographic area to the number of residents in the same area. The explicit use of such an employment measurement in the definition of a core would be a logical extension of the use of another employment- related statistic, commuting patterns, to define those areas that are integrated with the core. A third option would be to rely solely on employment as the defining characteristic by delineating cores on the basis of employment density, defined as the number of jobs per unit of area.     A fourth alternative would use commuting data directly to identify cores as those areas that exhibit strong evidence of multi-directional commuting. In this approach, multi-directional commuting indicates interdependence within the core of an urban area and could be used to define inner city and inner suburban territory. Outlying territory integrated with a particular core would contain mostly uni-directional commuting flows toward that core and could be used to define outer suburban territory.     These different approaches to defining cores of metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas reflect changes in settlement and commuting trends, as well as technological improvements in geographic analysis; yet, they remain consistent with the tradition of identifying the Nation's large urban centers.  [[Page 70536]]  D. Geographic Building Blocks for Metropolitan Areas and Nonmetropolitan Areas  1. Introduction     This section addresses the relative merits of various potential geographic building blocks. The geographic unit used to define metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas is important to data providers and users due to: (1) its effect on the geographic extent of a statistical area; (2) its meaningfulness in describing economic and social integration between communities; and (3) the ability of Federal agencies to provide data for comparable statistical areas and their components. The choice of whether to use counties or county subdivisions as building blocks for MAs was a central issue in the 1940s during development of the MA program; resolution of the issue at that time favored greater availability of data over greater geographic precision in defining social and economic linkages.     The concerns raised in the 1940s also are central issues in this review. Counties are familiar geographic units offering the advantage of a wider range of statistically reliable economic and demographic data. Because of their geographic extent, however, counties can include territory and population not functionally integrated with a specific core. Sub-county entities offer greater resolution when analyzing economic and demographic patterns, and increased precision when defining statistical areas. These smaller units are at a disadvantage, however, because fewer economic and demographic data series are available for sub-county entities than for counties, and there would be less comparability of units defined on this basis with previously defined metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. 2. Characteristics of the Metropolitan and Nonmetropolitan Area Building Blocks     The geographic entity used as a building block should have the following characteristics:      Consistency. The geographic building block should be delineated in a consistent fashion across the Nation. The degree to which this is the case both within a state and from one state to another affects the ability to make meaningful comparisons of demographic and economic data.      Data Availability and Utility. Data for a geographic building block should be available from a wide variety of sources and should facilitate the linkage of various data sets.      Stability of Boundaries. The ability of the geographic building block to be flexible in portraying demographic and economic change over time in areas is important when defining and analyzing social and economic linkages between communities.      Familiarity. The geographic unit used to define metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas should be meaningful and recognizable to a wide range of data users.     Table 2 details the advantages and disadvantages of using each of five geographic units (counties, county subdivisions, census tracts, ZIP Codes, and grid cells) as building blocks in relation to the characteristics outlined above. The following paragraphs summarize the significant issues from Table 2 and discuss related issues of confidentiality and data reliability.  BILLING CODE 3110-01-P  [[Page 70537]]  [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TN21DE98.045  [[Page 70538]]  [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TN21DE98.046  BILLING CODE 311-01-C  [[Page 70539]]      Counties. Except in New England, counties currently are used to define MAs. Counties are well-known, with boundaries that rarely change, and they are useful for analyzing data over time. Data currently are available for counties from a wide variety of Federal, state, and local agencies and less frequently are limited by disclosure and statistical reliability issues than sub-county units. Counties, however, are established according to state laws and have as their primary purpose the administration of local government and provision of programs and services. As a result, there is little consistency in population size and land area among counties throughout the United States. The large size of counties in the West often poses challenges to measuring and analyzing localized shifts in population.     County Subdivisions. County subdivisions currently are used to define MAs in New England, and before 1950 were used to define metropolitan districts. County subdivisions include MCDs, such as towns and townships, and census county divisions (CCDs). MCDs are governmental or administrative entities defined according to state laws. CCDs are defined for statistical purposes by local officials using nationally consistent criteria and guidelines issued by the Census Bureau. As with counties, the population sizes and land areas of county subdivisions vary both within state and from one state to another. Governmentally functioning MCDs in the Northeast as well as most CCDs generally have stable boundaries; elsewhere, MCD boundaries may change because of annexations or mergers. Redistricting of administrative MCDs, particularly in Virginia and North Carolina, can result in substantial changes each decade. Accounting for these changes could require significant retabulations of data for metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas, potentially compromising comparability of data over time. The volume of economic and demographic data collected and published for county subdivisions varies, with greater amounts available for MCDs with functioning governments and lesser amounts for MCDs without functioning governments and CCDs. Despite variations in population size and instability of boundaries for some MCDs and CCDs, county subdivisions could provide a compromise between the disadvantages posed by the geographic extent of counties and the more limited availability of economic data for some other sub-county geographic units.     Census Tracts. Local officials define census tracts using nationally consistent criteria and guidelines established by the Census Bureau. Census tracts have a consistent population size range (between 1,500 and 8,000, with an optimum of 4,000) to ensure statistical reliability of data. Census tracts vary in size and shape and tend to reflect contemporary local settlement patterns. Census tracts are meant to facilitate analysis of time-series data at a sub-county level, and are generally stable. Because they are defined in terms of population count, however, census tracts are capable of portraying change over time by changing boundaries. If a tract increases in population, it can be split to form new census tracts that aggregate to the original boundaries. For the 1990 decennial census, approximately 30 percent of all census tracts had boundary changes. Although demographic data generally are available for census tracts, a key disadvantage is the dearth of economic data available at the census tract level. Data for census tracts, however, are becoming increasingly important for understanding and analyzing patterns of home ownership and economic development, as well as the general social and physical environment within metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas.     ZIP Codes. The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) establishes ZIP Codes to facilitate efficient mail delivery. ZIP Codes are linear rather than areal (i.e., they are routes that mail carriers walk or drive) and as a result do not have discrete boundaries. In some instances, when the volume of mail is particularly high, a ZIP Code may refer to a specific building, a floor within a building, or even a specific office. Because ZIP Codes exist for operational purposes, they can be taken out of use when the population of an area declines or when the USPS consolidates post offices. The USPS, however, sometimes reuses such ZIP Codes in a different location, thus creating a false sense of comparability if used as geographic areas. Despite their shortcomings as geographic units, ZIP Code use is, nevertheless, ubiquitous for collecting and reporting information on demographic and economic characteristics as well as for carrying out surveys and market analysis studies that report on consumption patterns and lifestyle characteristics.     Grid Cells. Grid cells are not in use currently by Federal statistical agencies. If established, however, they could provide ideal units for analyzing population change within stable boundaries. If relatively small in geographic extent, they also could be useful in measuring population change across space. Grid cells would be defined consistently nationwide and all would encompass a similar amount of territory. Although grid cells may offer advantages from delineation, measurement, and analysis standpoints, their lack of familiarity and relationship with geographic areas that are more real and familiar to people offer significant disadvantages to their use. In addition, adoption of grid cells would require data providers to convert from use of current geographic entities. Selection of grid cell size would require careful consideration of confidentiality and statistical reliability concerns. 3. Quality and Availability of Data     In general, the quality of data for particular areas is related to the allocation of questionnaire responses to specific geographic entities and to the statistical reliability of the data derived from a sample. The geographic precision of data is only as good as the completeness of location information provided in the response, and the quality of geographic codes assigned to it. This limitation affects the ability to report data at varying levels of geography.     Respondent confidentiality also must be considered when determining which geographic area to use as a building block, particularly if data are to be reported for components of metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. In general, the larger the number of observations (persons, households, establishments within a specific industry) within a geographic entity, the greater the ability to protect respondent confidentiality.     Not all Federal data can be provided for every level of geography, and the frequency with which Federal data are available also can vary by level of geography. Sample size limitations for some demographic survey data make survey results reliable only at higher levels of geography. The diffuse nature of modern manufacturing processes renders some economic data, for instance the amount of value added to a product at each step in the manufacturing process, difficult to portray at levels of geography below the state or Nation. Data that are available only from the decennial census place limitations on the frequency of updating some statistical areas. The uncertain availability of intercensal population estimates for census tracts, and the likelihood that tract-level commuting data from the American Community Survey will not be available for all census tracts until 2008, also will affect the ability to update metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas.  [[Page 70540]]  4. Summary     The choice of a building block should focus on achieving the most precise geographic delineation of metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas possible, given the constraints of data availability. Collecting, processing, and tabulating data at sub-county levels of geography are important technical issues that must be resolved within individual Federal statistical agencies if a sub-county geographic unit is to be used to define metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas.     Counties and census tracts offer the greatest promise as potential building blocks for metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas based on current availability and reliability of statistical data, general stability of boundaries over time, consistency of definitions, and familiarity among data users. Counties and census tracts, therefore, are used in the examples of alternative methods for defining metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas that follow in Part IV.  Part IV. Alternative Approaches to Defining Metropolitan and Nonmetropolitan Areas      This part presents four alternative approaches to defining metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas: (1) a commuting-based, county- level approach; (2) a commuting-based, census tract-level approach; (3) a directional commuting, census tract-level approach; and (4) a comparative population density, county-level approach. Table 3 summarizes how each approach addresses issues raised in Parts I and II of this Notice.     All four of these approaches differ from the current (1990) MA standards in many respects but have points in common with them as well. The first three approaches share with the current standards a reliance on commuting patterns, but depart from the standards' other criteria for inclusion of outlying areas in an MA. None of these three approaches uses population density, presence of urban population, or rapid population growth to evaluate outlying areas. The fourth approach uses population density as an indicator of the relative intensity of social and economic activity rather than attempting to identify individual cores or to quantify core-outlying area relationships.  BILLING CODE 3110-01-P  [[Page 70541]]  [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TN21DE98.047  BILLING CODE 3110-01-C  [[Page 70542]]      Although these approaches use either counties or census tracts as the building blocks for statistical areas, each could be implemented using other geographic units discussed in Part III.D. The population and commuting thresholds presented for these approaches were selected by analyzing 1990 population and commuting patterns but are intended primarily for illustrative purposes and are subject to modification based on further research and on comments received in response to this Notice. In general, each approach should be read, considered, and commented upon in terms of its adequacy in defining and describing social and economic ties among communities throughout the United States.  A. A Commuting-Based, County-Level Approach to Defining Metropolitan and Nonmetropolitan Areas      The MA has been successful as a standard statistical representation of the social and economic linkages between urban centers and outlying areas. This success is evident in MAs' continued use across broad areas of data collection, presentation, and analysis. Nevertheless, some users of metropolitan and nonmetropolitan area data have strongly expressed the view that the current standards are overly complex and burdened with ad hoc components. This first proposed alternative approach explicitly aims to provide a simpler method of defining metropolitan and nonmetropolitan regions.     Four kinds of areas are identified in this approach: metropolitan regions, defined around cores of at least 100,000 persons; mesopolitan regions, defined around cores of at least 50,000 persons and less than 100,000 persons; and micropolitan regions, defined around cores of at least 10,000 persons and less than 50,000 persons. Counties not included in a metropolitan, mesopolitan, or micropolitan region will constitute rural community areas.     In this approach, counties are the building blocks (see Figure 1). While this is in keeping with the current standards for most of the United States, it is a departure from current practice in New England. Outlying counties are included in metropolitan, mesopolitan, and micropolitan regions solely on the basis of commuting. Adjacent areas are combined when commuting rates indicate that the central counties are linked socially and economically. When metropolitan regions are combined, the initial metropolitan regions are recognized as primary metropolitan regions and the combined entity is recognized as a consolidated metropolitan region.     There are several advantages to this approach. First, counties are familiar geographic units for which a wide range of statistically reliable social and economic data are readily available. Second, the use of counties eases comparison with current and past MA definitions. Third, because of the greater availability of data for counties than for sub-county entities, statistical area definitions using counties can be updated more frequently than others. The potential availability of nationwide annual county-level commuting data from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey starting in 2003 raises the possibility of reviewing all definitions on an annual basis. Under the current standards, definition activity during intercensal years is largely limited to cases where new MAs can be designated on the basis of population estimates or special censuses.     There are, however, disadvantages to this approach as well. Because of their geographic extent, counties can include territory and population not functionally integrated with a specific core. The large geographic size of some counties often poses challenges to measuring and analyzing localized shifts in populations.

Criteria for Defining Metropolitan Regions Using the Commuting- Based, County-Level Approach a. Requirement for Qualification as a Metropolitan Region     Each metropolitan region must include a Census Bureau-defined UA of at least 100,000 persons. b. Identification of Central Counties of a Metropolitan Region     The central county or counties of the metropolitan region are those counties where at least 50 percent of the population resides in the qualifier UA(s), or that contain at least 50 percent of the population of the qualifier UA(s). A central county of one metropolitan region cannot be included as an outlying county in another metropolitan region in the initial steps for defining metropolitan regions (see IV.A.1.d below). c. Inclusion of Outlying Counties     A county is included in the metropolitan region as an outlying county if at least 25 percent of its resident workers commute to the central county or counties, or at least 15 percent of its resident workers commute to the central county or counties and at least 15 percent of its employment is accounted for by workers residing in the central county or counties.     A county that qualifies as an outlying county of more than one metropolitan region will be included in the metropolitan region with which it has the highest commuting exchange. A county that has a combined commuting exchange with central counties of two or more metropolitan regions that meets or exceeds the thresholds listed above, and is contiguous with counties already qualified for inclusion in those metropolitan regions, will be included in the metropolitan region with which it has the highest commuting exchange.     The counties included in the metropolitan region must form a continuous geographic entity. A central county of one metropolitan region cannot be classified as an outlying county of another metropolitan region at this stage in the definition process. d. Combination of Adjacent Metropolitan Regions     Two adjacent metropolitan regions are combined if a central county of one metropolitan region qualifies as an outlying county of the other. If two or more metropolitan regions are combined, the metropolitan regions as defined before the combination will be designated as primary metropolitan regions and the area resulting from the combination will be designated as a consolidated metropolitan region. e. Titles of Metropolitan Regions     The first name in the title of a metropolitan region or primary metropolitan region will be the name of the incorporated place with the largest population in the metropolitan region. The names of up to two additional incorporated places that are at least one-third the size of the largest incorporated place will be included in the metropolitan region or primary metropolitan region title in order of descending population rank.     The title of a consolidated metropolitan region will include the names of up to three incorporated places, including the first named incorporated places in the titles of component primary metropolitan regions (to a maximum of three) in order of descending population rank of incorporated places. 2. Criteria for Defining Mesopolitan Regions and Micropolitan Regions     The criteria for defining mesopolitan regions and micropolitan regions are the same as those for defining metropolitan regions, with two exceptions: the requirements for qualification and the criteria pertaining to combining mesopolitan and micropolitan regions. For the sake of brevity, only the requirements for qualification and criteria for combining adjacent mesopolitan regions and micropolitan regions are presented here. a. Requirements for Qualification of Mesopolitan Regions and Micropolitan Regions     Each mesopolitan region must contain no part of a metropolitan region and must include a Census Bureau-defined UA or, outside of UAs, an incorporated place of at least 50,000 persons and less than 100,000 persons. Each micropolitan area must contain no part of a metropolitan or mesopolitan region and must include an incorporated place of at least 10,000 persons and less than 50,000 persons. b. Combining Adjacent Mesopolitan Regions and Micropolitan Regions     Two adjacent mesopolitan regions (or two adjacent micropolitan regions) are combined if a central county of one mesopolitan region (or one micropolitan region) qualifies as an outlying county of the other. 3. Identification of Rural Community Areas     Counties not included in a metropolitan, mesopolitan, or micropolitan region will form the components of rural community areas. Contiguous counties will be grouped according to local opinion to form individual rural community areas within each state, subject to specified conditions. Titles for rural community areas will be based on the same criteria used to title metropolitan, mesopolitan, and micropolitan regions.  B. A Commuting-Based, Census Tract-Level Approach to Defining Metropolitan and Nonmetropolitan Areas      This second approach employs a two-stage process. First, it identifies statistical settlement areas based around cores of at least 10,000 persons and their associated daily influence areas. Second, it identifies metropolitan, mesopolitan, and micropolitan regions. Census tracts are the geographic units used in this approach. In the first stage, each statistical settlement area core is identified and linked with all qualifying statistical settlement area outlying census tracts on the basis of commuting, creating a system of overlapping areas. Any core or outlying census tract may be part of two or more statistical settlement areas. This outcome is meant to depict the overlapping and nested nature of social and economic linkages between communities throughout the United States. To account for all the territory of the United States, rural community areas are identified representing census tracts not contained within statistical settlement areas or their daily influence areas.     The second stage of this approach results in a non-overlapping classification, where each statistical area is mutually exclusive of all other statistical areas (see Figure 2). Criteria are employed to assign each census tract to only one metropolitan, mesopolitan, or micropolitan region. Census tracts not included in any of these areas are designated as either urban-influenced or rural-influenced, depending on whether the tracts meet specified criteria relating to commuting ties with cores of metropolitan, mesopolitan, or micropolitan regions.  BILLING CODE 3110-01-P  [[Page 70545]]  [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TN21DE98.049  BILLING CODE 3110-01-C  [[Page 70546]]      There are several advantages to this approach. Identifying overlapping statistical areas in stage one of the delineation process depicts the multiple linkages among communities. Using census tracts as building blocks offers greater resolution when analyzing social and economic patterns and increased precision when defining statistical areas. Census tracts are defined nationwide using a consistent set of population guidelines; they are capable of portraying change over time and across space as their boundaries are updated to reflect population and settlement pattern changes.     There are disadvantages to this approach as well. First, the limited availability of economic and demographic data for census tracts at this time limits their use in analysis. Second, it is more difficult to compare areas defined using census tracts with MAs defined currently and in the past using counties. Third, the uncertain availability of intercensal population estimates for census tracts and the likelihood that tract-level commuting data from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey will not be available for all tracts until 2008 could result in a lack of data to update areas during much of the coming decade. As a result, metropolitan, mesopolitan, and micropolitan regions could be defined after the 2000 decennial census, but not updated until 2008 or later. Fourth, tract-level commuting data from the 2000 census may be less certain in some nonmetropolitan areas (where lists of commercial addresses are less complete and geocoding place-of-work locations therefore is more difficult) than in current MAs. These uncertainties in the quality of place-of-work geocoding may reduce the reliability of journey-to-work data for census tracts with small numbers of commuters. 1. Criteria to Establish Statistical Settlement Areas and Their Daily Influence Areas a. Requirement for Qualification as a Statistical Settlement Area     Each statistical settlement area must include either a Census Bureau-defined UA or, outside of UAs, an incorporated place of at least 10,000 persons. b. Identification of the Central Core of a Statistical Settlement Area     The core of a statistical settlement area consists of the census tract(s) in which 20 percent or more of the population falls within the UA or place identified in the previous step. In addition, at least 70 percent of the workers living in the statistical settlement area core must work within the core. This last criterion ensures that places that are strictly ""bedroom communities"" are not identified as cores of statistical settlement areas. c. Qualification of Outlying Areas     A census tract is included in a statistical settlement area as an outlying census tract if at least 25 percent of resident workers in that tract commute to work in the core, or if at least 25 percent of the employment in the census tract is accounted for by workers residing in the core. d. Titles of Statistical Settlement Areas     The title of a statistical settlement area will include the name of the incorporated place with the largest population. The names of up to two additional incorporated places that are at least one-third the size of the largest place will be included in the statistical settlement area title in order of descending population rank. e. Identification of Daily Influence Areas     A census tract is included in the daily influence area of a statistical settlement area if at least 5 percent but less than 25 percent of the resident workers in that tract commute to work in the core of the statistical settlement area, or if at least 5 percent but less than 25 percent of the employment in the census tract is accounted for by workers residing in the core of the statistical settlement area. f. Identification of Rural Community Areas     Census tracts not included in any statistical settlement area or daily influence area will form the components of rural community areas. Contiguous census tracts will be grouped according to specified conditions. Titles for rural community areas will be based on the same criteria used to title statistical settlement areas. 2. Identification of Metropolitan Regions, Mesopolitan Regions, and Micropolitan Regions     Stage two in this approach provides criteria for identifying mutually exclusive metropolitan, mesopolitan, and micropolitan regions, and then classifies the remaining territory as urban-influenced or rural-influenced. a. Assigning Territory in Individual Statistical Settlement Areas     A census tract that is part of the core of more than one statistical settlement area will be assigned to the statistical settlement area in which it has a larger population within the associated qualifier UA. A census tract that is in the core of one statistical settlement area and outlying to one or more other statistical settlement areas will be included in the statistical settlement area in which it is part of the core.     A census tract that qualifies for inclusion as an outlying census tract in more than one statistical settlement area will be assigned to the statistical settlement area with which it has the highest level of commuting exchange.     At no time may a statistical settlement area contain discontiguous census tracts. b. Combining Statistical Settlement Areas     Statistical settlement areas will be combined if the entire core of one is integrated with the entire core of the other according to the commuting thresholds contained in IV.B.1.c above. c. Qualification of Outlying Census Tracts in Combined Statistical Settlement Areas     After two or more statistical settlement areas are combined, a census tract will qualify for inclusion as an outlying census tract in the combined area if its commuting exchange with the combined statistical settlement area core(s) meets the criteria outlined in IV.B.1.c above. d. Distinguishing Between Metropolitan Regions, Mesopolitan Regions, and Micropolitan Regions     Any statistical settlement area that contains a Census Bureau- defined UA of at least 100,000 persons will be designated a metropolitan region. Any statistical settlement area not identified as a metropolitan region will be designated as a mesopolitan region if it contains a Census Bureau-defined UA of at least 50,000 persons and less than 100,000 persons, or if outside a UA, an incorporated place of at least 50,000 persons. Any statistical settlement area not identified as a metropolitan or mesopolitan region will be designated as a micropolitan region. e. Titles of Metropolitan Regions, Mesopolitan Regions, and Micropolitan Regions     Each metropolitan, mesopolitan, or micropolitan region title will include the name of the incorporated place with the largest population. The names of up to two additional incorporated places that are at least one-third the size of the largest place will be included in the metropolitan, mesopolitan, or micropolitan region title in order of descending population rank.  [[Page 70547]]  f. Identification of Urban-Influenced and Rural-Influenced Census Tracts     After all metropolitan, mesopolitan, and micropolitan regions are defined, any unassigned census tract will be identified as urban- influenced if at least 5 percent but less than 25 percent of the resident workers in that tract commute to work in the core of a metropolitan, mesopolitan, or micropolitan region, or if at least 5 percent but less than 25 percent of the employment in the census tract is accounted for by workers residing in the core of a metropolitan, mesopolitan, or micropolitan region. Any census tract that does not meet these commuting criteria will be classified as rural-influenced.  C. A Directional Commuting, Census Tract-Level Approach to Defining Metropolitan and Nonmetropolitan Areas      The directional commuting approach also is a census tract-based system. It relies on the direction and relative strength of commuting flows to measure social and economic linkages. This concept can be visualized by imagining typical commuters driving toward a hypothetical center of metropolitan or nonmetropolitan population in the morning and away from it in the evening. This approach measures the mean weighted direction of all commuting flows from a particular tract toward a population center, rather than measuring the percentage of workers who commute between central cores and outlying areas (see Figure 3).  BILLING CODE 3110-01-P'  [[Page 70548]]  [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TN21DE98.050  BILLING CODE 3110-01-C  [[Page 70549]]      The spatial characteristics of commuting flows never have been explicitly incorporated into the MA standards, even though the links between residence and work are inherently spatial. New research using disaggregated commuting flow data can measure flow characteristics that have been observed by highway and transit planners for decades.     The directional approach uses the weighted mean direction of commuting flows by census tract to associate census tracts with population centers. If the weighted mean flow of a given census tract is in the direction of a nearby population center, then the tract is included within the same statistical area as that center.     The directional approach for creating areas has one major advantage. It can mitigate shortcomings with geocoding place-of-work data by generalizing commuting flow. Lack of sufficient place-of-work address information may make the geocoding of tract-level commuting data from the 2000 decennial census difficult in some nonmetropolitan areas where lists of commercial addresses are less complete than in current MAs. Uncertainties in the quality of place-of-work geocoding may reduce the reliability of sub-county journey-to-work data in the absence of techniques such as directional statistical methods.     Several disadvantages also are associated with this approach. The linkage of a census tract with a center of population is subject to a specified level of angular tolerance and is subject as well to limitations of the commuting data. Implementation of this approach at the census tract-level limits annual updating of all metropolitan, mesopolitan, and micropolitan region definitions using commuting data from the American Community Survey until at least 2008. Other disadvantages associated with this approach are similar to those outlined in the commuting-based, census tract-level approach discussed above. 1. Criteria for Defining Metropolitan Regions, Mesopolitan Regions, and Micropolitan Regions a. Requirements for Qualification     Each metropolitan region must include a Census Bureau-defined UA of at least 100,000 persons. Each mesopolitan region must contain no part of a metropolitan region and must include either a Census Bureau- defined UA of at least 50,000 persons and less than 100,000 persons, or if outside a UA, an incorporated place of at least 50,000 persons. Each micropolitan region must contain no part of a metropolitan or mesopolitan region and must contain an incorporated place of at least 10,000 persons and less than 50,000 persons. b. Identification of Metropolitan Region, Mesopolitan Region, and Micropolitan Region Population Centers     Population centers are not cores per se but rather are starting points for the statistical analysis of commuting flows. The center point used in measuring directionality of commuting flows toward a metropolitan region is the ""internal point"" (see Part VII, ""Frequently Used Terms"") of the qualifier UA of 100,000 or more persons; in the case of mesopolitan regions, the center point used is the internal point of the qualifier UA of at least 50,000 and less than 100,000 persons, or, outside UAs, the internal point of the most populous incorporated place having at least 50,000 persons. The center point used in measuring directionality of commuting flows toward a micropolitan region is the internal point of the most populous incorporated place having at least 10,000 persons and less than 50,000 persons. c. Calculation of Mean Weighted Direction of Commuting Flows     Statistical areas are delineated based on the weighted mean direction of commuting flows for census tracts with respect to population centers. A trigonometric formula is used to produce a weighted mean direction of flow for each tract of residence. Based on that value, a tract is assigned to the relevant nearby population center--the UA or place that lies directly in the path of the flow vector.     To associate census tracts' mean commuting flows with population centers, it is necessary to specify an angle of inclusion. This means determining a level of tolerance so that when a directional mean flow is toward a center of population but does not ""hit"" it directly, the flow is still associated with the center. d. Qualification of Census Tracts for Inclusion in a Metropolitan Region, Mesopolitan Region, or Micropolitan Region     A census tract qualifies for inclusion in a metropolitan, mesopolitan, or micropolitan region if the largest flow of resident workers in the census tract is in the direction of the metropolitan, mesopolitan, or micropolitan region population center. If the flows are split evenly between two population centers, then local opinion will be sought to determine the census tract's assignment.     Metropolitan, mesopolitan, and micropolitan regions may not contain discontiguous census tracts. Under this approach, it is possible that the mean weighted commuting flows from census tracts close to a population center may point in a direction away from the center and in an opposite direction of more remote tracts; in such instances, the central census tracts will be included in the metropolitan, mesopolitan, or micropolitan region. 2. Identification of Rural Community Areas     Census tracts not included in a metropolitan, mesopolitan, or micropolitan region will form the components of rural community areas. Contiguous census tracts will be grouped according to local opinion, subject to specified conditions, to form individual rural community areas within each state.  D. A Comparative Density, County-Level Approach to Defining Statistical Areas      The three approaches to defining metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas just described rely upon commuting as the measure of linkages between central and outlying areas. Journey-to-work data, however, do not accurately depict the activity patterns of people without a regular, fixed work location, such as those who work in sales, contracting, construction and landscaping trades, and as day- and itinerant-laborers; also missed are people who work at home (or people not counted in the workforce). In addition, the daily journey to work does not describe the many other, non-work activities that define relationships between individuals and communities, such as trips associated with shopping, recreation, and social and religious activities.     Residential population density can serve as a surrogate for other measures of activity in the absence of nationally consistent and reliable data sets describing all daily and weekly movements of individuals. Under this fourth proposed approach, an index is calculated to reflect relative settlement intensities of counties. The index number assigned to any given county is determined by multiplying its population density ranking ratio at the state level with its ranking ratio at the national level (see below). This provides a relative measure of activity intensity for comparative purposes nationwide by taking into account both the national and state contexts. For instance, Natrona County, Wyoming, which constitutes the Casper Metropolitan Statistical Area,  [[Page 70550]]  has a low overall population density when compared with most other counties in the United States, but it would be assigned a value that also reflects its relative importance within Wyoming.     This approach has several advantages. First, because the classification is based solely on residential population density, each county's index value can be calculated quickly after 2000 decennial census population counts become available (and without waiting for the later processing of journey-to-work data). Thereafter, the classification could be updated annually using Census Bureau population estimates. Second, a wide range of statistically reliable social and economic data are readily available for counties. Third, the use of counties facilitates comparability with past MA definitions, even though this approach differs markedly from the current MA standards. Fourth, population density can provide information about the intensity of activity or potential activity within a geographic area.     There are disadvantages to this approach as well. The obvious drawback is that social and economic linkages between counties are not described directly. Also, the large land area of some counties tends to lower overall population densities, and as a result, the index value for such a county would be relatively low in spite of relatively high population densities in some parts of the county (San Bernardino County, California provides a good example). Because population density is calculated by dividing total population by total land area, local, sub-county variations in population distribution patterns are not revealed. 1. Steps in Defining Density-Based Statistical Areas     a. The overall residential population density for each county is calculated by dividing total population by total land area.     b. All counties within a given state are ranked according to population density. The highest-density county is assigned the rank N, where N equals the number of counties in the state. The second-highest- density county is assigned the rank N-1; third-highest, N-2; and so forth. For example, if there are 100 counties in a state, then the county with the highest population density has a rank of 100; the county with the second highest population density is 99.     c. The state ranking ratio (SRR) of each county is calculated by dividing the rank of the county by the total number of counties in the state, using the following equation:  SRR = N [N-1, N-2,...]/N      d. After assigning each county a ranking ratio within the state, steps a, b, and c are repeated at the national level. In this iteration, N will represent the number of counties within the United States (see Figure 4a).  BILLING CODE 3110-01-P  [[Page 70551]]  [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TN21DE98.051  BILLING CODE 3110-01-C  [[Page 70552]]      e. Each county is assigned an index number (I) by multiplying its state ranking ratio (SRR) and the national ranking ratio (NRR) using the following equation:  SRR x NRR = I      This produces an index value that can be used to classify and compare counties throughout the United States in terms of population density, and thus relative social and economic importance (see Figure 4b). 2. Identification of Residential Density-Based Statistical Areas     This approach would produce index values for all counties that can be used for classification into as many density-based levels as needed. A five-level classification that ranges between an index value of 0.0 to .19 at the low end and a value of .80 to 1.0 at the high end captures most recognizable aspects of the settlement pattern of the United States. Contiguous counties in the same classification level then can be identified as individual density-based statistical areas. 3. Titles of Density-Based Statistical Areas     The title of a density-based statistical area will include the name of the incorporated place with the largest population within that area. The names of up to two additional incorporated places that are at least one-third the size of the largest place will be included in the title in order of descending population rank.

Additional Issues for Consideration      This portion of the Notice briefly discusses a few issues that were not fully addressed in Parts I through IV. These issues are: (1) how to account for residual areas or exhaust the territory of the Nation within a statistical area classification; (2) how best to meet data producers' and users' desires for both county-based and sub-county- based classifications; and (3) how to identify various settlement categories, such as inner city, suburban, exurban, and rural areas, in ways that are useful when analyzing and understanding settlement and economic patterns within metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas.  A. Accounting for Residual Areas      Three of the four approaches presented in Part IV for defining metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas relied on commuting patterns as a measure of linkages between outlying and central areas. In all three of these approaches, however, some residual territory could not be linked with the central areas. This section discusses methods for minimizing this residual territory when defining metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. These methods could be used individually or in combination.     One means of reducing residual territory is to establish a minimum commuting threshold low enough to ensure that all or nearly all territory is included within a metropolitan or nonmetropolitan area. Although this approach would result in areas that account for all the territory of the Nation, the necessary commuting threshold would be so low as to call into question the meaningfulness of social and economic linkages between centers and some outlying areas. As a result, the conceptual integrity of metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas would be compromised.     A second method involves identifying cores of varying minimum sizes around which metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas are defined using a commuting threshold that is sufficiently high to portray meaningful linkages. This approach does not eliminate the possibility that residual territory will remain, but reduces the extent of residual territory to a more meaningful set of areas. This approach is taken in Parts IV.A and IV.C.     A variant of this second approach reduces the extent of residual territory by defining influence zones associated with each metropolitan and nonmetropolitan area, as outlined in Part IV.B. An outlying area that does not qualify for inclusion in a metropolitan or nonmetropolitan area could fall within the influence area of a metropolitan or nonmetropolitan area. Still, the extent of residual territory is reduced rather than eliminated.     A third approach involves using additional measures of social and economic linkages, such as newspaper circulation, media market penetration, and commodity flows, in addition to commuting criteria, to eliminate residual territory. These other measures would be used as a last resort after all outlying areas are added to a metropolitan or nonmetropolitan area on the basis of commuting. This approach eliminates residual areas by assigning all territory to metropolitan or nonmetropolitan areas but in doing so establishes a two-tiered system of qualification. As a result, outlying areas within a particular metropolitan or nonmetropolitan area may be linked with the core, but by different criteria.  B. Development of Multiple Sets of Statistical Areas      Some data users have expressed an interest in both a county-based classification, which offers greater availability of data, and sub- county-based classifications, which offer greater geographic precision when defining metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. Data providers and users could choose the classifications that best fit their research and analysis needs, guided by advice about appropriate uses of each classification. The substantial downside to this approach is the potential confusion resulting from the existence of two or more parallel classifications. Data providers also would be faced with increased costs for preparing data according to two or more classifications.  C. Settlement Types Within Metropolitan and Nonmetropolitan Areas      Data providers and users have expressed a desire for official classification of a variety of settlement types--such as inner city, inner and outer suburb, and exurban--within metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. A key aspect of this issue has been the lack of an official designation of what constitutes ""suburban"" territory. Designations of such settlement types are not essential to defining social and economic linkages among communities within metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas, but they are useful for analyzing and understanding settlement patterns. A separate settlement classification system that would be consistent with metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas may be appropriate.     Measures that could be employed in delineating inner city, inner suburban, outer suburban, and exurban territory include, in some combination:      median housing unit age or year of housing unit construction;      commuting interchange with central core;      directionality of commuting patterns;      population or housing density; and      road density.     High population density, older housing stock, multidirectional commuting, and contiguity with the inner city are typical of inner suburban areas, for example. Outer suburban areas are typified by moderate population density and age of housing stock and moderately unidirectional commuting flows. Exurban areas typically are of low population density, but are distinguished from other sparsely settled territory by newer housing and unidirectional commuting flows.  Part VI.

Frequently Used Terms  (An asterisk (*) denotes terms proposed for the purposes of this Notice)     Census county division (CCD)--A statistical subdivision of a county, established cooperatively by the Census Bureau and state and local government authorities, for the presentation of decennial census data in 21 states where minor civil divisions either do not exist or are unsatisfactory for the collection, presentation, and analysis of census statistics.     Census tract--A small, relatively permanent statistical subdivision of a county, delineated cooperatively by local statistical areas program participants and the Census Bureau. Census tracts for the 2000 decennial census will have between 1,500 and 8,000 inhabitants.     Central city--The largest city of a metropolitan statistical area or a consolidated metropolitan statistical area, plus additional cities that meet specified statistical criteria.     Central county--The county or counties of an MA containing the largest city or urbanized area, and to and from which commuting is measured to determine qualification of outlying counties.     Consolidated metropolitan statistical area (CMSA)--A geographic entity defined by OMB for statistical purposes. An area becomes a CMSA if it meets the requirements to qualify as a metropolitan statistical area, has a population of 1,000,000 or more, contains component parts that qualify as primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSAs), and local opinion favors PMSA designation. Whole counties are components of CMSAs, except in New England, where they are composed of cities and towns.     County subdivision--A legal (minor civil division) or statistical (census county division) subdivision of a county.     * Daily influence area (DIA)--Territory that is minimally associated with a statistical settlement area.     Functional integration--The linkage of geographic entities according to patterns of social or economic interactions.     Geocoding--The practice of assigning data to a specific geographic location and a set of geographic codes.     * Geographic building block--The geographic unit, such as census tract, county subdivision, or county, that forms the basic geographic component of a metropolitan or nonmetropolitan area.     Internal point--A point, generally marking the central location within a geographic entity.     * Mesopolitan region--A geographic entity containing a core area of at least 50,000 persons and less than 100,000 persons plus adjacent communities having a high degree of social and economic integration with that core.     Metropolitan area (MA)--A collective term, established by OMB and used for the first time in 1990, to refer to metropolitan statistical areas, consolidated metropolitan statistical areas, and primary metropolitan statistical areas.     * Metropolitan region--A geographic entity containing a core area of at least 100,000 persons plus adjacent communities having a high degree of social and economic integration with that core.     Metropolitan statistical area (MSA)--A geographic entity, defined by OMB for statistical purposes, containing a core area with a large population center and adjacent communities having a high degree of social and economic integration with that center. Qualification of an MSA requires the presence of a city with 50,000 or more inhabitants, or the presence of an urbanized area and a total population of at least 100,000 (75,000 in New England). MSAs are composed of entire counties, except in New England where the components are cities and towns.     * Micropolitan region--A geographic entity containing a core area of at least 10,000 persons and less than 50,000 persons plus adjacent communities having a high degree of social and economic integration with that core.     Minor civil division (MCD)--A type of governmental unit that is the primary legal subdivision of a county, created to govern or administer an area rather than a specific population. MCDs are recognized by the Census Bureau as the county subdivisions of 28 states and the District of Columbia.     New England county metropolitan area (NECMA)--County-based areas defined by OMB to provide an alternative to the city-and town-based metropolitan statistical areas and consolidated metropolitan statistical areas in New England.     Outlying county--The county or counties that qualify for inclusion in a metropolitan area based on commuting ties with central counties and other specified measures of metropolitan character.     Population density--A measure of the number of people per geographic unit, usually expressed in terms of people per square mile or per square kilometer.     Population growth rate--The change in a population during a given period, as determined by births, deaths, and net migration, and commonly expressed as a percentage of the initial population.     Primary metropolitan statistical area (PMSA)--A county or group of counties that meet specified statistical criteria and receive local opinion support for recognition as a component of a consolidated metropolitan statistical area under OMB's metropolitan area standards.     Qualifier urbanized area--The urbanized area that results in qualification of a metropolitan area.     * Rural community area (RCA)--A geographic entity containing geographic units not included within a statistical settlement area, metropolitan region, mesopolitan region, or micropolitan region, nor within associated influence areas, and defined partly in accordance with local opinion.     * Statistical settlement area (SSA)--A geographic entity containing a core of at least 10,000 persons and surrounding communities that are linked socially and economically, as measured by commuting.     Urbanized area (UA)--A statistical geographic area defined by the Census Bureau, consisting of a central place(s) and adjacent densely settled territory that together contain at least 50,000 people, generally with an overall population density of at least 1,000 people per square mile.

Overview      Part I gives the structure of this document. Part II describes the changes from the previous standards and the reasons for the changes. Part III gives the official metropolitan area standards for the 1990s. Part IV gives a list of definitions of key terms and guidelines used in the standards. The terms in Part IV are listed in alphabetical order.     In Part III, sections 1 through 7 contain the basic standards for defining metropolitan statistical areas in all States except the New England States. They specify standards for determining: how large a population nucleus must be to qualify as an MSA (section 1); the central county/counties of the MSA (section 2); additional outlying counties with sufficient metropolitan character and integration to the central county/counties to qualify for inclusion in the MSA (section 3); the central city or cities of each MSA (section 4); whether two adjacent MSAs qualify to be combined (section 5); four categories or levels of MSAs, based on the total population  [[Page 70556]]  of each area (section 6); and the title of each MSA (section 7).     Sections 8 through 10 provide a framework for identifying PMSAs within an MSA of at least one million population. If such PMSAs are identified, the larger area of which they are components is designated a CMSA.     Sections 11 through 15 apply only to the New England States. In these States, metropolitan areas are composed of cities and towns rather than whole counties. Sections 11, 12, and 13 specify how New England MSAs are defined and titled. Sections 14 and 15 show how CMSAs and PMSAs are defined and titled.     Section 16 sets forth the standards for updating definitions between decennial censuses.  Part II. Changes in the Standards for the 1990s      The metropolitan area standards for the 1990s generally reflect a continuity with those adopted for the 1980s, and they maintain the basic concepts originally developed in 1950. The substantive modifications of the standards are specified below. Some other modifications have been made that involve word changes but not substance.     1. Effective April 1, 1990, the set of areas known as Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas (PMSAs), and Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas (CMSAs) will be designated collectively as Metropolitan Areas (MAs). The reason for this change is to distinguish between the individual areas known as MSAs and the set of all areas.     2. A small group of counties containing a portion of a city's urbanized area will now qualify as outlying, even though their population density is relatively low. This change allows the inclusion in metropolitan areas of entire urbanized areas.     3. Counties included solely because they contain at least 2,500 population in a central city now will be assigned outlying county rather than central county status (section 3A(6)). This will ensure that additional outlying counties will not be designated solely because of commuting with a county including a small portion of the central city.     4. The largest city, and other cities of at least 15,000 in a secondary noncontiguous urbanized area within a metropolitan statistical area, now may be identified as central cities, provided that the other requirements for central cities are met (sections 4E and 4F). This allows cities that perform as central cities in secondary noncontiguous urbanized areas to be designated as central cities.     5. The employment criterion for inclusion in an area title is deleted; only the population criteria remain (section 7). This change was made because in 1980 only one area qualified based on employment.     6. A place qualifying as a central city but with less than one- third the population of the largest city may now be included in the metropolitan statistical area title if strongly supported by local opinion (section 7A(3)). Communities often have strong views on the way their MSAs are titled. This change allows taking these views into account.     7. The presence of a small portion (less than 2,500 population) of the largest city of a CMSA in a county no longer precludes consideration of that county as a PMSA (section 8B(4)). Such a small portion of a city does not alter the characteristics of the PMSA.     8. We have added standards for intercensal updating of metropolitan areas (section 16). These standards existed separately, but we felt they should be incorporated into the published standards.     9. Qualifying percentages and ratios are considered to one decimal and ratios on the basis of two decimals (in each case, one less decimal than previously) (Part IV). The previous standards implied a level of accuracy that was not justified.     10. Several technical adjustments were made (Part IV). For example, localities in Puerto Rico officially known as aldeas in 1980, are now termed comunidades.  Part III. Official Standards for Metropolitan Areas      Basic Standards. Sections 1 through 7 apply to all States except the six New England States, that is, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont. They also apply to Puerto Rico.     1    --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\   Those provisions of sections 1 through 7 that are applicable to New England are   specified in the standards relating to New England (sections 11 through 15).   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------   Section 1. Population Size Requirements for Qualification Each metropolitan   statistical area must include: A. A city of 50,000 or more population, or    2    --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \2\   An MSA designated on the basis of census data according to standards in effect   at the time of designation will not be disqualified on the basis of lacking a   city of at least 50,000 population.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------- B.   A Census Bureau defined urbanized area of at least 50,000 population, provided   that the component county/counties of the metropolitan statistical area have a   total population of at least 100,000. 3    --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \3\   An MSA designated on the basis of census data according to standards in effect   at the time of designation will not be disqualified on the basis of lacking an   urbanized area of at least 50,000 or a total MSA population of at least   100,000.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------   Section 2. Central Counties The central county/counties of the MSA are: A.   Those counties that include a central city (see section 4) of the MSA, or at   least 50 percent of the population of such a city, provided the city is located   in a qualifier urbanized area; and B. Those counties in which at least 50   percent of the population lives in the qualifier urbanized area(s). Section 3.   Outlying Counties A. An outlying county is included in an MSA if any one of the   six following conditions is met: (1) At least 50 percent of the employed   workers residing in the county commute to the central county/counties, and   either (a) The population density of the county is at least 25 persons per   square mile, or (b) At least 10 percent, or at least 5,000, of the population   lives in the qualifier urbanized area(s); (2) From 40 to 50 percent of the   employed workers commute to the central county/counties, and either (a) The   population density is at least 35 persons per square mile, or (b) At least 10   percent, or at least 5,000, of the population lives in the qualifier urbanized   area(s); (3) From 25 to 40 percent of the employed workers commute to the   central county/counties and either the population density of the county is at   least 50 persons per square mile, or any two of the following conditions exist:   (a) Population density is at least 35 persons per square mile, (b) At least 35   percent of the population is urban, (c) At least 10 percent, or at least 5,000,   of the population lives in the qualifier urbanized area(s); (4) From 15 to 25   percent of the employed workers commute to the central   county/counties, 4  the population density of the county is at least   50 persons per square mile, and any two of the following conditions also exist:   --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \4\   Also accepted as meeting this commuting requirement are: (a) The number of   persons working in the county who live in the central county/counties is equal   to at least 15 percent of the number of employed workers living in the county;   or (b) The sum of the number of workers commuting to and from the central   county/counties is equal to at least 20 percent of the number of employed   workers living in the county.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------- (a)   Population density is at least 60 persons per square mile, (b) At least 35   percent of the population is urban, (c) Population growth between the last two   decennial censuses is at least 20 percent, (d) At least 10 percent, or at least   5,000, of the population lives in the qualifier urbanized area(s); (5) From 15   to 25 percent of the employed workers commute to the central   county/counties, 4  the population density of the county is less than   50 persons per square mile, and any two of the following conditions also exist:   (a) At least 35 percent of the population is urban, (b) Population growth   between the last two decennial censuses is at least 20 percent, (c) At least 10   percent, or at least 5,000, of the population lives in the qualifier urbanized   area(s); (6) At least 2,500 of the population lives in a central city of the   MSA located in the qualifier urbanized area(s). 5    --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \5\   See section 4 for the standards for identifying central cities.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------- B.   If a county qualifies on the basis of commuting to the central county/counties   of two different MSAs, it is assigned to the area to which commuting is   greatest, unless the relevant commuting percentages are within 5 points of each   other, in which case local opinion about the most appropriate assignment will   be considered. [[Page 70557]] C. If a county qualifies as a central county   under section 2 and also qualifies as an outlying county of another   metropolitan area under section 3A on the basis of commuting to (or from)   another central county, both counties become central counties of a single   merged MSA. Section 4. Central Cities The central city/cities of the MSA are:   A. The city with the largest population in the MSA; B. Each additional city   with a population of at least 250,000 or with at least 100,000 persons working   within its limits; C. Each additional city with a population of at least   25,000, an employment/residence ratio of at least 0.75, and at least 40 percent   of its employed residents working in the city; D. Each city of 15,000 to 24,999   population that is at least one-third as large as the largest central city, has   an employment/ residence ratio of at least 0.75, and has at least 40 percent of   its employed residents working in the city; E. The largest city in a secondary   noncontiguous urbanized area, provided it has at least 15,000 population, an   employment/residence ratio of at least 0.75, and has at least 40 percent of its   employed residents working in the city; F. Each additional city in a secondary   noncontiguous urbanized area that is at least one-third as large as the largest   central city of that urbanized area, that has at least 15,000 population and an   employment/residence ratio of at least 0.75, and that has at least 40 percent   of its employed residents working in the city. Section 5. Combining Adjacent   Metropolitan Statistical Areas Two adjacent MSAs defined by sections 1 through   4 are combined as a single MSA provided: A. The total population of the   combination is at least one million, and: (1) The commuting interchange between   the two MSAs is equal to: (a) At least 15 percent of the employed workers   residing in the smaller MSA, or (b) At least 10 percent of the employed workers   residing in the smaller MSA, and (i) The urbanized area of a central city of   one MSA is contiguous with the urbanized area of a central city of the other   MSA, or (ii) A central city in one MSA is included in the same urbanized area   as a central city in the other MSA; and (2) At least 60 percent of the   population of each MSA is urban. B. The total population of the combination is   less than one million and: (1) Their largest central cities are within 25 miles   of one another, or their urbanized areas are contiguous; and (2) There is   definite evidence that the two areas are closely integrated with each other   economically and socially; and (3) Local opinion in both areas supports the   combination. Section 6. Levels A. Each MSA defined by sections 1 through 5 is   categorized in one of the following levels based on total population: Level   A--MSAs of 1 million or more; Level B--MSAs of 250,000 to 999,999; Level   C--MSAs of 100,000 to 249,999; and Level D--MSAs of less than 100,000. B. Areas   assigned to Level B, C, or D are designated as MSAs. Areas assigned to Level A   are not finally designated or titled until they have been reviewed under   sections 8 and 9. Section 7. Titles of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) A.   The title of an MSA assigned to Level B, C, or D includes the name of the   largest central city, and up to two additional city names, as follows: (1) The   name of each additional city with a population of at least 250,000; (2) The   names of the additional cities qualified as central cities by section 4,   provided each is at least one-third as large as the largest central city; and   (3) The names of other central cities (up to the maximum of two additional   names) if local opinion supports the resulting title. B. An area title that   includes the names of more than one city begins with the name of the largest   city and lists the other cities in order of their population according to the   most recent national census. 6    --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \6\   The largest central city included in an existing metropolitan area title will   not be resequenced in or displaced from that title until both its population   and the number of persons working within its limits are exceeded by those of   another city qualifying for the area title.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------- C.   In addition to city names, the title contains the name of each State in which   the MSA is located. Standards for Primary and Consolidated Metropolitan   Statistical Areas (PMSAs and CMSAs). Sections 8 through 10 apply to Level A   metropolitan statistical areas outside New England. Section 8. Qualifications   for Designation of Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas (PMSAs) Within a   Level A MSA: A. Any county or group of counties that was designated an SMSA on   January 1, 1980, will be designated a PMSA, unless local opinion does not   support its continued separate designation for statistical purposes. B. Any   additional county/counties for which local opinion strongly supports separate   designation will be considered for identification as a PMSA, provided one   county is included that has: (1) At least 100,000 population; (2) At least 60   percent of its population urban; (3) Less than 35 percent of its resident   workers working outside the county; and (4) Less than 2,500 population of the   largest central city of the Level A MSA. C. A set of two or more contiguous   counties for which local opinion strongly supports separate designation, and   that may include a county or counties that also could qualify as a PMSA under   section 8B, also will be considered for designation as a PMSA, provided: (1)   Each county meets requirements (1), (2), and (4) of section 8B, and has less   than 50 percent of its resident workers working outside the county; (2) Each   county in the set has a commuting interchange of at least 20 percent with the   other counties in the set; and (3) The set of two or more contiguous counties   has less than 35 percent of its resident workers working outside its area. D.   Each county in the interim Level A MSA, not included within a central core   under sections 8A through C, is assigned to the contiguous PMSA to whose   central core commuting is greatest, provided this commuting is: (1) At least 15   percent of the county's resident workers; (2) At least 5 percentage points   higher than the commuting flow to any other PMSA central core that exceeds 15   percent; and (3) Larger than the flow to the county containing the Level A   MSA's largest central city. E. If a county has qualifying commuting ties to two   or more PMSA central cores and the relevant values are within 5 percentage   points of each other, local opinion is considered before the county is assigned   to any PMSA. F. The interim PMSA definitions resulting from these procedures   (including possible alternative definitions, where appropriate) are submitted   to local opinion. Final definitions of PMSAs are made based on these standards,   and a review of local opinion. G. If any primary metropolitan statistical area   or areas have been recognized under sections 8 A through F, the balance of the   Level A metropolitan statistical area, which includes its largest central city,   also is recognized as a primary metropolitan statistical area. 7    --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \7\   If section 8G would result in the balance of the Level A metropolitan   statistical area including a noncontiguous county, this county will be added to   the contiguous primary metropolitan statistical area to which the county has   the greatest commuting.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------   Section 9. Levels and Titles of Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas A. PMSAs   are categorized in one of four levels according to total population, following   the standards of Section 6A. B. PMSAs are titled in either of two ways: (1)   Using the names of up to three cities in the primary metropolitan statistical   area that have qualified as central cities of the Level A MSA under section 4,   following the standards of section 7 for selection and sequencing; or (2) Using   the names of up to three counties in the PMSA, sequenced in order from largest   to smallest population. C. Local opinion on the most appropriate title will be   considered. [[Page 70559]] Section 10. Designation and Titles of Consolidated   Metropolitan Statistical Areas A. A Level A metropolitan statistical area in   which two or more primary metropolitan statistical areas are identified by   section 8 is designated a consolidated metropolitan statistical area. If no   primary metropolitan statistical areas are defined, the Level A area remains a   metropolitan statistical area, and is titled according to section 7. B.   Consolidated metropolitan statistical areas are titled according to the   following guidelines. Local opinion is always sought before determining the   title of a consolidated metropolitan statistical area. (1) The title of each   area includes up to three names, the first of which is always the name of the   largest central city in the area. A change in the first-named city in the title   will not be made until both its population and the number of persons working   within its limits are exceeded by the those of another city in the consolidated   area. (2) The preferred basis for determining the two remaining names is: (a)   The first city (or county) name that appears in the title of the remaining   primary metropolitan statistical area with the largest total population; and   (b) The first city (or county) name that appears in the title of the primary   metropolitan statistical area with the next largest total population. (3) A   regional designation may be substituted for the second and/or third names in   the title if there is strong local support and the proposed designation is   unambiguous and suitable for inclusion in a national standard. Standards for   New England In the six New England States of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts,   New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont, the cities and towns are   administratively more important than the counties, and a wide range of data is   compiled locally for these entities. Therefore, the cities and towns are the   units used to define metropolitan areas in these States. The New England   standards are based primarily on population density and commuting. As a basis   for measuring commuting, a central core is first defined for each New England   urbanized area. In New England, there is an alternative county-based definition   of MSAs known as the New England County Metropolitan Areas (NECMAs) (see Part   IV). Section 11. New England Central Cores A central core is determined in each   New England urbanized area through the definition of two zones. A. Zone A   comprises: (1) The largest city in the urbanized area; (2) Each additional   place in the urbanized area or in a contiguous urbanized area that qualifies as   a central city under section 4, provided at least 15 percent of its resident   employed workers work in the largest city in the urbanized area; 8    --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \8\   Also accepted as meeting this commuting requirement are: (a) The number of   persons working in the subject city or town who live in the specified city or   area is equal to at least 15 percent of the employed workers living in the   subject city or town; or (b) The sum of the number of workers commuting to and   from the specified city or area is equal to at least 20 percent of the employed   workers living in the subject city or town.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------- (3)   Each additional city or town at least 50 percent of whose population lives in   the urbanized area or a contiguous urbanized area, provided at least 15 percent   of its resident employed workers work in the largest city in the urbanized area   plus any additional central cities qualified by section 11A(2). 8  B.   Zone B comprises each city or town that has: (1) At least 50 percent of its   population living in the urbanized area or in a contiguous urbanized area; and   (2) At least 15 percent of its resident employed workers working in Zone   A. 8  C. The central core comprises Zone A, Zone B, and any city or   town that is physically surrounded by Zones A or B, except that cities or towns   that are not contiguous with the main portion of the central core are not   included. D. If a city or town qualifies under sections 11A through C for more   than one central core, it is assigned to the core to which commuting is   greatest, unless the relevant commuting percentages are within 5 points of each   other, in which case local opinion as to the most appropriate assignment also   is considered. Section 12. Outlying Cities and Towns A. A city or town   contiguous to a central core as defined by section 11 is included in its   metropolitan statistical area if: (1) It has a population density of at least   60 persons per square mile and at least 30 percent of its resident employed   workers work in the central core; or (2) It has a population density of at   least 100 persons per square mile and at least 15 percent of the employed   workers living in the city or town work in the central core. 9    --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \9\   This commuting requirement is also considered to have been met if: (a) The   number of persons working in the city or town who live in the central core is   equal to at least 15 percent of the employed workers living in the city or   town. (b) The sum of the number of workers commuting to and from the central   core is equal to at least 20 percent of the employed workers living in the city   or town.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------- B.   If a city or town has the qualifying level of commuting to two different   central cores, it is assigned to the metropolitan statistical area to which   commuting is greatest, unless the relevant commuting percentages are within 5   points of each other, in which case local opinion as to the most appropriate   assignment also is considered. C. If a city or town has the qualifying level of   commuting to a central core, but has greater commuting to a nonmetropolitan   city or town, it will not be assigned to any metropolitan statistical area   unless the relevant commuting percentages are within 5 points of each other, in   which case local opinion as to the most appropriate assignment will also be   considered. Section 13. Applicability of Basic Standards to New England   Metropolitan Statistical Areas A. An area defined by sections 11 and 12   qualifies as a metropolitan statistical area if it contains a city of at least   50,000 population or has a total population of at least 75,000. 10    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------   \10\ A New England metropolitan statistical area designated on the basis of   census data according to standards in effect at the time of designation will   not be disqualified on the basis of lacking a total population of at least   75,000.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------- B.   The area's central cities are determined according to the standards of section   4. C. Two adjacent New England metropolitan statistical areas are combined as a   single metropolitan statistical area provided the conditions of section 5A are   met. Section 5B is not applied in New England. D. Each New England metropolitan   statistical area defined by sections 13A through C is categorized in one of the   four levels specified in section 6A. Areas assigned to Level B, C, or D are   designated as metropolitan statistical areas. Areas assigned to Level A are not   finally designated until they have been reviewed under sections 14 and 15. E.   New England metropolitan statistical areas are titled according to the   standards of section 7. Section 14. Qualification for Designation of Primary   Metropolitan Statistical Areas (PMSAs) The following are qualifications within   a Level A metropolitan statistical area in New England: A. Any group of cities   and towns that was recognized as a standard metropolitan statistical area on   January 1, 1980, will be recognized as a primary metropolitan statistical area,   unless local opinion does not support its continued separate recognition for   statistical purposes. B. Any additional group of cities and/or towns for which   local opinion strongly supports separate recognition will be considered for   designation as a primary metropolitan statistical area, if: (1) The total   population of the group is at least 75,000; (2) It includes at least one city   with a population of 15,000 or more, an employment/residence ratio of at least   0.75, and at least 40 percent of its employed residents working in the city;   (3) It contains a core of communities, each of which has at least 50 percent of   its population living in the urbanized area, and which together have less than   40 percent of their resident workers commuting to jobs outside the core; and   (4) Each community in the core also has: (a) At least 5 percent of its resident   workers working in the component core city identified in section 14B(2), or at   least 10 percent working in the component core city or in places already   qualified for this core; this percentage also must be greater than that to any   other core or to the largest city of the Level A MSA; and (b) At least 20   percent commuting interchange with the component core city together with other   cities and towns already [[Page 70559]] qualified for the core; this   interchange also must be greater than with any other core or with the largest   city of the Level A MSA. C. Contiguous component central cores may be merged as   a single core if: (1) Section 14B would qualify the component core city of one   core for inclusion in the other core; and (2) There is substantial local   support for treating the two as a single core. D. Each city or town in the   interim Level A MSA not included in a core under sections 14A through C is   assigned to the contiguous PMSA to whose core its commuting is greatest, if:   (1) This commuting is at least 15 percent of the place's resident workers; and   (2) The commuting interchange with the core is greater than with the Level A   MSA's largest city. E. If a city or town has qualifying commuting ties to two   or more cores and the relevant values are within 5 percentage points of each   other, local opinion is considered before the place is assigned to any PMSA. F.   The interim PMSA definitions resulting from these procedures (including   possible alternative definitions, where appropriate) are submitted to local   opinion. Final definitions of PMSAs are made based on these standards, and a   review of local opinion. G. If any primary metropolitan statistical area or   areas have been recognized under sections 14A through F, the balance of the   Level A metropolitan statistical area, which includes its largest city, also is   recognized as a primary metropolitan statistical area.  11    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------   \11\ If section 14G results in the balance of the Level A metropolitan   statistical area including a noncontiguous city or town, this place will be   added to the contiguous primary metropolitan statistical area to which it has   the greatest commuting.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------   Section 15. Levels and Titles of Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas and   Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas in New England A. New England   primary metropolitan statistical areas are categorized in one of four levels   according to total population, following section 6A. B. New England primary   metropolitan statistical areas are titled using the names of up to three cities   in the primary area that have qualified as central cities under section 4,   following the standards of section 7 for selection and sequencing. C. Each   Level A metropolitan statistical area in New England in which primary   metropolitan statistical areas have been identified and supported by local   opinion (according to section 14) is designated a consolidated metropolitan   statistical area. Titles of New England consolidated metropolitan statistical   areas are determined following the standards of section 10. A Level A   metropolitan statistical area in which no primary metropolitan statistical   areas have been defined is designated a metropolitan statistical area, and is   titled according to the rules of section 7. Section 16. Intercensal   Metropolitan Area Changes A. Definitions. (1) A Census Count is a special   census conducted by the U.S. Bureau of the Census or a decennial census count   updated to reflect annexations and boundary changes since the census. (2) A   Census Bureau Estimate is a population estimate issued by the U.S. Bureau of   the Census for an intercensal year. B. Qualification for Designation of a   Metropolitan Statistical Area. The qualifications for designation are as   follows: (1) A city reaches 50,000 population according to a Census Count or   Census Bureau Estimate. (2) A nonmetropolitan county containing an urbanized   area (UA) defined by the Bureau of the Census at the most recent decennial   census reaches 100,000 population according to a Census Count or Census Bureau   Estimate. If the potential metropolitan statistical area centered on the   urbanized area consists of two or more counties, their total population must   reach 100,000. In New England, the cities and towns qualifying for the   potential metropolitan statistical area must reach a total population of   75,000. (3) The Census Bureau defines a new urbanized area based on a Census   Count after the decennial census, and the potential metropolitan statistical   area containing the urbanized area meets the population requirements of section   16.B(2). If a metropolitan statistical area is qualified intercensally by a   Census Bureau Estimate, the qualification must be confirmed by the next   decennial census, or the area is disqualified. C. Addition of Counties.   Counties are not added to metropolitan statistical areas between censuses,   except as follows: (1) If a central city located in a qualifier urbanized area   extends into a county not included in the metropolitan statistical area and the   population of the portion of the city in the county reaches 2,500 according to   a Census Count, then the county qualifies as an outlying county and is added to   the metropolitan statistical area. (2) If a metropolitan statistical area   qualified intercensally under section 16B meets the requirements of section 5B   for combination with a metropolitan statistical area already recognized, that   combination may take place and thereby alter the definition of the existing   metropolitan statistical area. D. Qualification for Designation of a Central   City. A Census Count serves to qualify a central city (section 4) that has   failed to qualify solely because its population was smaller than required-- for   example, it did not qualify as the largest city of the metropolitan statistical   area (section 4A), or was below 250,000 (4B), below 25,000 (4C), or below   15,000 (4D-F). If qualification requires comparison with the population of   another city, comparison is made with the latest available Census Bureau   Estimate or Census Count of the population of the other city. E. Area Titles.   The title of a metropolitan statistical area, primary metropolitan statistical   area, or consolidated metropolitan statistical area may be altered to include   the name of a place that has newly qualified as a central city on the basis   described in section 16D, and that also meets the requirements of section 7.   Such a change is made by adding the new name at the end of the existing title,   but cannot be made if the title already contains three names. Names in area   titles are not resequenced except on the basis of a decennial census. F. Other   aspects of the metropolitan area definitions are not subject to change between   censuses. Part IV. General Procedures and Definitions This part specifies   certain important guidelines regarding the data and procedures used in   implementing the standards. It also gives definitions for ""city,"" ""urbanized   area,"" and other key terms. General Procedures Local Opinion. Local opinion is   the reflection of the views of the public on specified matters relating to the   application of the standards for defining metropolitan areas, obtained through   the appropriate congressional delegation, and considered after the thresholds   in the statistical standards have been met. Members of the congressional   delegation will be urged to contact a wide range of groups in their   communities, including business or other leaders, Chambers of Commerce,   planning commissions, and local officials, to solicit comments on specified   issues. OMB will consider all pertinent local opinion material on these matters   in determining the final definition and title of the area. After a decision has   been made on a particular matter, OMB will not again request local opinion on   the same question until after the next national census. Local opinion is   considered for: (a) Combining two adjacent metropolitan statistical areas (of   less than one million population) whose central cities are within 25 miles of   each other (section 5B). (b) Metropolitan statistical area titles (section   7A(3)). (c) Identifying primary metropolitan statistical areas within   consolidated metropolitan statistical areas (sections 8 and 14). (d) Titling   primary metropolitan statistical areas (sections 9 and 15). (e) Titling   consolidated metropolitan statistical areas after identification of the largest   city (sections 10 and 15). (f) Assignment of a county or place that, based on   commuting, is eligible for inclusion in more than one area (sections 3B, 8E,   11D, 12B and 12C, and 14E). New England County Metropolitan Areas (NECMAs). The   New England County Metropolitan Areas (NECMAs) provide an alternative to the   official city-and-town-based metropolitan statistical areas in that region for   the convenience of data users who desire a county-defined set of areas. The   NECMA for a metropolitan statistical area includes: 1. The county containing   the first-named city in the metropolitan statistical area title. In some cases,   this county will contain the [[Page 70560]] first-named city of one or more   additional metropolitan statistical areas. 2. Each other county which has at   least half of its population in the metropolitan statistical area(s) whose   first-named cities are in the county identified in step 1. The NECMA for a   consolidated metropolitan statistical area also is defined by the above rules,   except that the New England portion of the consolidated metropolitan   statistical area which includes New York City is used as the basis for defining   a separate NECMA. No NECMAs are defined for individual primary metropolitan   statistical areas. The central cities of a NECMA are those cities in the NECMA   that qualify as central cities of a metropolitan statistical area or   consolidated metropolitan statistical area; some central cities may not be   included in any NECMA title. The title of the NECMA includes each city in the   NECMA that is the first-named title city of a metropolitan area, in descending   order of metropolitan statistical area (or primary metropolitan statistical   area) total population. Other cities that appear in metropolitan area titles   are included only if the resulting NECMA title would consist of no more than   three names. Levels for NECMAs are determined following section 6A of the   official metropolitan area standards. Percentages, Densities, and Ratios.   Percentages and densities are computed to the nearest tenth (one decimal);   ratios are computed to the nearest one hundredth (two decimals); and   comparisons between them are made on that basis. Populations. In general, the   population data required by the standards are taken from the most recent   national census. However, in certain situations either (1) the results of a   special census taken by the Bureau of the Census, or (2) a population estimate   published by the Bureau of the Census may be used to meet the requirements of   the standards (section 16). Review of Cutoffs and Values. OMB has promulgated   these standards with the advice of the Federal Executive Committee on   Metropolitan Areas, following an open period of public comment. After the 1990   decennial census data become available, the Federal Executive Committee will   review the census data and their implications for the cutoffs and values used   in the standards, and will report to OMB the results of its review. Definitions   of Key Terms Central Core--The counties (or cities and towns in New England)   that are eligible for initial delineation as primary metropolitan statistical   areas because they meet specified population and commuting criteria. City--The   term ""city"" includes: (a) Any place incorporated under the laws of its State as   a city, village, borough (except in Alaska), or town (except in the New England   States, New York, and Wisconsin). These comprise the category of incorporated   places recognized in Bureau of the Census publications. (b) In Hawaii, any   place recognized as a census designated place by the Bureau of the Census in   consultation with the State government; in Puerto Rico, any place recognized as   a zona urbana or a comunidad by the Bureau of the Census in consultation with   the Commonwealth government. (Hawaii and Puerto Rico do not have legally   defined cities corresponding to those of most States.) (c) Any township in   Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, or Pennsylvania, and any town in the New   England States, New York, or Wisconsin, at least 90 percent of whose population   is classified by the Bureau of the Census as urban, provided it does not   contain any part of a dependent incorporated place. Commuting Interchange--The   commuting interchange between two areas is the sum of the number of workers who   live in either of the areas but work in the other. County--For purposes of the   standards, the term ""county"" includes county equivalents, such as parishes in   Louisiana and boroughs and census areas (formerly census divisions) in Alaska.   Certain States contain cities that are independent of any county; such   independent cities in Maryland, Missouri, and Nevada are treated as county   equivalents for purposes of the standards. In Virginia, where most incorporated   places of more than 15,000 are independent of counties, the standards usually   regard each such city as included in the county from which it was originally   formed, or primarily formed. In certain exceptional cases, the city itself is   treated as a county equivalent, as follows: (a) An independent city that has   absorbed its parent county (Chesapeake, Hampton, Newport News, Suffolk,   Virginia Beach); and (b) An independent city associated with an urbanized area   other than the one with which its parent county is primarily associated (for   example, Colonial Heights). A county included in a metropolitan area is either   a central (section 2), or an outlying (section 3) county. An outlying county   must be contiguous with a central county or with an outlying county that has   already qualified for inclusion. Employment/Residence Ratio--This ratio is   computed by dividing the number of persons working in the city by the number of   resident workers with place of work reported. (These items are taken from the   most recent national census.) For example, a city with an equal number of jobs   and working residents has an employment/residence ratio of 1.00. Interim   Area--An area that meets the requirements of sections 1 through 4, or sections   11 through 13, for metropolitan statistical area qualification, which needs to   be further examined to determine: (1) if it qualifies for combination with any   adjacent interim area, (2) its final level, based on population; and (3) if the   area has 1 million or more population, the identification of primary   metropolitan statistical areas, if any, and the preferences, expressed through   local opinion, for consolidated or individual identity. Largest Central   City--The largest central city of a metropolitan area is the central city with   the greatest population at the time of the initial metropolitan area   designation. Once determined, the largest central city will not be replaced   until both its population and the number of persons working within its limits   are exceeded by those of another city in the area. Outcommuting--The number (or   percent) or workers living in a specified area, such as a city or a county,   whose place of work is located outside that area. Qualifier Urbanized Area--The   qualifier urbanized area(s) for a metropolitan statistical area are: 1. The   urbanized area that resulted in qualification under section 1B or the urbanized   area containing the city that resulted in qualification under section 1A. 2.   Any other urbanized area whose largest city is located in the same county as   the largest city of the urbanized area identified in paragraph one above, or   has a least 50 percent of its population in that county. Secondary   Noncontiguous Urbanized Area--An additional urbanized area within a   metropolitan statistical area that has no common boundary of more than a mile   with the main urbanized area around which the metropolitan statistical area is   defined. Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area--The term used from 1959 to   1983 to describe the statistical system of metropolitan areas, and the areas as   individually defined. It was preceded by Standard Metropolitan Area (SMA) from   1950 to 1959, and superseded by Metropolitan Statistical Area in 1983. That   term was adopted when the current system formally recognizing consolidated   metropolitan statistical areas and their component primary metropolitan   statistical areas was put in place. The term Metropolitan Area (MA) is used to   describe the system and the areas collectively, but the individual areas will   retain the MSA, CMSA, and PMSA nomenclature. Urban--The Bureau of the Census   classifies as urban: (a) The population living in urbanized areas; plus (b) The   population in other incorporated or census designated places of at least 2,500   population at the most recent national census. Urbanized Area--An area defined   by the Bureau of the Census according to specific criteria, designed to include   the densely settled area around a large place. The definition is based   primarily on density rather than governmental unit boundaries. An urbanized   area must have a total population of at least 50,000. (See qualifier urbanized   area and secondary noncontiguous urbanized area). Appendix B--OMB Memorandum   M-94-22, ""`Use of Metropolitan Area Definitions"" May 5, 1994 M-94-22 MEMORANDUM   FOR HEADS OF DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES FROM: Leon E. Panetta SUBJECT: Use of   Metropolitan Area Definitions On December 28, 1992, the Office of Management   and Budget issued revised metropolitan area (MA) definitions to reflect shifts   in population and other demographic changes that had occurred during the   preceding decade. At the time the revisions [[Page 70561]] were announced, we   provided guidance (OMB Bulletin 93-05) to Federal departments and agencies   concerning the use of MA definitions for statistical purposes. During the past   year, we have received a substantial number of letters from Members of   Congress, local government officials, and others involved with administering   various Federal programs. For the most part, their correspondence has been   related to nonstatistical uses of the MA definitions in the allocation of   Federal program funds. Their concerns have highlighted the need to reiterate   the purposes for which OMB defines metropolitan areas and our advice with   respect to other uses agencies may make of these definitions. The metropolitan   area classification provides a nationally consistent set of definitions   suitable for collecting, tabulating, and publishing Federal statistics. The   definitions of metropolitan areas are established and maintained solely for   statistical purposes. In periodically reviewing and revising the MA   definitions, OMB does not take into account or attempt to anticipate any   nonstatistical uses that may be made of the definitions, nor will OMB modify   the definitions to meet the requirements of any nonstatistical program. We   recognize that some legislation specifies the use of metropolitan areas for   programmatic purposes, including allocating Federal funds. For example, the   Health Care Financing Administration uses MAs to define labor market areas and   gather hospital wage data that are used in developing a hospital wage index for   the labor related portion of a hospital's standardized Medicare payment. The   Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community Development Block Grant   (CDBG) program targets 70 percent of CDBG funds to ""entitlement communities""   which include cities of 50,000 or more or central cities of MAs. We will   continue to work with the Congress to clarify the foundations of the   metropolitan area definitions and the resultant, often unintended consequences   of their use for nonstatistical purposes. In cases where there is no statutory   requirement and an agency elects to use the MA definitions in a nonstatistical   program, it is the sponsoring agency's responsibility to ensure that the   definitions are appropriate for such use. When an agency is publishing for   comment a proposed regulation that would use the MA definitions for a   nonstatistical purpose, the agency should seek public comment on the proposed   use of the MA definitions. I would appreciate your sharing this information   with others in your department or agency. Note: The latest version of OMB   Bulletin 93-05, referenced above, is OMB Bulletin No. 98-06, issued on June 23,   1998. Appendix C--Summary of the Conference on New Approaches to Defining   Metropolitan and Nonmetropolitan Areas This conference, held on November 29-30,   1995 in Bethesda, Maryland, constituted part of the Office of Management and   Budget's metropolitan area standards review that is to be completed by spring   2000. The conference provided an open forum for discussion of proposed   alternative approaches to defining metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas, as   well as discussion of the current metropolitan area standards. Presentations of   findings from four commissioned studies of alternative approaches to defining   areas were the centerpiece of the conference. Papers from these studies were   published in Metropolitan and Nonmetropolitan Areas: New Approaches to   Geographical Definition, Population Division Working Paper No. 12, Bureau of   the Census. Conference Points of General Agreement The Federal Government   should define standard metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. The metropolitan   and nonmetropolitan areas defined should cover the entire territory of the   United States and better account for the full range of settlement patterns than   do the current, dichotomous metropolitan areas and nonmetropolitan residual.   Metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas should be defined according to the same   set of rules for all parts of the country. A county-based set of metropolitan   and nonmetropolitan areas is necessary, but also there should be alternative,   sub-county unit-based areas. Familiar components of settlement--including those   represented by today's metropolitan area definitions--should be in evidence in   a new system. Conference Views on Major Questions The conference explicitly   addressed a list of major questions that are fundamental to any set of areas   defined by the Federal Government. These same questions had been addressed in   the commissioned studies that were the centerpiece of the conference. Presented   here are summaries of the conference discussions of these questions. What   should be the basic geographic units for defining areas? There was strong   consensus that there must be a county-based set of defined areas for reasons of   data availability, comparability, and familiarity, but also there were comments   favoring additional sets of areas based on sub-county units for greater   precision and special purposes. There were suggestions that multiple sets of   areas should be provided, along with documentation on appropriate uses of those   sets. There also were suggestions that the Census Bureau and the Office of   Management and Budget should facilitate ""do-it-yourself"" definitions by making   readily available as much small-area data as possible. What should be the   criteria for aggregating the basic units? Commuting data as obtained from the   decennial census were regarded as the best measure for defining areas by most   individuals addressing this question. Other data-including electronic media and   newspaper market penetration data, local traffic study data, and wholesale   distribution data-are available and usable for specific purposes. Population   and housing density data are useful for some purposes within the definition   task. Employment density also received mention. Should there be hierarchies or   multiple sets of areas? As already noted, there were comments favoring use of   different geographic units to define sets of areas that would be available for   different purposes. There also was discussion--without any clear outcome--of   classifying entities within a nationwide metropolitan/ nonmetropolitan   definition framework into such categories as inner city and suburban. What   kinds of areas should receive official recognition? Inner city, suburban, and   exurban all received mention as areas that should be recognized within   metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas, but this issue was not fully addressed.   Should a new system provide nationwide territorial coverage? There was strong   agreement that the areas defined should cover the Nation's entire territory.   Should the definition process follow strictly statistical rules or allow a role   for local opinion? There were reservations regarding the usefulness of local   opinion in a program of standard statistical areas, but the majority view   expressed was that soliciting local opinion can serve a useful purpose,   particularly in providing room for accommodation on some issues of local   significance without threatening the integrity of the national system. The   incorporation of local opinion, two individuals noted, should come early in the   definition process. What should be the frequency of updating? There was little   discussion of this topic, as the frequency of updating depends heavily on   decisions concerning basic geographic units, criteria for aggregation, and data   availability. Should the Federal Government define metropolitan and   nonmetropolitan areas? The overall view was strongly in favor of metropolitan   and nonmetropolitan areas being defined, although a few individuals seemed to   support the idea of ceasing the Federal Government's activity in this arena   altogether. Areas defined by the Federal Government offer to a wide community   of data users the advantage of direct data comparability, i.e., data from   different sources for areas with the same boundaries. This advantage may rise   in importance in the face of programs shifting to states. There also were those   who argued in favor of a standard set of areas on the grounds that such areas   were useful for non-statistical program administration. Others noted that the   absence of a standard set of areas probably would produce competing sets of   areas from different Federal agencies.

These files include voting districts and individual block statistics.            For voting districts the entire state is in one file and is available            by clicking ""Voting Districts"".

GX168-10-16277142	"This script opens a separate window with the Census 2000 glossary               Census 2000 Gateway   |     Glossary                                                   Census 2000: Another Technological Revolution?            (Technical and general audiences)    In 1890, it was keypunch cards; in 1950, UNIVAC I, the first civilian-use mainframe electronic computer, made its debut; for Census 2000, the Census Bureau could introduce yet another technological revolution.   Census 2000 will be the first fully computerized census, from collecting data to releasing the final results on the Internet. And, in the level of access to the data, it could be considered the most democratic of the 21 censuses of population and housing ever. Internet will give millions of more data users the tools they need to construct a digital picture of America down to any one of 7 million census blocks.   For the first time, the data capture process will use optical scanners that can read hand-printing to process the millions of questionnaires returned by mail or filled out by enumerators. Scanners, of course, have been used for decades to recognize the marks made on standardized I.Q. and college-admission tests. But the strokes making the marks were restricted to defined ovals or boxes and the markings themselves to No. 2 lead pencils.   By contrast, the optical scanners to be used in Census 2000 will recognize and decipher hand-written responses made by pens, as well as pencils. But the scanners are just one component of the system being developed by Lockheed-Martin Mission Systems. Lockheed is using commercially available sorters, scanners and processors -- rather than developing expensive new hardware and software -- in a system called Data Capture System 2000 (DCS 2000). Within this system, the scanners will take electronic photos, or images, of the census forms. Then, the ""photos"" will be processed by software capable of recognizing an infinite variety of hand strokes as either alphabetic or numeric characters. After the characters are translated into computer code, the responses will be transmitted electronically to the Census Bureau headquarters complex for statistical processing and analysis.   More than 100 million questionnaires will flow through the DCS 2000 systems at four data capture centers located around the country. Three of these centers, one in Baltimore County, Md., a second in Phoenix, Ariz., and the third in Pomona, Calif., are being established under a contract with TRW Inc. just for Census 2000. A fourth, in Jeffersonville, Ind., is a permanent installation called the National Processing Center, run directly by the Census Bureau to process its other censuses and surveys.   ""Each center will employ between 1,500 and 2,000 people at the height of the census between March and July, 2000,"" according to Ann Gwynn of the Census Bureau's Data Capture Program. ""TRW will be responsible for leasing, designing and building out space for the facilities, as well as hiring and training the workers who will operate DCS 2000.""   As the forms come into the data capture centers, they will be checked in and the envelopes slit open for manual removal of the forms. The check-in process also captures information about which households have responded to the census. Those that do not will be contacted by a follow-up census-taker. Once the check-in function is completed, forms are fed into the digital scanners. The resulting images are sent to sophisticated computer processors where they are assessed for quality. Only then are the data ""read"" from the form. The goal is to minimize expensive manual keying operations and process the forms faster -- as much as 20 times faster.   As in the most recent censuses, two basic forms will be used, the  so-called short- and long-form questionnaires. The short form, sent to roughly 83 percent of the estimated 118 million housing units in the country, asks for information on age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, household relationship and whether the housing unit is owned or rented. The long form seeks more detailed socio-economic information. The printing contract for the census questionnaires was scheduled to be awarded in November of 1998.   Census population totals are used to reapportion among the states the seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and, within states, to redraw the boundaries of state legislative districts and even some local voting districts. These totals and subsequent population estimates based on the decennial numbers are one element that determines eligibility or distribution to state and local governments of more than $180 billion a year in federal program funds (FY 1996 figures).   This census, moreover, will empower citizens to participate more directly than ever in political processes. Using the data disseminated by the Census Bureau via Internet, literally millions of people with access to personal computers will better understand the reasons behind zoning, road-building, new school or medical-facility decisions, as well as broader issues such as demographic trends and economic opportunities.   The use of keypunch cards in the 1890 census ushered in an era of business machines, tabulators, cash registers, etc. The computer age flowed out of UNIVAC I, used to process 1950 census data. With Census 2000 making it possible for anyone to log on to the same data used by government officials and interest groups, America will move closer to becoming an Internet Society -- a perpetual town-meeting in cyberspace.

GX039-00-16008612	"Evaluating Components of International Migration:  Quality of Foreign-Born and Hispanic Population Data    Arthur Cresce  Roberto Ramirez  Gregory Spencer    Population Division  U. S. Bureau of the Census  Washington, D.C. 20233   December 2001   Population Division Working Paper No. 65      DISCLAIMER:    This paper reports the results of research and analysis undertaken by Census Bureau Staff. It has undergone a more limited review than official Census Bureau publications. This report is released to inform interested parties of research and to encourage discussion.        Synopsis    On March 1, 2001, the U.S. Census Bureau issued the recommendation of the Executive Steering Committee for A.C.E. Policy (ESCAP) that the Census 2000 Redistricting Data not be adjusted based on the Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation (A.C.E.). By mid-October 2001, the Census Bureau had to recommend whether Census 2000 data should be adjusted for future uses, such as the census long form data products, post-censal population estimates, and demographic survey controls.  In order to inform that decision, the ESCAP requested that further research be conducted.   Between March and September 2001, the Demographic Analysis-Population Estimates (DAPE) research project addressed the discrepancy between the demographic analysis data and the A.C.E. adjusted estimates of the population.  Specifically, the research examined the historical levels of the components of population change to address the possibility that the 1990 Demographic Analysis understated the national population and assessed whether demographic analysis had not captured the full population growth between 1990 and 2000.  Assumptions regarding the components of international migration (specifically, emigration, temporary migration, legal migration, and unauthorized migration) contain the largest uncertainty in the demographic analysis estimates. Therefore, evaluating the components of international migration was a critical activity in the DAPE project.   This report addressed the question: ""How do edit and imputation procedures affect the consistency of foreign-born and Hispanic populations?""  Comparisons were made between the edit and imputation specifications for the 1990 census and Census 2000 for the questions on place of birth and Hispanic origin to determine what impact, if any, such differences might have had on comparisons of numbers between the censuses.  There were few significant differences in the specifications for the question on place of birth.  The most significant difference - ""hot deck"" imputation of specific countries of birth in Census 2000 but not in 1990 - did not affect the overall total of foreign-born people.  Regarding the specifications for the Hispanic question, several important differences were noted, the most important of which was the use of surname-assisted ""hot decks"" in assigning an origin.  Overall, the Census 2000 edit and imputation procedures seemed to be more accurate than the 1990 procedures in assigning an origin.  The improvement in assigning an origin was assisted by a substantial decline between 1990 and 2000 in the level of nonresponse to the question on Hispanic origin.

We analyzed the edit and imputation procedures from the 1990    census and Census 2000 to answer this question.         Executive Summary             Foreign-Born Population  - A comparison of the key      differences between the 1990 census and Census 2000 edit      specifications for the place of birth question reveals one      significant difference. (See Table A.)  In 1990, 808,158 people      who were imputed as foreign born were not assigned a specific      country of birth.  Instead, these people were assigned the      generic code for ""Country of birth not reported.""  By contrast,      people imputed as foreign born in Census 2000 will be assigned a      specific country of birth.   While this difference does not have      an impact on the total foreign-born population, it has a      significant impact on comparisons of country of birth totals      between 1990 and 2000.       Task Team 5 is investigating how people in the ""country of      birth not reported category"" in 1990 were allocated after      the fact to a specific country of birth for the purpose of      developing population estimates.  Other differences in the      edit and imputation procedures do not appear to be of      sufficient magnitude to warrant further quantitative      analysis.            Hispanic Population  - Comparison of the 100-percent edit and      imputation procedures for the 1990 Census and Census 2000 reveals      differences between the two procedures. (See Table A.) In      general, the 1990 procedures were not as rigorous as the Census      2000 procedures in assigning an origin. One significant      difference between the two procedures specifications is the use      of surname-assisted hot decks in Census 2000.            An extremely important context for understanding the impact      of these differences is the fact that the number of      allocations for the origin question dropped by 34 percent      between 1990 and 2000.  This translated into a drop from      25.5 million allocations in 1990 to 16.8 million allocations      in 2000.  In addition to the drop in overall allocations,      there was a fundamental shift in the type of allocation      made.  In 1990, 75.6 percent of allocations occurred through      the ""hot deck"" (nearest neighbor) method.  By contrast, only      41.2 percent of allocations required hot deck allocation in      Census 2000.  This is an important point, because of the      techniques used (imputation based on other information      provided by the respondent, allocation from other household      members, and hot deck allocation), hot deck allocation is      the least reliable.  We can attribute this improvement, in      large part, to moving the question on origin  before  the      question on race.            There is strong evidence that the less restrictive 1990 edit      and imputation procedures and greater reliance on hot deck      allocation, combined with a much higher level of nonresponse      to the Hispanic origin question in 1990, may have resulted      in ""over-editing"" at least 161,000 people as Hispanic.      Although we did not attempt to run the Census 2000 edit and      imputation program on 1990 data, we believe the Census 2000      would have imputed fewer people as Hispanic than did the      1990 program.                       Philosophy of Edit and Imputation Procedures 1          In any imputation scheme, imputed values may differ (sometimes         significantly) from what would have been obtained had the         information been reported by the respondent.  Edit and         imputation techniques are designed to make the best possible         estimate of the probable response given the best information         available.  For example, if the respondent did not provide an         origin, the procedure first checked to determine if the person         indicated that he (or she) was Hispanic in the question on         race (close to half of Hispanics provided an Hispanic         ethnicity in the race question).  If an origin could not be         obtained from race, then the procedures attempted to allocate         an origin from other people in the household (according to a         hierarchy of household relationship) under the assumption that         people living in the same household would tend to have the         same origin.  If an origin could not be obtained from within         the household, as a last resort, an origin was assigned by hot         deck allocation under the assumption that people of the same         origin tend to live in close proximity to each other.  To the         extent that these assumptions do not hold for a given person         or household, allocated values might differ from what would         have been obtained had the information been obtained directly         from the respondent.           Edit and imputation procedures attempt to rely as much as         possible on sources of information about which there is the         most confidence (other information provided by the respondent         or responses of other household members) and to rely less on         last resort procedures such as hot deck allocation.  Even with         hot decks, efforts are made to improve the accuracy of         allocation by matching donors and donees according to one or         more key characteristics.  For example, in the 1990 census,         origin hot decks used race as a matching variable for donors         and donees.  In contrast, Census 2000 used not only race, but         also age and whether the surname was Spanish or not Spanish,         as matching variables.  We believe these additional variables         improved the accuracy of origin allocation from the hot deck.         Comparison of Edit and Imputation Procedures for Place         of Birth          Table A provides a summary of the differences between the         1990 and the Census 2000 edit and imputation procedures for         the question on place of birth.  An analysis of the         differences noted indicates that none of the changes should         have significantly affected comparisons in the  overall          number of native and foreign-born people between 1990 and 2000.         The following changes were deemed to have had only a minor impact         (if any) on the totals:                 Changes to the hot deck              The age/race/Hispanic controls for the hot deck were revised             for the two main hot decks by combining race and Hispanic             categories (Hispanic; non-Hispanic White; non-Hispanic             Black; non-Hispanic Asian; non-Hispanic Other) rather than a             cross tabulation of race and Hispanic origin (Hispanic             White; Hispanic Black; Hispanic Other; non-Hispanic White;             non-Hispanic Black; non-Hispanic Other).  In addition, more             hot decks with limited universes (e.g. Puerto Rico and             outlying areas only) were used.                     Separate procedures for group quarters (GQ)              The 1990 edit and imputation procedures included the GQ             population within the same edit and imputation procedures as             those used for the household population.  First, the portion             of the procedures that attempted to assign a state or             country of birth from other information provided by the             respondent was imbedded within the procedures used for the             household population. Furthermore, people in GQ's needing a             state or country of birth from the hot deck obtained one             from the same hot deck as that used by the rest of the             population.  By contrast in Census 2000, the portion of the             procedures that attempted to assign a state or country of             birth was entirely separate from that for the household             population. Furthermore, the Census 2000 procedures use             separate hot decks for the GQ population controlled by age             and 6 GQ types (correctional institutions, nursing homes,             college quarters, military quarters, other institutions, and             all other GQ's).                     Availability of information for adopted children              The 1990 edit and imputation procedures distinguished             between ""natural born or adopted sons or daughters"" and             ""stepsons/stepdaughters"" in assigning a state or country of             birth.  The Census 2000 procedures combined these categories             into one category ""son/daughter"" in attempting to assign a             state or country of birth.               While these changes reflect an attempt to provide a more         precise allocation of state or country of birth, they do not         appear to be of sufficient importance to affect adversely         comparisons of  levels  of foreign born compared with natives         between the two censuses.  It is unclear, however, how         differences between the edit and imputation procedures may         have affected comparisons between specific states or countries         of birth for the two censuses.  We will need to evaluate these         issues when we obtain the long form data in Spring 2002.               The use of a native or foreign-born check box in the question         may have had some impact for prompting people to report a         place of birth.  However, because the question relies         primarily  on a write-in entry for appropriate classification         as native or foreign born (in fact, the write-in entry takes         precedence over the check box), it is not clear that we would         have obtained different results because of the check box         categories.  The check box categories played a role in the         edit and imputation procedures when no write-in response was         provided, but this role was a rather limited one.  When there         was no write-in response, a citizenship response, in some         instances, was actually given higher weight in assigning a         place of birth than the check box response.               The most important difference between the 1990 and 2000 edit         and imputation procedures was in the assignment of a specific         country of birth for people not reporting a place of birth who         were assigned as foreign born.  In 1990, people who were         assigned as foreign born were not assigned a specific country         of birth.  Instead, these people were classified as ""Area not         reported.""  By contrast, the edit and imputation procedures         for Census 2000 will assign a specific country of birth.         While this difference does not affect comparisons of the total         foreign born between the two censuses, it does affect any         comparison by country of birth.  In fact, we had to distribute         the ""Area not reported"" population among countries of birth         for intercensal estimates that required detailed country of         birth data.  Another DAPE task team is analyzing how these         distributions were made and will not be discussed further in         this report. 2                The allocation rate for the place of birth question in 1990         was 5.4 percent.  By contrast, the rate for Census 2000 was         9.0 percent. 3   The difference in the level of nonresponse         between the two censuses can be explained partially by the         fact that the 1990 census had a content edit follow-up         operation that attempted to obtain answers from census forms         that had more than a pre-specified threshold of questions with         no answers.  Census 2000 did not implement a content edit         follow-up operation.  The increased level of nonresponse,         however, does not necessarily imply that comparisons of data         on specific countries of birth between 1990 and 2000 would be         adversely affected, especially given the improvements in         Census 2000 edit and imputation procedures and the fact that         specific country of birth was not assigned in the 1990 census         procedures.             Comparison of Edit and Imputation Procedures for     Hispanic Origin                 Summary of Differences                        Table A summarizes the key differences between the edit and             imputation procedures for the Hispanic origin question in             1990 and 2000.  First, while multiple responses were not             allowed in either census, Census 2000 allowed for the data             capture of more than one response and the edit and             imputation procedures assigned one origin.  In the case of             multiple non-Hispanic or multiple Hispanic responses, a             respondent remained non-Hispanic or Hispanic, respectively.             However, in the case of a conflicting Hispanic/non-Hispanic             response, an attempt was made to resolve this conflict by             using other information provided by the respondent (for             example, an Hispanic response in the race question),             responses of other people in the household, or people living             near by who are of the same race.                       Census 2000 edit and imputation procedures also differed             from the 1990 procedures in how origin could be assigned             from other people in the household.  In 1990, anyone in the             household could donate an origin regardless of their race.             By contrast, Census 2000 rules only allowed other household             members to ""donate"" an origin if the person needing an             origin and the donor had the same race.                       One of the most important differences between the two             procedures was how ""hot deck"" allocation was implemented. 4              In 1990, hot deck values were stored and assigned by the             race of the ""donor"" and ""donee.""  In Census 2000, the hot             decks also were controlled by the race of the donor.             However, Census 2000 hot decks also were controlled by four             broad age groups.                       More importantly, Census 2000 origin hot decks were further             differentiated by whether the donor (and donee) had a             Spanish or non-Spanish surname.  Use of surname in storing             and assigning an origin was one of the most important             innovations implemented in Census 2000 in that it allowed a             much more precise method for assigning an origin from a hot             deck.  This innovation was cited in a recent evaluation of             having a ""profound"" impact on the assignment of origin. 5                        Finally, if both race and Hispanic origin were not reported,             the edit attempted to assign both a race  and  an origin from             another donor (both within household imputation and hot deck             allocation).  The 1990 procedures assigned race and origin             independently of each other, thus increasing the possibility             of creating race/origin combinations that were not that             common in the population.                     Context for Comparing Edit and Imputation Procedures                        Before assessing the impact of these differences on the             Hispanic origin population, it is important to understand             the differing contexts within which each edit operated.  One             of the hallmarks of the Hispanic origin question in 1990 was             the relatively high level of nonresponse.  Table 1 compares             the allocation rates 6  for Census 2000 and the 1990 census.             It is clear from this table that the allocation rate for             this question was almost twice as high in 1990 as it was in             2000 (10.4 percent versus 5.6 percent).  What is striking is             that the range of allocation rates by region narrowed             considerably from 1990 to 2000.  In 1990, the rates ranged             from 7.2 percent in the West to 11.8 percent in the             Northeast - a difference of 4.6 percentage points.  Among             states and the District of Columbia, the range was even             wider with Idaho having the lowest percent (4.2 percent) and             the District of Columbia having the highest (18.3 percent) -             a difference of 14.1 percentage points.  In Census             2000, by contrast, the range by region was much narrower,             with the Midwest having the lowest rate (4.7 percent) and             the South having the highest rate (6.0 percent) - a             difference of only 1.3 percentage points.  By state,             Minnesota had the lowest rate in Census 2000 (4.0 percent),             while the District of Columbia had the highest rate (11.0             percent) - a difference of 7.0 percentage points.  It is             clear that the biggest improvement in these rates occurred             for states that had high allocation rates in 1990.  This             dramatic improvement in response can be attributed in large             part to the placement of the Hispanic question before the             question on race in Census 2000.                       Tables 2-7 show the impact of the higher level of             nonresponse to the origin question in the 1990 census. 7              Table 2 shows that at the national level, hot deck             allocation was the largest source of origin response after             ""reported origin.""  This means that for a significant             proportion of the population (8.5 percent), no one in the             household answered the Hispanic origin question.  This             relationship held for all states.                       Table 3 shows that for the 1990 Hispanic population alone,             there was about equal reliance on ""within household"" and             ""hot deck"" allocation, with some regions and states having a             higher proportion of within-household allocation.  This is             not surprising since the question is primarily oriented to             the Hispanic population.  Table 4, by contrast, shows that             for non-Hispanics, the proportion of responses coming from             hot deck allocation was much higher than that from within             household allocation.   Tables 5-7 show the distribution of             allocated responses by source of allocation and support the             same conclusions but from a slightly different perspective.                       One of the most important changes made to the Hispanic             origin question in Census 2000 to address the problem of             nonresponse was to shift the order of the Hispanic origin             and race questions.  In the 1990 census, the race question             appeared first and the Hispanic origin question appeared             several questions later.  It seems clear that after             answering the question on race, many people felt that the             Hispanic origin question did not apply and simply skipped             the question.  Shifting the order of the questions in tests             conducted before Census 2000 seemed to improve overall             response to the Hispanic origin question with some increased             nonresponse to the question on race.                       Table 1 and Tables 8-13 show very clearly that not only the             level of nonresponse was reduced but also that the relative             contribution of within household and hot deck allocation was             much more balanced for non-Hispanics in Census 2000 than in             the 1990 census.   More importantly, allocation from              surname-assisted hot decks overall was greater than allocation from             non-surname-assisted hot decks (Tables 8-10).  Table 10, in             particular, shows that for non-Hispanics, allocation from             surname-assisted hot decks was about three times the level             of allocation from non-surname assisted hot decks (2.0             percent compared to 0.6 percent).                       The impact of surname-assisted programs is clearly more             dramatic when observing the source of allocations in Tables             11-13.  Overall, surname-assisted hot decks represented 31.4             percent of all allocations, while non-surname assisted hot             decks accounted for only 9.6 percent of all allocations.             For Hispanic allocations, surname-assisted hot decks overall             represented 8.1 percent of all allocations while non-surname             assisted hot decks represented about 4.0 percent.  For              non-Hispanics, surname assisted hot decks provided 36.9 percent             of all allocations, while non-surname assisted hot decks             provided only 10.9 percent of all allocations (Table 13).             In some states where the proportion of Hispanics is very low             (such as Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina,             South Carolina, and West Virginia), the proportion of people             receiving an origin from a surname-assisted hot deck is five             times the proportion receiving an origin from a non-surname             assisted hot deck.                       It is clear from Tables 2-13 that there was a significant             increase in Census 2000 in the level of substitution, from             0.7 percent of the population in households in 1990 to 1.2             percent of the total population in Census 2000 (Tables 2 and             8).  Substitution occurs when there are no data for anyone             in the housing unit, and we use data from a neighboring             household of similar size, using the hot deck method, to             allocate characteristics for the people in that housing             unit.  Given that the same basic method was used in both             censuses, there is no reason to believe that the procedure             itself created any upward or downward bias in assigning             origin in 1990 and 2000.                       Tables 9 and 10 show that the percent substituted is             slightly higher for the Hispanic population (1.6 percent)             than for the non-Hispanic population (1.2 percent).  There             was a similar pattern in 1990, however, but at a lower             level.  Tables 3 and 4 show that in 1990 the percent             substituted for the Hispanic population (0.9 percent) was             again slightly higher than that for the non-Hispanic             population (0.6 percent). In addition, it is also clear that             substitution played a much larger role in the source of             allocation of origin in 2000, with substitution constituting             about 20 percent of allocations overall.  Interestingly, as             shown in Tables 12 and 13, the share of substitution was             higher for the non-Hispanic population  (21.1 percent) than             for the Hispanic population (17.5 percent).  By contrast,             Tables 6 and 7 show that in1990 the share of substitution in             total allocations was much higher for Hispanics (11.0             percent) than for non-Hispanics (5.9 percent).  The reasons             for the increase in substitution will be part of the Census             Bureau's evaluation of Census 2000.                       Finally, to put all these results in a broader perspective             by including the results from the Census 2000 Supplemental             Survey (C2SS), Tables 14-16 show that the trend toward             improved response to the origin question is continuing.             Editing procedures were basically the same for Census 2000             and the C2SS, except that there was no substitution in the             C2SS. Table 14, in particular, shows that allocation rates             are lower for the total population and for the Hispanic and             non-Hispanic populations in the C2SS than in Census 2000 and             in 1990.  Table 15 shows an even greater reliance on surname             assisted hot decks in the C2SS, with Table 16 showing a much             greater reliance on surname assisted hot decks for the non-             Hispanic population than for the Hispanic population.   It             should be noted, however, that the level of response in C2SS             was improved through the use of field follow-up procedures             for people who did not fully answer the questions on the             questionnaire, a procedure that was not used in Census 2000.                     Impact of Editing on Hispanic Origin Population in 1990                        In the 1990 census, there was an unusually high level of             dependence on hot deck allocation because many of the people             needing an imputed origin had no reported origin for anyone             in the household.  This greater reliance on hot deck             allocation, combined with a relatively high level of             nonresponse, meant that most allocations came from the hot             deck, especially for the non-Hispanic population.  For             example, 75.6 percent of non-Hispanic allocations came from             a hot deck, excluding substitutions.  By contrast, only 29.9             percent of Hispanic allocations came from a hot deck (Tables             5 and 6), again excluding substitutions.  This reflects the             fact that the 1990 census hot decks matched donors and             donees by their race, but did not match by age and by             whether the donee had a Spanish or non-Spanish surname as             did Census 2000 origin hot decks.                       Concerns about the impact of 1990 edit and imputation             procedures emerged when the results of the sample data             processing, including a separate edit and imputation for             sample questionnaires, became available.  The Hispanic             origin question on the sample form was edited in sample             processing independent of the 100-percent edit and             imputation program. Although the basic structure of the two             procedures were the same, the edit and imputation procedures             for the Hispanic origin question during sample processing             differed in a very important way from those used in              100-percent processing. Unlike the 100-percent procedures,             sample procedures made use of the rich source of ethnic-related             questions from the sample form (ancestry, place of             birth, language spoken at home) that could assist in             imputing for nonresponse. The use of ethnic-related             information, combined with a higher response rate for the             Hispanic origin question on the sample form, meant a much             lower dependence on hot deck allocation.                       The estimate of the Hispanic origin population that resulted             from sample processing was about 454,000 below the total of             Hispanics obtained from 100-percent processing with the              100-percent total exceeding the sample estimate for most states.             This difference existed despite the fact that sample             estimates were controlled to 100-percent totals, including             race and Hispanic origin. 8                        Thompson (1991) addressed this difference and the difference             between 100-percent totals and sample estimates for the             American Indian population.  He noted that the difference             for the Hispanic population could be attributed to three             factors: 1) weighting procedures; 2) a form of allocation             bias; and 3) sample processing.  Thompson attributed the             difference between 100-percent totals and sample estimates             primarily to undersampling of Hispanics and to a form of             allocation bias.  He also attributed part of the difference             to different data processing procedures.9 His analysis,             however, did not quantify how much each factor contributed             to this difference.                       The ""allocation bias"" to which Thompson's analysis refers is             directly related to the focus of this analysis.  Thompson             noted that the nonresponse for the Hispanic question on the             short form was 10 percent while the nonresponse rate for the             same question on the sample form was only 4 percent.  This             difference was due partly to the fact that during data             collection all sample forms were subject to content edit             follow-up (field follow-up of cases where the number of             non-reported items exceeded a certain threshold).  By             contrast, only 10 percent of short forms were subject to             content edit follow-up.                       Thompson reasoned that Hispanics were more likely to answer             the Hispanic origin question than were non-Hispanics, making             the donor pool more heavily Hispanic than it would have been             had both Hispanics and non-Hispanics reported.  If the             nonresponse rate for the Hispanic question was high, there             was an increased risk that an Hispanic origin would be             disproportionately assigned.  Evidence of this comes from             Del Pinal (1994) who noted that the 1990 edit and imputation             procedures tended to increase the overlap between various             racial groups and the Hispanic population.  For example,             although there were very few Black Mexican origin persons,             about 62 percent of Black Mexicans were created by the edit             and imputation procedures. 10  Not surprisingly, the Black             population had a much higher nonresponse rate (18.4 percent)             in the Hispanic origin question than did the White             population (9.6 percent). (See Table 17.) The corresponding             nonresponse rates for American Indians and Alaska Natives             and Asians and Pacific Islanders were 10.2 percent and 9.7             percent, respectively.  All these rates were still much             higher than the nonresponse rates for other 100-percent             questions such as race, age, gender and household             relationship - all of which had nonresponse rates below 3             percent - and increased the possibility of a misallocation             of respondents as Hispanic.  To give a sense of the             potential impact on the data, a net misallocation of only             0.1 percent of nonresponses as Hispanic out of a total of             24 million needing an origin would result in a net increase             of 240,000 Hispanics.                       To attempt to quantify at some minimal level the impact of             the potential misallocation of responses as Hispanic, we             obtained records from the sample edited detailed file (SEDF)             for 1990.  On these records, we had not only the origin             value from sample processing (along with its allocation flag             to indicate whether the value was reported or imputed) but             also the origin value from 100-percent processing along with             its corresponding allocation flag.  In particular, we were             interested in determining how people who received an             allocated origin in the 100-percent edit had their origin             allocated in the sample edit.  For the purposes of this             analysis, the results of the sample edit are considered the             standard for accuracy because sample editing procedures made             use of data from additional ethnic-related questions             (ancestry, place of birth, and language spoken at home) not             available on the short form.                       Table 18 shows that, overall, the 100-percent edit produced             a net of about 181,000 more Hispanics than did the sample             edit when origin was allocated both in 100-percent and             sample editing procedures.  This net difference in edit             outcomes represented only 2.1  percent of the 8.6 million             people for whom origin was allocated in both 100-percent             and sample processing.                       If we take into consideration also the situations in which             we imputed a value in the 100-percent procedures but did             not impute a value in the sample procedures, the 100-percent             edit produced a net overall of about 161,000 more Hispanics             than did the sample procedures. 11   Assuming that             the sample edit and imputation process is more             accurate, the 100-percent edit appears to have imputed as             Hispanic a net total of 161,000 people who were probably not             Hispanic. However, this number represents only 1.8 percent             of all people whose origin was imputed.  It is also             important to keep in mind that both edit procedures agreed             on the edit outcome 96 percent of the time.                       It is clear from this table that the impact of this             potential misallocation is different by race. The apparent             degree of over-editing of Hispanics (as measured by taking             the ratio of  ""Hispanic-100%; Not Hispanic - Sample"" to ""Not             Hispanic - 100%; Hispanic - Sample"") appeared to be much             greater for Blacks (10.0) and Asian and Pacific Islanders             (13.1) than for Whites (4.4).  Analysis of the unweighted             data shows the same pattern, but slightly lower ratios for             each group.   This finding is consistent with Del Pinal's             finding that certain race/Hispanic combinations were more             significantly affected by the editing procedures.                       It is important to keep in mind that the estimate of 161,000             is probably a lower bound because these data were obtained             from sample forms that had a lower nonresponse rate and had             much more ethnic-related information than did short form             questionnaires.  It is possible that the level of             misallocation would be higher among the population that             received only the short form, which experienced a higher             nonresponse rate for origin than did the sample form.             However, it is unlikely that the upper bound would be as high             as the difference between the 100-percent and sample totals             (454,000) because: 1) sample processing changed about 262,000             responses from ""Other Spanish/Hispanic"" to not Hispanic 12  and             2) to an unknown degree there was undersampling of Hispanics             for which the sample weighting procedures did not compensate.                       It is also very important to keep in mind that the impact on             the overall total Hispanic population was very small.             Overall, this net difference (161,000) represented only             0.7 percent of the total Hispanic population.                     Impact of Edit and Imputation Procedures on Hispanic             Origin Population in Census 2000                        There are no comparable data available at this time from             Census 2000 to perform the same type of analysis that was             conducted on the 1990 census edit and imputation procedures.             However, it is very clear that the Census 2000 procedures             operated in an environment that was profoundly different             from that in which the 1990 procedures operated.             Significantly reduced nonresponse to the question, combined             with more restrictions on the conditions under which origin             could be assigned to an individual,             probably has led to much lower level of erroneous             imputations as Hispanic (or non-Hispanic). 13   At the same             time, innovations, such as the surname-assisted hot deck,             has improved the accuracy and, therefore, the quality of             data from the Hispanic origin question.                       Conclusion          From the information provided above we have come to the         following conclusions:                    There is no evidence based on a comparison of edit and             imputation procedures from Census 2000 and the 1990 census             for the place of birth question to conclude that differences             in the procedures would have explained differences in the             overall total of the foreign born population in 2000 and in             1990.  There were some changes in the edit and imputation             procedures between the two censuses, but none of these would             have had any significant impact on the overall total of the             foreign born.          There were some significant differences in the edit and             imputation procedures between the two censuses for the Hispanic             origin question. The most important of these was the use of             surname-assisted hot decks in Census 2000.  These hot decks             allowed for much greater precision in assigning an origin             from neighboring housing units when no one in the household             answered the question.  Furthermore, there was a dramatic             improvement in response to the Hispanic question in Census             2000, thus reducing the need (relative to 1990) for             providing a response through edit and imputation procedures.             In fact, there is evidence from 1990 that the combination of             higher nonresponse, greater use of hot deck procedures, and             lack of the benefit of surname-assisted hot deck procedures             (surname capture was not done in 1990 for all census forms)             led to some over-editing of people as Hispanic.                       We will continue our analysis of the quality of Census 2000             origin data as sample data and data from other evaluation             studies become available.               1   In this report, ""edit"" refers to revising or imputing     a response based on information provided by the respondent himself     or herself.  ""Imputation,"" also used interchangeably with the     term ""allocation,"" refers to imputing a response based on the     response of other people in the same household or the response of     people in neighboring households.       2  This issue is one of the topics being analyzed by Task     Team 5.       3  This percent is based on a file containing the results     of automated coding (excluding any manual coding) of place of birth     responses and using modified editing and weighting procedures to     obtain a preliminary estimate of the native and foreign born     populations.  Official sample data will be available in Spring 2002.       4   ""Hot deck"" allocation involves the assignment of values     from a set of stored values that are constantly updated as each     person's data record is processed.  A hot deck is usually the     procedure of last resort when a value cannot be assigned either from     information provided by the person or from other people in the     household.   In the case of race and origin , hot deck imputation     is used most often when there no one in the household has provided     a response to a particular question.       5   Summary provided by Yves Thibbaudeau, Statistical     Research Division, March 31, 1999 concerning evaluation of editing     of origin in the 1998 Census Dress Rehearsal.       6   Allocation rates represent the rate at which responses     were imputed based on responses of others within the household or     from people living nearby (also called ""hot deck"" imputation).       7  The universe for these tables is the population in     housing units and excludes the population in group quarters.       8   Although efforts are made to control the weighting by     race and Hispanic origin in each weighting area, there is no guarantee     that these weighting control totals can be maintained in each area     because each control total in the weighting matrix had to meet a     certain minimum threshold.  Those totals not meeting the threshold     were merged with other totals according to a pre-determined     collapsing sequence.       9   In 1990 processing for the Hispanic origin question,     only optical marks, but no write-in responses were captured.  Thus,     people who provided a write-in response but did not fill the ""Other     Hispanic"" circle were treated as a nonresponse in the 100-percent     edit and could have been assigned either as Hispanic or not Hispanic.     People who provided a write-in response and marked the ""Other     Spanish/Hispanic"" circle would have been identified as ""Other     Spanish/Hispanic"" in the 100-percent edit and then either as     Hispanic or not Hispanic in the sample edit depending on whether     the write-in response was Hispanic or not Hispanic in sample coding     operations.       10   The percentages and rates in this paragraph were     derived from special 1990 files containing only household records     and excludes records from the group quarters population (such as     college dorms, prisons, military bases, and nursing homes).       11   This was possible because we only captured optical     marks in the 100-percent data processing and a person could have     written in a response without marking any circles.  Although the     write-in entry could have been either an Hispanic or a non-Hispanic     entry, most of the time the entry was Hispanic.       12  Based on the fact that the respondent provided a     non-Hispanic response in the write-in space.       13  Another example of this is how we handled situations     in which a respondent indicated that he or she was Hispanic and     non-Hispanic.  This situation occurred about 700,000 times     nationally. Instead of simply assuming that all such people     should be Hispanic, we looked at information provided by the     respondent (such as the reporting of an Hispanic origin in race),     information provided by others in the household, and ultimately     by the hot deck, to adjudicate these situations.  As it turned     out, about half of the people were assigned as Hispanic and half     were assigned as not Hispanic.

HOT TIP  The Census Bureau has just released the first results from Census 2000 -- the apportionment population -- and the resulting apportionment of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, thus fulfilling the major Constitutional purpose of the census (Article 1, Section 2). The apportionment population for each state includes the resident population plus the overseas population assigned to that state. The overseas population includes Armed Forces stationed abroad and federal civilian employees stationed outside the country, along with their dependents living with members of both groups. The District of Columbia is not included in the  apportionment population since the District does not have a voting representative in Congress. The Census Bureau also has released separate tabulations of the resident population and the overseas population for each state. When the Census Bureau releases more detailed numbers for redistricting in March, states will use the resident population alone in determining Congressional and state legislative districts during the redrawing of these districts that follows every census.

New County/State Population Projections Series Released  New county and state population projections for each year from 2002 through 2030 were released in early June of 2002 by the State Demographer. These projections are based on detailed data from the 1990 and 2000 federal Censuses. Values were created for each of 96 age groups (single years from 0-94 and a 95 and older composite group), by male and female, by ""White"" and ""Other"". The separation of 2000 Census values for all races into values for ""White"" and values for ""Other"" races was based on an  estimate of ""White""  from the 2000 Census which matched the ""White"" used in the 1990 Census MARS file. Growth and density tables, growth maps,  density maps ,  methodology ,  trend analysis , and a large number of age, race, sex specific data files are available in the County/State Projections section of the State Demographics Unit Website.

HOT TIP  Which kind of map should I get to work with Census 2000 data, specifically with the PL94-171 data?  The answer to this question depends on how you intend to use the maps. At present, the Census Bureau is issuing three types of maps for use with the redistricting (Public Law 94-171) data due out in March, the first major release of small-area data from the census. These data provide population counts and race and Hispanic breakdowns for small areas like census tracts and blocks as well as for larger areas such as cities and counties.  The three map types are as follows: the PL 94-171 county block maps, the PL94-171 voting district/state legislative district (VTD/SLD) outline maps, and the census tract outline maps.  The BLOCK maps display the boundaries of  areas for which PL 94-171 data are compiled, ranging from census blocks (the smallest) to larger areas such as census tracts, incorporated places, and minor civil divisions.  These maps also show voting districts in most states. They do not show state legislative districts.  These county-based map sets are typically made up of many map sheets. For example, we estimate that the county maps for Delaware, a small state with three counties, will run to about 140 36X33-inch map sheets. The estimate for Texas (the state with the largest package of block maps) exceeds 7,000 map sheets.  The other two types of maps show less detail on a smaller number of sheets. The VTD/SLD maps focus on the boundaries of voting districts and are also the only map type which shows boundaries of state legislative districts. This is the first time we have shown state legislative districts on census maps. VTD/SLD maps are available on a county basis for the states which supplied voting district and/or state legislative district information to the Census Bureau.  The CENSUS TRACT outline maps are being made available with the PL 94-171 maps because of their great value to most users of Census 2000 data.  These maps are invaluable to planners, marketers, mortgagees, and other users. They show census tract boundaries and identify features (such as streets and rivers) that coincide with those boundaries. They may prove useful if you're using the PL94-171 data for purposes other than redistricting or if you're using any of the subsequent Census 2000 data files.  Which map type should you choose? That depends on what type of work you're doing and what level of data you're working with.  If you are doing redistricting with census block level data, you need the PL 94-171 county block maps. If your redistricting work requires less detailed geographic information or you need to see current state legislative districts, use the VTD/SLD outline map.  If you won't be working with the PL94-171 data and plan to use the more complete data sets which will be released later in the year in our Summary Files (SF) series, you may want to wait and obtain the separate edition of block maps, the Census 2000 block maps, which will accompany the SF data.  That edition will be available not just as county sets, but also for American Indian and Alaska Native Areas, incorporated places, census designated places, and minor civil divisions.  Census 2000 maps will come in several forms: paper and in PDF format on the Internet, CD-ROM, and DVD. We'll talk more about media in our next issue.   BOOKMARK THIS!  State Data Centers.  Don't overlook the many services of the nation's state data centers (SDCs), especially if you need help navigating the large data files from the Census Bureau. In each state, a lead data center coordinates services among a number of affiliate organizations. SDCs receive data from the Census Bureau and other sources and make the data (often in customized form) available at or below cost to the public. These centers are also very knowledgeable about other local data sources. A great source of technical assistance and training. You can get a list with links to SDC home pages by clicking here < http://www.census.gov/sdc/www/ >.

The Census Bureau will select the vendor to produce    the software.         The expected data users include transportation planners from metropolitan planning    organizations (MPOs) and State Departments of Transportation. This group has    varying degrees of experience with CTPP data - from novices to expert CTPP users.    However, even the most experienced user will benefit from an easy way to take    a quick look at the data.         Other data users are likely to be the media, community groups, universities    and market analysts. The data should be accessible. The goal, therefore, is    to have software that provides an easy way to access the data, without sophisticated    database or geographic information system (GIS) expertise.        The CTPP software will perform three main functions: Finding a CTPP table; browsing  or examining the data; and saving, printing or exporting the data to other formats.         To find a table, options will be provided to select geography, the data set    and tables.         To browse or examine CTPP data with the software, users will be able to look    at the data from a specific table and a specific geographic area on the screen    without having to export the data into another software package. Options will    also be provided to aggregate categories and summarize the data.         The software also will allow the data to be exported to such formats as ASCII,    GIS, transportation planning packages, spreadsheets and databases.         The CTPP 2000 data access software also will be able to make and print simple    maps without a separate GIS or mapping software.         The process for building the data-access software for CTPP 2000 represents    a significant change from the 1990 software.         For CTPP 2000, the data access software is being built in conjunction with    the data, as the CTPP is prepared. The CTPP 1990 software, TransVu, was commissioned    by BTS after the CTPP was completed.                 Attention: State DOTs         Opportunity to obtain CTPP 2000 data for your statewide geography          For CTPP 2000, a number of State DOTs have requested data at a more detailed    geographic level than was available in the 1990 CTPP Statewide Element. For    1990, data were provided for places (incorporated places and Census Designated    Places) with a population of 2,500 or more, but there was no detailed geography    like TAZ available in the Statewide Element, only in the Urban Element.         Because of an interest for more detailed geography in some states, the TAZ    delineation process was opened up to state DOTs for 2000. A number of states    participated in the program and defined TAZs for some or all of the counties    in their state. These state-defined TAZs are contained in TIGER, just like the    MPO-defined TAZs. In fact, they are indistinguishable from the MPO TAZs. However,    there is only one TAZ field reserved in TIGER, so for any county there could    only be one set of TAZs defined in TIGER. This limit, of one set of TAZ definitions    per county, meant that state DOTs could not define TAZs in counties where an    MPO was defining them.         To address this limitation, we told the state DOTs that they would have another    opportunity to delineate another small-area geographic unit in counties where    MPOs defined TAZs. It is now time to begin thinking about this issue. The new    units can be made from existing geography, using equivalency files, and will    not be inserted into TIGER. They will only be used to present CTPP 2000 data.         The CTPP Working Group (WG) is now conceptualizing this part of the CTPP 2000    program. Pending approval by the Census Bureau's Disclosure Review Board (DRB),    the Bureau intends to provide data for a detailed geographic summary level for    state DOTs and MPOs. The process as envisioned would work in the following way:         For each county in their state (even those where MPOs did not define TAZs),    the state DOT would select one type of detailed geography to be used in the    CTPP standard tabulations. The choices would be:                    Use the TAZs as defined in TIGER for the county. These TAZs may have been      delineated by the state DOT, or an MPO. For many counties there are no TAZs      defined in TIGER.            Use census tracts as the detailed geography for the county.             Create a new set of detailed geographic units for the county by combining      census tracts  OR  by combining the TAZs already contained in TIGER.      These new units have not been named, but they may be called something like      ""Combined Zones."" (Suggestions for other names?)                  The process of having state DOTs create the equivalency files for these Combined    Zones needs to begin in October 2001. During the last week of September 2001,    guidelines and instructions for the process will be mailed to the CTPP contact    person in each state DOT.                 Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) Definition Process          State Data Centers from 49 States and the District of Columbia have volunteered    to participate in the PUMA definition process. We hope that many MPOs and State    DOTs will work with their SDC to ensure that transportation needs are considered    in PUMA definition. The deadline to provide PUMA geographic equivalency files    to the Census Bureau is August 31, 2001.          The Census Bureau guidelines require that PUMAs should be defined using either    census place boundaries or census tract boundaries. A note discussing the transportation    planning implications of using place or tract boundaries is posted at:  http://www.mcs.com/~berwyned/census/articles/puma050801.pdf             Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) from Census 2000 will likely be used in    many transportation applications. The April 2001 issue of the CTPP Status Report    ( http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ctpp/status.htm ) lists previous    applications of PUMS.         For more information on the PUMA definition process, please visit  http://www.mcs.com/~berwyned/census/articles/pumaguidelines.pdf                 Urbanized Area Criteria          MPOs and TMAs are designated based on urbanized area population (50,000 threshold    for MPOs and 200,000 threshold for TMAs). The Census Bureau issued a Federal    Register notice in March 2001 recommending a new process for defining urbanized    areas and urban clusters.          The Census Bureau expects to issue a second Federal Register notice with corrections    by July 27, 2001, with a new 30 day comment period The Census Bureau is planning    to define and release urbanized area boundaries in Spring 2002.

How to Convert Block Level Data from Summary File 1 to your TAZs         By Nanda Srinivasan, Cambridge Systematics Inc.          On June 13, 2001, the Census Bureau (CB) started release of Summary File 1    (SF1) data. The CB is scheduled to release SF1 data for 35 states by July 25    and complete release for all states by September 2001.         SF1 contains 100-percent data using questions common to both the short and    the long forms. Most of the SF1 data is reported at the census block level.    Since the Transportation Analysis Zones defined in TIGER/Line 2000 are aggregations    of Census Blocks, transportation planning agencies can assemble SF1 data for    their TAZs. A process for converting block level data from SF1 into a GIS and    aggregating the data to your TAZs is posted at:  http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/census/sf1.htm         SF1 contains both population items and housing items. Population items include    age, race, sex, Hispanic or Latino origin, household relationship and group    quarters. Housing items include occupancy status, tenure (owner occupied or    renter occupied), and vacancy status.         In SF1, there are 171 population tables (identified with a ""P"") and    56 housing tables (identified with an ""H"") available at the geographic    detail of census blocks. In addition, there are 59 population tables with detailed    race and ethnic origin available at the geographic detail of census tracts (identified    with a ""PCT"").         You can obtain SF1 data in three ways:         1. Census Bureau FTP site:          http://www2.census.gov/census_2000/datasets/Summary_File_1/         The FTP (File Transfer Protocol) application is intended for experienced users    of census data, and spreadsheet/database software. Due to the size of the files,    the FTP user should have a fast ftp capability (for example: DSL, ISDN or T1    connection). Data are arranged in the FTP site by state. The file structure    consists of a header file and 39 data files.         To read the downloaded SF1 data into SAS or SPSS, the CB state data centers    have developed some coding. The code can be accessed from the SDC clearing house    website at:  http://www.sdcbidc.iupui.edu/Profiles/profiles.html         A process to transfer SF1 data to an Oracle platform was developed by Darryl    Scott, South Western Regional Planning Agency. You can access his procedure    and code at:  http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/census/oracle.htm         2. American FactFinder (AFF)   http://factfinder.census.gov         Using American FactFinder, individual tables can be downloaded in a text delimited    or comma delimited format.          3.

Status of American Community Survey (ACS)         By Elaine Murakami, Federal Highway Administration          The Committee on Government Reform, Subcommittee on the Census conducted a    hearing, ""Oversight of the Census Bureau's Proposed American Community    Survey"" on June 13, 2001.         The hearing was chaired by Rep. Dan Miller (R-FL). William Barron, the Acting    Director of the Census Bureau (CB) was the first witness. Congressional concerns    included cost, the number of questions, mandatory vs. voluntary completion,    weighting, and missing units. Testimony from data users raised issues on the    quality of small area data, weighting using state/county estimates program,    and recommending a research program using 1999-2001 data.          For a complete account of the hearing, please visit the Congressional website    at:  http://www.house.gov/danmiller/census/hearing/hearing1.html#6.13.01hearing         For our notes on the hearing, please visit  http://www.mcs.com/~berwyned/census/notes/acshearing061301.html         The July 6 ""News Alert"" issue of the Census 2000 Initiative's newsletter    also contains a summary of the hearing. You can access this report at:  http://www.census2000.org/news/01/july6.html .         This summer, the Census Bureau will release a national comparison file; which    is a sample of 700,000 addresses, surveyed over 12 months, compared to decennial    census April 1, 2000. The first results will be limited to state data. Tables    for counties and cities with a population of 250,000 or over are expected to    be available by the end of 2001. The records are weighted to Census 2000 counts    (PL-94-171). The ACS home page is  www.census.gov/CMS/www/ .         The USDOT is working to establish two small research projects through the Census    Bureau's Research Data Center (RDC) Program. CB RDC program was established    through the Census Bureau's Center for Economic Studies. The RDC provides an    opportunity for researchers to use non-publicly available Census Bureau data    files, however, they do not have a history of working with demographic survey    data.          Through the RDC program, we are hoping to conduct research using the 1999 and    2000 ACS comparison site data for at least 2 counties. There are many limitations    to the research. First, there are only 31 county comparison sites for ACS, and    second, there are only six RDCs. The number of possible intersections of a place    having ACS test data, and having a nearby RDC is small. Since the research MUST    be conducted on-site at the CB RDC, the USDOT is trying to set up two projects,    San Francisco City/County with Metropolitan Transportation Commission, and Hampden    County, Massachusetts, with University of Massachusetts.                 Use of 1990 CTPP and NCHRP 365 Report to Build a Travel Demand Model for Las  Cruces, New Mexico         By Kenneth Wall, New Mexico State University          The objective of my thesis research at New Mexico State University was to build    a travel demand model for Las Cruces, New Mexico; a small metropolitan area    45 miles northwest of El Paso, Texas with a population of 85,000. Two basic    components of developing the travel demand forecasting model were locating and    calculating socioeconomic data and travel parameters. This report describes    how socioeconomic data found in the 1990 CTPP and travel parameters found in    the National Cooperative Highway Research Program's ""Travel Estimation    Techniques for Urban Planning"" (NCHRP 365) were applied, along with other    data, to successfully develop a local travel demand model.         The 1990 CTPP, on CD-ROM, was easy to install and easy to use. A patch was    required to run CTPP in Windows NT. Following the installation of the program,    I selected the appropriate datasets from the program menus.         One of the first steps was to identify the TAZs to include. Because this was    a regional study, it was only necessary to include freeways and arterials in    the highway network. The CTPP database included a map of the Las Cruces urban    area. This map showed the geographic location of all CTPP TAZs in the Las Cruces    urban area relative to the highways and arterials in the urban area. In the    model, the TAZs were delineated by the highway network, therefore, the CTPP    TAZs were regrouped into larger geographic units to develop the 47 TAZs used    in the travel demand model. For example CTPP TAZs 87, 88, 89, 90, and 91 were    aggregated to form TAZ 7 in the travel demand model.         The travel demand forecasting software required that several socioeconomic    attributes be entered for each TAZ. Attributes included the mean income, the    number of households, and the number of retail and non-retail employees. The    number of households in a CTPP TAZ was found in Table U104 ""Households    by TAZ"" and the mean income of each CTPP TAZ was found in Table U116 ""Mean    HH Income by Number of Workers in HH."" It was a simple exercise to sum    the number of households in each group of CTPP TAZs to find the number of households    in the corresponding model TAZ. For example CTPP TAZ 87 had 218 households,    88 had 259, 89 had 441, 90 had 280, and 91 had 401 for a total of 1599 households    in TAZ 7. Likewise, the mean income of each group of CTPP TAZs was calculated    and used for the mean income of the corresponding model TAZ. The number of retail    and non-retail employees in CTPP TAZ was found in a socioeconomic study that    had been completed for the Las Cruces Metropolitan Planning Organization (LCMPO)    in 1995. The LCMPO study used the 1990 CTPP TAZ system to organize its data;    therefore, it was easily incorporated with the 1990 CTPP database.         The next step was to select the travel parameters and techniques that would    be used to model travel demand in the urban area. NCHRP 365 contains tables    of transferable parameters and many analytical techniques that can be used to    model travel demand when more accurate local data is unavailable. The travel    demand forecasting software that was used to develop the model included files    of transferable parameters, such as production and attraction rates, taken directly    from NCHRP 365. Most parameters, such as the ones mentioned above, were automatically    set; however, others parameters, such as auto-occupancy rates, Bureau of Public    Roads (BPR) curve parameters, and constants used in the calculation of friction    factors with the negative exponential function, were calculated using techniques    found in NCHRP 365. For example, in small urban areas, NCHRP 365 recommends    that the v/c multiplier and the v/c coefficient in the BPR function are set    to 0.84 and 5.5. NCHRP 365 techniques were also used to estimate external travel    and special generator travel.                  Once the network was developed and checked for errors, the software was run    for the first time. The model was calibrated by comparing the model's output    with standard values for small urban areas in the U.S. that are found in the    U.S. DOT's ""Calibrating and Adjustment of System Planning Models""    (CASPM). CASPM also provides Techniques for adjusting the model in order to    calibrate it. The model was run and adjusted a dozen times before the calibration    process was complete.          The travel demand model met three key criteria presented by the U.S. DOT in    CASPM. The first step was to determine whether or not the total number of person    trips produced per household was reasonable. The total number of person trips    produced per household by the model was estimated to be 10.9. The standard number    of trip productions for a small urban area is 9.1 trips per household. While    the estimated number of trips produced per household was higher than the national    average, the difference may be due to unique demographic characteristics of    Las Cruces. The second step was to check that the daily vehicle miles traveled    (VMT) was reasonable. For a small urban area, the national average is between    1,001,010 and 1,334,680 VMT. The estimated VMT calculated by the model was 1,216,750.    Finally, traffic volumes were sampled along six screenlines in the urban area.    The percent deviation of assigned traffic flows from maximum desirable errors    averaged 9.0 percent.         While the travel demand modeling process was complex, in the end, few resources    were used. A calibrated model was developed that used available socioeconomic    and highway network data, transferable parameters and techniques, a commercial    travel demand modeling software, and a standard computer spreadsheet. The calibrated    model would later serve as a research tool for measuring the impact of land    use on travel demand.

TRB Subcommittee:  Message from the Chair:          Odds and Ends           Now that its summer and most of the Census 2000 data has not yet been delivered,    one would think that we could sit back and take it easy--NOT. Sometimes it almost    feels like the more that we do, the less gets done.         On the TRB front, the subcommittee has two activities underway. We are developing    a half-day workshop to be held in conjunction with 81st Annual TRB Meetings    in January. The workshop will be Sunday, January 13, 2002 and will focus on    the American Community Survey - the replacement for the census long form. Although    the content of the workshop is still being developed, it promises to be a worthwhile    experience for those can make it. We will of course have more details available    as the Workshop comes together.         Another activity, WHERE WE NEED YOUR HELP is in the development of a Poster    Session to be held during the TRB Meetings this January. Our interest is in    developing a poster session around the innovative and creative ways, in which    census related data is being presented, displayed or delivered. For more information    on the Poster Session Call for Papers/Presentations refer to  http://www.mcs.com/~berwyned/census/notes/postercall2002.html         On a slightly different front, the Subcommittee secretary, Ed Limoges from    the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments has taken on a side job. Ed will    be assisting the Census Bureau's Journey-to-Work and Migration Branch (those    responsible for the tabulation of the CTPP) with the development of algorithms    for improving the allocation of the work locations that cannot be geocoded.    We anxiously await Ed's work. For more information please contact Ed at  limoges@semcog.org .         Other issues that we are watching include the developments in and around the    ACS, the creation of PUMAs, the Urban Area Criteria for developing boundaries    as well the continued development of the CTPP data package, outreach materials    and extraction software. To stay on top of these issues and many more, make    sure to be subscribed to the ""CTPP-News"" listserve. To subscribe e-mail    me at  berwyned@mcs.com .         While thinking about my E-mail address and the Subcommittee's website there    is good news and bad news. The bad news is that later this summer, my E-mail    address and the subcommittee website will change locations (location to be determined).    The good news is that the US Department of Transportation has allowed the CTPP    to have a home on it's server.

The table finding guide lists the geographic areas and the subjects shown in this report. To determine which tables in this report show data for a particular topic, find the subject in the column headings at the top of the table finding guide and then look down the left-hand column for the desired type of geographic area. Below is an example of a table finding guide.  INTRODUCTION Data from the 1990 census are presented in several different report series. These series are published under the following three subject titles: 1. 1990 Census of Population (1990 CP) 2. 1990 Census of Housing (1990 CH) 3. 1990 Census of Population and Housing (1990 CPH) The types of data and the geographic areas shown in reports differ from one series to another. In most series, there is one report for each State, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands of the United States (Virgin Islands), plus a United States summary report. Some series include reports for American Indian and Alaska Native areas, metropolitan areas, and urbanized areas. See appendix F for detailed information about the various report series; additional 1990 census data products such as computer tapes, microfiche, and laser disks; other related materials; and sources of assistance. The data from the 1990 census were derived from a limited number of basic questions asked of the entire population and about every housing unit (referred to as the 100-percent questions), and from additional questions asked of a sample of the population and housing units (referred to as the sample questions). Two primary versions of questionnaires were used: a short form containing only the 100-percent questions and a long form containing both the 100-percent questions and the additional sample questions. Appendix E presents facsimiles of the questionnaire pages and the respondent instructions used to collect the data included in this report. Appendix F lists the subjects that are covered by the 100-percent and sample components of the 1990 census. Legal provision for this census, which was conducted as of April 1, 1990, was made in the Act of Congress of August 31, 1954 (amended August 1957, December 1975, and October 1976), which is codified in Title 13, United States Code.

Each table includes four major parts: (1) heading, (2) boxhead, (3) stub, and (4) data field. A typical census report table is illustrated below.  The stub is located at the left edge of the table. It includes a listing of line or row captions or descriptions. At the top of the stub is the stubhead. The stubhead is considered to be an extension of the table title and usually shows generic geographic area designations and restrictions. In the stub, several features are used to help the user better understand the contents of the table. Usually, a block of data lines is preceded by a sidehead. The sidehead, similar to a spanner, describes and classifies the stub entries following it. The use of indentation in a stub indicates the relationship of one data line to another. Indented data lines represent subcategories that in most instances, sum to a total. Occasionally in tables, it is desirable to show one or more single-line subcategories that do not sum to the total. The unit of measure, such as dollars, is shown when it is not clear from the general wording of the data line. The data field is that part of the table that contains the data. It extends from the bottom of the boxhead to the bottom of the table and from the right of the stub to the right-hand edge of the page. Both geographic and subject-matter terms appear in tables. It is important to read the definitions of the terms used in the tables because census terms often are defined in special ways that reflect the manner in which the questions were asked and the data were tabulated. Definitions of geographic terms are provided in appendix A. Subject-matter terms are defined in appendix B.  Symbols and Geographic Abbreviations The following symbols are used in the tables and explanations of subjects covered in this report:  A dash ` ` ' ' represents zero or a figure or percent that rounds to less than 0.1.  Three dots ` ` ...' ' mean not applicable.  (NA) means not available. The heading consists of the table number, title, and headnote. The table number indicates the position of the table within the report, while the title is a brief statement indicating the classification, nature, and time reference of the data presented in the table. The headnote is enclosed in brackets and is located under the title. It contains statements that qualify, explain, or provide information pertaining to the entire table. The boxhead is under the heading. This portion of the table, which contains the individual column heads or captions, describes the data in each vertical column. In the boxhead of many tables, a spanner appears across and above two or more column heads or across two or more lower spanners. The purpose of a spanner is to classify or qualify items below it or separate the table into identifiable blocks in terms of major aspects of the data. I2  The prefix ` ` r' ' indicates that the count has been revised since publication of 1980 reports or that the area was erroneously omitted or not shown in the correct geographic relationship in the 1980 census reports. This symbol appears only in the 1990 CPH-2, Population and Housing Unit Counts reports.  A dagger ` ` ' ' next to the name of a geographic area indicates that there has been a geographic change(s) (for example, an annexation or detachment, a new incorporation, or a name change) since the information published for the 1980 census for that area. This symbol appears only in the 1990 CPH-2, Population and Housing Unit Counts reports. The geographic change information for the entities in a State is shown in the ` ` User Notes' ' section of the 1990 CPH-2, Population and HOW TO USE THIS CENSUS REPORT   JOBNAME: No Job Name PAGE: 3 SESS: 50 OUTPUT: Tue Nov 17 09:48:18 1992 / node2/ F main F / 90dec/ cph2/ usst/ how  Housing Unit Counts report, for that State. The information for all States appears in the ` ` User Notes' ' section of the technical documentation for Summary Tape Files 1 and 3.  A plus sign ``+ '' or a minus sign ``'' following a figure denotes that the median falls in the initial or terminal category of an open-ended distribution. (For more information on medians, see the discussion under ` ` Derived Measures' ' in appendix B.)  A minus sign ` ` ' ' preceding a figure denotes decrease. The following geographic abbreviations are used in the tables and explanations of subjects covered in this report:  A ` ` (pt.)' ' next to the name of a geographic area in a hierarchical presentation indicates that the geographic entity is only partially located in the superior geographic entity. For example, a ` ` (pt.)' ' next to a place name in a county subdivision-place hierarchy indicates that the place is located in more than one county subdivision. (Places also may be ` ` split' ' by county, congressional district, urban/ rural, metropolitan area, voting district, and other geographic boundaries, depending on the presentation.) Other geographic entities also can be``split'' by a higher-level entity. The exception is a tabulation block, which is unique within all geographic entities in census products.  BG is block group.  BNA is block numbering area.  CDP is census designated place.  CMSA is consolidated metropolitan statistical area.  MA is metropolitan area.  MSA is metropolitan statistical area.  PMSA is primary metropolitan statistical area.  TDSA is tribal designated statistical area.  TJSA is tribal jurisdiction statistical area.  unorg. is unorganized territory.  VTD is voting district. Census tables often include derived measures such as medians, means, percents, and ratios. More detailed information about derived measures is provided in appendix B.  USER NOTES User notes include corrections, errata, and related explanatory information. This section appears directly before the statistical tables in census reports unless graphics are shown. It presents information about unique characteristics of the report and changes or corrections made too late to be reflected in the text or tables themselves.  CONTENTS OF THE APPENDI X ES Appendix A--Provides definitions of the types of geographic areas and related information used in census reports. Appendix B--Contains definitions for the subject-matter items used in census reports, including explanations of derived measures, limitations of the data, and comparability with previous censuses. The subjects are listed alphabetically. In reports that contain both population and housing characteristics, the population characteristics are described first, followed by the explanations of the housing subjects. Appendix C--Provides information on confidentiality of the data, allocations and substitutions, and sources of errors in the data. Appendix D--Explains the residence rules used in counting the population and housing units, presents a brief overview of data collection operations, and describes processing procedures used to convert data from unedited questionnaires to final 1990 publications and tapes. This appendix also clarifies the procedures used to collect data for persons abroad at the time of the census, where persons on military bases or away at school were counted, how data were collected for persons in institutions, and which citizens of foreign countries were included in the U.S. data. Appendix E--Presents a facsimile of the 1990 census questionnaire pages and the respondent instructions used to collect the data in this report. Appendix F--Summarizes the 1990 census data products program by describing the information available in printed reports and in other sources, such as microfiche or computer tape; and provides information on where to obtain assistance. Appendix G--Contains maps depicting the geographic areas shown in this report.  GRAPHI CS Charts, statistical maps, and other graphic summaries are included in some 1990 census reports. If graphics are shown in a report, they are presented immediately after the ``User Notes'' section.

In 1959, Alaska was admitted to the Union as the forty-ninth State.  GEOGRAPHI C CHANGE NOTES The entities that serve as the statistical equivalents of counties in this State are the organized boroughs and ` ` census areas' ' ; the latter were developed for general statistical purposes by the State and the Bureau of the Census. The county subdivisions are statistical entities called census subareas (CSA' s). Alaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSA' s) replace the Alaska Native villages (ANV' s) reported in 1980; their boundaries, as established for statistical purposes by the Census Bureau in collaboration with the Alaska Native Regional Corporations and knowledgeable officials, delineate local tribal communities and governments. See appendix A for additional information. The year, where shown parenthetically, relates to the year the action was effective; the population and housing unit counts that follow, respectively, are as of April 1, 1980.

Alaska is divided into A1  AREA CLASSIFICATIONS   JOBNAME: No Job Name PAGE: 2 SESS: 57 OUTPUT: Wed Apr 22 13:24:37 1992 / node2/ F main F / 90dec/ all/ usst/ appa  12 ANRC' s that cover the entire State, except for the Annette Islands Reserve. The boundaries of the 12 ANRC's were established by the Department of the Interior, in cooperation with Alaska Natives. Each ANRC was designed to include, as far as practicable, Alaska Natives with a common heritage and common interests. The ANRC boundaries for the 1990 census were identified by the Bureau of Land Management. A 13th region was established for Alaska Natives who are not permanent residents and who chose not to enroll in one of the 12 ANRC' s; no census products are prepared for the 13th region. ANRC' s were first identified for the 1980 census. Each ANRC is assigned a two-digit census code ranging from 07 through 84. These census codes are assigned in alphabetical order of the ANRC' s.  Federal reservations may cross State boundaries, and Federal and State reservations may cross county, county subdivision, and place boundaries. For reservations that cross State boundaries, only the portion of the reservations in a given State are shown in the data products for that State; the entire reservations are shown in data products for the United States. Each American Indian reservation is assigned a fourdigit census code ranging from 0001 through 4989. These census codes are assigned in alphabetical order of American Indian reservations nationwide, except that joint areas appear at the end of the code range. Each American Indian reservation also is assigned a five-digit FIPS code; because the FIPS codes are assigned in alphabetical sequence of American Indian reservations within each State, the FIPS code is different in each State for reservations in more than one State. Trust Land--Trust lands are property associated with a particular American Indian reservation or tribe, held in trust by the Federal Government. Trust lands may be held in trust either for a tribe (tribal trust land) or for an individual member of a tribe (individual trust land). Trust lands recognized for the 1990 census comprise all tribal trust lands and inhabited individual trust lands located outside of a reservation boundary. As with other American Indian areas, trust lands may be located in more than one State. Only the trust lands in a given State are shown in the data products for that State; all trust lands associated with a reservation or tribe are shown in data products for the United States. The Census Bureau first reported data for tribal trust lands for the 1980 census. Trust lands are assigned a four-digit census code and a five-digit FIPS code, the same as that for the reservation with which they are associated. Trust lands not associated with a reservation are presented by tribal name, interspersed alphabetically among the reservations.  Alaska Native Village (ANV) Statistical Area Alaska Native villages (ANV' s) constitute tribes, bands, clans, groups, villages, communities, or associations in Alaska that are recognized pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1972, Public Law 92-203. Because ANV' s do not have legally designated boundaries, the Census Bureau has established Alaska Native village statistical areas (ANVSA' s) for statistical purposes. For the 1990 census, the Census Bureau cooperated with officials of the nonprofit corporation within each participating Alaska Native Regional Corporation (ANRC), as well as other knowledgeable officials, to delineate boundaries that encompass the settled area associated with each ANV. ANVSA' s are located within ANRC' s and do not cross ANRC boundaries. ANVSA' s for the 1990 census replace the ANV' s that the Census Bureau recognized for the 1980 census. Each ANVSA is assigned a four-digit census code ranging from 6001 through 8989. Each ANVSA also is assigned a five-digit FIPS code. Both the census and FIPS codes are assigned in alphabetical order of ANVSA' s.  American I ndian Reservation and Trust Land American I ndian Reservation--Federal American Indian reservations are areas with boundaries established by treaty, statute, and/ or executive or court order, and recognized by the Federal Government as territory in which American Indian tribes have jurisdiction. State reservations are lands held in trust by State governments for the use and benefit of a given tribe. The reservations and their boundaries were identified for the 1990 census by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Department of Interior (for Federal reservations), and State governments (for State reservations). The names of American Indian reservations recognized by State governments, but not by the Federal Government, are followed by ` ` (State).' ' Areas composed of reservation lands that are administered jointly and/ or are claimed by two reservations, as identified by the BIA, are called ` ` joint areas,' ' and are treated as separate American Indian reservations for census purposes. A2  Tribal Designated Statistical Area (TDSA) Tribal designated statistical areas (TDSA' s) are areas, delineated outside Oklahoma by federally- and Staterecognized tribes without a land base or associated trust lands, to provide statistical areas for which the Census Bureau tabulates data. TDSA' s represent areas generally containing the American Indian population over which federally-recognized tribes have jurisdiction and areas in which State tribes provide benefits and services to their members. The names of TDSA' s delineated by Staterecognized tribes are followed by ` ` (State).' ' The Census Bureau did not recognize TDSA' s before the 1990 census. Each TDSA is assigned a four-digit census code ranging from 9001 through 9589. The census codes are assigned in alphabetical order of TDSA' s nationwide. Each TDSA also is assigned a five-digit FIPS code in alphabetical order within State.

TJSA' s represent areas generally containing the American Indian population over which one or more tribal governments have jurisdiction; if tribal officials delineated adjacent TJSA' s so that they include some duplicate territory, the overlap area is called a ` ` joint use area,' ' which is treated as a separate TJSA for census purposes. TJSA's replace the ``Historic Areas of Oklahoma (excluding urbanized areas)' ' shown in 1980 census data products. The Historic Areas of Oklahoma comprised the territory located within reservations that had legally established boundaries from 1900 to 1907; these reservations were dissolved during the 2- to 3-year period preceding the statehood of Oklahoma in 1907. The Historic Areas of Oklahoma (excluding urbanized areas) were identified only for the 1980 census. Each TJSA is assigned a four-digit census code ranging from 5001 through 5989. The census codes are assigned in alphabetical order of TJSA' s, except that joint areas appear at the end of the code range. Each TJSA also is assigned a five-digit FIPS code in alphabetical order within Oklahoma.  AREA MEASUREMENT Area measurements provide the size, in square kilometers (also in square miles in printed reports), recorded for each geographic entity for which the Census Bureau tabulates data in general-purpose data products (except crews-of-vessels entities and ZIP Codes). (Square kilometers may be divided by 2.59 to convert an area measurement to square miles.) Area was calculated from the specific set of boundaries recorded for the entity in the Census Bureau' s geographic data base (see ` ` TIGER' ' ). On machine-readable files, area measurements are shown to three decimal places; the decimal point is implied. In printed reports and listings, area measurements are shown to one decimal. The Census Bureau provides measurements for both land area and total water area for the 1990 census; the water figure includes inland, coastal, Great Lakes, and territorial water. (For the 1980 census, the Census Bureau provided area measurements for land and inland water.) The Census Bureau will provide measurements for the component types of water for the affected entities in a separate file. ` ` Inland water' ' consists of any lake, reservoir, pond, or similar body of water that is recorded in the Census Bureau' s geographic data base. It also includes any river, creek, canal, stream, or similar feature that is recorded in that data base as a two-dimensional feature (rather than as a single line). The portions of the oceans and related large embayments (such as the Chesapeake Bay and Puget Sound), the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea that belong to the United States and its territories are considered to be ` ` coastal' ' and ` ` territorial' ' AREA CLASSIFICATIONS  waters; the Great Lakes are treated as a separate water entity. Rivers and bays that empty into these bodies of water are treated as ` ` inland water' ' from the point beyond which they are narrower than one nautical mile across. Identification of land and inland, coastal, and territorial waters is for statistical purposes, and does not necessarily reflect legal definitions thereof. By definition, census blocks do not include water within their boundaries; therefore, the water area of a block is always zero. Land area measurements may disagree with the information displayed on census maps and in the TIGER file because, for area measurement purposes, features identified as ` ` intermittent water' ' and ` ` glacier' ' are reported as land area. For this reason, it may not be possible to derive the land area for an entity by summing the land area of its component census blocks. In addition, the water area measurement reported for some geographic entities includes water that is not included in any lower-level geographic entity. Therefore, because water is contained only in a higher-level geographic entity, summing the water measurements for all the component lower-level geographic entities will not yield the water area of that higher-level entity. This occurs, for example, where water is associated with a county but is not within the legal boundary of any minor civil division, or the water is associated with a State but is not within the legal boundary of any county. Crews-of-vessels entities (see ` ` Census Tract and Block Numbering Area' ' and ` ` Block' ' ) do not encompass territory and therefore have no area measurements. ZIP Codes do not have specific boundaries, and therefore, also do not have area measurements. The accuracy of any area measurement figure is limited by the inaccuracy inherent in (1) the location and shape of the various boundary features in the data base, and (2) rounding affecting the last digit in all operations that compute and/ or sum the area measurements.  BLOCK Census blocks are small areas bounded on all sides by visible features such as streets, roads, streams, and railroad tracks, and by invisible boundaries such as city, town, township, and county limits, property lines, and short, imaginary extensions of streets and roads. Tabulation blocks, used in census data products, are in most cases the same as collection blocks, used in the census enumeration. In some cases, collection blocks have been ` ` split' ' into two or more parts required for data tabulations. Tabulation blocks do not cross the boundaries of counties, county subdivisions, places, census tracts or block numbering areas, American Indian and Alaska Native areas, congressional districts, voting districts, urban or rural areas, or urbanized areas. The 1990 census is the first for which the entire United States and its possessions are block-numbered. Blocks are numbered uniquely within each census tract or BNA. A block is identified by a three-digit number, sometimes with a single alphabetical suffix. Block numbers A3   JOBNAME: No Job Name PAGE: 4 SESS: 53 OUTPUT: Wed Apr 22 13:24:37 1992 / node2/ F main F / 90dec/ all/ usst/ appa  with suffixes generally represent collection blocks that were ` ` split' ' in order to identify separate geographic entities that divide the original block. For example, when a city limit runs through data collection block 101, the data for the portion inside the city is tabulated in block 101A and the portion outside, in block 101B. A block number with the suffix ` ` Z' ' represents a ` ` crews-of-vessels' ' entity for which the Census Bureau tabulates data, but that does not represent a true geographic area; such a block is shown on census maps associated with an anchor symbol and a census tract or block numbering area with a .99 suffix.  1. Annexations to or detachments from legally established governmental units. 2. Mergers or consolidations of two or more governmental units. 3. Establishment of new governmental units. 4. Disincorporations or disorganizations of existing governmental units. 5. Changes in treaties and Executive Orders. The historical counts shown for counties, county subdivisions, and places are not updated for such changes, and thus reflect the population and housing units in the area as delineated at each census. Information on boundary changes reported between the 1980 and 1990 censuses for counties, county subdivisions, and incorporated places is presented in the ` ` User Notes' ' section of the technical documentation of Summary Tape Files 1 and 3, and in the 1990 CPH-2, Population and Housing Unit Counts printed reports. For information on boundary changes for such areas in the decade preceding other decennial censuses, see the Number of Inhabitants reports for each census. Boundary changes are not reported for some areas, such as census designated places and block groups.  BLOCK GROUP (BG) Geographic Block Group A geographic block group (BG) is a cluster of blocks having the same first digit of their three-digit identifying numbers within a census tract or block numbering area (BNA). For example, BG 3 within a census tract or BNA includes all blocks numbered between 301 and 397. In most cases, the numbering involves substantially fewer than 97 blocks. Geographic BG' s never cross census tract or BNA boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of county subdivisions, places, American Indian and Alaska Native areas, urbanized areas, voting districts, and congressional districts. BG' s generally contain between 250 and 550 housing units, with the ideal size being 400 housing units.  CENSUS REGI ON AND CENSUS DI VI SI ON Census Division Census divisions are groupings of States that divisions of the four census regions. There divisions, which the Census Bureau adopted in the presentation of data.

BG' s are used in tabulating decennial census data nationwide in the 1990 census, in all block-numbered areas in the 1980 census, and in Tape Address Register (TAR) areas in the 1970 census. For purposes of data presentation, BG' s are a substitute for the enumeration districts (ED' s) used for reporting data in many parts of the United States for the 1970 and 1980 censuses, and in all areas for pre-1970 censuses.

For data analysis, such a BNA can be summarized with an adjacent BNA.  Census Tract Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county. Census tracts are delineated for all metropolitan areas (MA' s) and other densely populated counties by local census statistical areas committees following Census Bureau guidelines (more than 3,000 census tracts have been established in 221 counties outside MA' s). Six States (California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, New Jersey, and Rhode Island) and the District of Columbia are covered entirely by census tracts. Census tracts usually have between 2,500 and 8,000 persons and, when first delineated, are designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. Census tracts do not cross county boundaries. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over a long time so that statistical comparisons can be made from census to census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, etc., may require occasional revisions; census tracts occasionally are split due to large population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline. Census tracts are referred to as ` ` tracts' ' in all 1990 data products. Census tracts are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a two-digit suffix; for example, 6059.02. The decimal point separating the four-digit basic tract number from the two-digit suffix is shown in printed reports, in microfiche, and on census maps; in machine-readable files, the decimal point is implied. Many census tracts do not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field is left blank in all data products. Leading zeros in a census tract number (for example, 002502) are shown only on machinereadable files. Census tract numbers range from 0001 through 9499.99 and are unique within a county (numbers in the range of 9501 through 9989.99 denote a block numbering area). The suffix .99 identifies a census tract that was populated entirely by persons aboard one or more civilian or military ships. A ` ` crews-of-vessels' ' census tract appears on census maps only as an anchor symbol with its census tract number (and block numbers on maps showing block numbers). These census tracts relate to the ships associated with the onshore census tract having the same four-digit basic number. Suffixes in the range .80 through .98 usually identify census tracts that either were revised or were created during the 1990 census data collection activities. Some of these revisions may have resulted in census tracts that have extremely small land area and may have little or no population or housing. For data analysis, such a census tract can be summarized with an adjacent census tract. A5  Mountain Division: Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Nevada Pacific Division: Washington, Oregon, California, Alaska, Hawaii  Census Region Census regions are groupings of States that subdivide the United States for the presentation of data. There are four regions--Northeast, Midwest, South, and West. Each of the four census regions is divided into two or more census divisions. Prior to 1984, the Midwest region was named the North Central region. From 1910, when census regions were established, through the 1940' s, there were three regions--North, South, and West.  CENSUS TRACT AND BLOCK NUMBERI NG AREA Block Numbering Area (BNA) Block numbering areas (BNA' s) are small statistical subdivisions of a county for grouping and numbering blocks in nonmetropolitan counties where local census statistical areas committees have not established census tracts. State agencies and the Census Bureau delineated BNA' s for the 1990 census, using guidelines similar to those for the delineation of census tracts. BNA' s do not cross county boundaries. BNA' s are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a two-digit suffix; for example, 9901.07. The decimal point separating the four-digit basic BNA number from the two-digit suffix is shown in printed reports, in microfiche, and on census maps; in machine-readable files, the decimal point is implied. Many BNA' s do not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field is left blank in all data products. BNA numbers range from 9501 through 9989.99, and are unique within a county (numbers in the range of 0001 through 9499.99 denote a census tract). The suffix .99 identifies a BNA that was populated entirely by persons aboard one or more civilian or military ships. A ` ` crews-ofvessels' ' BNA appears on census maps only as an anchor symbol with its BNA number (and block numbers on maps showing block numbers); the BNA relates to the ships associated with the onshore BNA' s having the same four-digit basic number. Suffixes in the range .80 through .98 usually identify BNA' s that either were revised or were created during the 1990 census data collection activities.

After the apportionment of congressional seats among the States, based on census population counts, each State is responsible for establishing CD' s for the purpose of electing representatives. Each CD is to be as equal in population to all other CD' s in the State as practicable, based on the decennial census counts. The CD' s that were in effect on January 1, 1990 were those of the 101st Congress. Data on the 101st Congress appear in an early 1990 census data product (Summary Tape File 1A"

Usual residence is the place where the person lives and sleeps most of the time. This place is not necessarily the same as the person's legal residence or voting residence. In the vast majority of cases, however, the use of these different bases of classification would produce substantially the same statistics, although there might be appreciable differences for a few areas. The implementation of this practice has resulted in the establishment of rules for certain categories of people whose usual place of residence is not immediately apparent. Furthermore, this practice means that people were not always counted as residents of the place where they happened to be staying on Census Day (April 1, 2000). United States Enumeration rules. Each person whose usual residence was in the United States was to be included in the census, without regard to the person's legal status or citizenship. As in previous censuses, people specifically excluded from the census were citizens of foreign countries temporarily traveling or visiting in the United States who had not established a residence. Americans temporarily overseas were to be enumerated at their usual residence in the United States. With some exceptions, Americans with a usual residence outside the United States were not enumerated in Census 2000. U.S. military personnel and federal civilian employees stationed outside the United States and their dependents living with them, are included in the population counts for the 50 states for purposes of Congressional apportionment but are excluded from all other tabulations for states and their subdivisions. The counts of overseas U.S. military personnel,   federal civilian employees, and their dependents were obtained from administrative records maintained by the employing federal departments and agencies. Other Americans living overseas who were not affiliated with the U.S. government were not included in the census. Residence rules. Each person included in the census was to be counted at his or her usual residence the place where he or she lives and sleeps most of the time. If a person had no usual residence, the person was to be counted where he or she was staying on Census Day. People temporarily away from their usual residence on Census Day, such as on a vacation or business trip, were to be counted at their usual residence. Armed forces personnel in the United States. Members of the U.S. Armed Forces were counted at their usual residence (the place where they lived and slept most of the time), whether it was on or off the military installation. Family members of armed forces personnel were counted at their usual residence (for example, with the armed forces person or at another location). Personnel assigned to each Navy and Coast Guard vessel with a U.S. homeport were given the opportunity to report an onshore residence where they usually stayed when they were off the ship. Those who reported an onshore residence were counted there; those who did not were counted at their vessel's homeport. Personnel on U.S. flag merchant vessels. Crews of U.S. flag merchant vessels docked in a U.S. port, sailing from one U.S. port to another U.S. port, or sailing from a U.S. port to a Puerto Rico port were counted at their usual onshore residence if they reported one. Those who did not were counted as residents of the ship and were assigned as follows:  The U.S. port, if the vessel was docked there on Census Day.  The port of departure, if the ship was sailing from one U.S. port to another U.S. port, or from a U.S. port to a Puerto Rico port. Crews of U.S. merchant ships docked in a foreign port (including the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam), sailing from one foreign port to another foreign port, sailing from a U.S. port to a foreign port, or sailing from a foreign port to a U.S. port were not included in the census. People away at school. College students were counted as residents of the area in which they were living while attending college, as they have been since the 1950 census. Children in boarding schools below the college level were counted at their parental home. People in institutions. People under formally authorized, supervised care or custody, such as in federal or state prisons; local jails; federal detention centers; juvenile institutions; nursing or convalescent homes for the aged or dependent; or homes, schools, hospitals, or wards for the physically handicapped, mentally retarded, or mentally ill; or in drug/alcohol recovery facilities were counted at these places. People in general hospitals. People in general hospitals or wards (including Veterans Affairs hospitals) on Census Day were counted at their usual residence. Newborn babies were counted at the residence where they would be living. People in shelters. People staying on Census Day at emergency or transitional shelters with sleeping facilities for people without housing, such as for abused women or runaway or neglected youth, were counted at the shelter. People with multiple residences. People who lived at more than one residence during the week, month, or year were counted at the place where they lived most of the time. For example, commuter workers living away part of the week while working were counted at the residence where they stayed most of the week. Likewise, people who lived in one state but spent the winter in another state with a warmer climate (``snowbirds'') were to be counted at the residence where they lived most of the year.   People away from their usual residence on Census Day. Temporary, migrant, or seasonal workers who did not report a usual U.S. residence elsewhere were counted as residents of the place where they were on Census Day. In some areas, natural disasters (hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, and so forth) displaced households from their usual place of residence. If these people reported a destroyed or damaged residence as their usual residence, they were counted at that location. People away from their usual residence were counted by means of interviews with other members of their families, resident managers, or neighbors.   MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THE CENSUS 2000 PLAN The Census Bureau prepared the Census 2000 plan to ensure the most accurate decennial census legally possible. This plan included data collection from 100 percent of households and housing units. In addition, the plan included an extensive statistical operation to measure and correct overall and differential coverage of U.S. residents in Census 2000. This operation consisted of a scientific sample of approximately 300,000 housing units and used regional groupings to generate corrected counts. To ensure that Census 2000 will be both more accurate and more cost-effective than the 1990 Census, the Census Bureau reviewed its procedures with input from a wide array of experts. In addition, the Census Bureau and Department of Commerce officials held more than 100 briefings for the members of Congress and their staff on the plan for Census 2000. The result has been an innovative departure from past practices that substantially increased overall accuracy and addressed the differential undercount of children, renters, and minorities. At the same time, the new methods of enumeration saved money and delivered results more quickly. The major components of the plan for Census 2000 included: 1. The Master Address File To conduct Census 2000, the Census Bureau needed to identify and locate an estimated 118 million housing units in the Nation. The Census Bureau accomplished this goal by developing and maintaining the Master Address File (MAF). This vital operation took place with the assistance of the U.S. Postal Service (USPS); other federal agencies; tribal, state and local governments; community organizations; and by an intensive canvass of selected areas. The resulting file was more comprehensive than ever before. In 1990, the Census Bureau relied on address lists purchased from vendors. As these lists were originally generated for marketing purposes, they proved to be less accurate in low-income areas. As a result, during the 1990 census, housing units were missed often enough to contribute notably to the undercount problem. Plans for Census 2000 were designed to address weaknesses found in the 1990 address list. The Census 2000 MAF started with the USPS address list, a list that does not discriminate against certain areas because of their marketing potential. Partnerships with state and local officials, community organizations, and tribal governments also played an important role in making sure the MAF is accurate; the local officials who knew the areas best helped develop the MAF. Finally, the Bureau made intensive efforts to create address lists in rural areas well in advance of the census.   City-style addresses. The USPS uses the term ``city-style'' for an address such as ``123 Main Street,'' even though such an address may occur in small towns and increasingly along country roads. In areas where the USPS delivers mail primarily to city-style addresses, the Census Bureau created the MAF by combining addresses from the 1990 Census Address Control File with those addresses in the USPS Delivery Sequence File (DSF). The DSF is a national file of individual delivery point addresses. As part of a cooperative agreement, the USPS provided the Census Bureau with updated DSFs on a regular basis. The Bureau then located these addresses in its computer mapping system called TIGER (Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing). If an address could not be located, the location was researched and resolved through an office operation or through assistance from local partners. As a result of this research, the Bureau identified new features and corrected and added address ranges to the TIGER database. Noncity-style addresses. In late 1998 and early 1999, the Census Bureau launched a comprehensive effort to canvass areas where most residences did not have city-style addresses. Over 30,000 canvassers visited approximately 22 million residences without a street address to enter their locations in the TIGER system. The combination of innovative use of computer data and technology along with these visits allowed the Bureau to construct the most accurate address list ever, giving field enumerators more time to meet other challenges presented by the 2000 count. Remote areas. In a few extremely remote and sparsely settled areas, census enumerators created the address list at the time of the initial census data collection while canvassing their assignment area and picking up or completing unaddressed questionnaires that the USPS previously had delivered to each household. Nontraditional living quarters. A separate operation built an inventory of all facilities that were not traditional living quarters; for example, prisons and hospitals. The Bureau interviewed an official at each location using a Facility Questionnaire. The responses to the questionnaire identified each group quarters and any housing units associated with the location. The Bureau classified each group quarters and its associated housing units at the location according to whether they would be enumerated as part of special place enumeration or through regular enumeration. The Bureau added these group quarters and housing units to the MAF and linked them to the TIGER database. Local government partnerships. The Bureau relied on local knowledge to build the MAF. State, local, and tribal governments; regional and metropolitan planning agencies; and related nongovernmental organizations were encouraged to submit locally developed and maintained city-style address lists to the Census Bureau to enhance the MAF. The Bureau matched the local lists both to the MAF and TIGER database and verified the status of each newly identified address through ongoing matches to updated address information from the USPS, other independent sources, and its own field operations. The Local Update of Census Addresses (LUCA) program was a partnership that allowed local and tribal governments to designate a liaison to review the portion of the MAF that covered their jurisdiction to help ensure its completeness. After processing the LUCA input, the Census Bureau provided feedback on the status of the adds, deletes, and corrections of addresses to the liaisons. The updated address list then was used to deliver census questionnaires. 2. Public Outreach and Marketing In 1990, the mail response rate dropped in spite of the Census Bureau's support of a public service announcement (PSA) effort that aired donated advertisements. Part of this drop was caused by the Bureau's inability to ensure that PSAs were broadcast at optimum times and in appropriate markets. An evaluation of the 1990 PSA campaign noted that the ads were seldom placed at optimal times because decisions about when to air PSAs rested with local radio and television stations. Sixty percent of the U.S. population received 91 percent of the census advertising impact; 40 percent received only 9 percent. Based on its studies of prior outreach campaigns, the Bureau concluded that the professional control of a paid media campaign would produce the best results. Census 2000 launched a vigorous public outreach campaign to educate everyone about the importance of being counted. Among the improvements in public outreach and marketing were:   Partnerships/targeted community outreach. The Census Bureau built partnerships with local and tribal governments, businesses, and community groups to get the word out, to endorse the census, and to encourage constituents to respond. Beginning in 1996 and expanding in 1998, the Bureau hired government and community specialists to build relationships with local community and service-based organizations, focusing on groups representing traditionally undercounted populations. The Bureau deployed an extensive outreach program to reach schools, public sector employees, American Indians, and religious organizations. Businesses, nonprofit groups, and labor organizations also were asked to endorse participation and to publicize the census through employee newsletters, inserts with paychecks, and through communications with members and local chapters. Direct mail. The census questionnaire and related materials delivered to individual addresses carried the same themes and messages as the overall campaign. Public relations. The Census Bureau used public meetings and the news media to inform the public about the value of the census and to encourage response. Communications specialists were assigned to each field office to perform media outreach, to respond to media inquiries, and to coordinate the dissemination of the Census 2000 message. In many communities, the Census Bureau established local broadcaster/news director committees to emphasize Census 2000 to television viewers and radio listeners through broadcast segments and editorials in newspapers. Paid advertising. The Census Bureau planned a targeted campaign to reach everyone through ads in newspapers, magazines, billboards, posters, radio, and television. A private advertising firm designed and implemented the Census 2000 advertising campaign. The Census Bureau conducted a first-ever paid advertising campaign, including a national media campaign aimed at increasing mail response. The campaign included advertising directed at raising mail response rates among historically undercounted populations, with special messages targeted to hard-to-enumerate populations. Advertising also focused on encouraging cooperation during the nonresponse follow-up procedures. Media public relations. The Census Bureau assigned media specialists to the regional census centers to cultivate local press contacts and respond to local media inquiries. Promotion and special events. A variety of special events, including parades, athletic events and public services television documentaries were cosponsored by state, local, and tribal governments and by community organizations and businesses to motivate people to respond. More ways to respond. In 2000, in addition to mailing the census questionnaires, the Census Bureau made the forms available in stores and malls, in civic or community centers, in schools, and in other locations frequented by the public. A well-publicized, toll-free telephone number was available for those who wished to respond to the census by telephone. People also had the option to respond to the short form via the Internet. Multiple languages. In 2000, as in all prior decennial censuses, questionnaires were in English (the Census Bureau has made Spanish-language questionnaires available in the past). However, for the first time in a decennial census, households had the option to request and receive questionnaires in five other languages (Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Tagalog, and Vietnamese). In addition, questionnaire assistance booklets were available in 49 languages. 3. Questionnaire Mailout/Mailback In Census 2000, the questionnaire mailout/mailback system was the primary means of census-taking, as it has been since 1970. The short form was delivered to approximately 83 percent of all housing units. The short form asked only the basic population and housing questions, while the long form included additional questions on the characteristics of each person and of the housing unit. The long form was delivered to a sample of approximately 17 percent of all housing units. USPS letter carriers delivered questionnaires to the vast majority of housing units that had city-style addresses. In areas without such addresses, enumerators hand delivered addressed census questionnaires to each housing unit. In very remote or sparsely populated areas, enumerators visited each housing unit and picked up or completed unaddressed questionnaires that the USPS previously delivered to each unit.   4. Collecting Data on Populations Living in Nontraditional Households During a decennial census, the Census Bureau not only counts people living in houses and apartments, but also must count people who live in group quarters and other nontraditional housing units, as well as people with no usual residence. These units include nursing homes, group homes, college dormitories, migrant and seasonal farm worker camps, military barracks or installations, American Indian reservations, and remote areas in Alaska. Some of the methods that were used for these special populations are listed below:  The Census Bureau designed an operation for Census 2000 called Service-Based Enumeration (SBE) to improve the count of individuals who might not be included through standard enumeration methods. The SBE operation was conducted in selected service locations, such as shelters and soup kitchens, and at targeted outdoor locations.  Another special operation counted highly transient individuals living at recreational vehicle campgrounds and parks, commercial or public campgrounds, marinas, and even workers' quarters at fairs and carnivals.  The Census Bureau worked with tribal officials to select the appropriate data collection methodologies for American Indian reservations.  Remote areas of Alaska, often accessible only by small airplanes, snowmobiles, four wheel-drive vehicles, or dogsleds, were enumerated beginning in mid-February. This special timing permitted travel to these areas while conditions are most favorable.  The Census Bureau worked with the Department of Defense and the U.S. Coast Guard to count individuals living on military installations, and with the U.S. Maritime Administration to identify maritime vessels for enumeration. 5. Collecting Long Form Data to Meet Federal Requirements The census is the only data gathering effort that collects the same information from enough people to get comparable data for every geographic area in the United States. The Census Bureau has used the long form on a sample basis since 1940 to collect more data, while reducing overall respondent burden. The Census 2000 long form asked questions addressing the same 7 subjects that appeared on the short form, plus an additional 27 subjects which were either specifically required by law to be included in the census or were required in order to implement other federal programs. 6. Retrieving and Processing the Data From the Returned Forms The Census Bureau contracted with the private sector to secure the best available data capture technology. This technology allowed the Census Bureau to control, manage, and process Census 2000 data more efficiently. The Census 2000 Data Capture System has been a complex network of operational controls and processing routines. The Census Bureau recorded a full electronic image of many of the questionnaires, sorted mail-return questionnaires automatically, used optical mark recognition for all check-box items, and used optical character recognition to capture write-in character based data items. The system allowed the Census Bureau to reduce the logistical burdens associated with handling large volumes of paper questionnaires. Once forms were checked in, prepared, and scanned, all subsequent operations were accomplished using the electronic image and data capture. 7. Matching and Unduplication One of the main goals of Census 2000 was to make it simpler for people to be counted by having census forms available in public locations and providing multiple language translations. Responses also were accepted over the telephone and, for the short form only, on the Internet. These options made it easier for everyone to be counted, but increased the possibility of multiple responses for a given person and household. Advances in computer technology in the areas of computer storage, retrieval, and matching, along with image capture and recognition, gave the Census Bureau the flexibility to provide multiple response options without incurring undue risk to   the accuracy of the resulting census data. Unduplication of multiple responses in past censuses required massive clerical operations. Modern technology allowed the Census Bureau to spot and eliminate multiple responses from the same household. 8. Geographic Database Development--TIGER The Census Bureau's TIGER (Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing) system provided the geographic structure for the control of the data collection, tabulation, and dissemination operations for Census 2000. The TIGER system links each living quarter to a spatial location, each location to a specific geographic area, and each geographic area to the correct name or number and attributes. The database constantly changes; for example, when new streets are built and the names and address ranges of existing streets change. To ensure that the TIGER database is complete and correct, the Census Bureau works with other federal agencies; state, local and tribal governments; and other public and private groups to update both its inventory of geographic features and its depiction of the boundaries, names, and attributes of the various geographic entities for which the Census Bureau tabulates data. The Census Bureau obtains updates to the features in the TIGER system, including associated address ranges, from its various address list improvement activities, from partnership efforts like the Local Update of Census Addresses (LUCA) program, from digital files provided by some local and tribal governments, and from local and tribal governments in response to a preview of the census map of their jurisdictions. As a part of updating the TIGER system, the Census Bureau conducted boundary surveys in 1998 and 1999 to determine the boundaries that were in effect on January 1, 2000, which were the official Census 2000 boundaries for functioning governments. The Census Bureau also relied on other programs to update the TIGER boundaries data, including a program that allowed local or tribal officials to review proposed Census 2000 boundaries a program that allowed local and tribal participants the opportunity to delineate Census 2000 participant statistical areas (block groups, census county divisions, census designated places, and census tracts) and additional programs that offered participants the opportunity to identify other areas for which the Census Bureau would tabulate data (for example, traffic analysis zones). 9. Field Offices and Staffing The Census Bureau opened a national network of temporary offices from which employees collected and processed the data for Census 2000. Establishing the office network required, for most offices, the leasing of office space, purchasing furniture and equipment, purchasing and installing computer hardware and software, and establishing voice and data line connections. The plan for the office structure included:  12 Regional Census Centers (RCCs). Through a network of Census Field Offices, the RCCs managed all census field data collections operations, address listings, and address list enhancement for city-style address areas; coordinated the LUCA program; produced maps; updated TIGER; worked with local participants in the Public Law 94-171 Redistricting Data Program; and recruited temporary staff.  402 Census Field Offices (CFOs). Opened in September 1998, these offices helped with address listing; conducted local recruiting; and performed clerical review of completed field address listing work.  520 Local Census Offices (LCOs). These offices produced enumerator maps and assignments; conducted local recruiting; conducted outreach and promotion; conducted group quarters and service-based enumeration activities; conducted update/leave and list/enumerate operations; conducted nonresponse follow-up, coverage improvement follow-up, and address verifications; and performed the block canvass operations.  3 New Data Capture Centers (DCCs). These centers checked in mail returns, prepared questionnaires, and conducted data capture.  1 National Processing Center (NPC). In addition to performing the functions of a Data Processing Center, it processed address listing data and performed coding of questionnaire data.   To conduct a successful Census 2000, the Census Bureau recruited and tested hundreds of thousands of applicants for a wide range of positions, such as local census office managers, enumerators, partnership specialists, media specialists, and clerks. This required an extraordinary recruiting effort throughout the country. Every job applicant was required to pass a written test and was screened for criminal history. Applicants selected for employment had to take an oath of office and sign an affidavit agreeing not to disclose census information. Many factors converged to present the Census Bureau with unprecedented challenges in hiring, retraining, and training the necessary employees for Census 2000. To address this challenge, the Census Bureau implemented several new approaches:  Innovative methods of setting pay and incentives.  Expanding the potential labor force by working with other federal agencies and state agencies to reduce barriers presented by various income transfer programs, and encouraging recipients of these programs to work for the Census Bureau. Consistent with these efforts, the Census Bureau hired more welfare-to-work employees than any other federal agency.  Earlier and expanded training for enumerators. 10. Data Collection: Basic Enumeration Strategy To ensure that the Census Bureau obtained a completed questionnaire from every household, or as close to that as possible, the Census Bureau developed a ten-part, integrated enumeration strategy.  The first part of this strategy ensured that a questionnaire was delivered to every housing unit, by one of three data collection methods:  Mailout/mailback. U.S. Postal Service delivered questionnaires to every ``city style'' housing unit with a street name and house number.  Update/leave. Census enumerators delivered questionnaires to housing units without street names and house numbers to be mailed back, mainly in rural areas, and corrected and updated the address list and maps for any additions or errors.  List/enumerate. In remote and sparsely populated areas, enumerators visited every housing unit and completed the enumeration as delivered.  The second part of this strategy provided people with assistance, as needed, to complete and return their questionnaires.  Telephone questionnaire assistance (TQA). The Census Bureau operated a toll-free TQA system, in English, Spanish, and several other languages, providing automated touch-tone answers to common questions, personal operator answers to those requesting it, and special service for the hearing impaired to assist them in completing a short form. Callers also could request a questionnaire.  Internet. Respondents were able to access an Internet Web site to both receive assistance and, for short forms, submit their responses.  Questionnaire assistance centers. The Census Bureau opened Walk-In Questionnaire Assistance Centers in convenient locations to assist respondents with filling out questionnaires in person. Bilingual staff was available in these centers.  Questionnaire assistance guides. languages. Questionnaire Assistance Guides were available in 49   The third part of this strategy provided a means for people who believed they had not received a questionnaire or were not included on one. Part of this operation was targeted to members of historically undercounted groups. The major element of this operation was the distribution of ``Be Counted Questionnaires.'' The Census Bureau distributed these questionnaires at public locations, such as Walk-In Questionnaire Assistance Centers and some public and private facilities, staffed with bilingual competencies when appropriate. These forms were available in English, Spanish, Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Tagalog.    The fourth part of this strategy was designed to enumerate people who did not live in traditional housing units, including group quarters situations, such as nursing homes and college dormitories; people living in migrant farm worker camps, on boats, on military installations; and federal employees living overseas. This part of the strategy was expanded further because the Census 2000 Dress Rehearsal results indicated that, compared to 1990, many more people did not live in traditional housing units.  Group quarters enumeration. This operation identified the location of all group living quarters and made advance visits to each group quarter. Census staff listed all residents in April 2000 and distributed questionnaire packets.  Transient night operation. Transient Night enumerated people living a mobile lifestyle by visiting and interviewing people at racetracks, commercial or public campgrounds and those for recreational vehicles, fairs and carnivals, and marinas.  Remote Alaska enumeration. This operation sent out enumerators to deliver and complete questionnaires for people living in outlying or remote settlements in Alaska.  Domestic military/maritime enumeration. The Census Bureau, in cooperation with the Department of Defense and U.S. Coast Guard, identified living quarters and housing units on military installations and ships assigned to a U.S. home port and used appropriate enumeration methods.  Overseas enumeration. The Census Bureau, in cooperation with the Department of Defense and other departments, counted federal employees assigned overseas (including members of the armed forces) and their dependents, for apportionment purposes.  The fifth part of this strategy targeted people with no usual residence or address. This operation was conducted at selective service locations, such as shelters and soup kitchens and nonsheltered outdoor locations.  The sixth part of this strategy deployed special data collection methods to improve cooperation and enumeration in certain hard-to-enumerate areas.  Regional Census Centers used the planning database and their knowledge of local conditions to identify appropriate areas for targeted methods. A team of enumerators then went to targeted areas, such as areas with high concentrations of multiunit buildings, safety concerns or low enumerator production rates, and conducted team enumerations.  Mail response rates and maps were available to local and tribal officials so they could work with Census Bureau staff to identify low-response areas and implement additional outreach and publicity efforts and targeted enumeration efforts.  In partnership with local and tribal governments and community-based organizations, local census offices established Walk-In Questionnaire Assistance Centers in locations, such as community centers and large apartment buildings, to provide assistance in English, Spanish, and other and foreign languages.  The Be Counted Program made unaddressed questionnaires available in the Walk-In Assistance Centers and other locations.  Letters were mailed to managers of large multiunit structures and gated communities informing them of upcoming census operations.  In preidentified census blocks, census enumerators canvassed the blocks, updated the address list, and delivered and completed census questionnaires for all housing units.  In preidentified blocks originally classified as ``Mailout/Mailback'' areas, enumerators delivered the questionnaire and updated the address list (Urban Update/Leave).  The seventh part of this strategy, coverage-edit and telephone follow-up, reviewed completed questionnaires for potential missing, incomplete, or inconsistent data.    Coverage edit. The Census Bureau checked completed questionnaires for discrepancies between the number of persons reported and the number of persons for whom information was provided, forms returned where population count was blank, and forms for certain households that contained complex living arrangements.  Follow-up. Telephone clerks contacted and reinterviewed the households with discrepancies identified after mail returns were data captured; field staff resolved discrepancies found on enumerator returned questionnaires.  Content edit. Computer operations identified missing or incomplete responses to population or housing units and used statistical imputation to complete the information.  The eighth part of this strategy, nonresponse follow-up (NRFU), was the effort to secure a response in Census 2000 from every housing unit and resident. One hundred percent of nonresponding households were followed up.  In the initial period, the Census Bureau used reminder publicity urging people to return their questionnaires.  Following the period of mail response, nonresponding households were identified and listed.  Enumerators visited all nonresponding addresses to obtain a completed questionnaire for each household.  In mailout/mailback areas, enumerators also followed up 100 percent of housing units identified as nonexistent or vacant by the U.S. Postal Service.  In update/leave areas, enumerators followed up 100 percent of housing units where the Census Bureau was unable to deliver questionnaires.  The Census Bureau conducted quality assurance checks of NRFU to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the operations.  The ninth part of strategy involved additional operations to improve the coverage of Census 2000.  In mailout/mailback areas, enumerators revisited addresses for which questionnaires were returned in NRFU reporting the housing unit as vacant or delete and which were not initially identified by the U.S. Postal Service as undeliverable as addressed.  In update/leave areas, enumerators revisited addresses for which a questionnaire was returned as vacant or nonexistent in NRFU, but the questionnaire was not returned as undeliverable during the update/leave operation.  In both mailout/mailback and update/leave areas, mail returns checked in but not data captured were rechecked and, if necessary, revisited.  The tenth part of this strategy was unduplication, which involved reviewing and selecting person information when more than one questionnaire data set was reported for a single address. Dress Rehearsal results showed that the multiple ways in which people could respond to the census increased the possibility of more than one response being submitted for a given person or household. Automated matching technologies allowed the Census Bureau to resolve situations where more than one form was received for an address. 11. Special Populations American Indian and Alaska Native Areas and Hawaiian Home Lands The Census Bureau based its strategy for enumerating the populations in the American Indian and Alaska Native Areas (AIANAs) and Hawaiian home lands on building partnerships for:  Address list development. The Census Bureau used U.S. Postal Service's Delivery Sequence Files in AIANAs and Hawaiian home lands where there were city-style addresses. In other areas, the Census enumerators used the ``update/leave'' method where a form is left with the respondent for return by mail. In more remote areas, the census enumerator actually delivered the   form and conducted the census interview all in one visit. Tribal governments had an opportunity to participate in the LUCA program. The Census Bureau worked with tribal officials to select the appropriate data collection methodology for each area.  Geographic programs. There were many programs available to review and define geographic areas (see Appendix A for more details).  Marketing. Census Bureau staff and tribal liaisons compiled lists of available media for paid advertising and promotion. The Census Bureau also enlisted the help of tribal liaisons and locally established ``Complete Count Committees'' to assist with promotional activities.  Field operations. The Census Bureau worked with tribal governments to assist in all levels of field operations, including training local staff in cultural awareness, assisting in recruiting efforts, and identifying locations for census questionnaire assistance centers.  Data dissemination. While most data were processed in the same way as data for rest of the nation, the Census Bureau worked with tribal governments to meet their data needs. Puerto Rico The Census 2000 operations in Puerto Rico were comparable to activities in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The Census Bureau worked in partnership with the government of Puerto Rico to ensure that Census 2000 data met the federal legal requirements.  Build partnerships at every stage of the process. The Census Bureau entered a Memorandum of Agreement with the governor of Puerto Rico which outlined mutual roles and responsibilities. In consultation with the government of Puerto Rico, census questionnaire content was developed to meet the legislative and programmatic needs of Puerto Rico. A separate advertisement and promotion campaign was conducted in Puerto Rico to build awareness of the census and boost participation. Address list development allowed Puerto Rico to participate in the LUCA program.  Census questionnaires. Census questionnaires were readily available in Spanish and also in English, if requested. In Puerto Rico, only update/leave method was used to distribute questionnaires. However, questionnaires also were placed in Walk-In Questionnaire Assistance Centers and other locations identified through consultation with local partners.  Use of technology. The Census Bureau made use of the same technological advances that were used in the United States. Many operations performed clerically in 1990 were automated. Data users have access to Census 2000 data products through the Internet using the American FactFinder (AFF) system. The AFF offers a separate user interface utilizing the Spanish language for Census 2000 Puerto Rico data.  Special techniques to improve coverage. The update/leave methodology for census data collection was used for the first time in Puerto Rico. Census enumerators updated the Master Address File for Puerto Rico while delivering questionnaires. Respondents had the opportunity to complete the census questionnaires and return them by mail. Island Areas The Census Bureau conducted the Census 2000 operations in American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands (collectively referred to as the ``Island Areas'') in partnerships with the government of each area. These partnerships ensured that Census 2000 data met federal legal requirements, as well as the specific needs of each area. The Census 2000 operations in the Island Areas were built around the following:  Data collection. Data collection in the Island Areas used the list/enumerate method. This decision was based on recommendations from Island Area representatives and an analysis of the various data collection methodologies. Unlike stateside list/enumerate procedures, the Census Bureau delivered Advance Census Reports before the list/enumerate operation and asked respondents to complete the form and hold it for enumerator to pick up.    Build partnerships at every stage of the process. The Census Bureau developed and signed a Memorandum of Agreement with the governor of each Island Area that outlined mutual roles and responsibilities. In consultation with the governments of the Island Areas, census questionnaire content was developed to meet the legislative and programmatic needs of each Island Area. A separate advertisement and promotion campaign was developed for each Island Area to build awareness of the census and boost participation.  Census questionnaires. Census questionnaires and other forms were readily available to respondents in convenient locations identified through consultation with local partners.  Use of technology. The Census Bureau made greater use of the telephone to provide assistance to respondents with questions about Census 2000. Data users have access to Census 2000 data and products through the Internet using the American FactFinder system. 12. Telecommunications Support and Automated Data Processing Using dedicated links and other secure lines, the Census 2000 telecommunications network linked all census offices including: Census Headquarters in Suitland, Maryland, the 520 Local Census Offices, the 12 Regional Census Offices, the 12 Regional Census Centers, the Puerto Rico Area Office, the Maryland Computer Center in Bowie, the National Processing Center in Jeffersonville, Indiana, and the three contracted Data Capture Centers (Phoenix, AZ, Pomona, CA, and Essex, MD). The Census Bureau also established communication links with planned commercial telephone centers to assist with the Telephone Questionnaire Assistance program and the coverage edit follow-up program. The use of electronic imaging reduced the logistical and staffing requirements of handling large volumes of paper questionnaires. Some components of data capture were performed by private-sector partners. The Census Bureau used commercially available advanced hardware and software rather than limiting itself to creating in-house solutions. The most significant features of the Data Capture System included (1) work divided among four centers, (2) full electronic imaging and processing of questionnaires, (3) automated sorting of mailed responses, (4) optical mark recognition for check-box data, (5) optical character recognition for write-in data with automated processes to resolve difficult cases, and (6) quality assurance checks. 13. Quality Assurance To detect, correct, and minimize performance errors Bureau developed individual quality assurance plans errors in outcome, such as misprinted census forms, intelligent character recognition, inadequate training in critical census operations, the Census for all activities that could contribute to inaccurate maps or address lists, faulty of enumerators, and miskeyed entries.  14. The Census 2000 Dress Rehearsal in 1998 A good dress rehearsal is crucial to a successful census, and the key to any dress rehearsal is making it as much like the actual event as possible. The Census Bureau conducted Census 2000 Dress Rehearsal in three sites: Sacramento, California; Columbia, South Carolina along with 11 surrounding counties in north central South Carolina; and the Menominee American Indian Reservation in northeastern Wisconsin. Since the summer of 1996, the Census Bureau worked closely with local officials and community-based organizations in each of the three sites to plan and build the various infrastructures needed to ensure a successful dress rehearsal. These joint activities included refining the geographic database, building and refining the address list, and working with community and tribal organizations to plan effective outreach and promotion efforts. Also, the Census Bureau recruited staff in all three sites to complete address list development and verification. The dress rehearsal allowed for a thorough demonstration of the most critical procedures for Census 2000. These procedures included address list development; marketing and promotion; and data collection, processing, and tabulation. The dress rehearsal plan also demonstrated the use of statistical sampling in four major census operations: nonresponse follow-up, housing units designated as undeliverable as addressed by the U.S. Postal Service, integrated coverage measurement (ICM), and the long form survey.   15. Data Dissemination Through the Internet The census provides a wealth of data that researchers, businesses, and government agencies are eager to use. Taking advantage of modern computer and Internet capabilities, the Census Bureau planned to make data from Census 2000 more readily available than any previous decennial census data. The Census 2000 data are tabulated using the Data Products Production (DPP) system and disseminated using the American FactFinder (AFF) system on the Internet, in addition to CD-ROMs and DVDs. The AFF provides an interactive electronic system to allow data users to access data products, documents, and online help, as well as to build custom data products. The Census Bureau solicited the advice and recommendations of data users throughout the planning, design, and testing stages of the AFF system (initially known as the Data Access and Dissemination System (DADS)). The system is accessible to the widest possible array of users through the Internet and all available intermediaries, including the nearly 1,800 data centers and affiliates, the 1,400 Federal Depository libraries and other libraries, universities, and private organizations. It also allows users to create customized products, such as tables, charts, graphs, and maps for census geographic areas of their choice, and access metadata that provide documentation and explanatory information for data subjects and geographic areas. 16. Evaluation and Preparation for 2010 After the completion of Census 2000, the Census Bureau plans to conduct a variety of post census evaluation studies, as it has after all the previous censuses. These studies will help data users, both within and outside the Census Bureau, to assess the data and plan for the 2010 Census. The evaluation studies generally rely on demographic analysis, statistical methods, and ethnographic analyses.

Population density  Total population within a geographic entity divided by the number of square miles of land area of that entity measured in square kilometers or square miles.     Population Estimates  The Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program publishes population numbers between censuses. Estimates usually are for the past, while projections are estimates of the population for future dates.  July 1 estimates are published for years after the last decennial census (2000), as well as those for past decades.  Data for births, deaths, and domestic and international migration are used to update the decennial census base counts. These estimates are used in federal funding allocations; as inputs to other federal agencies statistics and per capita time series; as survey controls; and in monitoring recent demographic changes. With each new issue of July 1 estimates, the estimates for the years since the last census are revised.    Additional population estimates that include components of change and rankings, are available at  http://eire.census.gov/popest/estimates.php .

Barron, in his official capacity as the Acting Director of the United States Census Bureau (collectively, “Defendants”).    The present action challenges the Defendants’ decision to supplement the 2000 Census apportionment count with data derived from statistical imputation, a form of statistical sampling.    That decision deprived Utah of an additional member of Congress to which the State is entitled.    1.                    This Complaint stems from the actions of the Defendants, who are the executive officers charged with conducting the decennial census.    As such, the Defendants are constitutionally charged with performing an “actual Enumeration” of the people of the United States every ten years.    See  U.S. Const. Art. 1, § 2, cl. 3.    2.                    One of the most important functions that the Defendants perform is to determine the current “apportionment population.”    The apportionment population is the “ total resident population (citizens and non-citizens) of the 50 states.”    See  U.S. Census Bureau,  http://www.census.gov/population/www/censusdata/apportionment/faq.html .    It is on the basis of this count that seats in the United States House of Representatives are reapportioned among the fifty states.       3.                    In conducting the 2000 Census, Defendants used a statistical sampling procedure known as “imputation” to add to the apportionment population approximately 1.2 million persons nationwide who were not actually enumerated by traditional methods of enumeration.    Statistical imputation cannot be reconciled with the Census Act or the Apportionment Clause of the United States Constitution.    Plaintiffs therefore respectfully seek (1) a declaration from this Court that the Census Bureau’s decision to supplement the 2000 Census apportionment count with data derived from statistical imputation is unconstitutional under the Apportionment Clause and illegal under the Census Act; and (2) an injunction requiring Defendants to remove from the apportionment count all population data derived from statistical imputation.    THE PARTIES    4.                    The State of Utah (“Utah”) entered the Union on January 4, 1896 as the 45th state.    5.                    Michael O. Leavitt is the Governor of Utah.    6.                    Olene S. Walker is the Lieutenant Governor of Utah.    7.                    Mark L. Shurtleff is the Attorney General of Utah.    8.                    L. Alma Mansell is the President of the Utah State Senate.    9.                    Martin R. Stephens is the Speaker of the Utah State House of Representatives.    10.                Mike Dmitrich is the Utah State Senate Minority Leader.    11.                Ralph Becker is the Utah State House Minority Leader.    12.                Orrin G. Hatch is the senior United States Senator from the State of Utah.    13.                Robert F. Bennett is the junior United States Senator from the State of Utah.    14.                James V. Hansen, is a Representative from the First Congressional District of Utah.    15.                James Matheson is a Representative from the Second Congressional District of Utah.    16.                Christopher B. Cannon is a Representative from the Third Congressional District of Utah.    17.                Donald L. Evans is the Secretary of the United States Department of Commerce.    18.                William G. Barron is the Acting Director of the United States Census Bureau.    JURISDICTION AND VENUE    19.                Jurisdiction in this Court is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 2284 and Pub. L. 105-119, Title II, § 209 (“Section 209”).    Section 209 explicitly provides a cause of action for “any person aggrieved by the use of any statistical method in violation of the Constitution or provision of law . . . in connection with the 2000 or any later decennial census, to determine the population for purposes of the apportionment or redistricting of members of Congress.”      Pursuant to these statutory provisions, Plaintiffs request that a three-judge district court be convened.    20.                Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(2) & (3).    GENERAL ALLEGATIONS    21.                Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 of the United States Constitution, as modified by the Fourteenth Amendment, directs that every ten years Congress (or its designee) must conduct an “actual Enumeration” of the number of persons in each State “in such manner as [Congress] shall by Law direct.”    On the basis of the census, each state is allotted a number of Representatives in Congress proportional to its population.    22.                Pursuant to its constitutional authority to determine how the “actual Enumeration” of the population should be conducted, Congress enacted the Census Act, 13 U.S.C. § 1  et seq . (the “Act”).    The Act provides that the Secretary of Commerce “shall, in the year 1980 and every 10 years thereafter, take a decennial census of population as of the first day of April of such year.”    13 U.S.C. § 141(a).    It further provides that “[t]he tabulation of total population by States . . . as required for the apportionment of Representatives in Congress among the several States shall be completed within 9 months after the census date and reported by the Secretary to the President of the United States.”    Id . § 141(b).    The President must then “transmit to the Congress a statement showing the whole number of persons in each State . . . and the number of Representatives to which each State would be entitled.”    2 U.S.C. § 2a(a).    Within 15 days, the Clerk of the House of Representatives must “send to the executive of each State a certificate of the number of Representatives to which each State is entitled.”    Id . § 2a(b).    23.                The Census Act also speaks directly to the method of enumeration to be employed in the census.    It provides that “[e]xcept for the determination of population for purposes of apportionment of Representatives in Congress among the several States, the Secretary shall, if he considers it feasible, authorize the use of the statistical method known as ‘sampling’ in carrying out the provisions of this title.”    13 U.S.C. § 195.    In other words, statistical sampling is authorized where it is “feasible” for purposes other than apportionment, but the apportionment count must be conducted by traditional methods of enumeration, and not by statistical estimation.    24.                Throughout most of the history of the census, the “actual enumeration” of the population has been conducted by questions asked by census enumerators to heads of households.    Until 1964, census enumerators were required to “visit personally each dwelling house in [their] subdivision[s]” in order to obtain “every item of information and all particulars required for any census or survey” conducted in connection with the census.    Act. of Aug. 31, 1954, § 25(c), 68 Stat. 1012, 1015.    In 1964, Congress relaxed this requirement slightly in authorizing census enumerators to replace personal visits with forms delivered and returned via the Postal Service.    Act of Aug. 31, 1964, 78 Stat. 737.    25.                   Despite the authority to conduct the census through the mail, “there was no suggestion from any quarter that this change altered the prohibition in § 195 on the use of statistical sampling in determining the population for apportionment purposes.”    Department of Commerce v. United States House of Representatives , 525 U.S. 316, 337 (1999).    Rather, the Census Act continued to require an “actual enumeration” of the apportionment population by traditional methods of enumeration (personal visits or mailed questionnaires), and to permit statistical sampling only for non-apportionment purposes.    Id .    In fact, the Census Bureau itself long adhered to the view that the Census Act “clearly” continued the “historical precedent of using the ‘actual Enumeration’ for purposes of apportionment, while eschewing estimates based on sampling or other statistical procedures, no matter how sophisticated.”    45 Fed. Reg. 69366, 69372 (1980).    The Census Bureau’s Statistical Sampling Proposal for the 2000 Census    26.                In or about 1997, however, the Census Bureau abandoned this position and formulated a plan to make extensive use of statistical sampling to supplement the data obtained through traditional census methods.    27.                One aspect of the Bureau’s sampling proposal fell under the “Nonresponse Followup program,” which was to proceed in three steps.    Under the first step, the Bureau would “send census forms to all households, as well as make forms available in post offices and in other public places.”    House of Representatives , 525 U.S. at 324.    The Bureau anticipated “that 67 percent of households [would] return the forms.”    Id .    28.                Next, under the second step, the Bureau planned “to divide the population into census tracts of approximately 4,000 people that have ‘homogeneous population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions,’” and to collect census data from a random sample of the households that did not respond to the forms sent by mail by making personal visits:    The Bureau would then visit a randomly selected sample of nonresponding housing units, which would be “statistically representative of all housing units in [a] nonresponding tract.”    The rate of nonresponse follow-up in a tract would vary with the mail response rate to ensure that the Bureau obtain[ed] census data from at least 90 percent of the housing units in each census tract.    For instance, if a census tract had 1,000 housing units and 800 units responded by mail, the Bureau would survey 100 out of the 200 nonresponding units to obtain information about 90 percent of the housing units.    However, if only 400 of the 1,000 housing units responded by mail, the Bureau would visit 500 of the 600 nonresponding units to achieve the same result.         Id.         29.                Finally, under the third step, “[t]he information gathered from the nonresponding housing units surveyed by the Bureau would then be used to estimate the size and characteristics of the nonresponding housing units that the Bureau did not visit.”    Id . at 324-25.    “Thus, continuing with the first example, the Bureau would use information about the 100 nonresponding units it visits to estimate the characteristics of the remaining 100 nonresponding units on which the Bureau has no information.”    Id . at 325.    Legislative and Judicial Responses to the Bureau’s Proposal    30.                The Census Bureau’s announcement of its plan to make extensive use of statistical sampling in the 2000 census spawned both legislative and judicial responses.    In 1997, Congress passed, and President Clinton signed, a bill providing for the creation of a “comprehensive and detailed plan outlining [the Bureau’s] proposed methodologies for conducting the 2000 Decennial Census and available methods to conduct an actual enumeration of the population,” including an explanation of any statistical methodologies that may be used.    Tit. VIII, 111 Stat. 217.    31.                Pursuant to this requirement, the Secretary of Commerce issued the Census 2000 Report, detailing the above proposal for extensive use of statistical estimation.    32.                After receiving the Census 2000 Report, Congress enacted § 209, 111 Stat. 2482 (“Section 209”).    As noted above, Section 209 provides for expedited consideration in a three-judge court of any claim challenging “the use of any statistical method in violation of the Constitution or any provision of law” in the apportionment count conducted by the Census Bureau.    33.                Under these provisions, the plaintiffs in the  House of Representatives  case challenged certain aspects of the Census Bureau’s proposed use of statistical sampling.    In its 1999 decision in that case, the United States Supreme Court struck down those aspects of the Bureau’s statistical sampling procedures.    The Court held that “the proposed use of statistical sampling to determine population for purposes of apportioning congressional seats among the States violates the [Census] Act.”    Id . at 334.    In so doing, the Court noted that [f]rom the very first census . . . Congress has prohibited the use of statistical sampling in calculating the population for purposes of apportionment,” and that the current Census Act “maintains [that] prohibition.”    Id . at 335, 339.    34.                Because it found that the challenged conduct was prohibited by the Census Act,  see  13 U.S.C. § 195, the Court found it “unnecessary to reach the constitutional question presented.”    Id . at 343.    The Census Bureau’s Use of Statistical Imputation in the 2000 Census    35.                The Census Bureau abandoned the broad statistical sampling methodology that the Supreme Court expressly struck down in  House of Representatives .    It did not, however, eliminate statistical sampling from the 2000 apportionment count entirely.       36.                The statistical imputation methodology employed in the 2000 census is substantively indistinguishable from the sampling methodology struck down in  House of Representatives .    Like the methodology struck down by the Supreme Court, imputation attempts to estimate persons who are not actually enumerated by traditional methods of enumeration.    It seeks to do so by use of a sample or statistical model.    37.                The broad sampling methodology struck down in  House of Representatives  proposed to estimate the number of persons in the 10% of the households within each census tract that would not be counted by traditional methods of enumeration.    Similarly, the imputation program, as implemented in the 2000 census, estimated the number of persons in households that were not counted by traditional methods of enumeration.    38.                Specifically, under the statistical imputation methodology employed in the 2000 census, the Census Bureau utilized the “hot deck” method.    Using the hot deck method, the Bureau estimates the size of unenumerated households by reference to data gathered from a single household within the same census tract—the household that was geographically closest to the one being estimated and that was actually enumerated by traditional methods.    In other words, where the Census Bureau failed to actually enumerate a household, it simply  assumed  that that residence had the same number of occupants as its closest neighbor.    39.                By supplementing the apportionment count with data representing persons that were not actually enumerated, but were merely estimated on the basis of a statistical model, the Census Bureau contravened the requirements of the Census Act, as conclusively interpreted by the Supreme Court in 1999.    House of Representatives , 525 U.S. at 338 & 343.    40.                Defendants used statistical imputation to add approximately 1.2 million “persons” to the apportionment count in the 2000 census.    41.                Had Defendants not supplemented the apportionment count with statistical sampling estimates under the imputation methodology, Utah would have been entitled to 4 seats in the United States House of Representatives beginning in 2003, North Carolina would have been entitled to 12 seats, and no other state’s apportionment would have been affected.    In other words, Defendants’ utilization of statistical sampling estimates had the effect of assigning an additional seat in Congress to North Carolina at Utah’s expense, and otherwise did not affect apportionment.    CLAIMS FOR RELIEF    Count I   (U.S. Constitution Article I, Section 2, Clause 3,  U.S. Constitution, Amend. XIV, Sec. 2)    42.                Plaintiffs reallege paragraphs 1-41 as if set forth fully herein.    43.                The Constitution requires that Defendants conduct an “actual Enumeration” of the “whole number of persons in each State.”    U.S. Const. Art. I, Sec. 2, Cl. 3; U.S. Const. Amend. XIV, § 2.    This procedure is necessary so that Members of the U.S. House of Representatives may be “apportioned among the several States ... according to their respective Numbers.” U.S. Const. Art. I, § 2, Cl. 3;  see also  U.S. Const. Amend. XIV, § 2.    44.                Defendants violated these constitutional requirements in supplementing the actual enumeration of the 2000 apportionment population with statistical sampling estimates under the imputation methodology.    In so doing, Defendants deprived Plaintiffs of their rightful representation in the House of Representatives and in the Electoral College.    Count II    (Census Act)         45.                Plaintiffs reallege paragraphs 1-44 as if set forth fully herein.    46.                The Census Act forbids Defendants from supplementing the actual enumeration of the apportionment population with statistical sampling estimates.     See , e.g.,   13 U.S.C. § 195.     47.                Defendants violated this statutory prohibition by supplementing the actual enumeration of the 2000 apportionment population with statistical sampling estimates under the imputation methodology.    In so doing, Defendants deprived Plaintiffs of their rightful representation in the House of Representatives and in the Electoral College.    Count III    (Pub. L. No. 105-119, Title II § 209)         48.                Plaintiffs reallege paragraphs 1-47 as if set forth fully herein.    49.                In Section 209, Congress found that “the use of statistical sampling or statistical adjustment in conjunction with an actual enumeration to carry out the census with respect to any segment of the population [creates] the risk of an inaccurate, invalid, and unconstitutional census.”    Pub. L. No. 105-119, Title II § 209(a)(7).    50.                In accordance with its recognition that statistical sampling or adjustment violates both the Census Act and the Constitution, Congress provided a cause of action allowing “[a]ny person aggrieved by the use of any statistical method in violation of the Constitution or any other provision of law … in connection with the 2000 or any later decennial census” to bring “a civil action [to] obtain declaratory, injunctive, and any such other appropriate relief against the use of such method.”    Pub. L. No. 105-119, Title II § 209(b).    51.                The Census Bureau’s use of imputation in the conduct of the apportionment count is a statistical method that violates the Constitution and Census Act within the meaning of Section 209.    Plaintiffs are aggrieved by Defendants’ use of imputation in the conduct of the apportionment count in that imputation deprived Plaintiffs of their rightful representation in the House of Representatives.    Count IV   (The Administrative Procedure Act)    52.                Plaintiffs reallege paragraphs 1-51 as if set forth fully herein.    53.                The right to be free from arbitrary and capricious government action is protected not only by the Constitution, but also by the Administrative Procedure Act.    See  5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706.    Likewise, the APA protects against final agency actions that infringe on the constitutional rights of equal protection and equal representation.    See  5   U.S.C. § 706.    54.                Defendants have failed to provide a rational explanation or basis for their decision to estimate the number of persons in households not enumerated by traditional methods of enumeration, and have failed to reconcile this decision with the Census Act, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in the  House of Representatives  case.    Likewise, Defendants have failed to reconcile their decision to use statistical imputation with the constitutional requirement of an actual enumeration.    55.                Defendants’ actions in supplementing the actual enumeration of the apportionment population with statistical estimates under the imputation methodology are arbitrary and capricious and infringe on the rights of equal protection and equal representation.    56.                These actions deprive Utah of political representation to which the State and its citizens are entitled.    Defendants’ actions must therefore be reversed under 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706.    PRAYER FOR RELIEF    WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs, by their undersigned counsel, request that the Court grant the following relief:    (a)      enter a declaratory judgment, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, declaring that the Census Bureau’s decision to supplement the actual enumeration of the 2000 apportionment population with statistical sampling estimates under the imputation methodology violates Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 of the United States Constitution; Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment; the Census Act; Title II, Section 209; and the Administrative Procedure Act.    (b)     enter an injunction requiring Defendants to remove from the 2000 apportionment count all data derived from statistical sampling estimates under the imputation methodology, to recalculate a new apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives, and to submit that apportionment calculation to the President for subsequent transmittal to the clerk of the House and, from him, to the States; and    (c)      grant such further relief as this Court deems just and proper.                   DATED this _____ day of April, 2001.                                                     Respectfully submitted,                  ______________________________    Mark L.

Barron, Acting            Director, United States Census Bureau,                             Defendants.                                                                                                                                                             THIRD DECLARATION OF LARA J. WOLFSON, Ph.D.                                           Case No F-2-01-CV-23: B                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1. I am currently employed as a Professor of Statistics at Brigham    Young University in Provo, Utah.   2. I hold a Ph.D. and an M.S. in Statistics, both of which were    awarded by Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I also hold    a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Simon Fraser University in Burnaby,    British Columbia.   3. I have authored over 30 scholarly publications in the field    of statistics.    4. I have also conducted numerous studies, and compiled statistical    reports to accompany those studies, as a consultant.   5. A significant portion of my work - both as a scholar and    as a consultant - has been devoted to evaluating the statistical accuracy of    national censuses.    6. An additional portion of my work, both as a scholar and as    a consultant, has been in the area of statistical techniques for accounting    for missing data; in particular, in the use of statistical imputation methods.       7. I am currently serving as the President of the Utah Chapter    of the American Statistical Association.   8. I have been retained as a consultant in this case to advise    the Plaintiffs on the statistical implications of the way in which the Bureau    conducted the 2000 decennial census.   9. The conclusions I draw and opinions I express in this Declaration    are supported by data and statistical analysis that other experts in my field    would consider reliable.    10. In preparing this Declaration, I have reviewed population    data produced by the Census Bureau in connection with the 2000 census. I have    also reviewed the process by which the Census Bureau apportions congressional    representation after conducting each decennial census, as well as numerous documents    detailing the methods used by the Census Bureau in conducting Census 2000, and    the way in which previous decennial censuses have been conducted. I have additionally    reviewed numerous scholarly articles on methods used in the decennial census.   11. Plaintiffs recently asked me to help them determine (a)    whether the Bureau's use of a statistical estimation procedure known as ""whole    person imputation"" or ""statistical imputation"" affected Utah's representation    in the House of Representatives; and (b) whether and to what extent the Bureau's    imputation procedure could correctly be described as a method of statistical    sampling comparable to the sampling method held unlawful by the Supreme Court    in  Dept. of Commerce v. United States House of Representatives , 525    U.S. 316 (1999).   12. Because the Bureau has not made the necessary data available    to the public in a complete and accurate form, I was unable to definitively    determine whether the Bureau's use of imputation affected Utah's representation    in the House of Representatives until April 9, 2001. I obtained the necessary    information on that date in a telephone call with a staff member of the House    Subcommittee on the Census. That information consists of a list showing the    number of persons from each state who were not individually enumerated in the    2000 census, but who were nevertheless added to the apportionment count through    statistical imputation.    13. Using that information, I determined on April 9, 2001, that    Utah would have received a fourth seat in the U.S. House of Representatives    if the Bureau had not supplemented the apportionment count with data derived    from statistical imputation.    14. With respect to the second determination of whether imputation    constitutes statistical sampling, I have concluded that the Bureau's imputation    procedure can only be described as a method of statistical sampling.   15. The analysis underlying both of these conclusions is set    forth in greater detail below.   BACKGROUND   16. In conducting the apportionment count in the 2000 census,    the Census Bureau employed methods of counting the population that included    (a) counting persons by traditional methods of enumeration (i.e., from data    reported on forms mailed by individual households or on forms filled out by    census enumerators during visits to those households); and (b) adding persons    assumed to reside in households not enumerated by traditional methods through    the use of a method of statistical estimation called ""hot-deck imputation.""    DSSD Census 2000 Procedures and Operations Memorandum Series B-17, ""Census 2000:    Missing Housing Unit Status and Population Data"" (hereinafter ""DSSD 2000 B-17""),    and DSSD Census 2000 Procedures and Operations Memorandum Series Q-34, ""Census    2000 Specifications for Imputing Housing Unit Status and Population Counts""    (hereinafter ""DSSD 2000 Q-34"").    17. The first step in conducting the apportionment count is    to develop the ""Master Address File."" The Census Bureau compiles the Master    Address File with the assistance of the United States Postal Service, other    federal agencies, tribal, state, and local governments, community organizations,    and canvasses of selected areas where they expect that other sources have not    yielded highly accurate address lists (see, for example,  http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/feasibility.pdf ,       or the ""Report to Congress - The Plan for Census 2000"", August 1997    by the Census Bureau, hereinafter referred to as the 1997 Census 2000 Report    ). The Census Bureau next makes a series of attempts to contact every household    on the Master Address File.  See  ""Census 2000 Operational Plan"" (December    2000),     http://www.census.gov/dmd/www/pdf/Operational2000.pdf .   18. Three traditional methods of enumeration are utilized in    attempting to contact every household on the Master Address File. First, the    majority of households are contacted through forms mailed to them, which they    are to fill out and return. This is known as the  mailout/mailback  procedure.     Id.  at IX-1.   19. Second, for areas where enumerators had to physically update    the master address file, the Bureau uses a counting mechanism known as the  update/leave     procedure. In performing that procedure, an enumerator leaves a census    form at a housing unit for the head of household to complete and mail-back,    and adds that housing unit to the Master Address File.  Id.  at IX-1.   20. Finally, for households in remote and sparsely populated    areas, the Census Bureau employs the  list/enumerate  procedure.    Under this procedure, an enumerator actually completes the census form for the    household (while recording the address for the master file).  Id.  at    IX-1.   21. Individuals not enumerated through one of the traditional    procedures described above can obtain census forms from the local post office    or by contacting a hotline through the ""Be Counted"" program. Targeted efforts    to improve coverage were implemented in difficult to enumerate areas. Separate    procedures were used by the Census Bureau to count people who were in ""special    populations"" such as military bases, group living situations, persons without    a usual residence, etc.  Id.  at IX-1 to IX-9.   22. For all households on the Master Address File who do not    respond to the Census via the traditional methods detailed in 18-21, the Census    Bureau conducts ""Non-Response Follow-Up"", where an enumerator attempts to contact    and complete the census questionnaire (via an interview with a member of the    household or using a proxy) for these households. A further attempt is made    to contact any non-responding housing units during the ""Coverage Improvement    Follow-Up"", where a second attempt is made to obtain information on the status    of the housing unit. Thus, any housing units for which population counts or    housing status is not known have been subject to at least two (generally more)    attempts to obtain that information.  Id.  at IX-12, IX-13.   IMPUTATION    AS A FORM OF SAMPLING   23. The imputation methodology used by the Census Bureau in    the 2000 census (described in DSSD 2000 Q-34) is a form of statistical sampling,    just as the estimation methodology proposed in the 1997 Census 2000 Report is    a form of statistical sampling. Both methodologies attempt to estimate the number    of persons in households that were not actually enumerated by traditional census    methods on the basis of statistical models and assumptions that allow inference    to be drawn about an unobserved segment of the population based on information    in an observed segment of the population. Accordingly, both methodologies are    a form of statistical sampling.   24. The statistical imputation methodology employed in the 2000    census differs from the sampling methodology proposed in the 1997 Census 2000    Report (and struck down by the Supreme Court in the  House of Representatives     case) in two principal respects: (a) the statistical estimation actually employed    in the 2000 invokes statistical sampling on a smaller scale than that proposed    in the 1997 Census 2000 Report; and (b) the statistical imputation methodology    relies on a more questionable, non-random, non-representative sample to estimate    the number of persons in non-enumerated households. DSSD 2000 Q-34.   25. Neither of these differences suggests in any way that the    statistical imputation methodology employed in the 2000 census can be considered    to be anything other than a form of statistical sampling. If anything, for reasons    explained below, the statistical imputation methodology employed in the 2000    census represents an even greater statistical leap of faith than that which    underlay the statistical sampling methodology proposed in the 1997 Census 2000    Report. In other words, the statistical imputation methodology employed in the    2000 census is even further removed from traditional methods of enumeration,    and is even less statistically valid, than the statistical methodology struck    down by the Supreme Court in  House of Representatives .   26. First, the scope of the statistical imputation methodology    employed in the 2000 census is more limited than that proposed in the 1997 Census    2000 Report. Whereas the 1997 Census 2000 Report proposed to count 90% of the    households in each census tract by traditional methods of enumeration and to    use a statistical model to estimate the remaining 10%, the statistical imputation    methodology employed in the 2000 census was used to estimate a much smaller    percentage of the households that were not counted by traditional enumeration    methods. According to data released by the Census Bureau, only about .43% of    the total apportionment count was included as a result of statistical imputation;    the vast majority of the apportionment count was produced by data compiled by    traditional methods of enumeration. (DSSD 2000 B-17, Table 6.)   27. Second, the statistical sampling proposed in the 1997 Census    2000 Report would have employed a different statistical methodology than that    actually employed in the 2000 census. In the 1997 Census 2000 Report, the Bureau    proposed to estimate the 10% of the households not counted by traditional methods    of enumeration by extrapolating from ""information gathered from the nonresponding    housing units surveyed by the Bureau"" within the same census tract.  House    of Representatives , 525 U.S. at 325. Because the households proposed to    be visited under the program set forth in the 1997 Census 2000 Report were ""a    randomly selected sample of nonresponding housing units, which would be 'statistically    representative of all housing units in [a] nonresponding tract,'""  id .    at 324, the Bureau proposed to estimate - based on data gathered from the households    within the tract that it did visit - the size of the 10% of the households that    it did not visit.  Id .   28. The statistical imputation methodology actually employed    in the 2000 census also estimated the size of non-enumerated households based    on a sampling methodology. The methodology differed from that proposed in the    1997 Census 2000 Report, however, primarily in that it made statistical estimations    based on a non-random and non-representative sample. DSSD 2000 Q-34 and DSSD    2000 B-17.   29. The statistical imputation methodology employed in the 2000    census utilized the nearest neighbor hot deck imputation method (hereinafter,    ""hot-deck""). Under the hot-deck method of imputation, the number of persons    in a household that has no recorded population count from traditional methods    of enumeration may be estimated based on an appropriate ""substitute"" or ""donor""    household that was counted by traditional methods. Specifically, a household    that was not enumerated is assumed to have the same number of persons as a household    that was (a) actually enumerated by traditional methods that included either    a telephone or in-person contact from an enumerator; (b) of the same type (e.g.,    single-unit or multi-unit) as the household being estimated; (c) geographically    closest to the one being estimated; and (d) if possible, within the same census    tract. (DSSD 2000 Q-34)  (1)   30. The ""hot deck"" terminology comes from an era when computer    processing was done largely by punch cards. For each non-enumerated household,    a measure of distance is computed between that household and all other households    that were enumerated by traditional methods. The enumerated households are then    ordered for each non-enumerated household in order of increasing distance, forming    a deck of punch cards. The card on the top of the pile (and thus, with the smallest    distance metric) is the ""hot card,"" and is used as a substitute for the non-respondent.    (See R.J.A. Little and D.B. Rubin, ""Statistical Analysis with Missing Data""    (1987, Wiley).)   31. This hot-deck imputation process is indisputably a form    of sampling; observations from a subset of the population are being used to    draw inference about the unobserved population, and hence, of the population    as a whole.   32. Hot-deck imputation is no less a form of statistical sampling    than was the statistical estimation proposed in the 1997 Census 2000 Report.    Neither is based on traditional methods of enumeration; both rely on statistical    assumptions and theories in order to estimate the number of persons in households    that were not actually enumerated; both rely on information about one part of    a population to infer information about another part of the population.   33. If anything, the hot-deck imputation process relies on a    statistical assumption that is even more questionable than the statistical sampling    procedure that was proposed in the 1997 Census 2000 Report. Both forms of sampling    rely on an assumption that non-enumerated households are ""similar"" to the enumerated    households that are used as the sample for the hot-deck imputation. Under the    sampling methodology proposed in the 1997 Census 2000 Report, that assumption    was defensible because the sample households were randomly distributed among    all households that did not respond to the mailed questionnaire. Under the hot-deck    imputation process, however, that assumption clearly breaks down because the    sample (or ""donor"") households are demonstrably different from those being estimated.   34. For example, for households that are known to be occupied,    but the population count is unknown, one would expect that the population count    in these households should be lower among non-respondents than among respondents    (since one might expect an inverse relationship between size of household and    the probability of being missed - see, for example, E.P Ericksen and J.B. Kadane    (1985) ""Estimating the Population in a Census Year: 1980 and Beyond"" in  Journal    of the American Statistical Association , 80:98-109). Further, since non-respondents    with unknown status tend to live in housing units whose occupancy has not been    established after two or more attempts by census enumerators to ascertain that    status, these unresolved housing status non-respondents are clearly different    from those who had late resolution of their housing status (the identified donor    pool, as explained above). One would expect that they are more likely to be    vacant or non-existent than housing units with resolved housing status.   35. Accordingly, the sampling methodology proposed in the 1997    Census 2000 report is essentially the same procedure that the Census Bureau    used to estimate a smaller segment of the population in the 2000 Census. However,    this implementation of imputation is less statistically valid than the plan    proposed in the 1997 Census 2000 report, which was based on representative random    sampling.   36. In light of the foregoing, the imputation procedures used    in the 2000 census amounted to little more than a ""watered-down,"" less-accurate    version of the plan that was struck down by the Supreme Court in  House of    Representatives .   37. In essence, the Bureau used a non-representative ""convenience    sample"" to infer characteristics of a segment of the population that is not    even known to exist.   EFFECT    OF IMPUTATION ON APPORTIONMENT   38. The number of people added to the total resident population    count through statistical imputation in the 2000 Census was large enough to    affect congressional apportionment. In fact, according to data provided by the    House Subcommittee on the Census on April 9, 2001, the Bureau's use of imputation    caused one seat to shift from Utah to North Carolina.   39. The estimated data added to the apportionment count through    imputation was substantially larger in 2000 than it was in 1990. As the Census    Bureau staff acknowledged in DSSD 2000 B-17, ""For Census 2000 the relative level    of population count imputation and substitution has increased since the 1990    Census. The processing procedures were different in 1990 than 2000 and these    are currently under investigation.""  Id . at 5.   40. Exhibit A to this declaration is a table delineating (a)    the number of persons from each state who are data-defined (this includes all    those for whom the population count is actually enumerated, and not derived    through the use of imputation, inclusive of group quarters); (b) the number    of persons who have some characteristics, such as age, sex, or race, etc., imputed    (""Imputed Person Characteristics""); (c) the number of persons who are from households    with known population counts, but all population characteristics are imputed    (""Known Population Counts with Substituted Whole Persons""); and (d) the number    of persons who were added to the resident population count based completely    on imputation of both household occupancy and population characteristics (""Substituted    Whole Households).   41. This data was obtained from the House Subcommittee on the    Census, and is from the ""HDS Imputed Persons Tally"" file. (Personal communication    with Mike Miguel, staff member of the House Subcommittee on the Census, April    9, 2001). This data is verifiable in the sense that the column ""Substituted    Whole Households"" can be shown to correspond with published Census Bureau results    in the column labeled ""2000 Percent Persons Unclassified"" in Table 6 of DSSD    2000 B-17.   42. The last two columns of the table in Exhibit A show the    reported resident population (as reported to the President on 28 December 2000    by the Census Bureau), labeled ""Total Reported Resident Population,"" and the     actual  known resident population computed without the use of any statistical    sampling methods, in the column labeled ""Total Known Population Count.""   43. Based on these numbers, as well as the Overseas Federal    Employees count as reported to the President on December 28, 2000, I have computed    the apportionment of congressional seats to the 50 States, using both the ""Total    Reported Resident Population"" and the ""Actual Known Resident Population"" (the    latter being Resident - Imputed Counts), with and without the Overseas population.    The results of this are shown in Exhibit B to this declaration.   44. Exhibit B shows that if the Census Bureau had used only    the  known  resident population counts (meaning those persons actually    enumerated during the Census, and not including those who are imputed after    two or more attempts to ascertain the true enumeration status of the household    they are attributed to), Utah would have been entitled to 4 seats beginning    in 2003, North Carolina would have been entitled to 12 seats, and all other    states would have been entitled to the number of seats allocated following the    2000 census. That result is the same whether or not overseas federal employees    are included in the apportionment count.   45. Exhibit C to this declaration shows, under each of the apportionment    populations described in Exhibit B, the allocation of the last 5 congressional    seats (numbers 431-435).   46. Exhibit C also shows, in the last column of each table,    the number of people that would have to be added to the population counts of    the seats occupying the next 5 priority positions for that state to be entitled    to the 435 th  seat in congress.   47. Exhibit C thus shows that if data derived from statistical    imputation were removed from the apportionment count, Utah would be entitled    to the 434 th  seat in Congress (her 4 th ), and California    to the 435 th  (her 53 rd ). It also shows that, under the    same scenario, North Carolina would be entitled to only 12 seats.          I hereby declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing    is true and correct.    Executed this day of April, 2001.        _____________________________________    Lara J. Wolfson, Ph.D.       Endnotes   1.  As described in DSSD 2000 Q-34 and DSSD    2000 B-17, these were the ideal rules for the hot-deck imputation; if a suitable    housing unit meeting these criteria could not be identified as a donor for the    housing unit missing data, these rules were relaxed."

Wolfson,            do hereby declare the following:                 1. I am currently          employed as a Professor of Statistics at Brigham Young University in Provo,          Utah.         2. I hold a Ph.D.          and an M.S. in Statistics, both of which were awarded by Carnegie Mellon          University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I also hold a Bachelor's degree          in Mathematics from Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia.         3. I have authored          over 30 scholarly publications in the field of statistics.          4. I have also conducted          numerous studies, and compiled statistical reports to accompany those          studies, as a consultant.         5. A significant portion          of my work - both as a scholar and as a consultant - has been devoted          to evaluating the statistical accuracy of national censuses.          6. An additional portion          of my work, both as a scholar and as a consultant, has been in the area          of statistical techniques for accounting for missing data; in particular,          in the use of statistical imputation methods.          7. I am currently          serving as the Past President of the Utah Chapter of the American Statistical          Association.         8. I have been retained          as a consultant in this case to advise the Plaintiffs on the statistical          implications of the way in which the Bureau conducted the 2000 decennial          census.         9. The conclusions          I draw and opinions I express in this Declaration are supported by data          and statistical analysis that other experts in my field would consider          reliable.          10. In preparing this          Declaration, I have reviewed population data produced by the Census Bureau          in connection with the 2000 census. I have also reviewed the process by          which the Census Bureau apportions congressional representation after          conducting each decennial census, as well as numerous documents detailing          the methods used by the Census Bureau in conducting Census 2000, and the          way in which previous decennial censuses have been conducted. I have additionally          reviewed numerous scholarly articles on methods used in the decennial          census, and contacted several of the authors of such articles.          11. On March 14, 2001,          plaintiffs first asked me to start an investigation to determine (a) whether          the Bureau's use of a statistical estimation procedure or procedures may          have affected Utah's representation in the House of Representatives; and          (b) whether and to what extent the Bureau's use of such procedure(s) could          correctly be characterized as a method of statistical sampling comparable          to the sampling method held unlawful by the Supreme Court in  Dept.          of Commerce v. United States House of Representatives , 525 U.S. 316          (1999).         12. At that time,          plaintiffs called my attention to a press release issued by the Utah Democratic          Committee (attached hereto as Exhibit 1), which asserted that if ""Non-Data          Defined Persons"" were removed from the apportionment population, Utah          would receive a 4 th  congressional seat. The press release also          implied that ""Non-Data Defined Persons"" were the product of a method of          statistical estimation or sampling.         13. In response to          this press release and at the request of plaintiffs, I spent dozens of          hours during March and early April examining thousands of pages of the          Census Bureau's publicly released documents, making inquiries with the          Census Monitoring Board--Presidential Members (""CMBP""), and          eventually interviewing staff members of the House Subcommittee on the          Census, in an attempt to determine whether the Bureau had used a statistical          method of estimation that had affected the State of Utah's representation          in Congress. Despite these extensive, ongoing efforts, I was unable to          make this determination until April 9, 2001. Indeed, for the reasons explained          below, the State of Utah could not reasonably have made this determination          any earlier, and it was only as the result of intensive investigation          and inquiry that Plaintiffs were able to resolve this issue by April 9.         14. Upon my initial          review of the documents released publicly by the Census Bureau, I learned          that the only data that were available were the general apportionment          counts, consisting of the resident population of the United States (""Resident          Population"") and federal military and civilian personnel (and their dependents)          serving overseas (""Overseas Population""). These data were transmitted          by the Census Bureau to the President on December 28, 2000, and made available          publicly on the Census Bureau's website shortly thereafter.  See  http://www.census.gov/population/cen2000/tab01.txt           .         15. Unfortunately,          the Census Bureau's report of these data did not enable me to determine          whether the Bureau had used a statistical method of estimation that had          affected the State of Utah's representation in Congress. In fact, a footnote          at the bottom of the above-noted webpage suggested that no such methods          had been used:          NOTE: As required          by the January 1999 U.S. Supreme Court ruling (Department of Commerce          v. House of Representatives, 525 U.S. 316, 119 S. Ct. 765 (1999)),  the          apportionment population counts do not reflect the use of statistical          sampling to correct for overcounting or undercounting .          Id.  (emphasis          added).         16. Despite this disclaimer,          I continued to investigate whether the Census Bureau had used a method          of statistical estimation that might have affected Utah's representation          in Congress. For example, I searched the Census Bureau website with respect          to the use of imputation and/or sampling in the 2000 census, but found          only documents such as the one found at  http://www.census.gov/dmd/www/sampfaq.htm ,          which is a document discussing the  proposed  use of sampling that          was officially struck down by the Supreme Court ruling in  House of          Representatives .         17. On or about March          16, 2000, I contacted Frances Bourne of the Census Monitoring Board, Presidential          Members (CMBP) and Eugene P. Ericksen, a consultant to the CMBP and a          professor at Temple University, by telephone to ask them whether they          were aware of any data regarding the Census Bureau's use of any methods          of statistical estimation--specifically, any data detailing for each state          the number of ""Non-Data Defined People"" added to the apportionment count.          Bourne and Ericksen indicated that no such data was available to the public          at that time. In fact, when I pressed further as to whether the data existed,          Ericksen indicated that he had been required to sign a Memorandum of Agreement          with the Census Bureau that required that he maintain the confidentiality          of this data.         18. On March 20, I          had another telephone conversation with Professor Ericksen in a further          effort to determine whether the relevant data existed. At that time, Ericksen          indicated that even he did not have access to sufficiently detailed, state-by-state          breakdowns of the ""Non-Data Defined People  (1) ""          to determine whether statistical estimation methods had affected Utah's          (or any other state's) representation in Congress.         19. On or about March          26, 2001, Plaintiffs' counsel informed me that they had contacted the          House Subcommittee on the Census in an attempt to track down the relevant          data (which still had not been released to the public). As a result of          these inquiries, plaintiffs acquired a document (attached hereto as Exhibit          2) providing various data under the headings ""Data Defined,"" ""Imputations,""          ""Total Substitutions,"" ""Substitutions of 3,4,5,"" and ""Group Quarters.""          Unfortunately, staff members of the Subcommittee (such as Mr. Mike Miguel,          senior data analyst of the House Subcommittee on the Census) were unable          to explain what these headings meant or to indicate whether this document          established that the State of Utah's representation in Congress had been          affected by the use of a statistical method of estimation.         20. After receiving          this document, I reviewed extensive Census Bureau documentation in an          attempt to decipher the above-noted headings. None of the documents that          I reviewed enabled me to establish conclusively the meaning of the headings.         21. On April 5, 2001,          I again contacted Professor Ericksen to as his opinion about the meaning          of the headings and whether the document provided by the House Subcommittee          indicated whether a statistical method of estimation had affected Utah's          (or any other state's) representation in Congress. Ericksen indicated          that he was unable to determine which of the columns labeled ""Imputations,""          ""Total Substitutions,"" and ""Substitutions of 3,4,5"" referred to the number          of people that who had been included in the apportionment population only          through a process of statistical estimation.          22. On April 9, 2001,          I participated in a telephone conference call with Mr. Miguel. Mr. Miguel          indicated that prior to that day, even he had not known the meaning of          the data or the headings in Exhibit 2. Mr. Miguel also confirmed that          the relevant data (even in its present, indecipherable form) had not been          made publicly available. However, Mr. Miguel explained that he had obtained          the relevant explanation of the data that very morning from a staff person          at the Census Bureau, and he agreed to share the explanation with me and          with counsel for Plaintiffs.         23. Mr. Miguel's explanation          of the data in Exhibit 2 confirmed for the first time that the Census          Bureau's use of the statistical method of hot-deck imputation had caused          the State of Utah to lose its fourth representative in the House of Representatives.         24. Prior to April          9, 2001, neither I, nor the Plaintiffs, nor the Census Monitoring Board,          Presidential Members, nor even the senior data analyst at the House Subcommittee          could have determined whether hot-deck imputation had affected Utah's          representation in Congress. Indeed, the relevant data still had not been          publicly released by that date, and it was only as a result of intensive          inquiries on my part and on the part of Plaintiffs' counsel that we were          able to acquire and decipher the data.           I hereby declare          under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

In order to ascertain whether          Utah's representation in Congress had been impacted by any use of statistical          estimation technique, it was necessary to break that category down further          into those who had been  counted  by means of statistical estimation,          as opposed to those who merely had characteristics estimated by means          of statistical estimation. The data that Professor Ericksen had access          to grouped these two categories together."

WOLFSON, Ph.D.                                      Case No. 2:01-CV-292G                                                          I, Lara J. Wolfson, do hereby declare the following:    1.         I    am currently employed as a Professor of Statistics at Brigham Young University    in Provo, Utah.    2.         I    hold both a Ph.D. and an M.S. in Statistics from Carnegie Mellon University    in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  I also hold a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics    from Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia.      3.         I    have authored over 30 scholarly publications in the field of statistics.      4.         As    a statistical consultant, I have also conducted numerous statistical studies    and compiled statistical reports to accompany those studies.    5.         A    significant portion of my work – both as a scholar and as a consultant – has    been devoted to evaluating the statistical accuracy and quality of national    censuses.      6.         An    additional portion of my work, both as a scholar and as a consultant, has been    in the area of statistical techniques for accounting for missing data; in particular,    in the use of statistical imputation methods.     7.         I    am currently serving as the President of the Utah Chapter of the American Statistical    Association.    8.         I    have been retained as a consultant in this case to advise Plaintiffs on the    statistical implications of the Bureau’s methodology in the 2000 decennial census.    9.         The    conclusions and opinions expressed in this Declaration are supported by data    and statistical analysis that other experts in my field would consider reliable.       10.     In preparing this Declaration,    I have reviewed the following: (a) population data produced by the Census Bureau    in connection with the 2000 census; (b) the process by which the Census Bureau    apportions congressional representation after conducting each decennial census;    (c) numerous documents detailing the Census Bureau’s methods in conducting Census    2000 as well as previous decennial censuses; (d) numerous scholarly articles    on methods used in the decennial census; and (e) documents produced by Defendants    in response to Plaintiffs’ discovery requests.    11.     Plaintiffs asked me to help    them determine (a) whether the Bureau’s use of a statistical estimation procedure    known as “whole person imputation” or “statistical imputation” affected Utah’s    representation in the House of Representatives; and (b) whether and to what    extent the Bureau’s imputation procedure could correctly be described as a method    of statistical sampling comparable to the sampling method held unlawful by the    Supreme Court in  Dept. of Commerce v. United States House of Representatives ,    525 U.S. 316 (1999).    12.     Data on the number of persons    from each state who were not individually enumerated, but were added to the    apportionment count through statistical imputation, was provided by Defendants.      See  Defendants’ Objections & Responses to Plaintiffs’ Revised First    Set of Interrogatories & Requests for Production of Documents at Table 3    (“DOJ Disc. Resp.”).    13.     Using this information, I    have determined that if the Bureau had not supplemented the apportionment count    with data derived from statistical imputation, Utah would have received a fourth    seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. .     14.     With respect to the second    determination of whether imputation constitutes statistical sampling, I have    concluded that the Bureau’s imputation procedure is a method of statistical    sampling.    15.     The analysis underlying both    of these conclusions is set forth in greater detail below.   BACKGROUND    16.     In conducting the apportionment    count for the 2000 census, the Census Bureau employed the following two methods:    (a) counting persons by traditional methods of enumeration (i.e., from data    reported on forms mailed by individual housing units or on forms filled out    by census enumerators after contacting those units, either personally or by    telephone); and (b) adding persons assumed to reside in households not enumerated    by traditional methods through the use of a statistical method called “hot-deck    imputation.”  DSSD Census 2000 Procedures and Operations Memorandum Series B-17,    “Census 2000: Missing Housing Unit Status and Population Data” (hereinafter    “DSSD 2000 B-17”) (Administrative Record (“AR”)  [1]   at C01010-01028)), and DSSD Census    2000 Procedures and Operations Memorandum Series Q-34, “Census 2000 Specifications    for Imputing Housing Unit Status and Population Counts” (“DSSD 2000 Q-34”) (AR    at C00858-00886).     17.     The first step in conducting    the apportionment count is to develop the “Master Address File.”  The Census    Bureau compiles the Master Address File with the assistance of the United States    Postal Service, other federal agencies, tribal, state, and local governments,    community organizations, and canvasses of selected areas where they expect that    other sources have not yielded highly accurate address lists.   See ,  e.g. ,    U.S. Bureau of the Census, Report to Congress: The Plan for Census 2000, at    19 (August 1997) (AR at C00151); U.S. Bureau of the Census, Census 2000 Operational    Plan (“2000 Operational Plan”) at VI-1 to VI-11 (December 2000)  (AR at C00245-255).       18.     Once it is complete, the Census    Bureau makes a series of attempts to contact every household on the Master Address    File.   See  2000 Operational Plan at II-2 to II-4 (AR at C00205-07).     19.     Three traditional methods    of enumeration are utilized in attempting to contact every household on the    Master Address File.  First, the majority of households (more than 80%) who    have city-style addresses ( i.e. , addresses that identify the precise    location of the housing unit) are contacted through forms mailed to them through    the United States Postal Service, which they are to fill out and mail back to    the Census Bureau.  This is known as the  mailout/mailback  procedure.      See id.  at IX-1 (AR at C00267; C00151-53).    20.      Second, for areas where addresses    used for mail delivery are predominantly non-city-style ( i.e. , rural    postal route addresses, which do not identify the precise location of the housing    unit), enumerators used a counting mechanism known as the  update/leave  procedure.     In performing that procedure, an enumerator leaves a census form at a housing    unit for the head of household to complete and mail back, and updates the entry    for that housing unit in the Master Address File.   See id.  at IX-1 (AR    at C00267).    21.      Finally, for households in    remote and sparsely populated areas, the Census Bureau employs the  list/enumerate     procedure.  Under this procedure, enumerators contacted the housing units (either    in person or by telephone), completed census questionnaires following interviews    with one or more occupants of each unit, and recorded the addresses on the Master    Address File.   See   id .     22.     Individuals not enumerated    through one of the procedures described above could obtain census forms from    the local post office or by contacting a hotline through the “Be Counted” program.     Targeted efforts to improve coverage were implemented in difficult to enumerate    areas.  Separate procedures were used by the Census Bureau to count people who    were in “special populations” such as military bases, group living situations,    persons without a usual residence, etc.   See id.  at IX-1 to IX-9 (AR    at C00267-00275).    23.     For all housing units on the    Master Address File that did not respond to the census via the methods described    above, the Census Bureau conducted the  “Non-Response Follow-Up” (NRFU)     process, in which enumerators attempted to contact and complete census questionnaires    (via interviews with members of each household or using a “proxy” such as a    neighbor).  During NRFU, several attempts were made to contact any housing units    for which a completed census response had not been obtained, or for households    that had been identified as vacant or non-existent.   Id . at IX-12 (AR    at C00278).    24.     If an enumerator was unable    to contact any of the occupants of a particular housing unit after multiple    visits or telephone calls, he or she would attempt to complete the census questionnaire    for that housing unit using information obtained from a “proxy” or from some    other “last resort” method ( e.g. , conversations with neighbors, personal    observations, etc.).   See  “Preparing for the 2000 Census: Interim Report    II,” Andrew A. White and Keith F. Rust, eds., Panel to Evaluate Alternative    Census Methodologies, Committee on National Statistics, National Research Council;    National Academy Press, at 91-92 (1997) (“Preparing for the 2000 Census”).     25.     An additional attempt is made    to enumerate housing units classified as “vacant” or “delete” ( i.e. ,    non-existent) by the NRFU operations during  “Coverage Improvement Follow-Up”    (CIFU) .  In addition, housing units that were added to the Master Address    File during census operations, but which were not followed up on during NRFU,    were also contacted through CIFU.   See  2000 Operational Plan   at    II-4, IX-12, IX-13 (AR at C00207, C00278-79).    26.       Thus, the Census Bureau    made multiple attempts to obtain census information from non-responding housing    units in the 2000 census.  The Bureau then used imputation to estimate the occupancy    of all housing units that, at the conclusion of the follow-up procedures described    above, had been designated as having “unknown population count status” ( i.e. ,    units known to be occupied, but for which the Bureau had not assigned a population    count); “unknown occupied/vacant status” ( i.e. , units known to exist,    but which the Bureau had not established as occupied); and “unknown occupied/vacant/delete    status” ( i.e. , units whose existence the Bureau had not established).      See  AR at C00155, C00973, C00859.    27.     The Census Bureau’s “double-delete”  [2]   policy required two independent    verifications of vacancy or non-existence for a household to be given a final    classification status of “vacant” or “delete” ( i.e. , non-existent).      See  2000 Operational Plan at II-4 (AR at C00207).  Therefore, in many    instances the Bureau presumably “counted” persons living in units whose occupancy    or existence was not only unverified, but also doubtful.     [3]    HISTORY OF IMPUTATION IN THE DECENNIAL CENSUS   1940 Census    28.      The first recorded use of    imputation in the decennial census was in 1940, where an imputation process     [4]   was used to fill in missing or inconsistent ages for persons    known to exist.   See  DOJ Disc. Resp. at 10; Robert M. Jenkins,  Procedural    History of the 1940 Census of Housing and Population , 45-48, 68-73 (1985)    (hereinafter “1940 history”).   1950 Census    29.     In the 1950 census, imputation    schemes similar to those used in 1940 were developed to deal with other characteristics    of persons counted in the census.   See  DOJ Disc. Resp. at 11;   C.F.    Citro,  Editing and Imputation ,  in   Encyclopedia    of the US Census  195-97 (Margo Anderson ed., 2000);  see also  AR    at C00429-431.    30.     Thus, in the 1940 and 1950    censuses, no people were  added to the apportionment counts  of the population    through the use of imputation.   See  DOJ Disc. Resp. at 11.   1960 Census    31.     The 1960 census marked the    first time that computers were used extensively to process data from the census,    which enabled a further refinement of the imputation for characteristics that    had been done in previous censuses.  In particular, this use enabled the imputations    to be based on the characteristics of other respondents to the census (unlike    the methodology in 1940 and 1950, where the imputations were based on “known”    distributions of items from other studies and censuses).   See  DOJ Disc.    Resp. at 12.    32.     In the 1960 census, for the    first time, imputation was used to add persons to the apportionment count.      See  DOJ Disc. Resp. at 11.  It was used only to add persons to the count    who were living in housing units known to be occupied, but for which the population    count was missing or illegible.   See  DOJ Disc. Resp. at 13.  The method    for this type of “substitution,” as this particular form of imputation came    to be called, was to use the previously processed housing unit or computer coding    sheet as a substitute for the unavailable or unreadable population counts.      See  DOJ Disc. Resp. at 12-13.  The technical term used for this type    of substitution is “sequential hot-deck” imputation.  The Bureau’s records indicate    that 776,655 people were added into housing units through this process in the    1960 census.   See  DOJ Disc. Resp. at 13; US Bureau of the Census,  1960    Censuses of Population and Housing: Procedural History , US Government Printing    Office, Washington, DC, 1966, at 121 (hereinafter “1960 History”).   1970 Census    33.     In the 1970 census, the Census    Bureau conducted two distinct imputation programs, both of which were based    on probability sampling.   See  DOJ Disc. Resp. at 14.  The first program,    known as the  Post-Enumeration Post-Office Check (PEPOC) , was carried    out only in sixteen southern states where the census took place via personal    enumeration rather than through mail-out/mail-back operations.   See  DOJ    Disc. Resp. at 14-15; US Bureau of the Census, 1970 Census of Population and    Housing: Procedural History, June 1976, at 7-6 (hereinafter “1970 History”)    (AR at C00388).  The second program, called the  National Vacancy Check     was conducted nationwide.   See  DOJ Disc. Resp. at 14-15; 1970 History    at 8-26 to 8-30.    In both programs, a scientifically designed sample    was used to estimate both the proportion of missed households and the average    size of such households, and then these two pieces of information were used    to select housing unit records to duplicate ( i.e ., impute) into the final    Census count tabulations.   See  DOJ Disc. Resp. at 15.    Both the    sequential hot-deck procedure and a “cold deck” procedure were used in the imputations.      See  1970 History at 8-26 to 8-30 (AR at C00389-393).    34.     PEPOC added approximately    500,000 persons in 170,000 housing units (an increase of 1.4%) to the combined    population of 16 southern states.   See  DOJ Disc. Resp. at 15; 1970 History      at 8-26, 8-27.  The National Vacancy Check added 1,068,882 persons (about    0.5% of the enumerated population) who were presumed to be living in 380,209    housing units.   See  DOJ Disc. Resp. at 15; 1970 History at 8-30 (AR at    C00393).    35.     An additional 900,000 persons    were imputed to housing units known to be occupied but for which no population    was reported.   See  DOJ Disc. Resp. at 14; United States General Accounting    Office, Testimony, GAO/T-GGD-91-8, Statement of L. Nye Stevens, Director, Government    Business Operations Issues, General Government Division, before the Subcommittee    on Census and Population, House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service (Feb.    21, 1991) at 11 (AR at C00678).      36.     Thus, a total of approximately    2.47 million persons were added to the apportionment count in the 1970 census    based on the sampling methods described above.     1980 Census     37.     In the 1980 census, imputation    was used to (a) assign population counts for units known to be occupied but    for which the number of occupants had not been obtained, (b) assign housing    unit status and then a population count to housing units that were “unclassified”    ( i.e. , not known to be occupied or vacant, but known to exist) at the    conclusion of enumeration procedures.   See  DOJ Disc. Resp. at 15-16;    1980 History at 1-16, 1-19, 12-4.    38.     Approximately 762,000     [5]   persons were added to the apportionment population through the    use of imputation in the 1980 Census.   See  DOJ Disc. Resp. at 16.      39.     In 1980, the Bureau’s use    of imputation shifted one seat in the House of Representatives from Indiana    to Florida.   See  AR at C00655.  Other than 1980, however, Defendants    have not identified any other use of imputation that had any actual impact on    apportionment.      1990 Census    40.     The procedures for adding    persons to the population count in the 1990 census were similar to those used    in 1980.   See  DOJ Disc. Resp. at 17; Bureau of the Census, United States    Department of Commerce,  DSSD 1990 REX Memorandum Series #BB-11 , “Summary    of the 1990 Census Imputation Procedures for the 100%  Population and Housing    Items” by James B. Treat (“Treat 1994”) (AR at C00777-78).      41.     In 1990, the Census Bureau    used imputation to add approximately 54,000 persons to the apportionment population    count.   See  DOJ Disc. Resp. at 17.  Nevertheless, the Census Bureau’s    use of imputation in the 1990 census did not affect congressional apportionment.     [6]      2000 Census    42.     The method of imputation used    in the 2000 census differed from the imputation employed in earlier censuses    in at least one important respect.  In compiling the apportionment counts in    the 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990 censuses, the Bureau imputed persons that it    estimated to be living in housing units that the Bureau had found to exist,    but for which no population count was reported.  In the 2000 census, by contrast,    the Bureau also used imputation to estimate the number of persons living in    households not even known to exist.      43.     Defendants suggest that the    record is unclear on this point.  In their response to Plaintiffs’ Interrogatory    No. 3, Defendants claim that “[f]or the censuses of 1960, 1970, and 1980, available    records do not indicate for certain whether persons were added to the apportionment    count for housing units that the Census Bureau had not classified as to whether    it was in existence.”  DOJ Disc. Resp. at 21.  However, a careful reading of    Defendants’ own documents indicates that the Bureau used imputation to estimate    the occupancy of (1) “housing units with unknown (occupied or vacant) status”    and (2) “units known to be occupied but missing population counts.”   See     Griffin 1992 at 2 (AR at C00735).  In fact, in 1982, Barbara Bailar, Associate    Director for the Census Bureau’s Statistical Standards and Methodology division,    explained in a sworn affidavit that the Bureau had established “the physical    existence of [all] housing units” that were subjected to imputation in the 1980    census.    See  Affidavit of Barbara A. Bailar in  Orr  v . Baldridge     (S.D. Ind. No. IP-81-604C)   at 6 (“Bailar Affidavit”) (AR at C00568).    44.     Defendants also claim that    “[r]ecords for the 1990 census indicate that, in 1990, imputation was used to    add to the apportionment count persons who were living in housing units” whose    existence had not been verified by the Census Bureau.  Again, however, their    own documents suggest otherwise.  For example, in a memorandum dated March 8,    1991, Charles D. Jones, Associate Director of the 1990 Decennial Census, explained    that in conducting the 1990 census, the Bureau imputed only (a) housing “[u]nits    known to be occupied, but for which no population count was collected,” and    (b) “[u]nits known to be existing housing units, but for which we did not know    the occupancy status . . . or number of persons.”  AR at C00682;  accord     Deborah H. Griffin, Imputation in the 1990 Census: Coverage Implications, (Aug.    31, 1992) at 2-9 (AR at C00735-742) (“Griffin 1992”).     [7]    IMPUTATION AS A FORM OF SAMPLING    45.     The definition of “sampling,”    in a formal statistical sense, is “the process of selecting a number of subjects    [units] from all the subjects [units] in a particular group or ‘universe.’”      See  e.g. John M. Last, Ed.,  A Dictionary of Epidemiology, 3 rd     Ed , Oxford University Press, 1995 at 151.  In contemporaneous usage, however,    “statistical sampling” is taken not only to be the process of selecting the    subjects, but the subsequent use of the sample to draw inference to the population    from which it was drawn    46.     Therefore, the imputation    methodology used in the 2000 census to add individuals to the population count    is a form of statistical sampling, both because it involves (a) the process    of selecting a particular housing unit (one whose occupants were actually enumerated    in the 2000 census) to be used as the sample from which inferences could be    drawn to a non-responding unit, and (b) the process of drawing that inference.      47.     The imputation methodology    used by the Census Bureau in the 2000 census (described in DSSD 2000 Q-34) is    thus a form of statistical sampling, just as the estimation methodology at issue    in  House of Representatives  is a form of statistical sampling.  Both    methodologies attempt to estimate the number of persons in households that were    not actually enumerated by traditional census methods on the basis of statistical    models and assumptions that allow inferences to be drawn about an unobserved    segment of the population based on information in an observed segment of the    population.  Accordingly, both methodologies are a form of statistical sampling.    48.     The statistical imputation    methodology employed in the 2000 census differs from the sampling methodology    struck down by the Supreme Court in the  House of Representatives  case    only in two principal respects:  (a) the statistical estimation actually employed    in the 2000 invokes statistical sampling on a smaller scale than that at issue    in  House of Representatives ; and (b) the statistical imputation methodology    relies on a more questionable, non-random, non-representative sample to estimate    the number of persons in unenumerated households.  See generally  DSSD    2000 Q-34 (AR at C00858-886).  [8]       49.     Neither of these differences    suggests in any way that the statistical imputation methodology employed in    the 2000 census can be considered to be anything other than a form of statistical    sampling.  If anything, for reasons explained below, the statistical imputation    methodology employed in the 2000 census represents an even greater statistical    leap of faith than that which underlay the statistical sampling methodology    at issue in  House of Representatives .  In other words, the statistical    imputation methodology employed in the 2000 census is even further removed from    traditional methods of enumeration, and is even less statistically valid, than    the statistical methodology struck down by the Supreme Court in  House of    Representatives .    50.      First, the scope of the statistical    imputation methodology employed in the 2000 census is more limited than that    at issue in  House of Representatives .  Whereas the latter methodology    would have authorized the Bureau to count 90% of the households in each census    tract by traditional methods of enumeration and to use a statistical model to    estimate the remaining 10%, the statistical imputation methodology employed    in the 2000 census was used to estimate a much smaller percentage of the households    that were not counted by traditional enumeration methods.  According to data    released by the Census Bureau, only about .43% of the total apportionment count    was included as a result of statistical imputation; the vast majority of the    apportionment count was produced by data compiled by traditional methods of    enumeration.  DSSD 2000 B-17, Table 6 (AR at C01027).    51.     Second, the statistical sampling    at issue in  House of Representatives  would have employed a different    statistical sample selection mechanism than that actually employed in the 2000    census.  The proposed sampling procedures at issue in  House of Representatives     included plans to estimate 10% of all households (consisting of those households    not counted by traditional methods of enumeration) by extrapolating from “information    gathered from the nonresponding housing units surveyed by the Bureau” within    the same census tract.   House of Representatives , 525 U.S. at 325.  Because    the households proposed to be visited under the program set forth in the 1997    Census 2000 Report were “a randomly selected sample of nonresponding housing    units, which would be ‘statistically representative of all housing units in    [a] nonresponding tract,’”  id . at 324, the Bureau proposed to estimate    – based on data gathered from the households within the tract that it did visit    – the size of the 10% of the households that it did not visit.   Id .    52.     The statistical imputation    methodology actually employed in the 2000 census also estimated the size of    unenumerated households based on a sampling methodology.  The methodology differed    from that proposed in the 1997 Census 2000 Report, however, primarily in that    it made statistical estimations based on a non-random and non-representative    sample.   See  DSSD 2000 Q-34 at 2-15 (AR at C00858-872); DSSD 2000 B-17    (AR at C01014-01021).   The housing units left unclassified (either as to housing    unit status or population count) at the termination of census operations have    also been characterized as “a biased and uncontrolled sample of cases.”  Preparing    for the 2000 Census, at   92 .      53.     The statistical imputation    methodology employed in the 2000 census utilized the nearest neighbor hot deck    imputation method (hereinafter, “hot-deck”).  Under the hot-deck method of imputation,    the number of persons in a household that has no recorded population count from    traditional methods of enumeration may be estimated based on an appropriate    “substitute” or “donor” household that was counted by traditional methods.     Specifically, a household that was not enumerated is assumed to have the same    number of persons as a household that was (a) actually enumerated by traditional    methods that included either a telephone or in-person contact from an enumerator;    (b) of the same type (e.g., single-unit or multi-unit) as the household being    estimated; (c) geographically closest to the one being estimated; and (d) if    possible, within the same census tract.   See  DSSD 2000 Q-34 at 1-15 (AR    at C0858-872).    54.       For each unenumerated household,    a measure of distance is computed between that household and all other households    that were enumerated by traditional methods.  The enumerated households are    then ordered for each unenumerated household in order of increasing distance.     The card on the top of the pile (and thus, with the smallest distance metric)    is the “hot card,” and is used as a substitute for the non-respondent.   See     R.J.A. Little and Donald B. Rubin, Statistical Analysis with Missing Data (1987).    55.      In the context of the apportionment    count, statistical sampling is a two-step process whereby the Census Bureau    (1) gathers information from various components or “samples” of the population,    and then (2) “imputes” that information to other non-sampled components of the    same population in an attempt “to account for those who cannot otherwise be    accounted for.”  Census 2000 Report at x (AR at C00132).  The hot-deck imputation    procedure described above is indisputably a form of sampling; observations from    a subset of the population are being used to draw inference about the unobserved    population, and hence, of the population as a whole.      56.     Hot-deck imputation is no    less a form of statistical sampling than was the statistical estimation proposed    in the 1997 Census 2000 Report.  Neither is based on “traditional” methods of    enumeration, which rely on either self-enumeration or enumerator observations    and interviews; both rely on statistical assumptions and theories in order to    estimate the number of persons in households that were not actually enumerated;    both rely on information about one part of a population to infer information    about another part of the population.    57.     If anything, therefore, the    hot-deck imputation process relies on a statistical assumption that is even    more questionable than the statistical sampling procedure that was proposed    in the 1997 Census 2000 Report.  Both forms of sampling rely on an assumption    that unenumerated households are “similar” to the enumerated households that    are used as the sample for the hot-deck imputation.  Under the sampling methodology    proposed in the 1997 Census 2000 Report, that assumption was defensible because    the sample households were randomly distributed among all households that did    not respond to the mailed questionnaire.  Under the hot-deck imputation process,    however, that assumption clearly breaks down because the sample (or “donor”)    households are demonstrably different from those being estimated.   See     AR at C00155;  see also  Griffin at 3 (AR at C00736).    58.     For example, for households    that are known to be occupied, but the population count is unknown, one would    expect that the population count in these households should be lower among non-respondents    than among respondents (since one might expect an inverse relationship between    size of household and the probability of being missed – see, for example, E.P    Ericksen and J.B. Kadane (1985) “Estimating the Population in a Census Year:    1980 and Beyond” in  Journal of the American Statistical Association ,    80:98-109).  Further, since non-respondents with unknown status tend to live    in housing units whose occupancy has not been established after two or more    attempts by census enumerators to ascertain that status, these unresolved housing    status non-respondents are clearly different from those who had late resolution    of their housing status (the identified donor pool, as explained above).  One    would expect that they are more likely to be vacant or non-existent than housing    units with resolved housing status.    59.     Housing units for which housing    unit status can be verified, in light of the “double-delete” policy, are more    likely to be occupied than vacant or nonexistent.  Housing units with verified    status and known population counts are also likely to have larger population    sizes (since the probability that a member of the household will be contacted    by an enumerator and be able to provide the necessary information is proportional    to the number of people in that household).      60.     Thus, the nearest-neighbor    hot-deck imputation procedure is likely to overestimate both the number of occupied    housing units, and the population size of those units.   In some states, however,    the average household size for imputed households was larger than the average    household size for units actually enumerated.   See  DSSD 2000 B-17 at    13 (AR at C01026).     61.     By applying the nearest-neighbor    hot-deck imputation procedure to units not known to exist (i.e., not known for    certain to be a valid residential housing unit), this over-estimation error    is compounded; in 2000, over 35% of all persons imputed into the population    count were from units with “unknown occupied/vacant/delete status”.  See  DOJ    Disc. Resp. at Table 3.  This amounted to over 415,000 persons.   Id.     62.     For all of these reasons,    there is no reason to believe that the use of statistical imputation improves    the accuracy of the census.  Although imputation increases the total population    count, and thus makes the “net undercount” appear to be smaller, there is no    reason to believe that the estimates added to the apportionment count by imputation    accurately reflect the true population as distributed across the 50 states.    63.      Indeed, although the Census    Bureau evaluated the need for and impact of statistical imputation when it first    introduced it in 1960 and 1970, to my knowledge (after reviewing extensive documents    in the public domain and documents produced in this litigation) the Bureau has    made no attempt to evaluate these questions since then.  The use of hot-deck    nearest neighbor imputation in the census relies on an assumption of local homogeneity    between the “missing” and “non-missing” housing units.   See  Bailar Affidavit    at 6 (AR at C00568).  The Bureau has not provided any data supporting the validity    of this assumption in 2000.  The assumption was last verified in 1970 (during    the National Vacancy Check), a time since which the socioeconomic composition    of the American population has changed significantly.   See  “Designing    the 2010 Census: First Interim Report of the Panel on Research on Future Census    Methods” , edited by Michael L. Cohen and Benjamin F. King, Committee on National    Statistics, National Research Council; National Academy Press, 2000 at 32:   The imputation and editing    routines in previous censuses have received relatively little evaluation in    preparing for the 2000 census.  This is surprising, given their impact on census    data quality.  This issue is especially important given the recent advances    in techniques for imputing missing values.  Data should be collected during    the 2000 census to support evaluation of the current editing and imputation    procedures and, more importantly, to support research on new editing and imputation    methods for the 2010 census.     64.      One additional difference exists   between    the statistical sampling technique at issue in  House of Representatives  and    the imputation techniques at issue in this case.  The former were designed,    at least in part, to address the historical undercount of certain “identifiable    groups – including certain minorities, children, and renters.”  525 U.S. at    322-23.  I am aware of no instance in which the Bureau has given any indication    that the statistical imputation used in the 2000 census was either designed    or used as a means of remedying this  differential  undercount.  Nor am    I aware of any evidence that imputation has ever had any significant impact    on that differential undercount.   IMPUTATION IS SUBJECT TO MANIPULATION    65.     I have also been asked to    evaluate whether and to what extent the Census Bureau’s power to implement statistical    imputation provides the opportunity for the exercise of discretion that could    result in the political manipulation of the census.  I believe that it does    in several respects.    66.     Most obviously, the discretion    to decide whether to supplement the actual enumeration with estimates derived    from statistical imputation may provide an opportunity for a very direct manipulation    of the apportionment of representatives.  In the 2000 census, the Census Bureau    and the Secretary of Commerce fundamentally altered the apportionment that would    have resulted from a traditional actual enumeration—by shifting one seat in    the House from Utah to North Carolina.  If Defendants retain the discretion    to decide whether to utilize such an imputation adjustment, they possess enormous    discretionary control over the allocation of representatives in Congress.    67.      Similarly, the discretion    to determine the  extent  of the use of statistical imputation in the apportionment    also presents an opportunity for manipulation.  The Census Bureau and the Secretary    of Commerce may affect the extent of the use of statistical imputation in any    of a number of ways.  First, the Census Bureau and the Secretary of Commerce    can affect the extent of statistical imputation by prescribing the procedures    for adding households to and removing households from the Master Address File.     By making it relatively easy to add a housing unit to the Master Address File,    but relatively difficult to remove a non-existent unit, Defendants can intentionally    increase the number of imputed households and thus affect apportionment.    68.     Second, the Census Bureau    and the Secretary of Commerce can affect the extent of statistical imputation    by their decision as to the date they cut off actual enumeration under Non-Response    Follow Up and invoke the process of statistical imputation, or, similarly, by    their decision as to the extent of their efforts at Non-Response Follow Up.     By ending Non-Response Follow Up at an earlier date or by decreasing the resources    devoted to that program, Defendants can intentionally increase the number of    imputed households and thus affect apportionment.    69.     Third, the use of imputation    also accords substantial discretion to local governmental officials, who may    have a self-interested motive to increase local population counts.  Local governmental    officials interested in increasing the number of persons imputed within their    jurisdiction could easily do so by providing misleading and difficult-to-verify    information to the Census Bureau in connection with the local update of the    Master Address File.  Because a predictable number of these units might never    be resolved – and might consequently be classified as “unknown occupied/vacant/delete”    (that is, of uncertain existence) – local officials could add imputed persons    to local population counts.    70.     Fourth, the Census Bureau    and the Secretary of Commerce can change the way in which statistical imputation    is performed.  Over the last decade, considerable statistical advances have    been made in developing methodologies for imputation in general; and the Census    Bureau has been involved in such developments.   See, e.g. ,  Yves Thibadeau,    U.S. Bureau of the Census Statistical Research Division Research Report # RR-99-02,    “Model Explicit Item Imputation for Demographic Categories for Census 2000”.       It is possible that in future censuses, a different imputation algorithm    (rather than hot-deck,  e.g. , a model-based imputation, or a “neighborhood    average population count”) could be used.  Different imputation methods could    lead to different numbers of persons being added to the apportionment counts.     EFFECT OF IMPUTATION ON APPORTIONMENT    71.     To my knowledge (which is    based on publicly available documents on the procedures governing the conduct    of the 2000 census), imputation was the only form of statistical sampling (either    random or non-random) used in determining the population count totals for purposes    of congressional apportionment.      72.     The number of people added    to the total resident population count through statistical imputation in the    2000 Census was large enough to affect congressional apportionment.  In fact,    according to data provided by the Defendants, the Bureau’s use of imputation    caused one seat to shift from Utah to North Carolina.   See  DOJ Disc.    Resp. at Table 3.      73.     The number of persons imputed    to housing units that may not exist (that is, housing units that the Census    Bureau never classified as “unknown occupied/vacant/delete”) was large enough    to affect congressional apportionment by itself; it caused one seat to shift    from Utah to North Carolina.     74.     The number and proportion    of persons added to the apportionment count through imputation was substantially    larger in 2000 than it was in 1990.  As the Census Bureau staff acknowledged    in DSSD 2000 B-17, “For Census 2000 the relative level of population count imputation    and substitution has increased since the 1990 Census.  The processing procedures    were different in 1990 than 2000 and these are currently under investigation.”     Id . at 5 (AR at C01018).    75.     Based on these numbers, and    on the overall apportionment count as reported to the President on December    28, 2000, I have computed the apportionment of congressional seats to the 50    States, using both the “Total Reported Resident Population” and the “Actual    Known Resident Population” (the latter being Resident – Imputed Counts), with    and without the Overseas population.  I have also calculated the apportionment    of congressional seats removing only those imputations pertaining to housing    units not known to exist.  The results of these calculations are shown in Exhibit    A to this Declaration.       76.     Exhibit A shows that if the    Census Bureau had not supplemented the apportionment count with estimates derived    from statistical sampling, Utah would have been entitled to 4 seats beginning    in 2003, North Carolina would have been entitled to 12 seats, and all other    states would have been entitled to the number of seats allocated following the    2000 census.    77.     Exhibit A also shows that    if the Census Bureau had used statistical imputation to estimate the occupancy    of only those households that were known to exist (as it had done in previous    censuses), Utah would have been entitled to 4 seats beginning in 2003, North    Carolina would have been entitled to 12 seats, and all other states would have    been entitled to the number of seats allocated following the 2000 census.      78.     Exhibit B to this declaration    shows, under each of the apportionment populations described in Exhibit A, the    allocation of the last 5 congressional seats (numbered 431-435).    79.     Exhibit B also shows, in the    last column of each table, the number of people that would have to be added    to the population counts of the states occupying the next 5 priority positions    for any of those states to be entitled to the 435 th  seat in Congress.      80.     Exhibit B thus shows that    if all data derived from statistical imputation were removed from the apportionment    count, Utah would be entitled to the 434 th  seat in Congress (her    4 th ), and California to the 435 th  (her 53 rd ).    It also shows that, under the same scenario, North Carolina would be entitled    to only 12 seats.    81.     Exhibit B further shows that    if the Census Bureau had limited its use of imputation to households known to    exist (as it had done in previous censuses), Utah would be entitled to the 435 th     seat in Congress (her 4 th ), and North Carolina would be entitled    to only 12 seats.                           I hereby declare under penalty    of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.                     Executed this                      day of June, 2001.                                                            _____________________________________                                                            Lara J.

See, e.g.,  AR at C00278-280.            [3]   For example, the Bureau may have      received information indicating that many of the non-enumerated housing units      did not actaully exist.  But unless it received information to that effect      from two independent sources, the Bureau used imputation to estimate the occupancy      of those units.   See  Wolfson Decl. ¶¶ __-__.           [4]   The imputation process was a combination      of using other information provided about the person with missing age, and      reference to a “known” distribution of ages (compiled from previous censuses      and other research).   The latter is generally referred to as a “cold-deck”      imputation procedure, because the possible ages were in the form of a deck      of cards, and the cards never changed as a result of data obtained through      the census.  See  DOJ Disc. Resp. at 10-11; 1940 history at 69-73.            [5]   In their response to Plaintiffs’      Interrogatories, Defendants round the number to 761,000.   See  DOJ Disc.      Resp. at 16.  However, documents in the Administrative Record put the number      at 761,652 ( see  AR at C00531).  For purposes of convenience, I have      rounded that number up to 762,000.                 [6]   Using the data provided by Defendants      on the number of persons added to the apportionment population in 1990 through      the use of imputation, I calculated the apportionment of Congressional seats      among the States in 1990.  I found that no changes to congressional apportionment      in 1990 would have occurred if imputations were removed from the apportionment      populations.           [7]   In any event, it is clear that the use of imputation      in the 1990 census had absolutely no impact on apportionment, and therefore,      that any supposed imputation of housing units not known to exist had no practical      consequence.  It is undisputed that in the 1990 census, fewer than 1,000 people      were imputed into housing units with  any  form of “unknown status.”        See  Griffin 1992 at 2 (AR at C00735).  In fact, only 883 of the 53,590      persons added to the apportionment population through imputation in 1990 were      from “unclassified (vacant or occupied)” units; the remainder were for housing      units that were known to be occupied, but which were missing population counts.       Thus, even if Defendants could establish that they subjected  any  housing      units of unknown existence to imputation in the 1990 census, that use of imputation      was purely an academic exercise that had no practical effect.             [8]   A random sampling procedure is one      in which each unit of the population has a known, non-zero probability of      selection.  A representative sampling procedure is one in which the sampled      units possess characteristics that resemble those of the non-sampled units.

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY               In this action, the State of Utah, many of its elected officials, and others challenge the Census Bureau's use of a sampling technique known as ""imputation"" in the portion of the 2000 census used to apportion seats in the United States House of Representatives.  Imputation is a method of statistical sampling in which the Census Bureau estimates what might appropriately be termed ""phantom residents""--that is, individuals who have never been specifically identified and are not, in fact, known to exist.  The Bureau's use of that technique in the 2000 census deprived Utah of a fourth seat in the House of Representatives.             To be sure, the Bureau had used imputation in several previous censuses, but only to estimate the number of persons living in housing units that census enumerators had personally verified as existing.  In the 2000 census, the Census Bureau took the next step down this slippery slope:  it used imputation to estimate the number of persons living in housing units that had not been verified to exist, even after several attempts at verification.  In short, the Bureau not only included phantom residents of known housing units in the apportionment count--as it had done before--it also included phantom residents of phantom housing units!              Under the undisputed facts, the Bureau's use of imputation in the 2000 census was unlawful for three separate reasons.  First, it violated the Census Act, 13 U.S.C.  1  et seq. , as recently interpreted by the Supreme Court in  Department of Commerce  v . United States House of Representatives , 525 U.S. 316 (1999).  In the Census Act, Congress prohibited the Census Bureau from using ""the statistical method known as 'sampling'"" in enumerating the apportionment population.  13 U.S.C.  195.  In  House of Representatives , the Supreme Court held that the Census Act ""directly prohibits the use of sampling in the determination of population for purposes of apportionment.""   House of Representatives , 525 U.S. at 338;  see also id.  at 340 (holding that ""there is only one plausible reading of the amended  195: It prohibits the use of sampling in calculating the population for purposes of apportionment"").              As shown in detail below, imputation is a form of statistical sampling, and therefore cannot be used in the apportionment count.  Indeed, the Census Bureau itself has characterized imputation as a method of ""sampling.""   See  United States Department of Commerce, Report to Congress--The Plan for Census 2000 (""Census 2000 Report"") at 23 (AR at C00155).  And one of the dissenting opinions in  House of Representatives  acknowledged that imputation is a ""sampling technique[],""  House of Representatives , 525 U.S. at 352 (Breyer, J., dissenting), comparable to the sampling invalidated by the majority's decision there.              Second, imputation is unlawful under the Census Clause, U.S. Const. art. 1  2, cl. 3, which requires an ""actual Enumeration"" of the ""whole number of persons"" in each state.  U.S. Const. art. I,  2, cl. 3 & amend. XIV,  2.  As shown below, a wealth of historical information uncovered since the  House of Representatives  decision confirms the conclusion reached in the concurrence authored by Justice Scalia and joined by three other Justices:  that the Census Clause, as understood by the Framers, ""requires an actual counting, and not just an estimation of             number.""  525 U.S. at 346-47.  Imputation involves an ""estimation""--in this case of housing units as well as of the individuals residing in those units--rather than an ""actual counting"", and is therefore patently unlawful under the Census Clause.              Imputation, moreover, raises the very concerns about ""partisan manipulation"" that led the Founders to adopt this requirement.   See   House of Representatives , 525 U.S. at 349.  As the record presented here shows, imputation, like the other sampling technique at issue in  House of Representatives,  carries the potential for manipulation by Congress, the States, and the Bureau itself.              Finally, the Bureau's use of imputation in the 2000 census violated the Administrative Procedure Act.  The federal courts have repeatedly held that the central purpose of the census is to apportion congressional representation among the states based on an accurate determination of the size and distribution of the national population.  The Bureau's decision to include phantom individuals--including phantom residents of phantom housing units--in the apportionment count is manifestly arbitrary because the administrative record on which the Bureau relied contains no studies or analysis, or indeed any substantial evidence sufficient to demonstrate that imputation furthers this constitutional purpose.  Without such analytic or factual support, the Bureau could not know whether the imputation procedures used in the 2000 census would accurately identify real people in appropriate numbers and proportions across the states.  And without any analysis of the statutory and constitutional issues addressed in the  House of Representatives  decision--issues on which the Administrative Record  (1)  is deafeningly silent--the Bureau could not know whether those procedures satisfied applicable legal requirements. Accordingly, the Bureau's use of imputation in the apportionment count must be vacated as arbitrary and capricious.         For all these reasons, this Court should issue a declaratory order invalidating          the Bureau's use of imputation in the 2000 census and an injunction requiring          the Bureau to recalculate the apportionment count exclusive of individuals          added through the imputation process. (2)                       STATEMENT OF UNDISPUTED FACTS              1. The federal decennial census is conducted pursuant to the requirement imposed by the U.S. Constitution in Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 and the Fourteenth Amendment that Congress (or such entity as Congress may designate) conduct an ""actual Enumeration"" of ""the whole number of persons in each state"" as the basis for apportionment of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.   See  U.S. Const., art. I,  2, cl. 3 & amend. XIV,  2.  The portion of the decennial census that is used to apportion congressional representation is often referred to as ""the apportionment count.""              2. In the Census Act, 13 U.S.C.  1  et seq ., Congress delegated responsibility for conducting the census to the Secretary of Commerce.   See  13 U.S.C.  4.  In turn, the Secretary of Commerce delegated the responsibility to the Director of the Census Bureau.             See  13 U.S.C.  141.  Under the Census Act, the Secretary has the responsibility to conduct ""a decennial census"" of the ""population"" of each of the United States.  13 U.S.C.  141(a).              3. ""From the very first census, the census of 1790,"" Congress required enumerators to ""swear an oath to make 'a just and perfect enumeration' of every person within the division to which they were assigned.""   House of Representatives , 525 U.S. at 335 (quoting Act of Mar. 1, 1790,  1, 1 Stat. 101).  In 1810, Congress clarified that ""'the said enumeration shall be made by an actual inquiry at every dwelling-house, or of the head of every family within each district, and not otherwise.'""   Id . (quoting Act of Mar. 26, 1810,  1, 1 Stat. 101).  This requirement--that enumerators visit each home in person--""appeared in statutes governing the next 14 censuses.""   Id .  Enacted in 1954, the current Census Act initially contained substantially similar language requiring enumerators to ""'visit personally each dwelling house in his subdivision' in order to obtain 'every item of information and all particulars required for any census or survey' conducted in connection with the census.""   Id.  at 336 (quoting Act of Aug. 31, 1954,  25(c), 68 Stat. 1012, 1015).              4. In 1964, Congress repealed the requirement that enumerators personally visit each housing unit.   See id . at 337 (citing Act of Aug. 31, 1964, 78 Stat. 737).  Although in the most recent four censuses personal visits have been supplemented by census forms delivered and returned by mail, the forms continue the longstanding practice of requesting up-to-date information directly from each housing unit.   See id ., 525 U.S. at 337.              The Census Bureau's Methods of Actual Enumeration              5. To conduct the apportionment count in the 2000 census, the Census Bureau first compiled a ""Master Address File""-- i.e. , a comprehensive list of dwelling places within the United States--with the assistance of the United States Postal Service, other federal agencies, tribal, state, and local governments, community organizations, and canvasses of selected areas where they expected that other sources have not yielded highly accurate address lists.   See  Declaration of Lara J. Wolfson, Ph.D. (""Wolfson Decl."") (attached as Exhibit A)  17;  see also  Administrative Record (""AR"") at C00034-36.              6. Next, the Census Bureau used three different procedures in attempting to contact every housing unit on the Master Address File.   See  Wolfson Decl.  18;  see also  AR at C00206-07.              7. Three traditional methods of enumeration are utilized in attempting to contact every household on the Master Address File.  First, the majority of households (more than 80%) who have city-style addresses ( i.e. , addresses that identify the precise location of the housing unit) are contacted through forms mailed to them through the United States Postal Service, which they are to fill out and mail back to the Census Bureau.  This is known as the ""mailout/mailback""   procedure.   See  Wolfson Decl.    19;  see also  AR at C00205-07, C00267.              8. Second, for areas where addresses used for mail delivery are predominantly non-city-style ( i.e. , rural postal route addresses, which do not identify the precise location of the housing unit), enumerators used a counting mechanism known as the ""update/leave""             procedure.  In performing that procedure, an enumerator leaves a census form at a housing unit for the head of household to complete and mail back, and updates the entry for that housing unit in the Master Address File.   See  Wolfson Decl.    20;  see also  AR at C00206, C00267.              9. Finally, for housing units in remote and sparsely populated areas, the Census Bureau employed the ""list/enumerate"" procedure.  Under this procedure, enumerators contacted the housing units (either in person or by telephone), completed census questionnaires following interviews with one or more occupants of each unit, and recorded the addresses on the Master Address File.   See  Wolfson Decl.    21;  see also  AR at C00206, C00267.              10. Some individuals not enumerated through one of the procedures described above were able to obtain census forms from the local post office or by contacting a hotline through the ""Be Counted"" program.  Targeted efforts to improve coverage were implemented in difficult-to-enumerate areas.  Separate procedures were used by the Census Bureau to enumerate ""special populations,"" such as military bases, group living situations, persons without a usual residence, etc.   See  Wolfson Decl.    22;  see also  AR at C00269-73.               11. For all housing units listed on the Master Address File that were not enumerated through the procedures detailed in paragraphs 7-10, the Census Bureau conducted a ""Non-Response Follow-Up,"" (""NRFU"") in which enumerators attempted to contact persons living in those housing units (either by telephone or through a personal visit) and complete missing census questionnaires following an interview with a member of the household or with a ""proxy"" such as a neighbor.  During NRFU, several attempts were made to contact any housing units for which a completed census response had not been obtained, or for households that had been identified as vacant or non-existent.   See  Wolfson Decl.  23;  see also  AR at C00278.  If an enumerator was unable to contact any of the occupants of a particular housing unit after multiple visits or telephone calls, he or she would attempt to complete the census questionnaire for that housing unit using information obtained from a ""proxy"" or from some other ""last resort"" method ( e.g. , conversations with neighbors, personal observations, etc.).   See  Wolfson Decl.  24.              12. During a second follow-up up procedure known as ""Coverage Improvement Follow-Up,"" (""CIFU"") the Bureau made further attempts to verify information for housing units that were identified as ""vacant"" or ""delete"" ( i.e. , of uncertain existence) during Non-Response Follow-Up, or to obtain population data for housing units still lacking population counts.  In addition, housing units that were added to the Master Address File during census operations, but which were not followed up on during NRFU, were also contacted through CIFU.   See  Wolfson Decl.    25;  see also  AR at C00278-79.              13. Thus, the Census Bureau made multiple attempts to obtain census information from non-responding housing units in the 2000 census.   See  Wolfson Decl.  26;  see also  AR at C00278-79 .   The Bureau then used imputation to estimate the occupancy of all housing units that, at the conclusion of the follow-up procedures described above, had been designated as having ""unknown population count status"" ( i.e. , units known to be occupied, but for which the Bureau had not assigned a population count); ""unknown occupied/vacant status"" ( i.e. , units known to exist, but which the Bureau had not established as occupied); and ""unknown occupied/vacant/delete status"" ( i.e. , units whose existence the Bureau had not established).   See  Wolfson Decl.  26; DOJ Disc. Resp. at 15-22.              14. In the 2000 census, the Bureau did not classify non-responding housing units as vacant or ""delete"" ( i.e. , non-existent) unless or until it received information from two independent sources that the unit in question was vacant or did not exist.   See  Wolfson Decl.  27; AR at C01019; C00207.  As a result of this ""double-delete"" policy, in many instances the Bureau likely ""counted"" persons living in units whose occupancy or existence was not only unverified, but affirmatively doubtful.  (3)    See  Wolfson Decl. at  27.              The Census Bureau's Use of Statistical Imputation              15. From the first census of 1790 through the census of 1950, the apportionment count was derived exclusively from actual data gathered by census enumerators, and did not include any estimates generated by statistical methods.   See  DOJ Disc. Resp. at 11; AR at C00155.  Although a form of statistical imputation was employed in the 1940 and 1950 censuses, it was used only to estimate  characteristics  of the population (such as age), and not to estimate the actual population  count  for apportionment purposes.   See  DOJ Disc. Resp. at 10-11; AR at C00155; Wolfson Decl.  28.              16. The Census Bureau first used statistical imputation to supplement the apportionment count in the 1960 census, and has used some form of imputation for that purpose in every decennial census since then.   See  DOJ Disc. Resp. at 11-12; Wolfson Decl.  32.              17. The method of imputation used by the Bureau, however, has changed over the years.  In compiling the apportionment counts in the 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990 censuses, the Bureau imputed several hundred thousand persons presumed to be living in housing units that the Bureau had found to exist, but for which no population count was reported.  (4)    See            Wolfson Decl.  31-44; DOJ Disc. Resp. at 13-16;  see also  AR at C00678, C00548, C00682.                18. In the 2000 census, the Bureau again imputed persons living in housing units known to exist, but for which no population count had been reported, but the Bureau also imputed the presumed occupants of housing units whose existence it had not been able to verify.  (5)                See  DOJ Disc. Resp. at 20-21; AR at C00778;  see also  AR at C01138-39 (explaining that in the 2000 census, the Bureau used imputation even where it did not ""know whether the census listing actually represents a housing unit"").              19. Also, while the imputation methodology used in 1960 was similar to that used in 1980, it differed significantly from the methodology used in 1970.  Although Defendants apparently take the legal position that imputation does not amount to statistical sampling, Defendants concede that some of the statistical procedures used in 1970 can accurately be described as forms of statistical sampling.  (6)    See  DOJ Disc.           Resp. at 14.              20. In 1980, the Bureau's use of imputation shifted one seat in the House of Representatives from Indiana to Florida.   See  AR at C00655.  Other than 1980, however, Defendants have not identified any other use of imputation that had any actual impact on apportionment.   See  Wolfson Decl.  39.              Imputation as a Form of Statistical Sampling              21. The statistical imputation methodology employed in the 2000 census is substantively indistinguishable from the sampling methodology at issue in  House of Representatives .   See  Declaration of Donald B. Rubin (attached as Exhibit B) (""Rubin           Decl."")  11, 20-23; Wolfson Decl.  45-52.  The Census Bureau developed both procedures to estimate the portion of the population that was not counted by traditional methods of actual enumeration.   See  Rubin Decl.  21-23; Wolfson           Decl.  47.              22. The Census Bureau has acknowledged in its own documents that imputation is a form of statistical sampling and that estimates derived by use of imputation cannot be considered the product of an actual enumeration.  In its report to Congress on its plan for the 2000 census, the Bureau expressly recognized the straightforward distinction between ""traditional methods of physical enumeration"" and methods of ""statistical sampling"" that are designed ""to account for those who cannot otherwise be accounted for.""  United States Department of Commerce, Report to Congress--The Plan for Census 2000 (""Census 2000 Report"") at x (AR at C00132).  The Bureau has also acknowledged that traditional methods of ""actual enumeration"" have long been viewed as ""the foundation of the census.""   Id .  This traditional foundation includes the ""questionnaire mail-out and mail-back campaign"" and follow-up visits to unresponsive housing units.   Id .              23. Throughout the Census 2000 Report, the Bureau repeatedly described imputation as a form of statistical estimation or sampling.   See  Census 2000 Report at 23 (AR at C00155) (explaining that ""'sampling' occurs whenever the information on a portion of a population is used to infer information on the population as a whole,"" and discussing imputation as one example of the Bureau's ""[r]eliance on [s]ampling in [p]revious           [c]ensuses"");  see also id.  at 42 (AR at C00174) (asserting that           ""[e]rrors can . . . be introduced when missing data items are created from statistical modeling procedures ( i.e. , imputation)."");  id . at 56 (AR at C00188) (""When information is missing or inconsistent, the Census Bureau uses a method called imputation to assign values.  Imputation relies on the statistical principle of 'homogeneity,' or the tendency of households within a small geographic area to be similar in most characteristics. . . .  In past censuses, when the occupancy status or the number of residents was not known for a housing unit, this information was imputed."");  id . at 23 (AR at C00155) (referring to imputation, and explaining that ""Census 2000 [would] not be the first time that the Census Bureau has used statistical methods to correct for problems in physical enumeration and to provide a more accurate final result."").              24. The Census Bureau has acknowledged that ""'sampling' occurs whenever the information on a portion of a population is used to infer information"" about unobserved portions of the same population.  Census 2000 Report at 23 (AR at C00155);  see also  Testimony of Census Bureau Director Kenneth Prewitt, U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Government Reform, Subcommittee on the Census (June 22, 2000) (AR at C00857) (""[I]n the apportionment number there will be a certain number of Census records which are put there through an imputed process.  Those are not people with names.  They are not people who filled out a form.  They are people who our statistical processes lead us to believe by putting that Census record in there we have given the country a more accurate number."").              25. Thus, in the context of the decennial census, statistical sampling is a two-step process whereby the Census Bureau (1) gathers information from various components or ""samples"" of the population, and then (2) ""imputes"" that information to other non-sampled components of the same population in an attempt ""to account for those who cannot otherwise be accounted for.""  Census 2000 Report at x (AR at C00132).              26. This two-part description of statistical sampling applies to the imputation methodology used in the 2000 census no less than it does to the sampling plan at issue in            House of Representatives .  Both procedures are sampling methods in that they both involve efforts to (1) obtain information pertaining to an observed portion of the population, and (2) use that information to draw inferences about an unobserved portion of the population.   See            Rubin Decl.  11, 21, 23; Wolfson Decl.  45-46.              27. There are two minor differences--both of which relate to the first of the two steps described above--between the sampling at issue in  House of Representatives  and the statistical imputation methodology employed in the 2000 census.   See  Wolfson           Decl.  47-48.  First, the latter would have invoked statistical sampling on a smaller scale than the former.   See   id.   48.  The plan challenged in  House of Representatives  would have authorized the Bureau to count 90% of the housing units in each census tract by traditional methods of enumeration, and then use a statistical model to estimate the remaining 10%.   See id .  50;  see also House of Representatives , 525 U.S. at 324.  The statistical imputation methodology employed in the 2000 census, by comparison, was used to estimate a much smaller percentage of the housing units that were not counted by traditional enumeration methods.  Only about 0.43% of the total apportionment count was included as a result of statistical imputation; the vast majority of the apportionment count was produced by data compiled by traditional methods of enumeration.   See  Wolfson Decl.  49-51 (citing AR at C01027).              28. The second difference between the statistical imputation methodology used in the 2000 census and the statistical sampling at issue in  House of Representatives  is that they employ different sample selection mechanisms.   See  Rubin Decl.  20, 22; Wolfson           Decl.  51-54.  The imputation methodology used in the 2000 Census is a form of ""non-probability"" or ""quota"" sampling, while the sampling methodology struck down in  House of Representatives  was a form of ""probability"" or ""random"" sampling.   See  Rubin           Decl.  20, 22; Wolfson Decl.  52-55;  see also  AR at C01167 (defining ""probability sampling"" as ""used in statistical, demographic, and population survey applications"" as ""a method of sampling such that each unit of the population has a known, non-zero probability, or chance, of selection."").               29. The housing units that would have been estimated under the sampling technique at issue in  House of Representatives  were part of ""a randomly selected sample of nonresponding housing units, which would be 'statistically representative of all housing units in [a] nonresponding tract.'""   House of Representatives , 525 U.S. at 324.  The Bureau proposed to estimate--based on data gathered from the housing units within the visited tract--the occupancy of the housing units that it did not visit.   See id . at 324-25.  This type of sampling methodology is referred to as random or probability sampling.   See  Rubin           Decl.  20;  see also  AR at C00167-68 (defining probability sampling).              30. The Census Bureau apparently believes that the statistical imputation methodology employed in the 2000 census enables the Bureau to estimate the size of non-enumerated housing units.  It does so, however, on the basis of a non-random and non-representative sample.  (7)    See  Wolfson           Decl.  52-55.  That methodology is known as the nearest neighbor ""hot deck"" imputation method (""hot deck method"").   See  Wolfson           Decl.  53; DOJ Disc. Resp. at 17-18.              31. The Census Bureau used the hot deck method to estimate the occupancy of each imputed housing unit by using data from the nearest enumerated unit within the same census tract.   See  Wolfson Decl.  53; DOJ Disc. Resp. at 17-18.  Thus, the Census Bureau assumed that the unenumerated residence had the same number of occupants as its geographically closest enumerated neighbor within the same tract.   See  Wolfson Decl.  53; DOJ Disc.           Resp. at 17-18.  The hot-deck method used in the 2000 census is a form of non-random, non-representative sampling.   See  Wolfson           Decl.  51-57.              32. Therefore, the differences between the Bureau's imputation methodology and the sampling procedures at issue in  House of Representatives  relate to the manner in which data is collected from the observed component of the population. This difference does not suggest that hot-deck imputation can be considered to be anything other than a form of statistical sampling.   See  Wolfson Decl.  55-56.              33. If anything, hot-deck imputation relies on a statistical assumption that is even more questionable than the statistical sampling procedure at issue in  House of Representatives .   See  Rubin Decl.  23-25; Wolfson Decl.  55-56.  Both forms of sampling rely on an assumption that non-enumerated housing units are ""similar"" to the enumerated units that are used as the sample for the hot-deck imputation.   See  Wolfson           Decl.  47-53.  Under the sampling methodology at issue in  House of Representatives , this assumption was arguably defensible because the sample housing units were randomly distributed among all housing units that did not respond to the mailed questionnaire.   See id.              34. Under hot-deck imputation, however, this assumption is less reliable because the sample (or ""donor"") housing units are not random or representative--they are demonstrably different from those being estimated.   See  Wolfson Decl.  57-61.  By definition, imputed housing units are those whose occupancy and/or population count has not been established after two or more attempts to do so by census enumerators.  From a statistical standpoint, the characteristics of such housing units (including their occupancy and existence) are likely to differ from those of households whose occupants were counted through traditional enumeration methods.   See id.   Indeed, one would expect that imputed housing units are more likely to be vacant, non-existent, or to have smaller population counts than housing units with resolved housing status.   See id.              35. Thus, the imputation method employed in the 2000 census represents an even greater statistical leap of faith than the sampling methodology struck down in  House of Representatives , and is even further removed from traditional enumeration methods.   See            Rubin Decl.  25 (concluding that ""population estimates produced using the Census Bureau's imputation procedure rest on less reliable statistical assumptions than those produced using probability sampling, including the probability samples at issue in the  House of Representatives  case"").  (8)              36. By applying the nearest-neighbor hot-deck imputation procedure to units not known to exist (i.e., not known for certain to be a valid residential housing unit), this over-estimation error is compounded; in 2000, over 35% of all persons imputed into the population count were from units with ""unknown occupied/vacant/delete status.""   See  DOJ Disc. Resp. at Table 3.  This amounted to over 415,000 persons.   See id.              37. For all of these reasons, there is no reason to believe that the use of statistical imputation improves the accuracy of the census.  Although imputation increases the total population count, and thus makes the ""net undercount"" appear to be smaller, there is no reason to believe that the estimates added to the apportionment count by imputation accurately reflect the true population as distributed across the 50 states.              38. Defendants compiled an Administrative Record pertaining to their decision to use imputation in the 2000 census.  Although Defendants ultimately decided to continue using imputation--and even expand its use--the Administrative Record contains no studies or analyses demonstrating that the imputation methodology used in the 2000 census is capable of accurately identifying real people in appropriate proportions.  Similarly, the Administrative Record contains no studies or analyses demonstrating that the expanded use of imputation would further the census' constitutional goal of distributive accuracy.   See  Wolfson Decl.  63.  Nor, indeed, does the Administrative Record contain any analysis of how the policy, statutory, and constitutional considerations addressed in the  House of Representatives  case might impact the Bureau's use of imputation in the 2000 census.              Imputation as a Potential Means of Manipulating the Apportionment Count              39. Defendants' use of imputation in the 2000 census altered the apportionment that would have resulted from a traditional actual enumeration--by shifting one seat in the House of Representatives from Utah to North Carolina.  If Defendants retain the discretion to decide whether (and to what extent) to utilize imputation, they will possess enormous discretionary control over the allocation of representatives in Congress.  Without question, such a result would provide opportunities for manipulation.   See  Wolfson Decl.  66.              40. The Census Bureau and the Secretary of Commerce may affect the extent of the use of statistical imputation in at least four ways.  First, they can influence the extent to which imputation is used in the apportionment count by prescribing the procedures for adding housing units to, and removing them from, the Master Address File.  By making it relatively easy to add a housing unit to the Master Address File, but relatively difficult to remove a non-existent unit, Defendants can intentionally increase the number of imputed households and thereby affect apportionment.   See  Wolfson Decl.  67.              41. Second, Defendants can vary the extent of their reliance on imputation by adjusting the date at which they cease enumeration activities under Non-Response Follow Up and invoke the process of statistical imputation, or, similarly, by adjusting the extent of their efforts during the Non-Response Follow Up phase.  By ending Non-Response Follow Up at an earlier date or by decreasing the resources devoted to that program, Defendants can increase the number of imputed households and thereby affect apportionment.   See  Wolfson           Decl.  68.              42. Third, Defendants' use of imputation gives substantial discretion to local governmental officials, who may have a self-interested motive to increase local population counts.  Local officials interested in increasing the number of persons imputed within their jurisdiction could easily do so by providing misleading and difficult-to-verify information to the Census Bureau in connection with the local update of the Master Address File.  Because a predictable number of these units might never be resolved--and might consequently be classified as ""unknown occupied/vacant/delete"" ( i.e. , of uncertain existence)--local officials could add imputed persons to local population counts.   See  Wolfson Decl.  69.              43. Fourth, Defendants could alter the manner in which imputation is performed.  Over the last decade, advances have been made in developing methodologies for imputation; and Defendants have been involved in those developments.  Therefore, it is entirely possible that in future censuses, Defendants could use a different imputation algorithm (rather than hot-deck,  e.g. , a model-based imputation, or a ""neighborhood average population count"").  By using different imputation methods, Defendants could further increase or decrease the number of persons being added to the apportionment count.   See  Wolfson           Decl.  70.              Effect of Imputation on Apportionment              44. Imputation was the only form of statistical sampling (either random or non-random) used in the portion of the 2000 census used to apportion congressional representation.   See  Wolfson Decl.  71.              45. The number of people added to the total resident population count through statistical imputation in the 2000 Census was large enough to affect congressional apportionment.   See  Wolfson Decl.  72.  Specifically, the Bureau's use of imputation in the 2000 census caused one seat to shift from Utah to North Carolina.   See id .               46. If the Census Bureau had used only the  known  population counts (meaning those persons actually enumerated during the Census, and not those estimated through statistical imputation), Utah would have been entitled to 4 seats beginning in 2003, North Carolina would have been entitled to 12 seats, and all other states would have been entitled to the number of seats allocated following the 2000 census.   See  Wolfson Decl.  72, 76.              47. The same apportionment would have resulted if the Census Bureau had not used imputation to include housing units of unknown existence,  i.e. , those designated by the Bureau as ""unknown occupied/vacant/delete.""   See  Wolfson Decl.  73, 77.  Stated differently, if, in conducting the 2000 census, the Bureau had limited its use of imputation to estimate only the population counts for those housing units whose existence it had confirmed, Utah would have been entitled to four seats beginning in 2003, North Carolina would have been entitled to twelve, and every other state would have been entitled to the same number of seats allocated following the 2000 census.   See id.              ARGUMENT              Summary judgment is appropriate in this case because the discovery responses and affidavits ""show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law."" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  Under the undisputed facts, Plaintiffs are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on their claims that Defendants' use of statistical imputation is a violation of the Census Act ( see  Section I below), the Census Clause of the Constitution (Section II), and the Administrative Procedure Act (""APA"") (Section III).              As a result of Defendants' unlawful use of statistical imputation, Plaintiffs have suffered a significant injury in the form of the dilution of their representation in Congress and in the Electoral College for the next decade.  To redress this injury, this Court should enter summary judgment in Plaintiffs' favor and order Defendants to remove from the 2000 apportionment count all estimates derived from statistical imputation and to recalculate the apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives.  (9)              I. IMPUTATION VIOLATES THE CENSUS ACT.              Especially in light of the  House of Representatives  decision, there can be no serious question that the Bureau's use of statistical imputation violates the Census Act.  As the Court made clear in that case, the Act prohibits the use of any statistical sampling for the purpose of determining apportionment in the House of Representatives.  Because the statistical imputation methods used by the Bureau are unquestionably forms of statistical sampling, they are prohibited by the statute.              A. The Census Act, as Interpreted in  House of Representatives , Prohibits the Use of Statistical Sampling in the Apportionment Count.              In  House of Representatives , plaintiffs prospectively challenged the Census Bureau's proposed use of ""statistical sampling to supplement data obtained through traditional census methods"" in the 2000 census.   House of Representatives ,   525 U.S. at 324.  The Bureau's plan included three steps.  First, the Bureau proposed to ""send census forms to all households, as well as make forms available in post offices and in other public places.""   Id .  The Bureau anticipated ""that 67 percent of households [would] return the forms.""   Id .  Second, the Bureau planned ""to divide the population into census tracts of approximately 4,000 people that [would] have 'homogeneous population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions'"":              The Bureau would then visit a randomly selected sample of nonresponding housing units, which would be ""statistically representative of all housing units in [a] nonresponding tract.""  The rate of nonresponse follow-up in a tract would vary with the mail response rate to ensure that the Bureau obtain[ed] census data from at least 90 percent of the housing units in each census tract.  For instance, if a census tract had 1,000 housing units and 800 units responded by mail, the Bureau would survey 100 out of the 200 nonresponding units to obtain information about 90 percent of the housing units.  However, if only 400 of the 1,000 housing units responded by mail, the Bureau would visit 500 of the 600 nonresponding units to achieve the same result.                          Id .  Third, ""[t]he information gathered from the nonresponding housing units surveyed by the Bureau would then be used to estimate the size and characteristics of the nonresponding housing units that the Bureau did not visit.""   Id . at 324-25.  ""Thus, continuing with the first example, the Bureau would use information about the 100 nonresponding units it visits to estimate the characteristics of the remaining 100 nonresponding units on which the Bureau has no information.""   Id . at 325.               In no uncertain terms, the Supreme Court struck down this procedure.  The Court held that ""the proposed use of statistical sampling to determine population for purposes of apportioning congressional seats among the States violates the [Census] Act.""  (10)    Id . at 334.  In so doing, the Court noted that ""[f]rom the very first census . . . Congress has prohibited the use of statistical sampling in calculating the population for purposes of apportionment,"" and that the current Census Act ""maintains [this] prohibition.""   Id . at 335, 339.               Although the Census Bureau abandoned the precise sampling methodology expressly struck down in  House of Representatives , it did not eliminate statistical sampling from the 2000 apportionment count entirely.  The Bureau continued to use the form of statistical sampling known as imputation to estimate a portion of the population for purposes of the apportionment count.              B. Statistical Imputation Is a Form of Statistical Sampling Prohibited by the Census Act.              The statistical imputation methodology employed in the 2000 census is a form of statistical sampling that violates the Census Act as construed in  House of Representatives .   See            Statement of Undisputed Facts (""SUF"")  21-35.  Through its use of statistical imputation, the Bureau sought to estimate by means of a sample or statistical model persons who were not actually counted by traditional methods of enumeration.   See  SUF  21.  By including in the apportionment count persons who were merely estimated on the basis of a statistical model, the Census Bureau contravened the requirements of the Census Act, as conclusively interpreted by the Supreme Court in 1999.   See House of Representatives , 525 U.S. at 338 & 343.              The Census Bureau has expressly recognized the straightforward distinction between ""traditional methods of physical enumeration"" and methods of ""statistical sampling"" that are designed ""to account for those who cannot otherwise be accounted for.""  Census 2000 Report at x (AR at C00132);  see  SUF  22-24.  In its report to Congress on its plan for the 2000 census, the Bureau acknowledged that traditional methods of ""actual enumeration"" have long been viewed as ""the foundation of the census.""  Census 2000 Report at x (AR at C00132).  This traditional foundation includes the ""questionnaire mail-out and mail-back campaign"" and follow-up visits to households that do not respond to the questionnaire by mail.   Id .              The Census 2000 Report also reveals the Bureau's understanding that any attempt to estimate persons not actually enumerated by these traditional methods constitutes statistical ""sampling.""   Id . at 23 (AR at C00155).  Specifically, the Report acknowledges that ""'sampling' occurs whenever the information on a portion of a population is used to infer information on the population as a whole.""   Id .  There can be no doubt that the express, undisputed purpose of imputation is to ""infer information on the population as a whole"" from data gathered on a ""portion of a population.""   Id .              In the Census 2000 Report, the Bureau expressly concedes that imputation is a form of statistical sampling in this sense.  According to the Report, ""Census 2000 [would] not be the first time that the Census Bureau has used statistical methods to correct for problems in physical enumeration and to provide a more accurate final result.""  Census 2000 Report at 23 (AR at C00155);  see  SUF  23.  According to the Bureau, the method of ""statistical imputation"" had been employed in a few previous censuses when enumerators ""could not obtain information on the number of people living in [a housing] unit"" by traditional methods of actual enumeration.             Id .  Thus, as the Bureau itself acknowledges, imputation is a ""statistical method"" or form of ""sampling"" designed ""to correct for problems in physical enumeration.""  (11)   The Census Bureau's use of imputation in the 2000 census accordingly violates the Census Act as interpreted in  House of Representatives .   See  SUF  22-24.              Indeed, the imputation methodology employed in the 2000 census is substantively indistinguishable from the sampling proposal expressly struck down in  House of Representatives .   See  SUF  21-35.  Both methodologies effectively estimate the size of households (and the number of households) not counted by traditional methods of actual enumeration, and accordingly both are equally offensive to the statutory scheme.  Three differences between the two methodologies may be identified, but none of them calls into question the controlling conclusion that imputation is a form of statistical sampling prohibited by statute.              1. Imputation cannot be justified on the basis of its narrower scope.              The principal difference between the sampling struck down in  House of Representatives  and the statistical imputation used in the 2000 census is that estimates using imputation involved a smaller percentage of the population.   See  SUF  27.  In the Census 2000 Report, the Census Bureau proposed to count 90% of the households in each census tract by traditional methods of enumeration, and to use a statistical model to estimate the remaining 10%.   See House of Representatives , 525 U.S. at 324-25.  By contrast, the Census Bureau used imputation to estimate a much smaller percentage (less than one-half of 1%) of the households that it was unable to enumerate using traditional methods.  (12)    See  SUF  27.              This difference in the extent of the Census Bureau's use of statistical sampling is irrelevant as a matter of law under the Supreme Court's analysis in  House of Representatives .  In that case, Justice Breyer argued in dissent that, although the Census Act would not permit the use of sampling as a ""substitute"" for traditional enumeration methods, it would allow sampling as a ""supplement"" to such methods.   See House of Representatives , 525 U.S. at 350-51.  In rejecting Justice Breyer's argument, the Court firmly established that the unlawfulness of sampling cannot depend on the extent of its implementation.  Specifically, the Court explained that the Census Act prohibits the use of statistical sampling ""'for the  determination  of population for purposes of apportionment,'""  id . at 342 (quoting  195) (emphasis added), and that ""determination"" is ""'the act of deciding definitely and firmly,'""  id . (quoting Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 346 (1983)).  Because the relevant population ""is not 'determined,' not decided definitely and firmly, until the [estimates generated by statistical sampling methods] are complete,"" the Court in  House of Representatives  expressly held that the prohibition on sampling ""for the determination of population"" applies whenever any statistical estimates are included in the apportionment count.   Id .              Accordingly, under  House of Representatives , the Census Act's prohibition of statistical sampling applies whether sampling is used to estimate 10% of households (as proposed in the Census 2000 Report), or to estimate less than 1% of households (as the Bureau actually did in the 2000 census).  The Census Act leaves no room for statistical estimation of  any  households for apportionment purposes.               2. Non-random sampling is just as unlawful as random sampling.              The second difference between the method of statistical estimation invalidated in  House of Representatives  and the statistical imputation methodology used in the 2000 census is that they employ different sampling techniques.   See  SUF  28.  As Professor Donald B. Rubin, Chairman of the Department of Statistics at Harvard University, explains in his accompanying Declaration, the principal difference between the two methodologies is that while the imputation methodology employed in the 2000 census is a form of ""non-probability"" or ""quota"" sampling, the sampling struck down in  House of Representatives  was a form of ""probability"" or ""random"" sampling.  Declaration of Donald B. Rubin, Ph.D. (""Rubin Decl."")  17-23;  see  SUF  27-33.              Under the ""probability"" or ""random"" sampling model invalidated in  House of Representatives , the Bureau proposed to estimate the size of the 10% of the households within each census tract that would not be enumerated by traditional methods of enumeration.   See House of Representatives , 525 U.S. at 324.  It planned to do so based on data gathered from ""a randomly selected sample of nonresponding housing units, which would be 'statistically representative of all housing units in [a] nonresponding tract.'""   Id .  In this sense, the method struck down by the Supreme Court would have used random, representative sampling to estimate the size of households that were not actually counted.   See  SUF  27-33.  Because these estimates of unenumerated households were to be used to ""infer information on the population as a whole,""  id .  23, this proposal was a form of sampling prohibited by the Census Act.              The statistical imputation methodology actually employed in the 2000 census also estimated the size of non-enumerated households, but it did so based on a non-random ,  non-representative sample.   See  SUF  28-30.  Under the method of statistical imputation, the Bureau estimated the size of the 0.43% of the households that were not enumerated by traditional methods of enumeration.  It did so based on data gathered from the household within the same tract that was geographically closest to the one being estimated.   See id .  31.  In this sense, statistical imputation used non-random, non-representative sampling to estimate the size of households that were not actually counted.  (13)    See   id .  28-31.  Again, because these estimates of unenumerated households were used to ""infer information on the population as a whole,""  id .  23, statistical imputation is a form of sampling prohibited by the Census Act.              The fact that statistical imputation employed a non-random, non-representative sample can hardly be thought to justify it.  If anything, the non-random sampling that bears the ""imputation"" label represents an even greater statistical leap of faith than the random sampling methodology at issue in  House of Representatives , and thus is even further removed from traditional enumeration methods.  (14)    See  SUF  33-37.  To illustrate, the methodology at issue in            House of Representatives  included plans to estimate 10% of all housing units nationwide (consisting entirely of units not counted by traditional methods of enumeration) by making assumptions based on ""information gathered from the nonresponding housing units surveyed by the Bureau"" within the same census tract.   House of Representatives , 525 U.S. at 325.  Thus, the units surveyed under that plan were ""a randomly selected sample of nonresponding housing units, which would be 'statistically representative of all housing units in [a] nonresponding tract,'""  id . at 324, and could therefore be used to infer information about the non-surveyed housing units in the same tract.   See  SUF  33-37.  From a statistical standpoint, that assumption was defensible because the sampled housing units were randomly distributed among all non-enumerated households, and were therefore presumably representative of the non-sampled units.    See  SUF  33.              The hot-deck imputation methodology used in the 2000 census, by comparison, was based on a non-random and non-representative sampling technique.  It was non-random because it assumed that imputed housing units - which were not enumerated by traditional methods - were likely to have the same number of occupants as ""donor"" units whose occupants were actually enumerated by traditional methods.  Similarly, it was non-representative because enumerated households are statistically more likely to be occupied than their non-enumerated counterparts.   See  SUF  30-37.  By definition, imputed housing units are those whose occupancy and/or population count has not been established after two or more attempts to do so by census enumerators.  From a statistical standpoint, the characteristics of such housing units (including their occupancy and existence) are likely to differ from those of households whose occupants were counted through traditional enumeration methods.   See id.   Indeed, one would expect that imputed housing units are more likely to be vacant, non-existent, or to have smaller population counts than housing units with resolved housing status.   See id.              Thus, the Census Act's prohibition of statistical sampling cannot be construed to condone the non-random, non-representative sampling methodology actually employed by the Census Bureau if it condemns the random, representative sampling methodology struck down in  House of Representatives ).  Such a construction would render the Census Act a nullity, or at least an absurdity.  If the Census Act permitted non-random sampling estimates for unenumerated households, then the Census Bureau could accomplish precisely what the Supreme Court has held that it may not lawfully do: it could supplement its actual enumeration of the population with estimates generated by statistical sampling models--so long as it employed a methodology that is closer to the non-random sampling methodology employed in the 2000 census than it is to the random methodology at issue in  House of Representatives .  Surely the Census Act's prohibition on sampling cannot be so easily circumvented.              Nothing in the language of the Act suggests the possibility of fine distinctions between ""random"" and ""non-random"" sampling, or between ""representative"" and ""non-representative"" sampling.  The statute enacts an unambiguous prohibition on ""sampling.""  Moreover, such a distinction would foster endless litigation over the precise boundary between permitted and forbidden methods or sampling, thus injecting the federal courts into the impossible task of ""reviewing estimation techniques in the future"" to determine whether they are non-representative or representative techniques.   See   House of Representatives , 525 U.S. at 348-49           (Scalia, J., concurring) (noting that a legal standard that would permit some ""estimation techniques"" and forbid others would give rise to ""the new specialty of 'Census Law'"" and would strain the ability of the federal courts ""to conduct such review effectively"").  By the same token, such a distinction would give the party controlling the census the untenable power ""to distort representation in its own favor"" by ""select[ing] among various estimation techniques.""  (15)    Id .  This Court should avoid this troubling distinction and interpret the Census Act in accordance with its plain language to forbid any and all methods of statistical sampling.              3. The Census Bureau cannot avoid the statutory prohibition by pointing to four prior uses of imputation in the apportionment count.              In a previous submission to this Court, Defendants attempted to identify a third basis for distinguishing imputation from the sampling struck down in  House of Representatives :  that imputation can lay claim to the imprimatur of historical practice.  Specifically, Defendants sought to characterize imputation as ""a practice that has been used consistently by the Census Bureau since 1940,"" and thus as a practice that should be upheld even though the sampling proposed in the Census 2000 Report was held unlawful.  Defendants' Opposition to Motion for Scheduling Order at 6.  The Census Bureau's reliance on history, however, must be rejected as factually misleading and legally irrelevant.              First, to the extent past practice is relevant, the Bureau's own practice throughout its history has largely rejected the use of imputation in favor of traditional methods of actual enumeration.  From the first census of 1790 through the census of 1950, the apportionment count was derived exclusively from actual data gathered by census enumerators, and not from estimates generated by statistical methods.   See  SUF  15.  Contrary to Defendants' unsupported assertion that imputation has been employed since 1940, it is now undisputed that the only ""imputation"" employed in the 1940 and 1950 censuses was imputation designed to estimate            characteristics  of the population (such as age, race, and gender), and not to estimate the actual population  count  for apportionment purposes.   See id .  This earlier practice has no relevance here, as it is well settled that the statutory prohibition on sampling applies only to the apportionment count and not to other uses of the census.   See   House of Representatives , 525 U.S. at 338 (acknowledging that the Census Bureau may ""use sampling procedures and special surveys"" in ""collecting a range of demographic information during the decennial census"").              To be sure, the Census Bureau has used statistical imputation to supplement the actual enumeration of the apportionment population in the last few censuses.   See  SUF  16.  Such use of imputation, however, has rarely had any actual impact on apportionment.   See id .  20.              Moreover, the imputation methodology employed in the 2000 census is significantly different from its predecessors.  In compiling the apportionment counts in the 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990 censuses, the Bureau imputed persons that it estimated to be living in housing units that the Bureau had found to exist, but for which no population count was reported.   See  SUF  17 & n.4.  In other words, in these censuses, statistical imputation was used only with respect to households listed on the Master Address File that Census Bureau enumerators had visited and identified during the Non-Response Follow Up phase of the census.   See id .  If a housing unit visited and identified during this phase could not be enumerated--because enumerators were never able to secure census data from persons living in the household or from a ""proxy"" such as a neighbor--the statistical imputation methodology was employed to estimate the number of persons in that unit.   See id .  On the other hand, if enumerators were unable to verify that a housing unit listed on the Master Address File was a valid household that actually existed, then that housing unit was treated as non-existent and it was not subject to imputation.   See id .               This fundamental change easily distinguishes the imputation methodology used in the 2000 census from the methodology employed in earlier censuses.  In 2000, the Census Bureau not only used sampling to estimate persons of uncertain existence living in  known  households or dwelling units; it also used sampling to estimate additional persons of uncertain existence living in households or dwelling units that may not even exist!  Because it is undisputed that the number of persons imputed to such ""phantom"" households was alone sufficient to deprive Utah of its fourth member of the House of Representatives,  see  SUF  47, this recent innovation is clearly enough to distinguish the imputation used in 2000 from its predecessors.              Second, in any event, Defendants' reliance on historical practice is simply misguided as a matter of law.  The Census Bureau cannot opt out of its legal duty to conduct an actual enumeration of the population by a sort of ""adverse possession"" of statistical methods such as imputation.   See   Walz  v . Tax Comm'n , 397 U.S. 664, 678 (1970) (explaining that           ""[i]t is obviously correct that no one acquires a vested or protected right in violation of the Constitution by long use"").  If the Census Act requires an actual enumeration and eschews the use of statistical sampling, as the Supreme Court held in  House of Representatives , no past practice of disregarding that statutory command will alter its binding effect.              Indeed, the Supreme Court in  House of Representatives  expressly rejected any reliance on past practice as a justification for the use of statistical sampling.  There, the Census Bureau, in an attempt to justify its proposed use of sampling (as outlined in the Census 2000 Report), argued that it had previously ""used statistical methods [specifically, imputation] to correct for problems in physical enumeration and to provide a more accurate final result.""   House of Representatives , (Sup. Ct. No. 98-404)   Brief for the Appellants at 48 (1998 WL 691297).   Justice Breyer similarly argued in dissent that the Census Bureau had in several recent censuses ""used an estimation process called 'imputation' to fill in gaps in its headcount.""   House of Representatives , 525 U.S. at 352 (Breyer, J., dissenting).              The decision in  House of Representatives  necessarily (if implicitly) rejected this reliance on recent practice.  Despite the Bureau's recent practice of using ""statistical methods"" in the form of imputation, the Court unambiguously held that the Census Act eschews such methods in favor of traditional methods of actual enumeration.              To be sure, Justice O'Connor's opinion for the Court examined history to provide ""context"" for the Court's interpretation of an ambiguity on the face of the Census Act.   See House of Representatives , 525 U.S. at 339.  But the relevant historical context cited in  House of Representatives  was not the past practice of the Census Bureau; it was the historical treatment of statistical methods, by  Congress , in the governing statutory framework.   See id . at 339-40.  (16)   That history--i.e., the history of Congress's treatment of statistical sampling--draws no distinction between the random sampling struck down in House of Representatives and the non-random sampling implemented in the 2000 census.              In short, as the majority in  House of Representatives  noted, for over 200 years, ""federal statutes have prohibited the use of statistical sampling where apportionment is concerned,"" without ever suggesting that certain forms of sampling might be immune from this restriction.             House of Representatives , 525 U.S. at 341.  The fact that the Census Bureau has ignored this longstanding prohibition in the past few censuses is simply beside the point, since the relevant history of the Census Act admits of only ""one plausible reading"" of  195:  that it unambiguously ""prohibits the use of sampling"" of all stripes in the apportionment count.   House of Representatives , 525 U.S. at 340.              II. STATISTICAL IMPUTATION VIOLATES THE CENSUS CLAUSE.                          The majority opinion in  House of Representatives  declined to address the question whether sampling violates the Census Clause because it concluded that the issue was controlled by statute.  At least four justices concluded, however, that the Census Clause also appears to condemn statistical estimation techniques by requiring an actual ""enumeration.""   See House of Representatives , 525 U.S. at 346 (Scalia, J., concurring, joined by           Rehnquist, C.J., Kennedy, J., and Thomas, J.).  Further analysis demonstrates that this conclusion is compelled, not only by the plain language of the Census Clause, but also by various historical considerations that were not before the Court in  House of Representatives .  That analysis also demonstrates that statistical imputation is similarly unconstitutional because, like the statistical sampling techniques at issue in  House of Representatives , it also relies upon estimation rather than ""actual enumeration.""              A. An ""Actual Enumeration"" is an Actual Count, Not an Estimate.              As the  House of Representatives  concurrence pointed out, an actual enumeration implies a count based on traditional methods of enumeration, not on statistical estimation.  During the founding era, ""enumeration"" was understood to contemplate an actual counting, not an estimate:              Dictionaries roughly contemporaneous with the ratification of the Constitution demonstrate that an ""enumeration"" requires an actual counting, and not just an estimation of number.  Noah Webster's 1828 American Dictionary of the English Language defines ""enumerate"" as ""[t]o count or tell, number by number; to reckon or mention a number of things, each separately""; and defines ""enumeration"" as ""[t]he act of counting or telling a number, by naming each particular,"" and ""[a]n account of a number of things, in which mention is made of every particular article.""  Samuel Johnson's 1773 Dictionary of the English Language 658 (4 th  ed.) defines ""enumerate"" as ""To reckon up singly; to count over distinctly; to number""; and ""enumeration"" as ""The act of numbering or counting over; number told out.""  Thomas Sheridan's 1796 Complete Dictionary of the English Language (6 th  ed.) defines ""enumerate"" as ""to reckon up singly; to count over distinctly""; and ""enumeration"" as ""the act of numbering or counting over.""  The notion of counting ""singly,"" ""separately,"" ""number by number,"" ""distinctly,"" which runs through these definitions is incompatible  with gross statistical estimates.                          House of Representatives , 525 U.S. at 346-47 (Scalia, J., concurring).  Moreover, as if to remove the possibility of any ambiguity, the Census Clause prescribes an  actual  enumeration--an enumeration, in other words, ""really in act,"" not just ""purely in speculation.""   See  Samuel Johnson,  A Dictionary of the English Language  (4 th  ed. 1773).              It is difficult to imagine a phrase that more clearly would have expressed the preference for an actual count over a mere estimate.  Even the terminology sometimes adopted in this Memorandum-- i.e ., a ""physical headcount""--does not quite capture the distinction, inasmuch as traditional methods of enumeration have always included gathering data from heads of households on individuals not physically present, but known to reside in the household.   See             House of Representatives , 525 U.S. at 335-36.  Thus, the requirement of an ""actual enumeration"" uniquely identifies the relevant difference between a statistical estimate and an actual count.              Indeed, it is quite telling that the Census Bureau itself has used the word ""enumeration"" the same way.  In a 1909 Census Bureau publication discussing the history of censuses in colonial America, the Census Bureau repeatedly drew a distinction between population assessments rendered ""upon the basis of enumerations"" and those based on mere ""estimates.""             See  U.S. Bureau of the Census,  A Century of Population Growth:  From the First Census of the United States to the Twelfth, 1790-1900 , 9 (1909);  see also   id . at 4 (distinguishing population assessments that were ""partly estimated"" from those that were the result of enumeration);  id . at 5 (noting that population information recorded in colonial Connecticut was ""furnished more often from estimates than from enumerations"");  id . at 6 (distinguishing colonial ""estimates"" of population in New York, Vermont, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland from ""censuses"" of population based on a ""thorough enumeration"").  Similarly, when historians have addressed this issue, they have drawn the distinction between an ""enumerative"" census (which is based on an actual count of the population) and an ""estimate"" of the population (which is based on statistical inferences drawn from a ""partial enumeration"" of a portion of the population).   See            A.B. Wolfe, ""Population Censuses Before 1790"", 27  J. of Amer. Statistical Ass'n  No. 180, at 357;  id . at 364 (explaining that the ""population figure[s] reported to the government"" in Italy in the eighteenth century and earlier were ""based not on actual enumeration but on estimates, or a mixture of the two"").              Statistical imputation cannot be reconciled with the requirement of an ""actual enumeration.""  The very purpose of imputation is to estimate statistically the size of households that were  not  counted ""singly,"" ""separately,"" ""number by number,"" or ""distinctly.""  Indeed, under the imputation methodology employed in the 2000 census, the Census Bureau not only failed to count ""separately"" the individual ""persons"" that it imputed; it took a further step away from such actual enumeration by failing even to count ""separately"" the  households  to which such persons were imputed.  SUF  17 & n.4.  (17)    Thus, it is not at all surprising that the Census Bureau itself has acknowledged that imputation involves statistical estimation and is not one of the ""traditional census methods of physical enumeration.""  Census 2000 Report at x & 23.              B. The History of the Census Clause Confirms the Plain Language.              The history of the Census Clause confirms this understanding of the plain language.  From the outset of the debates on this Clause, the Framers' overriding concern was to provide a ""permanent and precise standard"" for the census.   See  1 Farrand 578.  They understood that any standard that preserved discretion in the hands of the political officers controlling the census would encourage an unseemly manipulation--as ""those who have power in their hands will not give it up while they can retain it,"" but ""will always when they can rather increase it.""   Id .;  see also Franklin v. Massachusetts , 505 U.S. 788, 791 (1992) (explaining that the requirement that a new census be conducted every ten years was designed ""to ensure that entrenched interests in Congress did not thwart or stall needed reapportionment"").              This overriding policy consideration initially arose in the context of the debate over whether to reapportion members of Congress on the basis of an assessment of the States' wealth, as opposed to (or in addition to) their population.   See  1 Farrand at 582.  Although an early proposal would have permitted reapportionment ""according to the principles of wealth & population,"" the wealth criterion was soon abandoned, primarily on the ground that any assessment of wealth would have introduced too much discretion:              Mr. Sherman thought the number of people alone the best rule for measuring wealth as well as representation; and that if the Legislature were to be governed by wealth, they would be obliged to estimate it by numbers.  He . . . had been convinced by the observations of (Mr. Randolph & Mr. Mason) that the  periods  & the  rule  of revising the Representation ought to be fixt by the Constitution.              Id . (emphasis in original).  William Paterson similarly objected to a standard calling for an ""estimate for the future according to the Combined rule of numbers and wealth as too vague.""             Id . at 561.  George Mason echoed these same concerns, noting that any assessment of the wealth of the States would ""require[] of the Legislature something too indefinite & impracticable.""   Id .;            see also   id . at 583 (James Wilson indicating that he ""considered wealth as an impracticable rule"").              The history of the Framers' expressed preference for an ""actual Enumeration"" of population over an ""estimate"" of wealth strongly supports the plain language interpretation set forth above in at least two respects:  (1) it indicates the Framers' repudiation of a reapportionment rule that would depend on ""indefinite"" determinations that create opportunities for manipulation by those who control the census; and (2) it demonstrates that the Framers understood (and even expressly discussed) the difference between an ""estimate"" and an ""actual Enumeration.""              1. The Framers preferred a precise rule over an indefinite standard.              The Framers' preference for a ""precise"" standard over an ""indefinite"" rule for apportionment strongly supports the conclusion that an ""actual Enumeration"" is an actual count and not a statistical estimate.  If Defendants retain the discretion to decide whether to implement the form of statistical sampling known as imputation, and further to determine the methodology and extent of such imputation, they possess the very power that the Framers meant to withhold under the Census Clause:  to manipulate the census in an attempt to further their own political interests.              Most obviously, the discretion to decide whether to supplement the actual enumeration with estimates derived from statistical imputation may provide an opportunity for a very direct manipulation of the apportionment of representatives.  In the 2000 census, the Census Bureau and the Secretary of Commerce fundamentally altered the apportionment that would have resulted from a traditional actual enumeration--by shifting one seat in the House from Utah to North Carolina.  If Defendants retain the discretion to decide whether to utilize such an imputation adjustment, they possess enormous discretionary control over the allocation of representatives in Congress.   See  SUF  39.              Similarly, the discretion to determine the  extent  of the use of statistical imputation in the apportionment count presents a further opportunity for manipulation.  The Census Bureau and the Secretary of Commerce can (and do) affect the extent of statistical imputations by prescribing procedures for adding households to and removing them from the Master Address File; by altering the date on which they cut off actual enumeration and begin the process of statistical imputation; by determining the extent of the Non-Response Follow Up; and by deciding on the statistical methods and assumptions used in statistical imputation.   See id .  40-43.  (18)                              The impact of such decisions is not merely hypothetical.  In 1990, for example, the Census Bureau's approach to imputation added only about 50,000 persons to the apportionment count,  see  SUF  17 n.4, while a different approach in 2000 added nearly 1.2 million persons to the apportionment count at issue here,  id .  The discretion to control the process of imputation is the power to control apportionment.              Such discretion is surely offensive to the fundamental design of the Census Clause:              To give Congress the power, under the guise of regulating the ""Manner"" by which the census is taken, to select among various estimation techniques having credible (or even incredible) ""expert"" support is to give the party controlling Congress [or the Department of Commerce] the power to distort representation its own favor.  In other words, genuine enumeration may not be the most accurate way of determining population, but it may be the most accurate way of determining population with minimal possibility of partisan manipulation.              House of Representatives , 525 U.S. at 348 - 49 (Scalia, J., concurring).              For all of the reasons noted above, an interpretation of the Census Clause that would permit statistical imputation must be rejected as contrary to the express design of the Framers.  A construction of the Constitution that permitted statistical imputation would inevitably invite its manipulation in an effort to ""distort representation"" in favor of the party that controls the census.  This is the very result that the Framers sought to avoid in the ""precise"" standards set forth in the Census Clause.               2. The Framers understood and discussed the difference between an ""estimate"" and a physical count of the actual ""number"" of persons in a population.              The plain-language interpretation of the Census Clause finds further support in the Framers' recognition of the difference between an estimate of population and a physical count.  There can be no doubt that the Framers' generation was aware of this difference.  (19)   When the first Continental Congress debated the possibility of using population to apportion representation in 1774, John Adams lamented the lack of actual population counts, warning that ""it will not do . . . to take each other's word"" on the matter--that population counts ""ought to be ascertained by authentic evidence.""  2  Diary and Autobiography of John Adams  123 - 24           (L.H. Butterfield ed., 1961).  This deficiency had not been cured by the time of the Constitutional Convention in 1787.  The Documentary History of the Ratification of the Constitution 298 (Merrill Jensen ed., 1976).    ""The records of the Constitutional Convention contain a few scattered and partial  estimates of population ,"" but there was no actual count based on ""authentic evidence.""   Id . (emphasis added).              In fact, the initial allocation of representatives in the Census Clause  (20)  was based on ""estimates"" of the population of the several States, not on actual counts.   See id . (noting that in early 1788 Charles Cotesworth Pinckney published the ""estimates"" that ""he said the Convention had used"" in making the initial apportionment of representatives);  see also  U.S. Bureau of the Census,  Historical Statistics of the United States, 1789-1945 , 16 (1949) (explaining that estimates of the population of the colonies were ""based on materials ranging from relatively complete enumeration . . . to fragmentary data"").              Moreover, the debates at the Constitutional Convention include express reference to the possibility of an ""estimate"" of population, and a clear understanding of the difference between such an estimate and a count of actual numbers.  As Nathaniel Gorham recounted in           ""support[ing] the propriety of establishing numbers as the rule"" for reapportionment, ""in           Massts. estimates had been taken in the different towns"" in an attempt to ascertain the population of those towns.  1 Farrand at 587.  Gorham and his colleagues clearly understood the difference between an ""estimate"" and an actual count of the population.  As he explained, ""persons had been curious enough to compare these estimates with the respective numbers of people,"" and in so doing had concluded that a measure of population was also an accurate indicator of wealth.             Id . (concluding that ""the most exact proportion prevailed between numbers and property"").              The Framers, then, surely understood the concept of an ""estimate"" of population, yet they expressly rejected such an approach in requiring an ""actual Enumeration.""  Indeed, delegates to the Constitutional Convention expressly adverted to (and rejected) the possibility of a reapportionment based on an ""estimate.""   See id . at 561, 582, 583.  An early version of the Census Clause would have called for reapportionment based on a ""census and estimate,""  id . at 564, but the Framers replaced that language with the requirement of an ""actual Enumeration.""  Similarly, as noted above, the Framers rejected wealth as the standard for reapportionment--on the ground that Congress ""would be obliged to  estimate it  by numbers"" and that such an estimate would be inconsistent with the preference for a ""rule of revising the Representation [that] ought to be fixt [sic] by the Constitution.""   Id . at 582.  Thus, although there apparently was no recorded debate explicitly addressing the meaning of the words ""actual Enumeration"" when they were added to the Constitution by the Committee of Style,  see  2 Farrand at 590, there can be little doubt that the Framers understood that this plain language was intended to require an actual count rather than an estimation of any kind.              This conclusion finds further confirmation in later statements by delegates to the Constitutional Convention.  For example, when the first Census Bill came up for debate in Congress, James Madison confirmed his understanding that the constitutional requirement of an ""enumeration"" was meant to prescribe the method of conducting the census.  Madison discussed this term in the context of his proposal that the first census be expanded beyond ""the bare enumeration of the inhabitants"" and that it also gather data concerning ""the several classes into which the community was divided"" so that ""the legislature might proceed to make a proper provision for the agricultural, commercial and manufacturing interests . . . in due proportion.""  James Madison, Census Bill, House of Representatives 25 - 26 Jan., 2 Feb. 1790,  Papers  13:8 - 9, 15 - 16 (quoted in 2 Philip B. Kurland & Ralph Lerner,  The Founders' Constitution  (1987) at 139).  Madison's proposal elicited widespread opposition, primarily on the ground that this broader use of the census would be unduly complicated and practically difficult.   See id .  In responding to this objection, Madison argued that the ""enumeration"" required by the constitution would itself be even more complex and difficult:              If the object to be attained by this particular  enumeration  be as important in the judgment of this house, as it appears to my mind, they will not suffer a small defect in the plan, to defeat the whole.  And I am very sensible, Mr. Speaker, that there will be more difficulty attendant on the taking the census,  in the way required by the constitution , and  which we are obliged to perform , than there will be in the additional trouble of making all the distinctions contemplated in the bill.  The classes of most troublesome to  enumerate , in this schedule, are happily those resident in large towns, the greatest number of artisans live in populous cities, and compact settlements, where distinctions are made with great ease.              Id . (emphasis added).  Thus, Madison understood that the constitutional requirement of an ""enumeration"" was intended to prescribe ""the way"" that the census should be taken.  Although this actual enumeration would be ""difficult,"" Madison nonetheless acknowledged that Congress was ""obliged to perform"" the census in this manner.              With the benefit of this historical context, the constitutional provision for an ""actual Enumeration"" can only be understood to require an actual count of the population, not a subjective estimate.  This conclusion finds further support in the fact that despite the long-recognized difficulty of an actual enumeration and the obvious availability of statistical estimation, Congress has long resisted the temptation to authorize the use of statistical methods to estimate the apportionment population.   See House of Representatives , 525 U.S. at 336 (noting that for most of the history of the census Congress ""require[ed] enumerators to 'visit personally each dwelling house in his subdivision' in order to obtain 'every item of information and all particulars required for any census'"").  Congress's forbearance strongly suggests that it believed ""that the power [to estimate the population by statistical methods] was thought not to exist.""   See             Printz v. United States , 521 U.S. 898, 905 (1997) (explaining that historical evidence that ""earlier Congresses avoided use of [the] highly attractive power [to compel state executive officers to administer federal programs]"" indicates ""reason to believe that the power was thought not to exist"");  see   also   House of Representatives , 525 U.S. at 348           (Scalia, J., dissenting) (arguing that ""[t]he stronger the case . . . for the irrationality of that course [of actual enumeration unaided by statistical estimation methods], the more likely it seems that the early Congresses . . . thought that estimations were not permissible"").              For all of these reasons, Plaintiffs are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on their claim that statistical imputation used in the apportionment count of the 2000 census violates the Census Clause.  At a minimum, the Court should hold that any interpretation of the Census Act that would countenance the use of statistical imputation would present serious constitutional doubts, and accordingly should interpret the Census Act to prohibit the use of imputation in the apportionment count.   See   Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Constr. Trades Council , 485 U.S. 568, 575 (1988) (explaining that federal courts should construe statutory text in such a way as to avoid serious constitutional doubts).              III. DEFENDANTS' USE OF STATISTICAL IMPUTATION VIOLATES THE APA.              Defendants' use of statistical imputation also violates the demands of the           APA.  The APA's most basic requirements are that an agency's actions must be supported by substantial facts and analysis set forth in the administrative record and that the agency's actions must bear a rational relationship to the agency's goal.   See ,  e.g. ,  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n  v . State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. , 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983);  Hoyl  v.  Babbitt , 129 F.3d 1377, 1383 (10th Cir. 1997);  Olenhouse v. Commodity Credit Corp ., 42 F.3d 1560, 1574-75 (10th Cir. 1994).  In this case, the Bureau's goal is prescribed by statute and the Constitution itself.  As the Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized, the central goal of the census is to conduct a ""distributively accurate"" apportionment count - that is, one that furthers equal political representation in Congress because it not only accurately identifies the size of the national population, but also accurately ascertains how that population is apportioned among the several states.   See Wisconsin  v.  City of New York ,   517 U.S. 1, 19-20 (1996);  Franklin  v . Massachusetts , 505 U.S. 788, 804 (1992).              Defendants' actions fail to satisfy these basic standards.  Defendants have produced the administrative record on which the Bureau based its decision to use imputation in the 2000 census.   See  DOJ Disc. Resp. at 6-8.  Defendants have also produced records of the Bureau's consideration of whether to use imputation in the 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990 censuses.   See id.   A review of those documents demonstrates that the Bureau has never gathered the necessary facts to assure that imputation furthers the constitutional goal of equal representation.  In particular, the administrative record does not contain facts or analysis showing that the procedures used in the 2000 census (including the imputation of ""phantom"" housing units not known to exist) were likely to produce a distributively accurate portrait of the American population.              Nor does the administrative record contain any indication that the Bureau has ever examined whether imputation is consistent with the Census Act (as interpreted by the Supreme Court in 1999) or the Census Clause.  This disregard for Congress' instructions and the Supreme Court's pronouncements is remarkable.  As discussed above,  House of Representatives  overruled Defendants' proposed use of sampling in the Census 2000 Report in holding that Congress has prohibited the use of statistical sampling in the apportionment count.   See House of Representatives , 525 U.S. at 338 & 343.  And four of the Justices expressed the opinion that the Census Clause itself prohibits the inclusion of sampling in the apportionment count, and that it calls into question statistical methods that present the possibility of partisan manipulation.   See             id.  at 348.  At a minimum, the Court's decision in  House of Representatives  put Defendants on notice that any statistical method that went beyond the actual enumeration of known persons was highly questionable and required special justification.              Despite the fact that the Court in  House of Representatives  rejected Defendants' arguments and at least called into question the statutory and constitutional legitimacy of imputation, Defendants never analyzed whether the continued use of imputation is consistent with their statutory and constitutional mandate.  (21)   Indeed, instead of analyzing these issues, Defendants actually expanded their use of imputation - using it to estimate hundreds of thousands of phantom persons in phantom households not known even to exist.  Accordingly, because the Bureau failed to gather the facts necessary to support its actions, and because it failed to set out a reasoned analysis of how imputation would further distributive accuracy, the Bureau's decision to supplement the apportionment could by means of imputation must be vacated.              CONCLUSION                                     For the foregoing reasons, there are no genuine issues of material fact and Plaintiffs are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The Court should enter an Order (a) declaring that the Census Bureau's decision to supplement the actual enumeration of the 2000 apportionment population with statistical sampling estimates under the imputation methodology violates Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 of the United States Constitution; Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment; the Census Act; Title II, Section 209; and the Administrative Procedure Act; and (b) enjoining and requiring Defendants to remove from the 2000 apportionment count all data derived from statistical sampling estimates under the imputation methodology, to recalculate a new apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives, and to submit that apportionment calculation to the President for subsequent transmittal to the clerk of the House and, from him, to the States.

Defendants compiled the Administrative Record, which contains documents pertaining to Defendants' use of statistical imputation in the 2000 census, in response to Plaintiffs' discovery requests.  Plaintiffs filed a copy of the Administrative Record--which consists of 1187 pages, numbered C00001 through C01187--contemporaneously with this Memorandum.            2.   Although this case challenges only Defendants' unlawful use of statistical imputation, Plaintiffs have also challenged another aspect of the 2000 apportionment count in a related suit.  In that case, Plaintiffs seek to overturn Defendants' decision to enumerate only a portion of the Americans who were temporarily living abroad on census day.  On April 17, 2001 a three-judge panel granted summary judgment for Defendants on this claim.   See   State of Utah  v.  Evans , No. 2: 01CV0023B (D. Utah, April 17, 2001).  Plaintiffs are appealing this ruling to the Supreme Court.  Because of the timing of such an appeal, it is likely that any ruling in the present case will be consolidated with Plaintiffs' other claim for purposes of Supreme Court review.            3.    For example, the Bureau may have received information indicating that many of the non-enumerated housing units did not actaully exist.  But unless it received information to that effect from two independent sources, the Bureau used imputation to estimate the occupancy of those units.   See  Wolfson Decl.  27.            4.   In their response to Plaintiffs' Interrogatory No. 3, Defendants claim that ""[f]or the censuses of 1960, 1970, and 1980, available records do not indicate for certain whether persons were added to the apportionment count for housing units that the Census Bureau had not classified as to whether it was in existence.""  DOJ Disc. Resp. at 21.  A careful reading of Defendants' own documents, however, indicates that the Bureau used imputation to estimate the occupancy of (1) ""housing units with unknown (occupied or vacant) status"" and (2) ""units known to be occupied but missing population counts.""   See  Griffin 1992 at 2 (AR at C00735).  In fact, in 1982, Barbara           Bailar, Associate Director for the Census Bureau's Statistical Standards and Methodology division, explained in a sworn affidavit that the Bureau had established ""the physical existence of [all] housing units"" that were subjected to imputation in the 1980 census.   See  Affidavit of Barbara A. Bailar in  Orr  v . Baldridge  (S.D. Ind. No. IP-81-604C)   at 6 (""Bailar Affidavit"") (AR at C00568); Wolfson Decl.  42-44.             Also, while Defendants claim that ""[r]ecords for the 1990 census indicate that, in 1990, imputation was used to add to the apportionment count persons who were living in housing units"" whose existence had not been verified by the Census Bureau, their own documents suggest otherwise.  For example, in a memorandum dated March 8, 1991, Charles D. Jones, Associate Director of the 1990 Decennial Census, explained that in conducting the 1990 census, the Bureau imputed only (a) housing ""[u]nits known to be occupied, but for which no population count was collected,"" and (b) ""[u]nits known to be existing housing units, but for which we did not know the occupancy status . . . or number of persons.""  AR at C00682; Wolfson Decl.  42-44.               In any event, it is clear that the use of imputation in the 1990 census had absolutely no impact on apportionment, and therefore, that any supposed imputation of housing units not known to exist had no practical consequence.  It is undisputed that in the 1990 census, fewer than 1,000 people were imputed into housing units with  any  form of ""unknown status.""   See            Wolfson Decl.  42-44.  In fact, only 883 of the 53,590 persons added to the apportionment population through imputation in 1990 were from ""unclassified (vacant or occupied)"" units; the remainder were for housing units that were known to be occupied, but which were missing population counts.  Thus, even if Defendants could establish that they subjected  any  housing units of unknown existence to imputation in the 1990 census, that use of imputation was purely an academic exercise that had no practical effect.   See  Wolfson Decl.  44 & n.7.  By contrast, of the nearly 1.2 million ""persons"" imputed in the 2000 census, more than 400,000 were attributed to housing units of unknown existence.   See  DOJ Disc. Resp. at Table 1;  id . at Table 3. 5.             6.    In 1970, the Census Bureau used two random, representative sampling procedures (known as the National Vacancy Check and the Post-Enumeration Post-Office Check) to estimate the occupancy of housing units that had been classified as vacant.  Those procedures were similar to those at issue in  House of Representatives , under which the verified population counts of randomly sampled non-responding housing units would have been used to estimate the occupancy of other non-responding units that were not sampled.   See  DOJ Disc.           Resp. at 14.              7. A random sampling procedure is one in which each unit of the population has a known, non-zero probability of selection.  A representative sampling procedure is one in which the sampled units possess characteristics that resemble those of the non-sampled units.   See  Wolfson           Decl.  48 n.8;  see also  Rubin Decl.  18-19.            8. There is one additional difference between the statistical sampling technique at issue in  House of Representatives  and the imputation techniques at issue here.  The former was designed, at least in part, to address the historical undercount of certain ""identifiable groups - including certain minorities, children, and renters.""  525 U.S. at 322-23.  Here, by contrast, there is no indication in the Administrative Record produced in this case that imputation was used as a means of remedying this  differential  undercount, as opposed to improving the overall numerical accuracy of the census.  Nor are Plaintiffs aware of any evidence that imputation actually has any significant impact on that differential undercount.   See  Wolfson           Decl.  64.            9. As noted above, this relief will affect only the parties before the Court as it will provide Utah its fourth representative in the House of Representatives, limit North Carolina to its current allotment of twelve representatives, and have no effect on any other state's representation.            10. Because it found that statistical sampling was prohibited by the Census Act, the majority found it ""unnecessary to reach the constitutional question presented.""   See House of Representatives , 525 U.S. at 343.  In a concurring opinion joined by three other justices, however, Justice Scalia opined that statistical estimation was also likely inconsistent with the constitutional requirement of an ""actual enumeration.""   See   id . at 344-56 (Scalia, J., concurring).   See  Section II below.            11.   Throughout the Census 2000 Report, the Bureau repeatedly describes imputation as a form of statistical estimation or sampling.   See  SUF   22-24.  In the heat of this litigation, the Census Bureau undoubtedly will seek to distance itself from these statements, and argue that imputation somehow does not qualify as statistical sampling.  Any such efforts must be rejected; having repeatedly described imputation as a form of statistical sampling in response to an inquiry from Congress, the Bureau cannot credibly re-define that term now for purposes of this litigation.   See             FLRA  v.  United States Dep't of Treasury , 884 F.2d 1446, 1455 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (explaining that ""a position established only in litigation may have been developed hastily, or under special pressure,"" and may not represent the results of the agency's deliberative processes).             12.    In light of the  House of Representatives  decision, the Bureau stepped up its efforts to visit households that did not respond to the mailed questionnaire, and thus counted over 99% of all households by traditional methods of enumeration.   See id .            13. A random sampling procedure is one in which each unit of the population has a known, non-zero probability of selection.  A representative sampling procedure is one in which the sampled units possess characteristics that resemble those of the non-sampled units.   See  SUF  30 n.7.            14. The important point, however, is not that imputation is statistically unreliable; Plaintiffs need not establish this point to prevail.  Rather, Plaintiffs' claim turns only on the undisputed proposition that statistical imputation is a form of statistical sampling , and not a method of actual enumeration.  This point is not only undisputed; it is conclusively established by the Census Bureau's own admissions.            15. For further discussion on this problem, see section II below.            16.   Specifically, the Court considered the history of the Census Act in an effort to reconcile two important provisions of the Act.  The first is Section 195, which provides that ""[e]xcept for the determination of population for purposes of apportionment . . ., the Secretary shall, if he considers it feasible, authorize the use of the statistical method known as 'sampling.'""  13           U.S.C.  195.  The second provision is Section 141(a), which authorizes the Secretary to ""take a decennial census of population . . . in such form and content as he may determine, including the use of sampling procedures and special surveys.""  13 U.S.C.  141(a).  The ambiguity that called for a reference to the history of the Act was whether the ""broad grant of authority given in  141(a)"" is limited by ""the narrower and more specific  195.""  525 U.S. at 338.  The Court held that it is so limited, after it ""look[ed] to the remainder of the law to determine what portions of the decennial census the authorization [in  141(a)] covers.""   Id .             Accordingly, the Court's historical analysis focused not on whether the Census Bureau had ever used statistical sampling in the apportionment count, but instead on whether the history of the Census Act itself supported a reading of section 141(a) that would allow the Bureau to override the express command of Section 195.  Because the Court found that Congress had long eschewed statistical methods in the apportionment count, it rejected this broader reading of  141.               The point of the historical inquiry, then, was not to discern whether the Census Bureau had ever attempted to arrogate to itself the power to implement statistical methods of estimation in the apportionment count, but only to determine whether  Congress  had ever authorized such methods for that purpose.  Because the relevant history indicated that for ""over 200 years . . . federal statutes have prohibited the use of statistical sampling where apportionment is concerned,"" the Court held that ""there is only one plausible reading of the amended  195:  It prohibits the use of sampling in calculating the population for purposes of apportionment.""   Id . at 339-40.            17.   It is also undisputed that the number of persons imputed in households not known even to exist was alone sufficient to deprive Utah of its fourth member of the House of Representatives.   See  SUF  47.  Thus, if imputation as to such ""phantom"" households is deemed to fall short of the constitutional requirement of an ""actual enumeration,"" that finding alone would entitle Plaintiffs to judgment as a matter of law.            18. By the same token, the use of imputation also accords substantial discretion to local governmental officials, who may increase the number of persons imputed within their jurisdiction by providing misleading and difficult-to-verify information to the Census Bureau in connection with the local update of the Master Address File.   See  SUF  42.             19. In this country, Thomas Jefferson and others had derived estimates of the populations of various states prior to the ratification of the Constitution.   See  H.           Alterman,  Counting People:  The Census in History 168-70  (1969).  Jefferson did so ""based upon limited data and specific demographic assumptions"" and made an estimate that ""is thought to have been accurate by a margin of one-to-two percent.""   House of Representatives , 525 U.S. at 348           (Scalia, J., concurring) (citing Alterman).            Methods of estimation did not originate with Jefferson, however.  In 1662, John           Graunt--sometimes referred to as the father of statistical sampling--published the first population estimate of London based on statistical analysis.   See  Philip           Kraeger, ""New Light on Graunt,"" Population Studies,  Journal of Demography , Vol. 42, No. 1 (Mar. 1988), at 132-34 (explaining that Graunt's ""estimate"" of the ""total population of London"" involved ""a great many guesses,"" but was based on ""a series of observations"" and ""rules for calculating probabilities of long life, and the distribution of deaths"").  More than a century later, ""[i]n 1753, Thomas Potter introduced a bill in Parliament providing for a general enumeration."" A.B. Wolfe,  Journal of the American Statistical Association , Vol. 27 (Dec. 1932), at 368.  At about this same time, a Frenchman by the name of LaPlace proposed a method of estimating the population in France by ""carefully enumerating at a given time, the inhabitants of several communities"" and then by extrapolating the actual enumeration of these communities to ""the entire country.""  Stephen M. Stigler,  The History of Statistics--The Measurement of Uncertainty before 1990  (1986), at 163-64.  This approach initially was lauded for ""its potential for great saving of time and effort at little or no cost in accuracy,""  id . at 164, but within a few years it was rejected on the ground that ""there is only one way of attaining exact knowledge of the population and the elements of which it is composed, and that is an  actual  and complete census, the formation of a register of the names of all inhabitants, together with their ages and professions,""  id . at 165.              Thus, the distinction between an ""estimate"" and an ""actual enumeration"" was well known in England and elsewhere in Europe for more than a century before the ratification of the Constitution.  The Constitution expressly requires the latter, and thus can only be construed to eschew estimates and to require an actual count.            20.   See Art. I,  2, Cl. 3 (allocating specific numbers of representatives to the several states ""until [the] enumeration"" to be conducted ""within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States"").            21. This is not the only evidence of Defendants' cavalier disregard for Congress' instructions.  To facilitate both congressional and judicial oversight of Defendants' compliance with the statutory mandate to exclude statistical sampling from the apportionment count, Congress directed the Bureau to publish--at specified times and for all geographic levels--""the number of persons enumerated without using statistical methods.""  Pub. L. No. 105-119, 1997 H.R. 2267, 111 Stat 2440, 2483.  The records produced by Defendants demonstrate that the Bureau failed to comply with Congress' instruction because it failed to publish data separating the number of persons actually ""enumerated without using statistical methods"" from the number of persons estimated under the ""statistical method"" of imputation.  Moreover, the Bureau's December 2000 report to Congress on the conduct of the census makes no mention of the Bureau's continued use of imputation--further underscoring Defendants' failure to rationally analyze whether is it proper to supplement the apportionment count with imputed persons following the Court's decision in            House of Representatives .

GX238-88-10619545	"American FactFinder: Disclosure Limitation for the Advanced Query System Sam Hawala Laura Zayatz Sandra Rowland Paper to appear in the Journal of Official Statistics  Key words: Confidentiality; Remote Access; Online query; Microdata; U.S. Census Bureau Data Abstract American Fact Finder is the United States Census Bureau's new online data dissemination system that accesses data from the 1990 Decennial Census, the American Community Survey, the 1997 Economic Census, and Census 2000. Most of the data files accessed are summary files with matrices of aggregated data. An additional capability developed as a separate system, the Advanced Query System, is the production of tabulations from a query of the Census 2000 microdata files. The dissemination of tabulations online from a query of the microdata files requires special techniques for disclosure limitation. These techniques, described in this paper, are applied to Census 2000 microdata files and the Advanced Query System.  ______________________________________________________________ This paper reports the results of research and analysis undertaken by U.S. Census Bureau staff. It has undergone a Census Bureau review more limited in scope than that given to official Census Bureau publications. This report is released to inform interested parties of ongoing research and to encourage discussion of work in progress.  1   1. Introduction Statistical agencies often collect data under a promise of confidentiality to their respondents. At the same time, they are required to publish as much high quality statistical information as possible. Therefore they must develop  methods for providing access to statistical data while limiting the risk of disclosure of confidential information. Remote access is one such method (Blakemore, 2001). It involves providing access to the data over secure  electronic lines to dedicated computers and/or electronic access to databases previously subjected to statistical disclosure limitation techniques. Advanced Query System is a remote access system. The  The U.S. Census Bureau is the pre-eminent collector and provider of timely, relevant, and quality data about the people and economy of the United States. In more than 100 surveys annually and 3 censuses a decade, evolving from the first census in 1790, the Census Bureau provides official information about America's people, businesses, industries and institutions. The Census Bureau guarantees the confidentiality of individual responses for persons for 72 years, as required by federal law (Title 13, Section 9 of the U.S. Code.) The cooperation of citizens, enterprises and other respondents in providing appropriate data needed for necessary statistical compilations largely depends on the Census Bureau achieving a balance between protecting individual confidentiality and allowing distribution of information in a useful and timely manner. To insure that any data accessible to external users - those outside the  2   Census Bureau - will not disclose information on individuals or entities, the Census Bureau has developed a set of automated disclosure limitation techniques. The purpose of this document is to describe these disclosure limitation techniques for the Advanced Query System.  2. The American FactFinder System Many of the data products released by the Census Bureau are in the form of tables that show details for Census blocks. Census blocks, averaging 34 people each, are the smallest geographic area for which the Bureau collects and tabulates decennial census data. The data, that the Census Bureau attempts to collect from one hundred percent of the population through what we call ""short form"" questionnaires, consist of characteristics such as sex, age, Hispanic/NonHispanic, race, relationship to householder, and tenure (owner or renter.)  Approximately a one in six sample of the population receives the long census form, which, in addition to the short form information, collects information on characteristics such as marital status, school attendance and grade level, ancestry, language, place of birth, citizenship, military service, income, industry, and occupation. The reader can find the long form questionnaire in Appendix D of the documentation at http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/doc/pums.pdf. The sample data are also published in the form of tables, some of which are at the block group level. More detailed tables are published at the tract level. The average block group contains 1348 people. Tracts are statistical  3   subdivisions of counties delineated by local committees of census data users in accordance with Census Bureau guidelines for the purpose of collecting and presenting decennial census data. These neighborhoods contain between 1,000 and 8,000 people, or on average, typically 1,700 housing units and 4,300 people. Tracts are designed to have homogeneous population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions at the time they are established. There were more than 60,000 census tracts in 2000.  With the proliferation of inexpensive and powerful computer systems and storage it became clear that some research goals could best be met only if the data were in microdata form. That is, disaggregated data at the respondent level. In 1963 the first public use microdata files were generated from a sample of the 1960 decennial census and released to the public. Public use microdata samples contain individual records of responses to questionnaires with unique identifiers (names, addresses, etc.) removed so that the confidentiality of respondents is protected.  Taking part in a government initiative aiming to make government more efficient and accessible to the public, the Census Bureau announced, in October 1998, the new Internet data-delivery system that significantly expands users access to the agency's vast data resources. This new system complements the Census Bureau's existing Internet site by giving the public online access for the first time to the Census Bureau's largest data sets. The new system is referred to as ""American FactFinder"" (AFF). It was built under  4   contract with the Census Bureau by IBM Global Services Corp., principal contractor, responsible for systems integration and user-interface design.  The first data released via AFF were preliminary reports from the 1997 Economic Census, 1990 Census of Population and Housing files, American Community Survey test and demonstration data and results of the Census 2000 Dress Rehearsal conducted in 1998. The full range of Census 2000 data products started becoming available via AFF beginning in January 2001, with the release of the state population totals to reapportion the U.S. House of Representatives' 435 memberships among the 50 states. The Census Bureau released the redistricting population data at the census block level on a stateby-state basis during March 2001. Redistricting is the process of revising the geographic boundaries of areas from which people elect representatives to the U.S. House of Representatives, a state legislature, a county or city council, a school board, and so forth.  The Advanced Query System allows users to select a population universe, geographic areas and variables for tabulations that previously were not standard at the Census Bureau. Some limits, described in this paper, are imposed on these non-standard tabulations. Nonstandard tabulations, in particular tabulations for small geographic areas can introduce a risk of disclosure of individual information. Threats of disclosure to individual information may affect people's willingness to cooperate with the censuses and surveys conducted by the Census Bureau. The Census Bureau has  5   devoted considerable staff resources to develop procedures to protect confidential data. The research and development of the disclosure limitation rules and techniques, which are presented in this paper, are part of the Census Bureau's efforts in maintaining the commitment to respondents'  confidentiality.  3. Disclosure Limitation Rules and Techniques Through AFF, and within the limits of the data provided, the public is able to obtain summarized data from Census 2000 over the Internet. Data are provided in table format, displayed back to the user, and in the softcopy file equivalent of the table. The Census Bureau publishes some basic tables in PDF format providing some national and state demographic profiles. These products are called ""Tier 1 data"" products. An example of a Tier 1 table is given in Figure 1. Data products such as redistricting data used for voting purposes, as well as more than 300 other predefined table shells from the short form decennial data and over 800 tables from the long-form decennial data, from which the user can select, are referred to as ""Tier 2 data."" An example of a Tier 2 table is given in Figure 2. The data feeding the predefined tables are obtained from decennial summary files that are edited by the Bureau after the decennial data collection phase is complete.  When external users define their own tabulations, in the Advanced Query System, the resulting tabulated output is referred to as ""Tier 3 data."" In Tier 3, the data feeding the tables are microdata files of individual persons and  6   households. To insure that any data tabulation requested by external users will not disclose respondents' identities, the Census Bureau uses data recoding and data swapping (Zayatz, 2003) for both Tier 2 and Tier 3 data. The Census Bureau's Disclosure Review Board has already approved all the table formats in Tier 2. Tabulated data from Tier 3 will be provided only if the table request passes automatic filters with the disclosure limitation rules described in this paper.  3.1 Data Recoding Variables such as detailed race, age, occupation, industry, Hispanic origin and group quarters are re-coded, i.e., some sparse categories are combined to show less detail. For instance single years of age are combined into a short list: (Under 1 year, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years, 6 years, 7 years, 8 years, 9 years, 10 years, 11 years, 12 years, 13 years, 14 years, 15 years, 16 years, 17 years, 18 years, 19 years, 20 years, 21 years, 22 to 24 years, 25 to 29 years, 30 to 34 years, 35 to 39 years, 40 to 44 years, 45 to 49 years, 50 to 54 years, 55 to 59 years, 60 and 61 years, 62 to 64 years, 65 and 66 years, 67 to 69 years, 70 to 74 years, 75 to 79 years, 80 to 84 years, 85 years and over.)  All continuous variables, such as household/family income, individual income types, cost of electricity, gas, water, and fuel, property taxes, mortgage payments and gross rent, are top-coded. Top-coding is used to mask outlying values in the tails of distributions of continuous variables. For example, we would never show an income value of one million dollars. Instead we may set  7   a top-code for income of $150,000 and make the highest category shown for income $150,000 or more. There are no hard and fast rules for determining which cutoffs to use in top-coding. Decisions should be based on examination of the structure of the distribution, in combination with other key variables like race, gender, etc. For example one may top-code the top 5% of the nonzero values.  Re-coded variables are added to the files used by both American FactFinder and the Advanced Query System. In the Advanced Query System re-coded variables are accessed according to the query and who is making the query. Internal Census Bureau users may use all of the variables and geographic areas, as required by their work. External users are diverted to re-coded variables and geographic areas of a certain size depending on confidentiality issues such as: < < the population universe, geography and variables requested the rules and population thresholds the Census Bureau requires for the tabulation as a whole and the cells in the tabulation to meet confidentiality requirements.  3.2 Data Swapping A swapping technique was used for the 1990 Census of Population and Housing. A modified version of this technique was used for the Census 2000 one hundred percent (short form) data and independently for the Census 2000 sample (long form) data. The technique consists of swapping pairs of  8   household records selected as having the greatest disclosure risk of being reidentified. In particular, records that are unique with respect to a set of variables are marked for swapping.  The variables that make a record unique are referred to as key variables. A record will be selected for swapping with a probability inversely proportional to block size. Records of households with unique race categories in the block will have an increased probability of being swapped. The swapped records match on a set of demographic characteristics but are in different census blocks, for the hundred percent (short form) data and in different block groups for the sample (long form) data. The list of variables used to find the unique records and the list of variables used to find partnering households are both confidential. The majority of the variables were swapped, but a few that were tied to the geography and the housing unit were held fixed. For example, travel time to work and place of work for a household might not make sense if swapped with a household geographically far away.  Both AFF and the Advanced Query System use the swapped data files as input. All tables publicly released (on paper, on tape, through AFF, etc.) to anyone outside the Census Bureau are generated from the swapped data files.  3.3 Advanced Query Technology Through the Advanced Query (AQ) system, the user can obtain very specific data for very specific geographic areas. Therefore, the AQ system is  9   configured to permit web-service requests which originate on only the AQ external server, and which terminate on the AQ internal server. Communication from any other external machine to the internal server is blocked by two firewalls. Any request for Tier 3 data from an external user is routed through the first firewall to the first server that contains the Query Processor as shown in the illustration. By definition, there is no confidential data sent along this path. The external server receives requests for tabulations, which require confidential data, and re-transmits them over the path through the second firewall to the second server that contains the Query Controller. Again, no confidential information is sent along this path. No traffic from the Internet can talk to the Internal Server because the firewall permits communication only between the two AQ servers. Completed tabulations are routed back through the Query Controller, which calculates the statistical results filter and sends the tabulations back to the user only if they pass the filters. If a table does not pass the filters, the user simply does not receive the table. There is no use of cell suppression. The entire table is suppressed, and a message is sent to the user saying that the table is suppressed for confidentiality reasons. The user can then request a table with less detail than the original. We discuss next the disclosure limitation rules designed for the AQ system. The rules are implemented as a pair of filters. There are two filters: the Query filter and the Statistical Results filter.  10   Presentation Services Census Firewall Census Firewall  Business Services  Data Services  Step 1  Query Query Filter Filter  Internet Internet Users Users  HTML HTML Query Query Processor Processor  Query Query Controller Controller  Query Query Controller Controller Statistical Statistical Results Results Filter Filter Step 2  Query Query Execution Execution Data Base  The Advanced Query System 3.3.1 Query Filter The purpose of the query filter is to detect those queries that will not pass disclosure limitation before they are submitted for execution. This saves the Tier 3 system resources and saves time for external users by telling them relatively quickly whether or not their query has a chance to pass disclosure limitation rules. < Cross-tabulations must be created from a Census Bureau's predefined list of geographic areas and non-geographic variables. < The smallest allowed geographic areas are block-groups for one hundred percent (short form) data and tracts for sample (long form) data. < < The query's geographic variable must meet a minimum threshold. The system determines if the query requests small areas, block-groups or user-defined geography with a population size that is less than  11   average tract size (population of less than 4,300), medium areas (population of 4,300 to 99,999) or large areas (population of 100,000 or more.) < According to the population size of the area or areas requested, the system permits the use of appropriate combinations of short, medium or long lists of predefined categories of race, Hispanic origin, group quarters and other sample variables in the cross tabulation. Only topcoded variables may be accessed. < The maximum number of variables used to create an overall table is three, excluding the geographic variable and the universe. < Depending on the cross-tabulation variables, the user must select from a list of derived measures possible (means, medians, ...) to be reported within a cell. < Derived measures are provided only if the corresponding counts are provided. If a query passes all the disclosure limitation rules for the query filter, the query is passed through the query controllers to the microdata files for computation. The microdata files contain all of the predefined categories for race, Hispanic origin, group-quarters and modified sample data variables.  3.3.2 The Statistical Results Filter The results filter provides a final check on the values in the cells of the resulting table. The filter is designed to prevent the passage of tables that are very sparse, i.e. with more than a majority of the cells having a 0 or a 1. It  12   serves as a reminder here that many of the predefined tables still contain cell values of 1, and for those we rely on the data swapping procedure to protect respondents from being re-identified. < When geographic sub-tables are requested in the query, the disclosure limitation rules are checked separately for each geographic area corresponding to the geographic sub-table -, as if the user had submitted separate queries, one for each geographic area. < The median cell size in a requested table cannot be less than a parameter set by the Bureau. < The mean cell size in a requested table cannot be less than a parameter set by the Bureau. < The ratio of the number of cells with an unweighted count equal to one (note that all sample data tables are weighted) to the total number of cells in a requested table cannot be more than a parameter set by the Bureau. < When a user defines re-codes for a query, the AQ system first computes the results as if no re-codes had been requested, and checks these results against the disclosure limitation rules. Following that, if the results satisfy the rules, they are aggregated to reflect the re-codes requested.  The parameters used in the results filter are confidential. They were chosen to allow approximately the same amount of detail available in Tier 2 data products.  13   4. Testing and Current Status  The Census Bureau hired statistical disclosure limitation experts at Carnegie Mellon University to test the system (Duncan, 2000). They found the confidentiality protections currently in place to be ""thoughtful and comprehensive, and substantially consistent with best practice."" The Bureau also hired a contractor to conduct a Beta Test for utility with a large set of users of decennial census tabular data products (Schneider, 2002). She  reported, ""Of critical importance is the fact that the AQ system provided useful results. About 90 percent of the tabulations attempted either fully or partially met the intended objective. Testers expressed some frustration with the confidentiality filters but the filters did not seem to be a significant impediment to obtaining usable results.""  In testing the system, we found that the requirement for a minimum mean cell size in the results filter was superfluous. That is, whenever this requirement was not met, one (or more) of the other requirements was also not met. Thus this requirement will be removed from the system.  Currently only the Beta Testers, the State Data Centers, and the Census Information Centers have access to the Advanced Query System. These users have extensive experience using U.S. decennial census data. They are familiar with the geographic summary levels and demographic characteristics used in  14   the U.S. Census Summary Files produced for U.S. Census 2000. Before using the system, users are encouraged to first review the extensive Census 2000 summary tabulations provided in American FactFinder (factfinder.census.gov) and on CD-ROM. If the tabulations do not satisfy users' needs, then the use of the AQ system is appropriate.  There are concerns that if the system is opened up to the general public, the volume of queries might overload and shut down the system. The Bureau may expand the list of users, but no formal plan has been developed at this time. Also, currently, the system is free.  There is continuous use of the system (8:00am  8:00pm, Monday  Friday). Each day the list of external users is captured along with the counts of tabulations they submitted and those that were not returned due to the confidentiality filters. Due to limited resources, system managers have not yet been able to analyze these logs of current uses, but they plan to in the near future. The overhead is mainly following up on the user feedback and  resetting forgotten passwords. Also, system managers are monitoring the way queries are being formulated by the SQL engine and adjusting the system to run better.  Current users seem very pleased with the system. When it was recently temporarily shut down for modification, we received numerous complaints and requests to get it running again as soon as possible.  15   The Advanced Query System has proven to be a very valuable tool for data users, and one that employs good disclosure limitation techniques to protect the confidentiality of Census Bureau data.  5.

Kelter        O nce every 10 years, the U.S. Bureau of the Census  undertakes the constitutionally mandated Census of Population and Housing for apportioning  of the House of Representatives. This decennial census is designed to collect demographic  data about all persons living in the United States, Puerto Rico and the island areas. 1    In addition to Congressional redistricting, census figures are used for redistricting State  legislatures and for distributing Federal funds for schools, housing assistance, highway  construction, and programs for the elderly. 2   Because of its magnitude, the decennial census  requires years of planning and thousands of employees to accomplish. For this reason, employment  levels in the Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey, particularly  in certain industries, are affected—both in the actual year in which the census is conducted and,  to a lesser degree, up to 21 months prior to the census. Hiring for the census is reflected in  data for Federal Government, except Postal Service, as well as in the aggregate, total nonfarm  employment. 3   Detailing the amount of census effect within the CES data is essential to understanding  the underlying employment trends in the affected industries.

Related term:   County and equivalent entity     Part  When appearing in parenthesis after a geographic name, such as ""Houston city (part)"", this term indicates that only a portion of the named geography is represented.  The full name reveals the geographic context which produced the part, such as ""Houston city (part), Harris County, Texas"", indicating that the only the portion of Houston city within Harris County is represented.    Parts can result when two or more geographic types that do not have a hierarchical relationship (e.g., county and place) are crossed against each other to produce a new geographic type.  That new geographic type contains the phrase ""(or part)"" to indicate the crossing of hierarchies (e.g., State-County-Place (or part))     People in family  Total number of people living in one household and related to the householder.    Related terms:  Family ,  Household     People in household  Total number of people living in one housing unit.    Related terms:   Household ,  Housing unit     Per capita income  Average obtained by dividing aggregate income by total population of an area.     Percentage  This measure is calculated by taking the number of items in a group possessing a characteristic of interest and dividing by the total number of items in that group, and then multiplying by 100.    Related term:   Derived measures     Period of military service  These periods represent officially recognized time divisions relating to wars or to legally-relevant peacetime eras.  The data pertain to active-duty military service.  In most tabulations of these data, people serving in combinations of wartime and peacetime periods are classified in their most recent wartime period.    Related term:   Veteran status     PHC-1 tables  These are Census 2000 Summary Population and Housing Characteristics tables, a publication series which includes information on the 100-percent population and housing subjects.  The data are available for the United States, regions, divisions, states, counties, county subdivisions, places, metropolitan areas, urbanized areas, American Indian and Alaska Native areas, and Hawaiian homelands.  The series is comparable to the 1990 CPH-1 report series, Summary Population and Housing Characteristics.  The series is available in printed form and on the Internet in PDF format.     Place  A concentration of population either legally bounded as an incorporated place, or identified as a Census Designated Place (CDP) including comunidades and zonas urbanas in Puerto Rico. Incorporated places have legal descriptions of borough (except in Alaska and New York), city, town (except in New England, New York, and Wisconsin), or village.    Related terms:   Census designated place (CDP) ,  City ,  Comunidad ,  Incorporated place ,  Town ,  Zona urbana     Place of birth  The U. S. state or foreign country where a person was born.

Population  All people, male and female, child and adult, living in a given geographic area.    Related terms:   Apportionment population , Resident population     Population density  Total population or number of housing units within a geographic entity (for example, United States, state, county, place) divided by the land area of that entity measured in square kilometers or square miles.  Density is expressed as both ""people (or housing units) per square kilometer"" and ""people (or housing units) per square mile"" of land area.     Portable Document File (PDF)  A type of computer file that looks the same on the screen and in print, regardless of what kind of computer or printer is being used, and what kind of software package was originally used to create it.    Most American FactFinder technical documentation is available in PDF format.     Poverty  Following the Office of Management and Budgets (OMBs) Directive 14, the Census Bureau uses a set of money income thresholds that vary by family size and composition to detect who is poor.  If the total income for a family or unrelated individual falls below the relevant poverty threshold, then the family or unrelated individual is classified as being ""below the poverty level.""    Related term:   Income     Primary metropolitan statistical area (PMSA)  A geographic entity defined by the federal Office of Management and Budget for use by federal statistical agencies. If an area meets the requirements to qualify as a metropolitan statistical area and has a population of one million or more, two or more PMSAs may be defined within it if statistical criteria are met and local opinion is in favor. A PMSA consists of one or more counties  (county subdivisions in New England) that have substantial commuting interchange. When two or more PMSAs have been recognized, the larger area of which they are components then is designated a consolidated metropolitan statistical area.    Related terms:   Consolidated metropolitan statistical area (CMSA) ,  Metropolitan statistical area (MSA)     Privacy Act  A 1974 act that places restrictions on the collection, use, maintenance, and release of information about individuals.

Products  This term is used in two ways in FactFinder:    - to refer to data products produced by the Census Bureau which present statistics and/or maps about the subjects covered in the various censuses and surveys conducted by the Bureau.  These products can be in a variety of media: printed reports, CD-ROM, DVD, or on the internet;    - to refer to the products produced by manufacturing or mining, as well as retail and wholesale trade industries in the context of the1997 economic census.     Public Law 103-430   (P.L. 103-430)  The public law that amends Title 13, U.S. Code, to allow designated local and tribal officials access to the address information in the master address file to verify its accuracy and completeness.  This law also requires the U.S. Postal Service to provide its address information to the Census Bureau to improve the master address file.    Related term:   Census (decennial)     Public Law 105-119   (P.L. 105-119)  A law enacted in 1997 which requires the Census Bureau to make publicly available a second version of decennial census data that does not include statistical correction for overcounts and undercounts measured in the Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation.    Related terms:   Apportionment ,  Census (decennial) ,  Reapportionment ,  Redistricting     Public Law 94-171     (P.L. 94-171)  Public Law (P.L.) 94-171, enacted in 1975, directs the Census Bureau to make special preparations to provide redistricting data needed by the fifty states. Within a year following Census Day, the Census Bureau must send the data agreed upon to redraw districts for the state legislature to each state's governor and majority and minority legislative leaders.    To meet this legal requirement, the Census Bureau set up a voluntary program that enables participating states to receive data for voting districts (e.g., election precincts, wards, state house and senate districts) in addition to standard census geographic areas such as counties, cities, census tracts, and blocks.    Related terms:  Apportionment ,  Census (decennial) ,  Census day ,  Reapportionment ,  Redistricting     Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA)  An area that defines the extent of territory for which the Census Bureau tabulates public use microdata sample (PUMS) data.

SUMMARY:           By this Notice, OMB is announcing its decision concerning the revision          of Statistical Policy Directive No. 15, Race and Ethnic Standards for          Federal Statistics and Administrative Reporting. OMB is accepting the          recommendations of the Interagency Committee for the Review of the Racial          and Ethnic Standards with the following two modifications: (1) the Asian          or Pacific Islander category will be separated into two categories --          ""Asian"" and ""Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,"" and (2) the term          ""Hispanic"" will be changed to ""Hispanic or Latino.""           The revised          standards will have five minimum categories for data on race: American          Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian          or Other Pacific Islander, and White. There will be two categories for          data on ethnicity: ""Hispanic or Latino"" and ""Not Hispanic or Latino.""                    The Supplementary          Information in this Notice provides background information on the standards          (Section A); a summary of the comprehensive review process that began          in July 1993 (Section B); a brief synopsis of the public comments OMB          received on the recommendations for changes to the standards in response          to the July 9, 1997,  Federal Register  Notice (Section C); OMB's          decisions on the specific recommendations of the Interagency Committee          (Section D); and information on the work that is underway on tabulation          issues associated with the reporting of multiple race responses (Section          E).           The revised          standards for the classification of Federal data on race and ethnicity          are presented at the end of this notice; they replace and supersede Statistical          Policy Directive No. 15.           EFFECTIVE          DATE:  The new standards will be used by the Bureau of the Census          in the 2000 decennial census. Other Federal programs should adopt the          standards as soon as possible, but not later than January 1, 2003, for          use in household surveys, administrative forms and records, and other          data collections. In addition, OMB has approved the use of the new standards          by the Bureau of the Census in the ""Dress Rehearsal"" for Census 2000 scheduled          to be conducted in March 1998.

SUPPLEMENTARY          INFORMATION:            A.          Background            For more          than 20 years, the current standards in OMB's Statistical Policy Directive          No. 15 have provided a common language to promote uniformity and comparability          for data on race and ethnicity for the population groups specified in          the Directive. They were developed in cooperation with Federal agencies          to provide consistent data on race and ethnicity throughout the Federal          Government. Development of the data standards stemmed in large measure          from new responsibilities to enforce civil rights laws. Data were needed          to monitor equal access in housing, education, employment, and other areas,          for populations that historically had experienced discrimination and differential          treatment because of their race or ethnicity. The standards are used not          only in the decennial census (which provides the data for the ""denominator""          for many measures), but also in household surveys, on administrative forms          (e.g., school registration and mortgage lending applications), and in          medical and other research. The categories represent a social-political          construct designed for collecting data on the race and ethnicity of broad          population groups in this country, and are not anthropologically or scientifically          based.           B.          Comprehensive Review Process            Particularly          since the 1990 census, the standards have come under increasing criticism          from those who believe that the minimum categories set forth in Directive          No. 15 do not reflect the increasing diversity of our Nation's population          that has resulted primarily from growth in immigration and in interracial          marriages. In response to the criticisms, OMB announced in July 1993 that          it would undertake a comprehensive review of the current categories for          data on race and ethnicity.           This review          has been conducted over the last four years in collaboration with the          Interagency Committee for the Review of the Racial and Ethnic Standards,          which OMB established in March 1994 to facilitate the participation of          Federal agencies in the review. The members of the Interagency Committee,          from more than 30 agencies, represent the many and diverse Federal needs          for data on race and ethnicity, including statutory requirements for such          data. The Interagency Committee developed the following principles to          govern the review process:           1. The racial          and ethnic categories set forth in the standards should not be interpreted          as being primarily biological or genetic in reference. Race and ethnicity          may be thought of in terms of social and cultural characteristics as well          as ancestry.           2. Respect          for individual dignity should guide the processes and methods for collecting          data on race and ethnicity; ideally, respondent self-identification should          be facilitated to the greatest extent possible, recognizing that in some          data collection systems observer identification is more practical.           3. To the          extent practicable, the concepts and terminology should reflect clear          and generally understood definitions that can achieve broad public acceptance.          To assure they are reliable, meaningful, and understood by respondents          and observers, the racial and ethnic categories set forth in the standard          should be developed using appropriate scientific methodologies, including          the social sciences.           4. The racial          and ethnic categories should be comprehensive in coverage and produce          compatible, nonduplicative, exchangeable data across Federal agencies.                    5. Foremost          consideration should be given to data aggregations by race and ethnicity          that are useful for statistical analysis and program administration and          assessment, bearing in mind that the standards are not intended to be          used to establish eligibility for participation in any federal program.                    6. The standards          should be developed to meet, at a minimum, Federal legislative and programmatic          requirements. Consideration should also be given to needs at the State          and local government levels, including American Indian tribal and Alaska          Native village governments, as well as to general societal needs for these          data.           7. The categories          should set forth a minimum standard; additional categories should be permitted          provided they can be aggregated to the standard categories. The number          of standard categories should be kept to a manageable size, determined          by statistical concerns and data needs.           8. A revised          set of categories should be operationally feasible in terms of burden          placed upon respondents; public and private costs to implement the revisions          should be a factor in the decision.           9. Any changes          in the categories should be based on sound methodological research and          should include evaluations of the impact of any changes not only on the          usefulness of the resulting data but also on the comparability of any          new categories with the existing ones.           10. Any revision          to the categories should provide for a crosswalk at the time of adoption          between the old and the new categories so that historical data series          can be statistically adjusted and comparisons can be made.           11. Because          of the many and varied needs and strong interdependence of Federal agencies          for racial and ethnic data, any changes to the existing categories should          be the product of an interagency collaborative effort.           12. Time          will be allowed to phase in any new categories. Agencies will not be required          to update historical records.           13. The new          directive should be applicable throughout the U.S. Federal statistical          system. The standard or standards must be usable for the decennial census,          current surveys, and administrative records, including those using observer          identification.           The principal          objective of the review has been to enhance the accuracy of the demographic          information collected by the Federal Government. The starting point for          the review was the minimum set of categories for data on race and ethnicity          that have provided information for more than 20 years for a variety of          purposes, and the recognition of the importance of being able to maintain          this historical continuity. The review process has had two major elements:          (1) public comment on the present standards, which helped to identify          concerns and provided numerous suggestions for changing the standards;          and (2) research and testing related to assessing the possible effects          of suggested changes on the quality and usefulness of the resulting data.                    Public input,          the first element of the review process, was sought through a variety          of means: (1) During 1993, Congressman Thomas C. Sawyer, then Chairman          of the House Subcommittee on Census, Statistics, and Postal Personnel,          held four hearings that included 27 witnesses, focusing particularly on          the use of the categories in the 2000 census. (2) At the request of OMB,          the National Academy of Sciences' Committee on National Statistics (CNSTAT)          conducted a workshop in February 1994 to articulate issues surrounding          a review of the categories. The workshop included representatives of Federal          agencies, academia, social science research institutions, interest groups,          private industry, and a local school district. (A summary of the workshop,           Spotlight on Heterogeneity: The Federal Standards for Racial and Ethnic          Classification , is available from CNSTAT, 2101 Constitution Avenue,          N.W., Washington, D.C. 20418.) (3) On June 9, 1994, OMB published a  Federal Register  (59 FR 29831-29835) Notice that contained background information          on the development of the current standards and requested public comment          on: the adequacy of current racial and ethnic categories; the principles          that should govern any proposed revisions to the standards; and specific          suggestions for change that had been offered by individuals and interested          groups over a period of several years. In response, OMB received nearly          800 letters. As part of this comment period and to bring the review closer          to the public, OMB also heard testimony from 94 witnesses at hearings          held during July 1994 in Boston, Denver, San Francisco, and Honolulu.          (4) In an August 28, 1995,  Federal Register  (60 FR 44674-44693)          Notice, OMB provided an interim report on the review process, including          a summary of the comments on the June 1994  Federal Register  Notice,          and offered a final opportunity for comment on the research to be conducted          during 1996. (5) OMB staff have also discussed the review process with          various interested groups and have made presentations at numerous meetings.                    The second          element of the review process involved research and testing of various          proposed changes. The categories in OMB's Directive No. 15 are used not          only to produce data on the demographic characteristics of the population,          but also to monitor civil rights enforcement and program implementation.          Research was undertaken to provide an objective assessment of the data          quality issues associated with various approaches to collecting data on          race and ethnicity. To that end, the Interagency Committee's Research          Working Group, co-chaired by the Bureau of the Census and the Bureau of          Labor Statistics, reviewed the various criticisms and suggestions for          changing the current categories, and developed a research agenda for some          of the more significant issues that had been identified. These issues          included how to collect data on persons who identify themselves as ""multiracial"";          whether to combine race and Hispanic origin in one question or have separate          questions on race and Hispanic origin; whether to combine the concepts          of race, ethnicity, and ancestry; whether to change the terminology used          for particular categories; and whether to add new categories to the current          minimum set.           Because the          mode of data collection can have an effect on how a person responds, the          research agenda proposed studies both in surveys using in-person or telephone          interviews and in self-administered questionnaires, such as the decennial          census, which are filled out by the respondent and mailed back. Cognitive          interviews were conducted with various groups to provide guidance on the          wording of the questions and the instructions for the tests and studies.                    The research          agenda included several major national tests, the results of which are          discussed throughout the Interagency Committee's  Report to the Office          of Management and Budget on the Review of Statistical Policy Directive          No. 15 : (1) In May 1995, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) sponsored          a Supplement on Race and Ethnicity to the Current Population Survey (CPS).          The findings were made available in a 1996 report,  Testing Methods          of Collecting Racial and Ethnic Information: Results of the Current Population          Survey Supplement on Race and Ethnicity , available from BLS, 2 Massachusetts          Avenue, N.E., Room 4915, Postal Square Building, Washington, D.C. 20212,          or by calling 202-606-7375. The results were also summarized in an October          26, 1995, news release, which is available electronically at << http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/ethnic.toc.htm >>.          (2) The Bureau of the Census, as part of its research for the 2000 census,          tested alternative approaches to collecting data on race and ethnicity          in the March 1996 National Content Survey (NCS). The Census Bureau published          the results in a December 1996 report,  Findings on Questions on Race          and Hispanic Origin Tested in the 1996 National Content Survey ; highlights          of the report are available at << http://www.census.gov/population/www/socdemo/96natcontentsurvey.html >>.          (3) In June 1996, the Census Bureau conducted the Race and Ethnic Targeted          Test (RAETT), which was designed to permit assessments of the effects          of possible changes on smaller populations not reliably measured in national          samples, including American Indians, Alaska Natives, detailed Asian and          Pacific Islander groups (such as Chinese and Hawaiians), and detailed          Hispanic groups (such as Puerto Ricans and Cubans). The Census Bureau          released the results in a May 1997 report,  Results of the 1996 Race          and Ethnic Targeted Test ; highlights of the report are available at          << http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0018.html >>.          Single copies (paper) of the NCS and RAETT reports may be obtained from          the Population Division, U.S. Bureau of the Census, Washington, D.C. 20233;          telephone 301-457-2402.           In addition          to these three major tests, the National Center for Education Statistics          (NCES) and the Office for Civil Rights in the Department of Education          jointly conducted a survey of 1,000 public schools to determine how schools          collect data on the race and ethnicity of their students and how the administrative          records containing these data are maintained to meet statutory requirements          for reporting aggregate information to the Federal Government. NCES published          the results in a March 1996 report,  Racial and Ethnic Classifications          Used by Public Schools  (NCES 96-092). The report is available electronically          at << http://nces.ed.gov/pubs/96092.html >>.          Single paper copies may be obtained from NCES, 555 New Jersey, NW, Washington,          D.C. 20208-5574, or by calling 202-219-1442.           The research          agenda also included studies conducted by the National Center for Health          Statistics, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, and the          Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to evaluate the procedures          used and the quality of the information on race and ethnicity in administrative          records such as that reported on birth certificates and recorded on death          certificates.           On July 9,          1997, OMB published a  Federal Register  Notice (62 FR 36874 - 36946)          containing the Interagency Committee's  Report to the Office of Management          and Budget on the Review of Statistical Policy Directive No. 15 . The          Notice made available for comment the Interagency Committee's recommendations          for how OMB should revise Directive No. 15. The report consists of six          chapters. Chapter 1 provides a brief history of Directive No. 15, a summary          of the issues considered by the Interagency Committee, a review of the          research activities, and a discussion of the criteria used in conducting          the evaluation. Chapter 2 discusses a number of general concerns that          need to be addressed when considering any changes to the current standards.          Chapters 3 through 5 report the results of the research as they bear on          the more significant suggestions OMB received for changes to Directive          No. 15. Chapter 6 gives the Interagency's Committee's recommendations          concerning the various suggested changes based on a review of public comments          and testimony and the research results.           C.          Summary of Comments Received on the Interagency Committee's Recommendations                     In response          to the July 9, 1997,  Federal Register  Notice, OMB received approximately          300 letters (many of them hand written) on a variety of issues, plus approximately          7000 individually signed and mailed, preprinted postcards on the issue          of classifying data on Native Hawaiians, and about 500 individually signed          form letters from members of the Hapa Issues Forum in support of adopting          the recommendation for multiple race reporting. Some of the 300 letters          focused on a single recommendation of particular interest to the writer,          while other letters addressed a number of the recommendations. The preponderance          of the comments were from individuals. Each comment was considered in          preparing OMB's decision.           1.  Comments          on Recommendations Concerning Reporting More Than One Race             The Interagency          Committee recommended that, when self-identification is used, respondents          who wish to identify their mixed racial heritage should be able to mark          or select more than one of the racial categories originally specified          in Directive No. 15, but that there should not be a ""multiracial"" category.          This recommendation to report multiple races was favorably received by          most of those commenting on it, including associations and organizations          such as the American Medical Association, the National Education Association,          the National Council of La Raza, and the National Committee on Vital and          Health Statistics, as well as all Federal agencies that responded. Comments          from some organizations, such as the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational          Fund, the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, and the Equal          Employment Advisory Council, were receptive to the recommendation on multiple          race responses, but expressed reservations pending development of tabulation          methods to ensure the utility of these data. The recommendation was also          supported by many of the advocacy groups that had earlier supported a          ""multiracial"" (box) category, such as the Association of MultiEthnic Americans          and its affiliates nationwide. Several individuals wrote in support of          ""multiple race"" reporting, basing their comments on a September 1997 article,          ""What Race Am I?"" in  Mademoiselle  magazine, which urged its readers          ""to express an opinion on whether or not a 'Multiracial' category should          be included in all federal record keeping, including the 2000 census.""          A few comments specifically favoring multiple race responses suggested          that respondents should also be asked to indicate their primary racial          affiliation in order to facilitate the tabulation of responses. A handful          of comments on multiple race reporting suggested that individuals with          both Hispanic and non-Hispanic heritages be permitted to mark or select          both categories (see discussion below).           A few comments,          in particular some from state agencies and legislatures, opposed any multiple          race reporting because of possible increased costs to collect the information          and implementation problems. Comments from the American Indian tribal          governments also were opposed to the recommendation concerning reporting          more than one race. A number of the comments that supported multiple race          responses also expressed concern about the cost and burden of collecting          the information to meet Federal reporting requirements, the schedule for          implementation, and how the data would be tabulated to meet the requirements          of legislative redistricting and enforcement of the Voting Rights Act.          A few comments expressed support for categories called ""human,"" or ""American"";          several proposed that there be no collection of data on race.           2.  Comments          on Recommendation for Classification of Data on Native Hawaiians            The Interagency          Committee recommended that data on Native Hawaiians continue to be classified          in the Asian or Pacific Islander category. This recommendation was opposed          by the Hawaiian congressional delegation, the 7,000 individuals who signed          and sent preprinted yellow postcards, the State of Hawaii departments          and legislature, Hawaiian organizations, and other individuals who commented          on this recommendation. Instead, the comments from these individuals supported          reclassifying Native Hawaiians in the American Indian or Alaska Native          category, which they view as an ""indigenous peoples"" category (although          this category has not been considered or portrayed in this manner in the          standards). Native Hawaiians, as the descendants of the original inhabitants          of what is now the State of Hawaii, believe that as indigenous people          they should be classified in the same category as American Indians and          Alaska Natives. On the other hand, the American Indian tribal governments          have opposed such a reclassification, primarily because they view the          data obtained from that category as being essential for administering          Federal programs for American Indians. Comments from the Native Hawaiians          also noted the Asian or Pacific Islander category provides inadequate          data for monitoring the social and economic conditions of Native Hawaiians          and other Pacific Islander groups. Because the Interagency Committee had          recommended against adding categories to the minimum set of categories,          requesting a separate category for Native Hawaiians was not viewed as          an option by those who commented.           3.  Comments          on Recommendation Concerning Classification of Data on Central and South          American Indians            The Interagency          Committee recommended that data for Central and South American Indians          be included in the American Indian or Alaska Native category. Several          comments from the American Indian community opposed this recommendation.          Moreover, comments from some Native Hawaiians pointed out what they believed          to be an inconsistency in the Interagency Committee's recommendation to          include in the American Indian or Alaska Native category descendants of          Central and South American Indians -- persons who are not original peoples          of the United States -- if Native Hawaiians were not to be included.           4.  Comments          on Recommendation Not to Add an Arab or Middle Eastern Ethnic Category                     The Interagency          Committee recommended that an Arab or Middle Eastern ethnic category should          not be added to the minimum standards for all reporting of Federal data          on race and ethnicity. Several comments were received in support of having          a separate category in order to have data viewed as necessary to monitor          discrimination against this population.           5.  Comments          on Recommendations for Terminology            Comments          on terminology largely supported the Interagency Committee's recommendations          to retain the term ""American Indian,"" to change ""Hawaiian"" to ""Native          Hawaiian,"" and to change ""Black"" to ""Black or African American."" There          were a few requests to include ""Latino"" in the category name for the Hispanic          population.           D.          OMB's Decisions            This section          of the Notice provides information on the decisions taken by OMB on the          recommendations that were proposed by the Interagency Committee. The Committee's          recommendations addressed options for reporting by respondents, formats          of questions, and several aspects of specific categories, including possible          additions, revised terminology, and changes in definitions. In reviewing          OMB's decisions on the recommendations for collecting data on race and          ethnicity, it is useful to remember that these decisions:           retain the          concept that the standards provide a  minimum  set of categories          for data on race and ethnicity;           permit the          collection of more detailed information on population groups provided          that any additional categories can be aggregated into the minimum standard          set of categories;           underscore          that self-identification is the preferred means of obtaining information          about an individual's race and ethnicity, except in instances where observer          identification is more practical (e.g., completing a death certificate);                    do  not           identify or designate certain population groups as ""minority groups"";                    continue          the policy that the categories are  not  to be used for determining          the eligibility of population groups for participation in any Federal          programs;           do  not           establish criteria or qualifications (such as blood quantum levels) that          are to be used in determining a particular individual's racial or ethnic          classification; and           do  not           tell an individual who he or she is, or specify how an individual should          classify himself or herself.           In arriving          at its decisions, OMB took into account not only the public comment on          the recommendations published in the  Federal Register  on July 9,          1997, but also the considerable amount of information provided during          the four years of this review process, including public comments gathered          from hearings and responses to two earlier OMB Notices (on June 9, 1994,          and August 28, 1995). The OMB decisions benefited greatly from the participation          of the public that served as a constant reminder that there are real people          represented by the data on race and ethnicity and that this is for many          a deeply personal issue. In addition, the OMB decisions benefited from          the results of the research and testing on how individuals identify themselves          that was undertaken as part of this review process. This research, including          several national tests of alternative approaches to collecting data on          race and ethnicity, was developed and conducted by the professional statisticians          and analysts at several Federal agencies. They are to be commended for          their perseverance, dedication, and professional commitment to this challenging          project.           OMB also          considered in reaching its decisions the extent to which the recommendations          were consistent with the set of principles (see Section B of the Supplementary          Information) developed by the Interagency Committee to guide the review          of this sensitive and substantively complex issue. OMB believes that the          Interagency Committee's recommendations took into account the principles          and achieved a reasonable balance with respect to statistical issues,          data needs, social concerns, and the personal dimensions of racial and          ethnic identification. OMB also finds that the Committee's recommendations          are consistent with the principal objective of the review, which is to          enhance the accuracy of the demographic information collected by the Federal          Government by having categories for data on race and ethnicity that will          enable the capture of information about the increasing diversity of our          Nation's population while at the same time respecting each individual's          dignity.           As indicated          in detail below, OMB accepts the Interagency Committee's recommendations          concerning reporting more than one race, including the recommendation          that there be no category called ""multiracial,"" the formats and sequencing          of the questions on race and Hispanic origin, and most of the changes          to terminology.           OMB does          not accept the Interagency Committee's recommendations concerning the          classification of data on the Native Hawaiian population and the terminology          for Hispanics, and it has instead decided to make the changes that follow.                    Native          Hawaiian classification .--OMB does not accept the recommendation concerning          the continued classification of Hawaiians in the Asian or Pacific Islander          category.  Instead, OMB has decided to break apart the Asian or Pacific          Islander category into two categories -- one called ""Asian"" and the other          called ""Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander.""  As a result, there          will be five categories in the minimum set for data on race.           The ""Native          Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander"" category will be defined as ""A person          having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa,          or other Pacific Islands.""  (The term ""Native Hawaiian"" does not include          individuals who are native to the State of Hawaii by virtue of being born          there.) In addition to Native Hawaiians, Guamanians, and Samoans, this          category would include the following Pacific Islander groups reported          in the 1990 census: Carolinian, Fijian, Kosraean, Melanesian, Micronesian,          Northern Mariana Islander, Palauan, Papua New Guinean, Ponapean (Pohnpelan),          Polynesian, Solomon Islander, Tahitian, Tarawa Islander, Tokelauan, Tongan,          Trukese (Chuukese), and Yapese.           The ""Asian""          category will be defined as ""A person having origins in any of the original          peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including,          for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan,          the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam.""            The Native          Hawaiians presented compelling arguments that the standards must facilitate          the production of data to describe their social and economic situation          and to monitor discrimination against Native Hawaiians in housing, education,          employment, and other areas. Under the current standards for data on race          and ethnicity, Native Hawaiians comprise about three percent of the Asian          and Pacific Islander population. By creating separate categories, the          data on the Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islander groups will no          longer be overwhelmed by the aggregate data of the much larger Asian groups.          Native Hawaiians will comprise about 60 percent of the new category.           The Asian,          Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander population groups are well defined;          moreover, there has been experience with reporting in separate categories          for the Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander population groups. The 1990          census included ""Hawaiian,"" ""Samoan,"" and ""Guamanian"" as response categories          to the race question. In addition, two of the major tests conducted as          part of the current review (the NCS and the RAETT) used ""Hawaiian"" and/or          ""Native Hawaiian,"" ""Samoan,"" ""Guamanian,"" and ""Guamanian or Chamorro""          as response options to the race question. These factors facilitate breaking          apart the current category.           Terminology          for Hispanics .--OMB does not accept the recommendation to retain the          single term ""Hispanic.""  Instead, OMB has decided that the term should          be ""Hispanic or Latino.""  Because regional usage of the terms differs          -- Hispanic is commonly used in the eastern portion of the United States,          whereas Latino is commonly used in the western portion -- this change          may contribute to improved response rates.           The OMB decisions          on the Interagency Committee's specific recommendations are presented          below:           (1)          OMB accepts the following recommendations concerning reporting more than          one race:            When self-identification          is used, a method for reporting more than one race should be adopted.                    The method          for respondents to report more than one race should take the form of multiple          responses to a single question and  not  a ""multiracial""          category.           When a list          of races is provided to respondents, the list should not contain a ""multiracial""          category.           Based on          research conducted so far, two recommended forms for the instruction accompanying          the multiple response question are ""Mark one or more ..."" and ""Select          one or more....""           If the criteria          for data quality and confidentiality are met, provision should be made          to report, at a minimum, the number of individuals identifying with more          than one race. Data producers are encouraged to provide greater detail          about the distribution of multiple responses.           The new standards          will be used in the decennial census, and other data producers should          conform as soon as possible, but not later than January 1, 2003.           (2)          OMB accepts the following recommendations concerning a combined race and          Hispanic ethnicity question:            When self-identification          is used, the two question format should be used, with the race question          allowing the reporting of more than one race.           When self-identification          is not feasible or appropriate, a combined question can be used and should          include a separate Hispanic category co-equal with the other categories.                    When the          combined question is used, an attempt should be made, when appropriate,          to record ethnicity and race or multiple races, but the option to indicate          only one category is acceptable.           (3)          OMB accepts the following recommendations concerning the retention of          both reporting formats:            The two question          format should be used in all cases involving self-identification.           The current          combined question format should be changed and replaced with a new format          which includes a co-equal Hispanic category for use, if necessary, in          observer identification.           (4)          OMB accepts the following recommendation concerning the ordering of the          Hispanic origin and race questions:            When the          two question format is used, the Hispanic origin question should precede          the race question.           (5)          OMB accepts the following recommendation concerning adding Cape Verdean          as an ethnic category:             Cape Verdean          ethnic category should not be added to the minimum data collection standards.                    (6)          OMB accepts the following recommendation concerning the addition of an          Arab or Middle Eastern ethnic category:            An Arab or          Middle Eastern ethnic category should not be added to the minimum data          standards.           (7)          OMB interprets the recommendation not to add any other categories to mean          the expansion of the minimum set to include new population groups. The          OMB decision to break apart the ""Asian or Pacific Islander"" category does          not create a category for a new population group.             (8)          OMB accepts the following recommendation concerning changing the term          ""American Indian"" to ""Native American"":            The term          American Indian should not be changed to Native American.           (9)          OMB accepts the following recommendation concerning changing the term          ""Hawaiian"" to ""Native Hawaiian"":            The term          ""Hawaiian"" should be changed to ""Native Hawaiian.""           (10)          OMB does not accept the recommendation concerning the continued classification          of Native Hawaiians in the Asian or Pacific Islander category.                     OMB has decided          to break apart the Asian or Pacific Islander category into two categories          -- one called ""Asian"" and the other called ""Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific          Islander."" As a result, there are five categories in the minimum set for          data on race.           The ""Native          Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander"" category is defined as ""A person having          origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other          Pacific Islands.""           he ""Asian""          category is defined as ""A person having origins in any of the original          peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including,          for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan,          the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam.""           (11)          OMB accepts the following recommendations concerning the use of ""Alaska          Native"" instead of ""Eskimo"" and ""Aleut"":            ""Alaska Native""          should replace the term ""Alaska n  Native.""           Alaska Native          should be used instead of Eskimo and Aleut.           The Alaska          Native response option should be accompanied by a request for tribal affiliation          when possible.           (12)          OMB accepts the following recommendations concerning the classification          of Central and South American Indians:            Central and          South American Indians should be classified as American Indian.           The definition          of the ""American Indian or Alaska Native"" category should be modified          to include the original peoples from Central and South America.           In addition,          OMB has decided to make the definition for the American Indian or Alaska          Native category more consistent with the definitions of the other categories.                    (13)          OMB accepts the following recommendations concerning the term or terms          to be used for the name of the Black category:            The name          of the Black category should be changed to ""Black or African American.""                    The category          definition should remain unchanged.           Additional          terms, such as Haitian or Negro, can be used if desired.           (14)          OMB decided to modify the recommendations concerning the term or terms          to be used for Hispanic:            The term          used should be ""Hispanic  or Latino .""           The definition          of the category should remain unchanged.           In          addition, the term ""Spanish Origin,"" can be used if desired.                     Accordingly,          the Office of Management and Budget adopts and issues the revised minimum          standards for Federal data on race and ethnicity for major population          groups in the United States which are set forth at the end of this Notice.                    Topics          for further research            There are          two areas where OMB accepts the Interagency Committee's recommendations          but believes that further research is needed: (1) multiple responses to          the Hispanic origin question and (2) an ethnic category for Arabs/Middle          Easterners.           Multiple          Responses to the Hispanic Origin Question .--The Interagency Committee          recommended that respondents to Federal data collections should be permitted          to report more than one race. During the most recent public comment process,          a few comments suggested that the concept of ""marking more than one box""          should be extended to the Hispanic origin question. Respondents are now          asked to indicate if they are ""of Hispanic origin""  or  ""not of Hispanic          origin."" Allowing individuals to select more than one response to the          ethnicity question would provide the opportunity to indicate ethnic heritage          that is both Hispanic and non-Hispanic.           The term          ""Hispanic"" refers to persons who trace their origin or descent to Mexico,          Puerto Rico, Cuba, Central and South America, and other Spanish cultures.          While there has been considerable public concern about the need to review          Directive No. 15 with respect to classifying individuals of mixed racial          heritage, there has been little comment on reporting both an Hispanic          and a non-Hispanic origin. On many Federal forms, Hispanics can also express          a racial identity on a separate race question. In the decennial census,          individuals who consider themselves part Hispanic can also indicate additional          heritages in the ancestry question.           On one hand,          it can be argued that allowing individuals to mark both categories in          the Hispanic origin question would parallel the instruction ""to mark (or          select) one or more"" racial categories. Individuals would not have to          choose between their parents' ethnic heritages, and movement toward an          increasingly diverse society would be recognized.           On the other          hand, because the matter of multiple responses to the Hispanic ethnicity          question was not raised in the early phases of the public comment process,          no explicit provisions were made for testing this approach in the research          conducted to inform the review of Directive No. 15. While a considerable          amount of research was focused on how to improve the response rate to          the Hispanic origin question, it is unclear whether and to what extent          explicitly permitting multiple responses to the Hispanic origin question          would affect nonresponse to the race question or hamper obtaining more          detailed data on Hispanic population groups.           Information          on the possible impact of any changes on the quality of the data has been          an essential element of the review. While the effects of changes in the          Hispanic origin question are unknown, they could conceivably be substantial.          Thus, OMB has decided  not  to include a provision in the standards          that would explicitly permit respondents to select both ""Hispanic origin""          and ""Not of Hispanic Origin"" options. OMB believes that this is an item          for future research. In the meantime, the ancestry question on the decennial          census long form does provide respondents who consider themselves part          Hispanic to write in additional heritages.           Research          on an Arab/Middle Easterner category .--During the public comment process,          OMB received a number of requests to add an ethnic category for Arabs/Middle          Easterners so that data could be obtained that could be useful in monitoring          discrimination. The public comment process indicated, however, that there          was no agreement on a definition for this category. The combined race,          Hispanic origin, and ancestry question in the RAETT, which was designed          to address requests that were received from groups for establishing separate          categories, did not provide a solution.           While OMB          accepted the Interagency's Committee recommendation not to create a new          category for this population group, OMB believes that further research          should be done to determine the best way to improve data on this population          group. Meanwhile, the write-ins to the ancestry question on the decennial          census long form will continue to provide information on the number of          individuals who identify their heritage as Arab or Middle Easterner.           E.          Tabulation Issues            The revised          standards retain the concept of a minimum set of categories for Federal          data on race and ethnicity and make possible at the same time the collection          of data to reflect the diversity of our Nation's population. Since the          Interagency Committee's recommendation concerning the reporting of more          than one race was made available for public comment, the focus of attention          has been largely on how the data would be tabulated. Because of the concerns          expressed about tabulation methods and our own view of the importance          of this issue, OMB committed to accelerate the work on tabulation issues          when it testified in July 1997 on the Interagency Committee's recommendations.                    A group of          statistical and policy analysts drawn from the Federal agencies that generate          or use these data has spent the past few months considering the tabulation          issues. Although this work is still in its early stages, some preliminary          guidance can be shared at this time. In general, OMB believes that, consistent          with criteria for confidentiality and data quality, the tabulation procedures          used by the agencies should result in the production of as much detailed          information on race and ethnicity as possible.           Guidelines          for tabulation ultimately must meet the needs of at least two groups within          the Federal Government, with the overriding objective of providing the          most accurate and informative body of data. The first group is composed          of those government officials charged with carrying out constitutional          and legislative mandates, such as redistricting legislatures, enforcing          civil rights laws, and monitoring progress in anti-discrimination programs.          (The legislative redistricting file produced by the Bureau of the Census,          also known as the Public Law 94-171 file, is an example of a file meeting          such legislative needs.) The second group consists of the staff of statistical          agencies producing and analyzing data that are used to monitor economic          and social conditions and trends.           Many of the          needs of the first group can be met with an initial tabulation that provides,          consistent with standards for data quality and confidentiality, the full          detail of racial reporting; that is, the number of people reporting in          each single race category and the number reporting each of the possible          combinations of races, which would add to the total population. Depending          on the judgment of users, the combinations of multiple responses could          be collapsed. One method would be to provide separate totals for those          reporting in the most common multiple race combinations and to collapse          the data for other less frequently reported combinations. The specifics          of the collapsed distributions must await the results of particular data          collections. A second method would be to report the total selecting each          particular race, whether alone or in combination with other races. These          totals would represent upper bounds on the size of the populations who          identified with each of the racial categories. In some cases, this latter          method could be used for comparing data collected under the old standards          with data collected under the new standards. It is important that users          with the same or closely related responsibilities adopt the same tabulation          method. Regardless of the method chosen for collapsing multiple race responses,          the total number reporting more than one race must be made available,          if confidentiality and data quality requirements can be met, in order          to ensure that any changes in response patterns resulting from the new          standards can be monitored over time.           Meeting the          needs of the second group (those producing and analyzing statistical data          to monitor economic and social conditions and trends), as well as some          additional needs of the first group, may require different tabulation          procedures. More research must be completed before guidelines that will          meet the requirements of these users can be developed. A group of statistical          and policy experts will review a number of alternative procedures and          provide recommendations to OMB concerning these tabulation requirements          by Spring 1998. Four of the areas in which further exploration is needed          are outlined below.           Equal employment          opportunity and other anti-discrimination programs have traditionally          provided the numbers of people in the population by selected characteristics,          including racial categories, for business, academic, and government organizations          to use in evaluating conformance with program objectives. Because of the          potentially large number of categories that may result from application          of the new standards, many with very small numbers, it is not clear how          this need for data will be best satisfied in the future.           The numbers          of people in distinct groups based on decennial census results are used          in developing sample designs and survey controls for major demographic          surveys. For example, the National Health Interview Survey uses census          data to increase samples for certain population groups, adjust for survey          non-response, and provide weights for estimating health outcomes at the          national level. The impact of having data for many small population groups          with multiple racial heritages must be explored.           Vital statistics          data include birth and death rates for various population groups. Typically          the numerator (number of births or deaths) is derived from administrative          records, while the denominator comes from intercensal population estimates.          Birth certificate data on race are likely to have been self reported by          the mother. Over time, these data may become comparable to data collected          under the new standards. Death certificate data, however, frequently are          filled out by an observer, such as a mortician, physician, or funeral          director. These data, particularly for the population with multiple racial          heritages, are likely to be quite different from the information obtained          when respondents report about themselves. Research to define comparable          categories to be used in both numerators and denominators is needed to          assure that vital statistics are as accurate and useful as possible.           More generally,          statistical indicators are often used to measure change over time. Procedures          that will permit meaningful comparisons of data collected under the previous          standards with those that will be collected under the new standards need          to be developed.           The methodology          for tabulating data on race and ethnicity must be carefully developed          and coordinated among the statistical agencies and other Federal data          users. Moreover, just as OMB's review and decision processes have benefited          during the past four years from extensive public participation, we expect          to discuss tabulation methods with data users within and outside the Federal          Government. OMB expects to issue additional guidance with respect to tabulating          data on race and ethnicity by Fall 1998.

Standards        for Maintaining, Collecting, and Presenting Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity             This          classification provides a minimum standard for maintaining, collecting,          and presenting data on race and ethnicity for all Federal reporting purposes.          The categories in this classification are social-political constructs          and should not be interpreted as being scientific or anthropological in          nature. They are not to be used as determinants of eligibility for participation          in any Federal program. The standards have been developed to provide a          common language for uniformity and comparability in the collection and          use of data on race and ethnicity by Federal agencies.           The standards          have five categories for data on race: American Indian or Alaska Native,          Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,          and White. There are two categories for data on ethnicity: ""Hispanic or          Latino,"" and ""Not Hispanic or Latino.""           1.          Categories and Definitions            The minimum          categories for data on race and ethnicity for Federal statistics, program          administrative reporting, and civil rights compliance reporting are defined          as follows:           --  American          Indian or Alaska Native.  A person having origins in any of the          original peoples of North and South America (including Central America),          and who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment.           --  Asian.           A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East,          Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example, Cambodia,          China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands,          Thailand, and Vietnam.           --  Black          or African American.  A person having origins in any of the black          racial groups of Africa. Terms such as ""Haitian"" or ""Negro"" can be used          in addition to ""Black or African American.""           --  Hispanic          or Latino.  A person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, South          or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of          race. The term, ""Spanish origin,"" can be used in addition to ""Hispanic          or Latino.""           --  Native          Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander.  A person having origins in          any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands.                    --  White.           A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the          Middle East, or North Africa.           Respondents          shall be offered the option of selecting one or more racial designations.          Recommended forms for the instruction accompanying the multiple response          question are ""Mark one or more"" and ""Select one or more.""           2.          Data Formats            The standards          provide two formats that may be used for data on race and ethnicity. Self-reporting          or self-identification using two separate questions is the preferred method          for collecting data on race and ethnicity. In situations where self-reporting          is not practicable or feasible, the combined format may be used.           In no case          shall the provisions of the standards be construed to limit the collection          of data to the categories described above. The collection of greater detail          is encouraged; however, any collection that uses more detail shall be          organized in such a way that the additional categories can be aggregated          into these minimum categories for data on race and ethnicity.           With respect          to tabulation, the procedures used by Federal agencies shall result in          the production of as much detailed information on race and ethnicity as          possible. However, Federal agencies shall not present data on detailed          categories if doing so would compromise data quality or confidentiality          standards.           a.          Two-question format            To provide          flexibility and ensure data quality, separate questions shall be used          wherever feasible for reporting race and ethnicity. When race and ethnicity          are collected separately, ethnicity shall be collected first. If race          and ethnicity are collected separately, the minimum designations are:                    Race:                     -- American          Indian or Alaska Native           -- Asian                    -- Black          or African American           -- Native          Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander           -- White                    Ethnicity :                    -- Hispanic          or Latino           -- Not Hispanic          or Latino           When data          on race and ethnicity are collected separately, provision shall be made          to report the number of respondents in each racial category who are Hispanic          or Latino.           When aggregate          data are presented, data producers shall provide the number of respondents          who marked (or selected) only one category, separately for each of the          five racial categories. In addition to these numbers, data producers are          strongly encouraged to provide the detailed distributions, including all          possible combinations, of multiple responses to the race question. If          data on multiple responses are collapsed, at a minimum the total number          of respondents reporting ""more than one race"" shall be made available.                    b.          Combined format            The combined          format may be used, if necessary, for observer-collected data on race          and ethnicity. Both race (including multiple responses) and ethnicity          shall be collected when appropriate and feasible, although the selection          of one category in the combined format is acceptable. If a combined format          is used, there are six minimum categories:           -- American          Indian or Alaska Native           -- Asian                    -- Black          or African American           -- Hispanic          or Latino           -- Native          Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander           -- White                    When aggregate          data are presented, data producers shall provide the number of respondents          who marked (or selected) only one category, separately for each of the          six categories. In addition to these numbers, data producers are strongly          encouraged to provide the detailed distributions, including all possible          combinations, of multiple responses. In cases where data on multiple responses          are collapsed, the total number of respondents reporting ""Hispanic or          Latino and one or more races"" and the total number of respondents reporting          ""more than one race"" (regardless of ethnicity) shall be provided.           3.          Use of the Standards for Record Keeping and Reporting            The minimum          standard categories shall be used for reporting as follows:           a.          Statistical reporting            These standards          shall be used at a minimum for all federally sponsored statistical data          collections that include data on race and/or ethnicity, except when the          collection involves a sample of such size that the data on the smaller          categories would be unreliable, or when the collection effort focuses          on a specific racial or ethnic group. Any other variation will have to          be specifically authorized by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)          through the information collection clearance process. In those cases where          the data collection is not subject to the information collection clearance          process, a direct request for a variance shall be made to OMB.           b.          General program administrative and grant reporting            These standards          shall be used for all Federal administrative reporting or record keeping          requirements that include data on race and ethnicity. Agencies that cannot          follow these standards must request a variance from OMB. Variances will          be considered if the agency can demonstrate that it is not reasonable          for the primary reporter to determine racial or ethnic background in terms          of the specified categories, that determination of racial or ethnic background          is not critical to the administration of the program in question, or that          the specific program is directed to only one or a limited number of racial          or ethnic groups.           c.          Civil rights and other compliance reporting            These standards          shall be used by all Federal agencies in either the separate or combined          format for civil rights and other compliance reporting from the public          and private sectors and all levels of government. Any variation requiring          less detailed data or data which cannot be aggregated into the basic categories          must be specifically approved by OMB for executive agencies. More detailed          reporting which can be aggregated to the basic categories may be used          at the agencies' discretion.           4.          Presentation of Data on Race and Ethnicity            Displays          of statistical, administrative, and compliance data on race and ethnicity          shall use the categories listed above. The term ""nonwhite"" is not acceptable          for use in the presentation of Federal Government data. It shall not be          used in any publication or in the text of any report.           In cases          where the standard categories are considered inappropriate for presentation          of data on particular programs or for particular regional areas, the sponsoring          agency may use:           a. The designations          ""Black or African American and Other Races"" or ""All Other Races"" as collective          descriptions of minority races when the most summary distinction between          the majority and minority races is appropriate;           b. The designations          ""White,"" ""Black or African American,"" and ""All Other Races"" when the distinction          among the majority race, the principal minority race, and other races          is appropriate; or           c. The designation          of a particular minority race or races, and the inclusion of ""Whites""          with ""All Other Races"" when such a collective description is appropriate.                    In displaying          detailed information that represents a combination of race and ethnicity,          the description of the data being displayed shall clearly indicate that          both bases of classification are being used.           When the          primary focus of a report is on two or more specific identifiable groups          in the population, one or more of which is racial or ethnic, it is acceptable          to display data for each of the particular groups separately and to describe          data relating to the remainder of the population by an appropriate collective          description.           5.          Effective Date            The provisions          of these standards are effective immediately for all  new  and  revised           record keeping or reporting requirements that include racial and/or ethnic          information. All  existing  record keeping or reporting requirements          shall be made consistent with these standards at the time they are submitted          for extension, or not later than January 1, 2003.

Address List Map Review        ALMR       A January 1998 program that asked local and        tribal government officials to review Census Bureau maps to identify incorrect        and missing map features and names so that the Census Bureau could update        the TIGER database in time for the address listing operation. They also        were asked to record address ranges for any street segments that used city-style        mailing addresses and to identify city-style address breaks for streets        and roads that intersected the legal boundary.                 Address List Review                See Local Update of Census Addresses.                address listing       AL       A Census 2000 field operation to develop the        address list in areas with predominantly noncity-style mailing addresses.        A lister entered, in an address register, the address and/or a physical/location        description for each living quarters within a specified area. The lister        marked the location of each residential structure on a block map by drawing        a map spot and assigning a map spot number. The lister also updated and        corrected the map if necessary. Called ""prelist"" for the 1990 census.                 address listing page               An individual page in an address register,        with either no entries or preprinted addresses and related information.                address range               The lowest and highest address numbers used        to identify structures along each side of a street segment that has city-style        addresses. The Census Bureau usually expands the range to include all possible        numbers, not just the existing ones (for example, the Census Bureau may        expand the actual addresses of 105, 111, 123, and 131 on the odd-numbered        side of a street to 101-199). Usually, an address range on one side of a        street contains only even or only odd numbers, but sometimes it contains        both. See address break, Automated Address Range Program.                address register       AR       A book used by field staff to record or        verify addresses and related information for all living quarters in an assignment        area.

Address System Information Survey       ASIS       A Census Bureau survey, conducted by telephone        in 1993 and 1996, to determine the type of mailing addresses used in a county        or, in New England, an incorporated place or minor civil division. It applied        to geographic entities that, according to the Census Bureau's records, used        city-style addresses for fewer than 95 percent of their residential mailing        addresses, or that previously reported that part of the entity was served        by noncity-style mailing addresses. The purpose of the ASIS was to determine        the most effective method of enumerating each geographic entity for Census        2000.

Advance Census Report       ACR       An unaddressed short-form questionnaire        delivered by U.S. Postal Service letter carriers in advance of the actual        enumeration in list/enumerate areas. Enumerators picked up completed ACRs,        checked them for completeness and consistency, transferred the responses        to standard census questionnaires, and completed any missing information        or entire questionnaires if necessary. These were used for the 1990 census,        but only in the Island Areas for Census 2000.                advance letter               The Census Bureau sent an advance letter to        alert households that the census questionnaire would be sent or delivered        to them soon (for every area except list/enumerate and update/enumerate        areas). The advance letter enabled households to request a questionnaire        in certain languages. See reminder card.                Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act       ANCSA       Legislation (Public Law 92-203, as amended)        enacted in 1972 establishing Alaska Native Regional Corporations and Alaska        Native villages to conduct business and nonprofit activities by and for        Alaska Natives.

American Community Survey       ACS       A monthly sample household survey conducted        by the Census Bureau to obtain information similar to the long-form census        questionnaire. It was first tested in 1995, and is expected to replace the        long form for the 2010 Census. Beginning in 2004, the nationwide survey        will provide annual data for social and economic characteristics for many        geographic entities and population groups. In 2004, they must have a minimum        population of 65,000; in 2006, 20,000; and in 2008, there will be no population        limit, and the data also will be available for census tracts and perhaps        block groups.

Although trust land may be located on or off a reservation, the Census        Bureau recognizes and tabulates data only for off-reservation trust land.        Census data always associate off-reservation trust land with a specific        federally recognized reservation or tribal government. See American Indian        trust land.                American Indian reservation               A federal American Indian reservation is        an area that has been set aside by the United States for the use of one        or more federally recognized American Indian tribes. It covers territory        over which a tribe(s) has primary governmental authority. Its boundary is        defined by tribal treaty, agreement, executive or secretarial order, federal        statute, or judicial determination. A state American Indian reservation        is an area that a state government has allocated to a tribe recognized by        that state, but not by the federal government.

ASCII was developed        by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).                 apportionment               There are two definitions for this term:        The process of dividing the 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives        among the 50 states based on the decennial census. See reapportionment,        redistricting. A distribution by the Office of Management and Budget of        funds available for obligation in appropriation or fund accounts of the        Executive Branch. The distribution makes funds available on the basis of        time periods (usually quarterly), programs, activities, projects, objects,        or combinations thereof. The apportionment system is intended to achieve        an effective and orderly use of federal funds. See appropriation, authorization,        and continuing resolution.                apportionment calculation               The mathematical calculation to determine        congressional representation by each state following a decennial census.        The apportionment calculation uses the method of equal proportions. The        calculation is based on the total resident population (citizens and noncitizens)        of the 50 states. For some censuses, including Census 2000, the population        includes U.S. Armed Forces personnel and federal civilian employees stationed        outside the United States (and their dependents living with them) who can        be allocated to a home state. The populations of the District of Columbia,        Puerto Rico, and Island Areas are not included in the calculation.                 apportionment counts               The first data product from the decennial        census is the apportionment population for each state and the number of        representatives each state is entitled to based on the apportionment calculation.                      appropriation               An act of Congress that allows federal agencies        to incur obligations and make payments from the U.S. Treasury for specified        purposes.

See assignment area, block map, and        locator map.                 assignment control               For selected field operations, this operation        required clerks to check the accuracy and completeness of work returned        from the field to the local census office, and to route materials to appropriate        staff.                 assignment preparation               The coordination, preparation, and assembly        of all materials by assignment area (AA), including maps, address registers,        and questionnaires. This operation was performed by the regional census        centers for address listing and block canvassing and by the local census        offices (LCOs) for other field operations. Map pouch labels and large or        color maps were printed in the regional census centers; AA maps, block maps,        and other 11""x17"" maps were printed in the LCOs.

Automated Address Range Program       AARP       A program for achieving a consistent address/block        number relationship between field-verified city-style addresses in the Master        Address File and the address ranges in the TIGER database. The AARP expanded        address ranges to include all possible addresses on each side of a street        segment.                automated data processing       ADP       The data processing operations performed        by a system of electronic or electrical machines.                Automated Listing and Mapping Instrument       ALMI       A post-census 2000 system of files and software        used by the Census Bureau to enable regional office field staff to update        the address information in the Master Address File (MAF) and the street,        address location, and related information in the TIGER database for an        area. The field staff use laptop computers to view address and map information        derived from the TIGER database and the MAF, and to record updates and        corrections to those files. (There will be separate versions of the ALMI        for use by staff at headquarters and in the regional offices.) As of spring        2002, the ALMI has three assignment types:      ""Update block,"" for which staff are        assigned specified blocks to canvass in order to find and record addresses        not in the MAF, correct and unduplicate information for the addresses recorded        in the MAF, record or correct the approximate location of each address,        and update and correct street/road information.     ""Locate address,""        for which staff are assigned specific addresses recorded in the MAF. Using        the ALMI, they can display a map for a specific block, nearby blocks, and,        if necessary, an overview or ""locator"" map of a county, census tract, governmental        unit, etc., in an effort to try to find each address on the ground. They        record in the ALMI the approximate location of each address that they find,        identify addresses currently in the MAF that do not seem to exist or that        duplicate another recorded address, and update and correct the address records        and street/road information.     ""Find growth,"" for which staff are        assigned an area suspected to contain new residential development. If they        find new housing, they identify the census tract(s) and block(s), which        will comprise a future ""update block"" assignment(s).          The primary intercensal users of the ALMI are the American Community Survey,        other Census Bureau surveys, and the Local Update of Census Addresses Field        Verification operation. The ALMI also may be used for incorporating into        the MAF and the TIGER database the updated information developed from other        field operations, such as special censuses.

Listers traveled in their assignment areas to collect and verify information        to ensure that their address listing pages (derived from the Master Address        File) contained a mailing address for every living quarters. They especially        looked for hidden housing units (such as attics, basements, or garages converted        into housing units) and houses that appeared to be one unit but actually        contained multiple housing units. They also updated and corrected their        Census Bureau maps. Formerly called precanvass, Targeted Canvassing, and        Targeted Multi-Unit Check. See blue line and canvass.                block cluster               A single block or a group of blocks, varying        in size depending on the requirements of each census operation or survey.

Field staff use block maps to        guide them in their canvass of each block, to annotate map changes, and,        in some areas, to mark (map spot) and number the location of each residential        structure. See assignment area map, block locator map, block number, collection        block, and map spot.                block number               A number assigned to each census block.     For  collecting         information for Census 2000, each census block was identified uniquely within        a county (or statistically equivalent entity) by a 4- or 5-digit number.        All the collection blocks in a county used the same number of digits. As        a result of changes to the TIGER database after the Census Bureau had numbered        the blocks in preparation for the Census 2000 field operations, the number        could have an alphabetic suffix, to represent one portion of a physical        block that was split by an added street or road or by the addition or change        of the boundary of a county, American Indian reservation, off-reservation        trust land, or military installation; for example, if an added street bisected        Block 1005, the block was split into Blocks 1005A and 1005B to represent        the portion of the orignal collection block on each side of that street.            For  tabulating  data for Census 2000, each census block was        identified uniquely within a census tract by a 4-digit number. A 1990 census        block number had three digits, with a potential alphabetic suffix. The first        digit identifies the block group in which the census block is located.                 See block group, census block, collection block, and tablulation block.                block numbering area       BNA       Prior to Census 2000, a statistical subdivision        of a county or statistically equivalent entity, delineated by a state government        agency or Census Bureau regional census center for the purpose of grouping        and numbering census blocks in counties (and statistically equivalent entities)        that did not have census tracts. BNAs were discontinued for Census 2000;        they were replaced by census tracts in every county and statistically equivalent        entity.                 blue line               A boundary that defined the extent of the        area covered by the block canvassing operation, and later was included in        the mailout/mailback and urban update/leave enumerations. Most mailing addresses        inside the blue line use a house number and street name.                boarded up               A housing condition in which the doors or        windows of a building have been covered to prevent destruction or entry.                      borough               A legal entity in Alaska that the Census Bureau        treats as statistically equivalent to a county; a minor civil division in        each of the five counties that comprise New York city; a type of incorporated        place in Connecticut, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. See governmental unit.                boundary               A line that identifies the extent or limit        of a geographic entity, such as a census block, census tract, county, or        place. The legal boundaries the Census Bureau recognizes for a census are        those in effect on January 1 of the census year. See block boundary.                 Boundary and Annexation Survey       BAS        A survey of all counties and statistically        equivalent entities, all or selected incorporated places and minor civil        divisions, all or selected federally recognized American Indian reservations        and off-reservation trust land, and Alaska Native Regional Corporations,        to determine the location of legal limits and related information as of        January 1 of the survey year. See Consolidated Boundary and Annexation Survey.                      boundary change               The establishment, relocation, or deletion        of a boundary. For legal entities, boundary changes are reported to the        Census Bureau in a state, local, or tribal government's response to a Boundary        and Annexation Survey, through a periodic or occasional survey to collect        boundary information for a specific set of geographic entities, as an adjunct        to obtaining other information about an area (such as updated street pattern        or address information), or by some other reliable source. For statistical        entities, boundary changes are provided in preparation for a specific census        in response to the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program        or some other specific boundary collection program. The boundaries of legal        entities are changed due to legal actions, whereas statistical entities        may be changed by appropriate reviewers to reflect population growth or        decline, or because of revisions either to visible or legal features used        as boundaries or to Census Bureau procedures. A boundary change also can        occur due to an error in recording a boundary for one census or survey,        and showing it correctly for the next.                Boundary Validation Program       BVP        A Census Bureau followup to the Census 2000        Boundary and Annexation Survey that enabled local and tribal government        officials to review and correct (but not update beyond January 1) the January        1, 2000 legal boundaries, and to add and correct city-style addresses at        the point where streets and roads intersected the legal boundary.

The Bureau uses census codes for geographic        entities for which a Federal Information Processing Standards code either        does not exist or is inadequate to identify and/or sequence a type of entity.        See Federal Information Processing Standards code, geographic code.                census county division       CCD       A statistical subdivision of a county, established        and delineated cooperatively by the Census Bureau and state, local, and        tribal officials for data presentation purposes. CCDs have been established        in 21 states that do not have minor civil divisions suitable for data presentation;        that is, minor civil divisions have not been legally established, do not        have a governmental or administrative purpose, have boundaries that are        ambiguous or change frequently, and/or generally are not well known to the        public.                 Census Day               The reference date for collection of information        for a census. For the decennial census, this has been April 1 of the decade        year (year ending with zero) since the 1930 census.                census designated place       CDP        A statistical entity that serves as a statistical        counterpart of an incorporated place for the purpose of presenting census        data for a concentration of population, housing, and commercial structures        that is identifiable by name, but is not within an incorporated place. CDPs        usually are delineated cooperatively with state, Puerto Rico, Island Area,        local, and tribal government officials, based on Census Bureau guidelines.        For Census 2000, CDPs did not have to meet a population threshold to qualify        for the tabulation of census data. See comunidad, place, and zona urbana.                census division               A grouping of states and the District of Columbia,        established by the Census Bureau for the presentation of census data. The        nine divisions (East North Central, East South Central, Middle Atlantic,        Mountain, New England, Pacific, South Atlantic, West North Central, and        West South Central) represent areas that were relatively homogeneous areas        when they were established in 1910.

Each        region (Midwest, Northeast, South, and West) is subdivided into census divisions.                      census statistical areas committee       CSAC       For the 1990 and prior censuses, a committee        established by local government officials and other interested individuals        to identify, in cooperation with the Census Bureau, the census tracts, block        groups, census designated places, and other statistical entities for the        area it served.                census statistical areas key person       CSAKP       For the 1990 and prior censuses, a person        designated by a census statistical areas committee to act as its contact        person with the Census Bureau.                census subarea               A statistical subdivision of a borough,        census area (county equivalent), or other entity that is the statistical        equivalent of a county in Alaska. Census subareas are delineated cooperatively        by the state of Alaska and the Census Bureau.                 census tract               A small, relatively permanent statistical        subdivision of a county or statistically equivalent entity, delineated for        data presentation purposes by a local group of census data users or the        geographic staff of a regional census center in accordance with Census Bureau        guidelines. Designed to be relatively homogeneous units with respect to        population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions at the        time they are established, census tracts generally contain between 1,000        and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. Census tract boundaries        are delineated with the intention of being stable over many decades, so        they generally follow relatively permanent visible features. However, they        may follow governmental unit boundaries and other invisible features in        some instances; the boundary of a state or county (or statistically equivalent        entity) is always a census tract boundary. See block numbering area, tribal        census tract.                census tract number               A 4-digit basic number, followed by an optional        2-digit decimal suffix, used to identify a census tract uniquely within        a county or statistically equivalent entity. For Census 2000, census tract        numbers ranged from 0001 to 9999, with 9400 to 9499 reserved for census        tracts related to federally recognized American Indian reservations and        off-reservation trust landprimarily reservations and trust land that cross        county lines.                 Census Tract Street Index       CTSI        An extract of the TIGER File, made available        to the public during the 1990s to enable users to relate a city-style address        to a 1990 census tract and current Congressional district.                Census Unedited File       CUF       The Decennial Response File, the file containing        all responses to Census 2000, is processed using the Primary Selection Algorithm.        From this file, two files are created: the Census Unedited File, which contains        the individual responses to the short-form questionnaires, and the Census        Unedited File - Sample, which contains the individual responses to the long-        form questionnaires. The long form, received by approximately one in six        households nationwide, included the short-form questionnaire items and additional        questions. The CUF is used to generate apportionment data as well as related        ""raw,"" or unedited, census data.                central city               In a metropolitan area (MA), the largest place        and, in some areas, one or more additional places that meet official standards        issued by the federal Office of Management and Budget. If a place extends        beyond an MA, only the portion within the MA is a central city. A few primary        metropolitan statistical areas do not have a central city.                 central place               In an urban area (urbanized area or urban        cluster), the largest place and, in some areas, one or more additional places        that meet specific Census Bureau criteria. If a place is identified as an        extended place, only the portion within the urban area represents the central        place. For an urban area that does not contain an incorporated or census        designated place, there is no central place, and the title of the urbanized        area or urban cluster uses the name of a minor civil division, or a local        place name recognized by the Board on Geographic Names and recorded by the        U.S. Geological Survey.                 check-in               An operation that records a census response        into a computer database. Every type of response (mailed-in questionnaire,        telephone response, Internet response, or enumerator interview response)        is checked in at a data capture center. See check-in rate.                 check-in rate               Questionnaires checked in at the four data        capture centers represented the initial step for processing responses to        Census 2000. Check-in at the data capture centers was an operation designed        to record receipt of census questionnaires into a database for control and        workflow management. It provided an estimate of the scanning workload. The        check-in count of questionnaires included all mailed-in questionnaires,        including responses from mailout/mailback, update/leave, and the Be Counted        Program, and enumerator interview responses, including list/enumerate, update/enumerate,        and Nonresponse Followup. The check-in count also included questionnaires        returned as undeliverable-as-addressed by the U.S. Postal Service. Some        questionnaires included in check-in may be duplicate forms from the same        household, blank forms, and the like; because questionnaires from all of        these sources constitute the questionnaire scanning workload, the Census        Bureau does not reduce the check-in count by the number of unusable questionnaires.                city               A type of incorporated place in all states        and the District of Columbia. In Virginia, all cities are not part of any        county, and the Census Bureau treats them as county equivalents as well        as places for purposes of data presentation; there also is one such independent        city in each of three states: Maryland, Missouri, and Nevada. In 23 states        and the District of Columbia, some or all cities are not part of any minor        civil division, and the Census Bureau treats them as county subdivisions        as well as places for purposes of data presentation. In agreement with the        state of Hawaii, the Census Bureau does not recognize the city of Honolulu        for presentation of decennial census data. See consolidated city, county        equivalent, county subdivision, governmental unit, incorporated place, independent        city, and independent place.                city and borough               A legally established geographic entity        in Alaska. The Census Bureau treats a city and borough as equivalent to        a county for data presentation purposes. The Bureau also treats a city and        borough as an incorporated place in Alaska. This designation is new for        Census 2000.                city delivery area               An area in which post        offices deliver mail to addresses consisting of a house number and street        name and that consists of ""city delivery routes"" as designated by the U.S.        Postal Service. Some homes and establishments in a city delivery area may        choose to use a post office/drawer or general delivery for their mail. See        city-style address, nondelivery area, and rural delivery area.                city-style address               An address that consists of a house number        and street or road name; for example, 201 Main Street. The address may or        may not be used for the delivery of mail, and may include apartment numbers/designations        or similar identifiers. See address, basic street address, house-number-and-street-name        address, mailing address, and noncity-style address.                coefficient of variation       CV       The ratio of the standard error (square root        of the variance) to the value being estimated, usually expressed in terms        of a percentage (also known as the relative standard deviation). The lower        the CV, the higher the relative reliability of the estimate.                collection block               A physical block enumerated as a single        geographic area, regardless of any legal or statistical boundaries passing        through it.

Most governmental units have legally established boundaries and names, and        have officials (elected or appointed) who have the power to carry out legally        prescribed functions, provide services for the residents, and raise revenues.        To meet Census Bureau criteria, a government must be an organized entity        that, in addition to having governmental character, has sufficient discretion        in the management of its own affairs to distinguish it as separate from        the administrative structure of any other governmental unit. To have governmental        character, an entity must exist as a legally organized entity and have legally        defined responsibilities to its residents. See active entity, false entity,        functioning entity, functional status, inactive entity, legal entity, and        nonfuctioning entity.                group quarters       GQ        A living quarter in which unrelated people live or stay other        than the usual house, apartment, or mobile home. A GQ is a special place        or part of a special place. The Census Bureau recognizes two general types        of group quarters: institutional (for example, nursing homes, mental hospitals        or wards, hospitals or wards for chronically ill patients, hospices, and        prison wards) and noninstitutional (for example, college or university dormitories,        military barracks, group homes, shelters, missions, and flophouses). Group        quarters may have housing units on the premises for staff or guests. See        embedded housing unit, freestanding housing unit, group quarters enumeration,        housing unit, and special place.                Group Quarters Automated Instrument for Listing       GAIL        Post-Census 2000 software that enables regional office and        headquarters staff to use laptop computers to record address, location,        and related information about group quarters and special places in the Special        Place/Group Quarters Master File, which is subsequently reflected in the        Master Address File and, often, in the TIGER database. During the Census        Bureau's post-Census 2000 current surveys, when the Automated Listing and        Mapping Instrument (ALMI) encounters a group quarters, it automatically        requests the GAIL so information can be reviewed and recorded for the facility.        The GAIL can be used for other programs without reference to the ALMI when        the Census Bureau updates information only for group quarters. Eventually,        the GAIL will be accessed automatically to record information about group        quarters found during other Census Bureau operations. See Automated Listing        and Mapping Instrument, Demographic Area Address Listing, group quarters,        special place.                group quarters enumeration               A method of data collection designed to count people living        or staying in group quarters. Enumerators visit each special place, list        the names of the people living or staying in the group quarters (including        staff who live or stay there), and leave an Individual Census Report for        each person or a staff member to complete. Enumerators return at a later        date to pick up the questionnaires and, if necessary, conduct interviews        to obtain any missing information and conduct interviews with nonrespondents.        See Transient Night Enumeration.                group quarters population               The portion of the population of a geographic entity that        is living in group quarters on the official date of a census or survey.                      hard to enumerate       HTE        An area for which the environment or population may present        difficulties for enumeration.                 Hawaiian home land        HHL        An area created and held in trust for the benefit of native        Hawaiians by the state of Hawaii, pursuant to the Hawaiian Homes Commission        Act of 1920, as amended. Hawaiian home lands are a new type of geographic        entity for Census 2000.                 headquarters       HQ        A term sometimes used to designate the Census Bureau facility,        staff, and operations located primarily in Suitland, MD.                 headquarters data processing       HQDP        HQDP provides a number of functions, including the software        that interacts with the Master Address File, Operations Control System,        Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation operations, data capture centers, Telephone        Questionnaire Assistance, Internet Data Collection, and multiple divisions        (at headquarters). HQDP conducts editing operations as well as operations        that convert address updates found in the field into computer- readable        form. HQDP operations include the headquarters check-in and followup control        activities for census data.                 heterogeneity               Heterogeneity occurs when housing units assigned to sampling        strata or groupings do not have equal chances of being included or missed        by a census or survey. Heterogeneity creates difficulty for the small-area        estimation process because the correction factor is applied to all people        with the specified characteristic in that sampling poststratum even though        some of them do not actually have the coverage characteristics. See homogeneity.                      highest elected official       HEO        The elected or appointed person who is the chief executive        official of a governmental unit and is most responsible for the governmental        activities of the governmental unit, such as the governor of a state, chair        of a county commission, or mayor of an incorporated place.                Historic Areas of Oklahoma               A term used in the 1980 census for an area encompassing the        former American Indian reservations that had legally established boundaries        during the period 1900 through 1907, but were dissolved during the 2- to        3-year period preceding the establishment of Oklahoma as a state in 1907.        It excluded territory within urbanized areas delineated for the 1980 census.        The 1980 census tabulated data for this entity, which was replaced for the        1990 census by tribal jurisdiction statistical areas. See Oklahoma tribal        statistical area.                homogeneity               Homogeneity assumes that all people in a particular sampling        stratum or poststratum have an equal chance of being included or missed        by a census or survey. A lack of homogeneity in a particular sample block        is not an error, but it does create difficulty for the small-area estimation        process. This happens because the correction factor is applied to all people        with the specified characteristic in that poststratum even though some of        them do not exhibit the same coverage characteristic. See heterogeneity.                      hotels, motels, and other facilities               Hotels, motels, and other facilities for which vouchers are        provided or that operate under contract to provide shelter to people without        housing are included in the service-based enumeration. See emergency shelter;        regularly scheduled mobile food van; shelter for children who are runaways,        neglected, or without housing; soup kitchen; and transitional shelter.                house-number-and-street-name address or house-number/street-name        address       HN/SN address        An address assigned to a specific structure, consisting of        a number and the street name with which the structure is associated. The        address may or may not be used for mail delivery. See address, basic street        address, city-style address, E-911 addresses, and mailing address.                household       HH        A person or group of people who occupy a housing unit as their        usual place of residence. The number of households equals the number of        occupied housing units in a census.                Household and Address Field Verification       HA FV        See Invalid Return Detection.                householder               The member of a household who lives at a housing unit and        owns, is buying, or rents the housing unit. If there is no such person present        when the Census Bureau contacts the household, any household member who        is at least 15 years old can serve as the householder for the purposes of        a census or survey.

After the Housing        Unit Field Followup is complete, clerks use the information collected to        resolve the remaining unmatched cases and assign an After Followup match        code to each address. The next operation is the Final Housing Unit Matching.                      Housing Unit Followup       HUFU        An Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation operation. After the Housing        Unit Matching, the addresses that remain unmatched and require additional        information are sent to Housing Unit Followup for interviewing. The followup        interviews attempt to gather more information about unmatched housing units        in order to resolve differences between the A.C.E. listing and the census        listing. The next operation is Housing Unit After Followup Matching.                 Housing Unit Matching               An Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation operation. The independent        list of housing units from the A.C.E. is matched to the census inventory        of housing units, first by a computer match and then by a clerical match.        Cases still unmatched after this operation go to the Housing Unit Followup        for resolution. See independent listing.                 How America Knows What America Needs       HAKWAN        A Census 2000 public relations program that disseminated response        rates for governmental units on a Census 2000 Internet site.

Hundred Percent Census Edited File       HCEF        A computer file that contains the edited characteristics and        records for all households and people in Census 2000. The edits are performed        on the Hundred Percent Census Unedited File. The edits include consistency        edits and imputation for items or people where the data are insufficient        for the hundred percent data items from both the short- and long-form questionnaires.        The HCEF provided the census counts for apportionment purposes.                 Hundred Percent Census Unedited File       HCUF        The Decennial Response File was combined with the Decennial        Master Address File to create the HCUF and the Sample Census Unedited File.        The HCUF contains the individual responses to the hundred percent data items        from both the short- and long-form questionnaires.                 hundred percent data               Population and housing information collected for all living        quarters in the United States as of Census Day. These questions appeared        on both the short- and long-form questionnaires.

Hundred Percent Summary File               There are two types of Hundred Percent Summary Files: 1) Statistically        corrected data derived from the hundred percent data items. These data include        the corrections measured in the Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation survey.        2) To fulfill the requirements of Public Law 105-119, data derived from        the hundred percent data items without statistical correction.                 hybrid mailing               A national concept, considered for Census 2000 but not implemented,        that involved a combination of targeted and blanket mailings of replacement        questionnaires within the mailout/mailback, update/leave, and urban update/leave        areas covered by a local census office.                 identification number               See census identification number.                imputation               The assignment of values by the Census Bureau when information        is missing or inconsistent. Imputation relies on the tendency of households        of the same size within a small geographic area to be similar in most characteristics.        For example, the value of ""rented"" is likely to be imputed for a housing        unit not reporting on owner/renter status in a neighborhood with multi-unit        structures for which other respondents reported ""rented"" on the census questionnaire.        There are two major types of imputation: 1) allocation, in which missing        values for individual items are entered on the basis of other reported information        for the person or household (or from other persons or households with similar        characteristics) and 2) substitution, in which  all  of the information        for a person or household is created from other persons or households with        similar characteristics.                inactive entity               A legal entity that has the power to have officials to carry        out legally prescribed functions, but is not currently exercising those        powers. See active entity, functioning entity, governmental unit.                incorporated place               A type of governmental unit, incorporated under state law        as a city, city and borough, municipality, town (except in New England,        New York, and Wisconsin), borough (except in Alaska and New York), or village,        that has legally prescribed limits, powers, and functions.

All incorporated places classified as cities in Virginia        are independent cities, as are Baltimore, Maryland; St. Louis, Missouri;        and Carson City, Nevada. The Census Bureau treats an independent city as        an incorporated place and as equivalent to a county, and, where appropriate,        as a county subdivision for data presentation purposes. See city, county,        county subdivision, incorporated place, and independent place.                independent listing               An Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation operation that creates        a list of housing units in an operation that is separate from the decennial        census.                 independent place               In a state in which the Census Bureau recognizes minor civil        divisions (MCDs), an incorporated place that is not legally part of any        MCD.

Individual Census Report       ICR        A Census 2000 questionnaire used during group quarters enumeration        and at shelters and targeted nonsheltered outdoor locations during service-based        enumeration. It contains population questions for one person. There are        both long- and short-form versions. In most group quarters, additional questions        were asked of a sample (one in six) of the population. The questionnaire        asked if the person had a usual residence, but did not ask housing questions.        Enumerators distributed this questionnaire.

These offices managed address listing field work, conducted local        recruiting, and visited living quarters to conduct various Census 2000 operations.        Called district office in previous censuses. See early opening local census        office, pseudo-LCO.                 Local Knowledge Update       LKU        For this Census 2000 operation, the special place staff at        each local census office reviewed the special place inventory for completeness        and accuracy by using local sources and reference materials and their own        knowledge of the facilities and locations in their area.                Local Update of Census Addresses        LUCA        A Census 2000 program, established in response to requirements        of Public Law 103-430, that provided an opportunity for local and tribal        governments to review and update individual address information or block-by-block        address counts from the Master Address File and associated geographic information        in the TIGER database. The goal was to improve the completeness and accuracy        of both computer files. Individuals working with the addresses had to sign        a confidentiality agreement before a government could participate. Also        called the Address List Review program.

See block        locator map.                 long form       LF        The decennial census questionnaire containing 100-percent        and sample questions. See hundred percent data, sample data, and short form.                long-form sampling               Distribution of the long form uses a variable-rate sampling        plan to determine which households receive the long form. The Census Bureau        samples housing units within each governmental unit using one of four rates,        as determined by the precensus count of housing units for governmental units.        Nationwide, one in six housing units and people in group quarters received        a long form.                mail census area               The area covered by the mailout/mailback, update/leave, and        urban update/leave methods of enumeration.                 mail return questionnaire               A questionnaire returned by a respondent by mail. These questionnaires        were received from mailout/mailback and update/leave areas, and also included        questionnaires obtained through the Be Counted program.                mail return rate               The total number of households returning a questionnaire by        mail divided by the number of occupied housing units that received a questionnaire        by mail or from a census enumerator (the only units that can return a questionnaire).        This measure cannot be derived until the enumeration is completed and the        final number of occupied housing units is determined.                 mailing address               The address used by a living quarters, special place, business        establishment, and the like to receive mail.

Map Image Metafile       MIM        A computer file that provides a full-image description of        a Census Bureau map in digital form (a human-readable format). The regional        offices, regional census centers, and National Processing Center use MIMs        to create printed maps or to record maps on CD-ROMs, from which other offices        (especially local census offices for Census 2000) can print maps. See Single        MIM-Based Integrated Mapping System.                 map inset               A sketch map drawn by an enumerator, lister, etc., to represent        an enlargement of an area that, on the original Census Bureau map, is too        small to clearly display added streets and/or map spots and map spot numbers.        The map usually is drawn on the back of the map sheet that contains the        enlarged area, but a separate sheet of paper may be used for this purpose.        See inset map.                map legend               An illustrated list of map content: the symbols, type styles,        and, if appropriate, shading or colors shown on a map or map series, and        the meaning of each.                Map Plotting System        MAPS        The MAPS site or area is the portion of the regional office/regional        census center in which maps are produced, assembled, and stored.

This relationship is shown        in the margin of each Census Bureau map by several bar scales that represent        distance in miles, kilometers, yards, feet, etc., on the map. The relationship        also can be expressed as a ratio, showing the actual numeric relationship        between distance on the map and on the ground; e.g., 1:2400 means that 1        inch on the map equals 2,400 inches, or 200 feet, on the ground.                map sheet               One of a set of sheets that comprise a Census Bureau map.        Many Census Bureau maps consist of a single map sheet.                map spot               A dot drawn on a census block map by a lister or enumerator        to show the location of a structure that contains one or more living quarters.        The enumerator assigns a number, unique within the census collection block,        to each map spot to correspond to the entry(s) in the address register for        a basic street address or residential structure. The map spots and numbers        are entered into the TIGER database, and are printed on subsequent block        maps as a box, oval, or combination with the map spot number inside. For        Census 2000, map spots are identified primarily by census listers and enumerators        during address listing and list/enumerate operations, but also may be created        during the Local Update of Census Addresses Field Verification, update/enumerate,        update/leave, and some followup operations.                map spot number               The number assigned uniquely to each map spot within a census        collection block. The same number can represent more than one living quarters        located in a multi-unit structure, in which case the number on the map is        followed parenthetically by the number of living quarters in that structure.                      maritime/military vessel enumeration               A type of group quarters enumeration for which the Census        Bureau conducts a special operation to enumerate the crews of ships. The        Census Bureau worked with the U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Coast Guard,        U.S. Maritime Administration, and others to identify military and maritime        vessels homeported to, or in port or leaving a port in, the United States,        Puerto Rico, or the Island Areas at the time of the census. The Census Bureau        mailed enumeration materials to those vessels for completion by individual        crew members.                Marketing Services Office       MSO        Census Bureau.

Master Address File       MAF        A computer file of every address and physical/location description        known to the Census Bureau, including their geographic locations. The file        was created by combining the addresses in the 1990 address file with U.S.        Postal Service Delivery Sequence Files, and supplementing this with address        information provided by state, local, and tribal governments. Census Bureau        staff updated and supplemented the file with address information obtained        by several census programs. The MAF is linked to the TIGER database. The        MAF was used to create the Decennial Master Address File, which provided        the addresses for mailing and delivery of Census 2000 questionnaires. See        Decennial Master Address File.                Master Address File Geocoding Office Resolution       MAFGOR        An operation in which the regional offices and regional census        centers try to find the location of addresses from the U.S. Postal Service        that did not match to the records in the TIGER database. Staff use atlases,        maps, city directories, and the like to locate these addresses and add their        streets and address ranges to the TIGER database.                 Master Address File Identification Number       MAFID        A number associated with each living quarters or special place        recorded in the Master Address File. It also is called the census identification        number. See no identification number.                Master Address File Quality Improvement Program       MAF QIP        An operation designed to assess the completeness and accuracy        of the coverage, as well as the block-level geocoding, of the addresses        in the initial MAF before the Census Bureau conducted its Census 2000 coverage        improvement operations. After a pilot study in six counties in 1997, field        staff listed addresses in selected mailout/mailback areas in 1998 for this        program.                 Master Address File Update File       MAFUF        Census Bureau staff do not individually key new addresses        and address revisions directly into the Master Address File (MAF). Instead,        using a specified format, they key the relevant information into a fileMAFUFthat        stores the information until the Geography Division is ready to merge the        complete updated file into the MAF in a batch process.

Multiple Response Processing       MRP        A two-stage operation that identifies and flags for removal        person and housing unit records that are redundant. The stages are the Within-Block        Search and the Primary Selection Algorithm. More than one response can be        received for a person or housing unit because the Census Bureau offers several        methods for responding to the census. These methods include Be Counted questionnaires,        Telephone Questionnaire Assistance, Internet responses, and non-English        language forms. The Within-Block Search looks within the census block for        person records for the same person appearing on two questionnaires. The        Primary Selection Algorithm eliminates duplicate responses for the same        identification number (housing unit) and determines the final housing unit        record and the people to include at the housing unit.                multiplicity estimation               A statistical procedure that adds an estimate of people not        enumerated on the day of enumeration to the count of people missed (because        the enumeration was limited to one visit) during the enumeration of shelters        and soup kitchens. This estimator was not used for Census 2000.                 multi-unit structure               A building that contains more than one housing unit (for example,        an apartment building).

Interviewers        collected information about the current resident(s) of each housing unit        and anyone who had moved out of the sample block between Census Day and        the time of the interview. The interviewers asked questions about alternate        residences to establish where people lived on Census Day according to census        residence rules. Interviews were conducted either by telephone or personal        visit, both using a computer assisted personal interview (CAPI) instrument.        The next operation was Person Matching.                Person Matching               An Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation operation. This operation        was conducted after Person Interviewing.

As a result, each tribe or base worked with only one        LCO for the census. The Bureau informally referred to the lands involved        in the reassigned areas as pseudo-LCOs, since they were not actually LCOs        in their own right. Each pseudo-LCO was assigned a unique code.                pseudo-tract               See interim census tract.                pseudo-voting district        pseudo-VTD        An area for which the Census Bureau reports        voting district (VTD) data, even though the boundary of the actual VTD was        adjusted by the reviewing officials for purposes of data presentation, so        that it no longer matches the legally established boundary.

Heitgerd, PhD, ATSDR           The demographic characterization of a population living            near a hazardous waste site provides   ATSDR  with essential            information needed to assess and address public health issues in local            communities. ATSDR uses this information to (a) estimate the size and            demographic characteristics of the population that potentially has been            exposed to hazardous substances, (b) identify sensitive populations            in the area (e.g., children, childbearing-aged women, and the elderly),            and (c) provide insight about the social context of the area.           The ability to link population and housing data to the            geographic location (e.g., a point defined by longitude and latitude)            of a hazardous waste site through geographic information system (GIS)            technology improves ATSDR's capability to estimate current population            numbers. This results in a more accurate characterization of site demographics            in a shorter period of time. It also helps the agency to develop communication            and health education efforts for the local community and to identify            potential environmental justice issues at a site.                      GIS            and U.S. Census Data                        ATSDR relies principally on data from the              U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census ,             to characterize community demographics. Decennial census data are the            most complete source of residential population information for the United            States and its territories (e.g., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands).            Demographic data are currently available from the 1990 census, and data            from Census 2000 are expected to be released in spring 2001. The Bureau            of the Census estimated that 248.7 million persons resided in the United            States in 1990. By 2000, this estimate was expected to be more than            275 million.           Understanding the population distribution across the nation's            landscape and using this information in a GIS requires knowledge of            census geography (i.e., the political and statistical areas the Bureau            of the Census uses to tabulate and report demographic data). Most U.S.            residents know the country's geographic/political areas (e.g., states,            counties, cities, and Native American reservations), but many are less            familiar with the geographic/statistical areas developed by the Bureau            of the Census, and which form the basis ATSDR uses to analyze and report            population and housing data for small geographic areas (e.g., census            tracts and census blocks)   (Table 1)  ( 1 , 2 ).           U.S. census data describing residential population and            housing provide the most complete picture of our nation and its subareas.            Basic population and housing data (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, and sex)            are reported for all census geographic levels (e.g., state, city, census            tract, and census block). Additional demographic data, including socioeconomic            information, are available at the block group level and at the larger            geographic levels ( 3 ).           ATSDR incorporates U.S. census population and housing            data into a GIS application, which generates demographic maps for the            areas near active hazardous waste sites (e.g., those listed by              EPA             on the   National            Priorities List ).             A map of each site contains the location of the site and its surrounding            area (within a 1-mile buffer). Using an area-proportion spatial analysis            technique in a GIS, demographic statistics from the 1990 census are            calculated and the results listed in a site map. ATSDR also records            these data in its   HazDat database , which            contains detailed site-specific information regarding hazardous waste            sites. Through  GATHER , a site            map can be generated that contains these demographic statistics for            any hazardous waste site in the comprehensive HazDat database.           GIS maps that overlay data on population, environmental            contaminants, and health outcomes are produced routinely for hazardous            waste sites. Requests by ATSDR staff for additional current and historical            demographic data, such as housing age, length of residence, and socioeconomic            status, are easily incorporated into the GIS system. ATSDR also provides            GIS-generated demographic statistics in response to requests from other            public health agencies, including   CDC             and the 28 state health departments that have cooperative agreements            with ATSDR.           Demographic            Data and   Segmentation Systems           An issue in using census data to examine area demographics            is that the data reflect the population and housing status of U.S. residents            on April 1 of a census year (e.g., 1990, 2000), but area demographics            can change over time, particularly in smaller geographic areas. Several            companies use the most recently published census data to project current-year            demographic estimates for the period between official censuses. These            projections are then incorporated into a system that segments small            geographic areas into categories reflecting the demographic characteristics,            lifestyle, and consumer behavior patterns of residents.           To meet the agency's need for updated data statistics,            ATSDR licenses with Claritas, Inc., for estimates of current-year demographic            data at the block-group level. These data include age, race/ethnicity,            sex, income, education, and housing. ATSDR uses the PRIZM   segmentation            system developed by Claritas, Inc., to obtain additional demographic            and lifestyle information about populations living near hazardous waste            sites ( 4 ). The concept behind the PRIZM segmentation            system is that individuals are more likely to live near others who share            similar demographic and behavioral characteristics. The PRIZM segmentation            system divides the U.S. population into 62 neighborhood types, or ""clusters,""            on the basis of residential location (i.e., geodemographics).           PRIZM has copyrighted names for each of the 62 neighborhood            types (e.g., ""Kids and Cul-de-Sacs"" and ""Southside City"")            that it assigns to census block groups, census tracts/block numbering            areas, and zip codes. These neighborhood types can be used to analyze            and display demographic data in a GIS. The cluster names are meant to            catch interest and convey a general sense of the character of an area;            however, they should not be interpreted literally. PRIZM contains demographic            and market research data that define and differentiate each cluster.            The marketing research data include information on lifestyle (e.g.,            smoking, gardening, and exercise), media habits (e.g., television, newspaper,            and radio), financial product usage (e.g., health insurance information),            and general product use (e.g., foods and alcohol).           Used successfully as a marketing tool for many years by            the business industry, segmentation systems are increasingly used by            public health agencies to (a) explore the relationship between community            and disease, (b) target health interventions, and (c) develop communication            strategies. For example, the Georgia Division of Public Health used            cluster information to target mammography programs in factory towns            designated as ""Mines and Mills"" because women in those communities            had higher rates of breast cancer ( 5 ). The              Office of Communication (OC) of the Centers for Disease Control and            Prevention (CDC)             collaborates with the centers that comprise CDC on projects that integrate            PRIZM data with epidemiologic and other data for communication planning            ( 6 ). One example of this collaborative work            concerns prevention efforts for              hantavirus .             Using zip code information, OC and the              National Center for Infectious Diseases (NCID)             identified the PRIZM   clusters at which 164 cases of hantavirus            had been diagnosed in the United States during 1993 through 1997. Residents            of these clusters then can be targeted as the priority audience to address            for prevention messages about hantavirus ( 6 ).           Community            Research           In support of ATSDR programs and initiatives (e.g., the              Minority Health Program  and the Child Health            Initiative) to define the issues concerning hazardous substances and            special populations, agency staff also use GIS technology and techniques            to conduct demographic research on populations living near hazardous            waste sites. This research helps ATSDR to understand the health status            of these segments of the population. For example, if racial/ethnic minority            groups and/or residents of areas designated as having lower socioeconomic            status are more adversely affected by close proximity to hazardous waste            sites, ATSDR must determine the implications for public health activities            in these areas.           In 1995, ATSDR published an article in the  International            Journal of Occupational Medicine and Toxicology  about a GIS approach            used to analyze the 1990 racial and ethnic composition of the population            near 1,200 National Priorities List sites ( 7 ).            Approximately 11 million persons were found to live within a 1-mile            buffer of these sites. ATSDR staff are updating this analysis using            current-year demographic estimates for race/ethnicity and socioeconomic            status and reviewing data for 1980-1999 to better understand the types            of demographic changes that occur in areas near hazardous waste sites.            Using the PRIZM segmentation system database, ATSDR is also studying            the types of neighborhoods in which              NPL             sites are found. An initial analysis of the data suggest that a concentration            of these sites exists in neighborhoods described as ""Middle America,""            ""Family Scramble,"" and ""Military Quarters.""           Creating            Community Profiles           ATSDR            is using a wide range of small-area demographic data to create community            profiles as a logical first step in its public health activities for            communities near hazardous waste sites. Data products from Census 2000            will provide up-to-date, small-area population and housing data. The            2000 TIGER/Line File, the digital database of U.S. geographic features            developed by the Bureau of the Census, will include Census 2000 statistical            area boundaries. Census 2000 and the 2000 TIGER/Line File are expected            to be available in spring 2001. ATSDR plans to publish a report this            fall on how the population changes reported in Census 2000 affect the            agency's population analysis for areas near hazardous waste sites. Significant            changes are not expected, except possibly in the reporting of race/ethnicity.            Census 2000—for the first time—instructs individuals to check one  or            more  categories on the form's race/ethnicity question. ATSDR will            continue to refine its GIS-based applications for population estimation            to produce more timely and accurate demographic data for communities            located near hazardous waste sites.

[Table of Contents]                            The          ABCs of GIS           Melissa Massaro, MA, ATSDR           Address-matching, buffering, and cartography are key tools used in a          geographic information system (GIS) to analyze information. The following          provides a brief explanation of these three ""ABCs of GIS.""                   ""A"" Is          for Address-Matching                                               Address-matching is a process                used by GIS analysts to assign geographic coordinates to addresses,                regardless of whether the coordinates belong to a site of concern,                participants in a study, or people and businesses in communities                surrounding hazardous areas. When applied to street addresses, this                process interpolates the exact geographic location on the basis                of where the street number falls within the address range on a street                segment. The result is the mapping of the address as a point location                from which other types of spatial analyses can be performed. In                the absence of addresses or where pin-point accuracy is desired,                the global positioning system (GPS) is another process often used                to locate points. GPS equipment calculates latitude and longitude                coordinates by using signals transmitted from satellites in orbit.                                   ""B"" Is for Buffering                                                                                                                                Address-matching is used to                      map the distribution of lead concentration in soil samples                      taken from residences near smelters in the Denver area.                                                                                                                                                                                                  Buffering is another GIS                feature frequently used for spatial analysis. The buffering functionality                of a GIS creates boundaries of a geographical area by measuring                a specified distance (e.g., 1 mile) from a specific geographic feature                (e.g., a hazardous waste site). This buffer area is then mapped                and overlaid with other data layers. The result is used by ATSDR                to identify areas in which to focus public health actions. For example,                populations that might have been exposed to hazardous chemicals                can be identified by their proximity to a site's contaminants or                plumes. Another powerful application of buffering is the capability                to extract features within a buffer area from other geographic data                sets to produce, for example, mailing lists or to identify unique                characteristics of the population.                                       ""C"" Is          for Cartography         Cartography is the science of map-making that sets forth the rules used          to abstract and symbolize the physical environment. Although a GIS has          the capacity to go well beyond map-making, cartography is one of the main          components used by GIS analysts to communicate information. GIS analysts          compile the relevant data by taking into consideration the appropriate          scale, level of detail, classification schemes, and symbolization used          in a GIS map. No amount of sophisticated spatial analysis performed using          GIS would be effective without incorporating these sound cartographic          principles of compilation, organization, and design.

As part of the 21st Century Master Address File /Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Enhancements initiative, the Geography Division is proposing an effort to streamline the process for collecting and disseminating the geographic and cartographic data and modernizing the corresponding technology. In the early 1980s, in an effort to streamline these activities, the Geography Division broke new ground by developing a valuable national resource to assist in conducting the census--the TIGER geographic data base. TIGER includes geographic features, such as roads, railroads, water, boundaries, and other geographic information needed to support the programs of the U.S. Census Bureau. TIGER is used extensively within the Bureau, and for many purposes other than the census by local/tribal governments and private industry. The TIGER data base collects street address ranges, ZIP Codes, and feature names--it does not contain specific addresses. To provide accurate address data that could be maintained and updated, the Bureau developed the MAF in the 1990s. The MAF includes addresses that allow census forms to be mailed and, in some cases, provides descriptions of living quarters enabling census enumerators to deliver forms. Further, the MAF has a geocoding linkage to the postal information in TIGER. Although TIGER is part of the public domain, MAF is restricted from public use by Title 13 of the U. S. Code. The use of MAF/TIGER greatly improved the accuracy of addresses, geographic features, and boundaries and improved the efficiency of Bureau operations. Today, however, the functional processes that MAF/TIGER were designed to support have expanded significantly and the technology available to support these processes has improved dramatically. Additionally, preparations for Census 2000 highlighted the need for this aging national resource to be updated to successfully execute the activities up to and including the 2010 decennial census. As a first step to better understand the expanded functions, the high-level requirements, and unmet needs, BoozAllen & Hamilton MAF/TIGER Modernization Study team members spoke with approximately 70 users and stakeholders. The team interviewed staff and managers across the Bureau and Geography Division and spoke with selected organizations external to the Bureau. The comments and opinions identified during these interviews are included in the body and appendices of this document. During interviews with Geography Division managers, these requirements were mapped to the following four initiative objectives that the Geography Division proposed to supplement and enhance the Geographic Support base program:  Correctly locate every street and other map feature in the TIGER data base, each MAF address, and implement an effective automated feature change detection methodology  ES-1  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study    Implement a modern processing environment for the MAF/TIGER system that will support rapid application development, allow extensive use of commercially available software, and reduce staff training time Expand and encourage geographic partnership programs with state, local, and tribal governments that update the MAF/TIGER data base, including a ""rolling LUCA"" to maintain a current address list for use by all Bureau censuses and surveys and computerbased updates of governmental unit boundaries and other geographic areas    Implement a comprehensive plan for periodic MAF/TIGER evaluation and corrective activities that will guide planning for cost-effective future coverage and geocoding improvement operations. Recent legislation and current efforts underscore the need to implement these objectives. For example, in 1994, Congress passed the Census Address List Improvement Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-430) mandating that the Bureau improve its partnerships with local and tribal governments by allowing them to review and update the census address list before the decennial census. The address list review requirement alone leads to functional process issues, such as the mechanism for communicating and updating address file data, that must be addressed by appropriately selecting technologies that will meet the objectives of the Bureau. For example, improving the ability to provide the Bureau's partners with timely data that is accessible and easy to work with would demonstrate the Bureau's commitment to partnership. Such examples have led the Geography Division to embark on the 21st Century MAF/TIGER Enhancements initiative. While multiple examples of functional and operational improvements will be addressed through the 21st Century MAF/TIGER Enhancements initiative, three key areas that will see significant improvement include--  Increased Use of the Internet--To increase voluntary participation, the Geography Division proposes developing an Internet-based geographic and address update program. This program will enable participating local and tribal governments to incorporate the review and update of address, street, and boundary information into their normal business processes, improving timeliness and accuracy of the data. Increased Accuracy of Address List and Map Feature Information--To maintain this valuable and permanent asset, the Bureau proposes establishing a program to validate the current address list information and provide for its continuous maintenance until the 2010 decennial census. This program will provide a highly accurate and up-to-date resource that will be available to support other core activities of the U.S. Census Bureau that rely on address list and map feature information.    Improved Tools Supporting Field Operations--The 21st Century MAF/TIGER Enhancements initiative proposes improving the quality and efficiency of collecting and processing geographic data by taking advantage of commercially available state-of-theart tools and techniques. Taking advantage of current technology moves data collection  ES-2  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  from a less accurate, less efficient paper-based system to a more precise digitized approach. This modernization study is the first step in addressing the functional requirements and technologies needed to more accurately and efficiently conduct the decennial census. As the 21st Century MAF/TIGER Enhancements initiative continues, it is expected that the functional requirements will be further refined. Additionally, it is expected that applicable technologies will continue to mature, contributing to further improvements in the accuracy and efficiency of this national effort. This study addresses these issues as follows: Chapter 1: Introduction and Background--Provides an introduction to the MAF/TIGER Modernization Study, including a high-level review of the challenges currently faced by the U.S. Census Bureau, a review of its overarching goals, and a review of the various geographic databases targeted by the initiative.

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND The mission of the U.S. Census Bureau is-- ""to be the preeminent collector and provider of timely, relevant, and quality data about the people and economy of the United States."" 1.1 Introduction The U.S. Census Bureau is the largest statistical agency of the U.S. Government. It conducts the constitutionally mandated Census of Population and Housing every 10 years to apportion seats in the House of Representatives, and it conducts 8 censuses related to economic activities and state and local government operations every 5 years. In addition, the Bureau conducts more than 100 demographic and economic surveys on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis. The tremendous array of information the Bureau collects describes the Nation's population, housing, businesses, government finances, foreign trade, and other vital characteristics. Analysis of this information forms the basis for decisions by a wide variety of entities including the Congress; the administration; private businesses; and state, local, and tribal planners. The Bureau is composed of three core program areas: Decennial, Economic, and Demographic. The Decennial program's principal activity is the decennial census, which is the Nation's oldest and most comprehensive source of population and housing information. The U.S. Government uses the results of the decennial census to apportion the seats in the House of Representatives. Decennial census data are also used in redistricting decisions and distribution of billions of dollars in federal funds. The diverse activities of the Economic program produce information that is critical to the economic functioning of the Nation. Data such as housing starts, retail sales, wholesale trade, merchandise imports and exports, mining, and manufacturing are collected each month. These data support several leading indicators of national economic performance that influence decisions made by the Federal Reserve Board and Wall Street investors. The Demographic program activities include the preparation of official population estimates and projections and the collection of survey data for official statistics on income and poverty, families, race and ethnic groups, and the Nation's housing characteristics. The collection and analysis of housing and socioeconomic data also supports the decennial census. Reimbursable agreements with other federal agencies compose a large part of the Demographic program. For example, data from the Bureau's Consumer Expenditures Survey is an important element of the Consumer Price Index, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates and publishes. The Current Population Survey gathers data to calculate employment and unemployment statistics. The Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation provides other government agencies with data to evaluate the effects of their programs on the population.  1-1  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  The statistical sampling techniques employed by the Bureau rely on relatively small samples of data that must be highly accurate to be considered valid. The credibility of the studies and surveys conducted by the Bureau relies on the accuracy of the address list and geographic database, which are critical elements of the Bureau's geographic support program. The goal of geographic support is to provide the basic maps, address lists, address and geographic reference files, and associated processing systems needed to meet the geographic requirements of all Bureau programs. To support its goal, the Bureau has developed an integrated computer-based Geographic Support System (GSS). The GSS needs to acquire large volumes of data from many external sources to establish and maintain a current and complete inventory of streets, roads, street names, address ranges, housing unit identifiers and addresses, and accurate geographic boundaries and their identifiers and other map information. This information must be updated periodically to meet the needs of the economic census, the current demographic statistics program, the intercensal demographic estimates program, and the future continuous measurement activities conducted by the Bureau. Among the most important information technology resources used by the Bureau is the electronic address list of housing units located throughout the United States and the related island areas where it performs the censuses and surveys. This electronic address list is referred to as the Master Address File (MAF) and is one of the primary geographic support databases. Another critical geographic database is the Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) system. The TIGER system is a companion system to the MAF that contains an inventory of geographic features and manmade structures. Key to this inventory is the geographic locations of all the features and structures and their linkage to specific addresses in the MAF. The geographic features and structures contained in TIGER describe the street network for the United States and the current governmental and statistical boundaries and their identifiers used for so many of the Bureau's activities. The accuracy and coverage of the current address and geographic databases is a significant issue for the three major programs of the Bureau. Although the accuracy and coverage of the existing inventory of residential structures is adequate for meeting Bureau performance levels, the inventory of business structures is barely adequate. The current state of the inventory of addresses is compromised by the absence of addresses for existing structures, the presence of addresses for structures that no longer exist, and most problematic, duplicate addresses for discrete structures. The TIGER system is based on custom software developed by the Bureau during the 1980s. The TIGER system has essentially remained in its originally designed format and operating environment. Many of the original design and platform decisions were based on the state of information technology at that time and do not meet current technological expectations for data management and user accessibility.  1-2  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  The current TIGER system does not support the real-time concurrent updating of data. Bureau staff who are responsible for updating the information in the TIGER data base are required to ""check out"" the particular portion of the database, known as a ""partition,"" that contains the geographic area requiring updating. During this time, the ""checked out"" geographic area is available for viewing only by other Bureau staff and does not include visibility into the updates being applied. The period of time that a partition can remain ""checked out"" can be extensive depending on the extent of the changes that need to be made. The inability of the TIGER system to support real-time concurrent updating of geographic information causes significant operational issues concerning workload management, coordination of program activities, and accuracy of the TIGER products produced. These problems cause the need for more resources and time for the execution of the field operations that support the three primary programs of the Bureau than would otherwise be necessary. Strategies to mitigate these issues have proven very expensive. With important matters such as federal funding and congressional redistricting depending on the accuracy and completeness of the geographic databases, the Bureau has been forced to execute costly field operations to ensure the integrity of the databases. Over the past decade, the Bureau has spent approximately $250 million on projects such as block canvassing and address listing to improve the accuracy of the address and geographic databases. The principal address and geographic databases that support the Bureau's core programs, including MAF and TIGER, are administered and maintained by the Geography Division within in the Decennial Census Directorate. The mission of the Geography Division is-- ""the development and accomplishment of all geographic and cartographic activities necessary to support the U.S. Census Bureau's data collection, processing, tabulation, and dissemination programs for the United States and its related island areas."" The Geography Division is proposing a 21st Century MAF/TIGER Enhancements initiative to provide significant improvements in the operational processes that support the decennial census, quinquennial economic censuses, and numerous economic and demographic surveys that measure changing individual and household demographics and the economic condition of the Nation. These improvements will help the Bureau address the differential undercount of children, renters, and minorities. At the same time, they will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of enumeration operations and in the process save money and deliver results more quickly. The three key areas that will contribute to these performance improvements are  Increased Use of the InternetTo increase the voluntary participation of the 39,000 local and tribal governmental units in the United States in maintaining the Bureau's MAF and TIGER data base, an Internet-based MAF/TIGER update program will be developed. By establishing this Internet-based system, the local and tribal governments will be empowered to incorporate the review and update of address and related statistical  1-3  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  information into their normal business process, improving the timeliness and accuracy of the data and streamlining the current manual process.  Increased Accuracy of Address List and Map Feature InformationThe Bureau uses the MAF information to deliver census questionnaires to every housing unit, check in returned questionnaires, and make follow-up visits to those housing units from which a questionnaire was not returned. Without a control address list, an accurate census is not possible. The current practice is to update the address list information used in the previous decennial census with current information. This is a costly and resourceintensive effort that requires an estimated $300 million each decade to complete. To maintain in a current and complete state this valuable and permanent asset, the Bureau will establish a program that will validate the current address list information and provide for its continuous maintenance until the 2010 decennial census. This program will provide a highly accurate and up-to-date resource that will be available to support other core activities that rely on address list information. Improved Tools Supporting Field OperationsThe current field operations supporting the decennial census require nearly 20 million black and white map sheets and 13.1 million pages of address lists. Any identified updates to the information presented on these paper instruments must be manually documented and processed at a later time. The current state of information technology has rendered these practices inefficient and archaic. To improve the efficiency of field operations, the Bureau will initiate a program to develop the use of commercially available software and hardware, to create tools designed to streamline the capture of decennial census information and the geographic information required to support census execution.    1.2 Geographic Databases The seven information systems that will be impacted by the 21st Century MAF/TIGER Enhancements initiative are-- Master Address File (MAF) System Topological Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) System Geographic Catalogue (GEOCAT) System Geographic Programs Participant (GPP) System Problem Referral (PRS) System Production Control (PCS) System Windowing Index (Windex) System. The MAF and TIGER systems provide the core information and work products that support the Bureau's programs while the other systems, particularly the Production Control System (PCS), provide critical support functions for managing the execution of the programs. 1.2.1 Master Address File System Following the 1990 decennial census, the Bureau undertook, for the first time, the development of a permanent housing unit address list, the MAF. Previously, address lists were prepared for  1-4  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  each decennial census and then discarded. The Address Control File (ACF) from the 1990 census was a starting point for the MAF. The MAF contains millions of records of housing unit mailing addresses, locational descriptions known to the Bureau, and nonresidential addresses such as those for businesses. The MAF lists every known residential address, whether occupied or vacant. The address list record includes the street address, mailing address, and geographic codes linking the record to U.S. Census Bureau geography. The MAF is for internal Bureau use only; the individual address data it contains are restricted from public use by Title 13 of the U.S. Code. The MAF contains several types of addresses. City-style addresses include a house number and street name (e.g., 123 Main Street). They also may contain a unit designator for multiunit structures (e.g., Apartment B). They generally are a permanent identification for each structure and are part of an address system. Non-city-style addresses do not use a house number and street name description. They often are found in rural areas. Post Office box numbers are the most common form of non-city-style address; other forms include general delivery, rural route, and highway contract route addresses. These types of addresses rarely conform to any address system, and they are not a permanent identifier for a structure; they often are used by the occupant of the structure and can be taken or used by the occupant if (s)he moves to a different structure within the same postal delivery area. Also, they are not associated with any street name, which makes relating them to U.S. Census Bureau geography (geocoding) difficult. Residential addresses are associated with a dwelling or housing unit. Nonresidential addresses are for structures or units within a structure that are used for business or other nonresidential, purposes. Residential and nonresidential addresses may be city- or non-city-style addresses. The MAF is updated regularly from numerous sources. For Census 2000, the primary source of updates was the U.S. Postal Service's (USPS) Delivery Sequence File (DSF). Other sources include field operations sponsored by the Bureau (e.g., Address Listing, Block Canvassing, Special Place Address Listing, List/Enumerate). In addition, local and tribal governments were asked to participate in the Local Update of Census Addresses (LUCA) Program and the new construction program to review each address in the MAF and provide missing addresses and missing streets/street names for the TIGER data base. The Geography Division updates the MAF and produces address-related products from it. These products include address listings, address extracts, and housing unit counts. The MAF is geographically structured through its geocoding linkage to the street name/address range/ZIP Code/map spot location information in the TIGER data base. 1.2.2 Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing System In the early 1980s, the Geography Division created the TIGER data base, initially for use in the 1990 decennial census, to manage all relevant geographic features, boundaries, and area identifiers needed to take the census. The database includes roads, railroads, water features, official boundaries, and other information for the entire United States and its related island areas. In addition to feature information, attributes of the features are collected (e.g., feature names, street address ranges, ZIP Codes). The database also contains codes for every geographic area, used for U.S. Census Bureau data tabulation, down to the census block level. Currently, 1-5 June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  TIGER contains some housing unit location information for non-city-style addresses (digitized map spots) that are linked to associated records in the MAF. The database and its rich set of attributes are used by every branch in the Geography Division and by many other divisions within the Bureau. Also, one extract of the TIGER data base, called the TIGER/Line file, is distributed to the general public for use in numerous geographic and demographic applications. The TIGER/Line files are credited with being a vital contributing factor in the development of the Geographic Information System (GIS) industry in the United States, and TIGER is considered a national resource. The Geography Division updates the TIGER data base with current geographic feature information and attributes, such as new boundary information, road information, and housing unit locations. Several programs to improve TIGER currency are sponsored by the Geography Division, such as the MAF Geocoding Office Resolution (MAFGOR). In addition, the Geography Division uses the TIGER data base to produce maps for collection and dissemination of data, perform geocoding, provide geographic reference files, and prepare a variety of other products. Although the TIGER data base has been modified over time, it remains in basically the same format and on basically the same platform as it was for the 1990 decennial census. The Geography Division's internal version of the TIGER data base is housed on a Compaq (digital alpha) computer in Bowie, Maryland. The information in the database is contained in approximately 3,200 distinct files called partitions. Each partition represents a segment of geographic information, usually based on a county. It is stored in a ""homegrown"" format and accessed only through Bureau-created software. Many branches in the Geography Division have large investments in in-house software that provides mission-critical functions using the TIGER data base. In addition, the internal Census TIGER processing is performed on a variety of systems (Compaq Open Virtual Memory System [VMS], Silicon Graphics IRIX, Windows). 1.2.3 Geographic Catalogue System The Geographic Catalogue System (GEOCAT) is an ORACLE-based system that provides nonspatial reference information for every ""named"" geographic area. These ""named"" geographic areas can be either a legal entity such as a state, county, or city or a statistical entity, such as a census tract or designated urbanized area. The GEOCAT stores nonspatial information concerning these ""named"" geographic areas, such as functional status, land area, and population. In addition, the GEOCAT contains an historical thread, or audit trail, of all the boundary changes that have occurred over time to the legal geographic area. The GEOCAT and TIGER geographic area lists are not integrated. To ensure consistency, the lists of legal and statistical geographic areas in the two systems are synchronized periodically through an electronic batch process. 1.2.4 Geographic Programs Participant System The GPP System is an ORACLE-based system that supports the execution of Bureau programs by providing a tool to manage and coordinate the interaction between the Bureau and external 1-6 June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  participating organizations. The GPP establishes a relationship among the specific program, the geographic area targeted by the program, and the organization that is representing the geographic area that is participating in the program. Only legal geographic areas or tribal statistical areas are included in the GPP. The participating organization can be a local government or a pseudogovernmental organization, such as the Washington Regional Council of Governments. The GPP contains information documenting the timeline and milestones of an organization's interaction with the Bureau and its participation in a specific program. Information such as when an organization was invited to participate, when the organization agreed to participate, when material was sent out, and when the updated materials were returned is captured in the GPP. The GPP is a key resource in the execution of critical Bureau programs such as the LUCA program, and the Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS). The GPP and GEOCAT geographic area lists are not integrated. The lists of legal geographic areas in the two systems are synchronized periodically through an electronic batch process to ensure consistency. 1.2.5 Production Control System The PCS is a system that supports the execution of Bureau programs by providing a tool to manage and coordinate the maintenance of TIGER partitions. The PCS uses the same Bureaudeveloped database engine that supports both MAF and TIGER. The information stored in the TIGER system periodically requires review and adjustment. This review and adjustment is performed by various Bureau organizations throughout the country. Every significant Bureau program that involves maintaining the geographic information in the TIGER system has a specific set of activities that are tracked from initiation to completion within the PCS. PCS provides an automated system that coordinates these activities, tracks the status of each TIGER partition, and analyzes the adjustments to ensure that data integrity is maintained. In addition, the PCS also coordinates the execution of other activities and processes that require the availability of the TIGER partitions and ensure that prerequisite activities have satisfactorily been completed before permitting a subsequent activity to be initiated. The PCS and GEOCAT geographic area lists are not integrated. The lists of geographic areas in the two systems are synchronized periodically through an electronic batch process to ensure consistency. The PCS receives date-related information from the GPP through an electronic batch process. 1.2.6 Problem Referral System The Problem Referral System (PRS) is an ORACLE-based incident tracking system that serves as a repository for all incidents that are related to the address and geographic databases. Incidents of operational failure can be entered into the system automatically or entered manually by Bureau staff. The PRS provides Bureau staff with visibility into any potential system-related 1-7 June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  issues with the address and geographic databases that would affect the staff's work schedule. Once an incident has been resolved, the PRS is updated to reflect the current status of the incident and its resolution. The PRS is tightly integrated with the PCS to support the automatic entry of operational failures in the PCS. 1.2.7 Windowing Index System Windex is a TIGER DB-based spatial index of the TIGER partitions. The TIGER data that represent a geographic area can span multiple TIGER partitions. Windex contains the specific geospatial coordinates for determining the dimensional boundaries of geographic areas. This information indicates what TIGER partitions are necessary to achieve a complete representation of the targeted geographic area. 1.3 MAF/TIGER System Modernization The MAF and TIGER systems have served the Geography Division and other Bureau customers well. However, modernization of the databases and the systems that support them will yield efficiency and accuracy that cannot be accomplished with the current processing system and database content. Therefore, as part of the 21st Century MAF/TIGER Enhancements initiative, the Geography Division is proposing a processing system modernization objective. This objective will allow the Bureau to expand the sources of data from which the database is built, forge stronger relationships with its partners, and provide higher quality products for internal and external customers. Although all programs that use geographic and address data will benefit from the initiative, some new programs depend directly on the success of the initiative and the ability of the Bureau to update the address database continually. The Geography Division has developed budget estimates for its Geographic Support base program. The base program estimates allow periodic updating of the address list and geographic features that meet the minimal needs of mapping, reference file creation, and address listings. The base program funding will not support additional automation, improved accuracy of coordinates, or increased production needs. The base program has four components: 1. 2. 3. 4. Activities that build/maintain the MAF of housing units Continuing operations to link the MAF with the TIGER data base Continuing partnerships with state, local, and tribal governments Quality assurance for geographic support products.  To improve MAF and TIGER, unfunded enhancements to the base program are included in the initiative. The proposed enhancements include the use of Global Positioning System (GPS) and aerial/satellite imagery technology to provide more precise location information that can correct the locations of all streets and other map features in the TIGER data base and also provide a correct location for every housing unit address in the MAF; use commercial software tools where  1-8  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  none existed at the time the databases were created; encourage improved relationships with Bureau geographic program partners; and improve database quality in all areas. The unfunded enhancements will enable the Geography Division to meet major goals. One major goal is improving the processing environment and using commercially available tools wherever feasible, economical, and practical. Another goal of the 21st Century MAF/TIGER Enhancements initiative is to improve accuracy of the database using aerial/satellite imagery or other sources to realign existing coordinates for features and existing housing units and place them in the TIGER data base. Improving the accuracy of the coordinates will streamline Bureau operations by allowing GPS technology to gather accurate housing unit location information in relation to an accurate base map, which will enable enumerators to relocate those structures in the field, when necessary, for follow-up operations. In addition, a more accurate base map will alleviate a publicly perceived problem with census geographic data and also facilitate digital data exchange with federal, tribal, state, local, and private partners. Sharing of geospatial data will improve relationships with partners and ultimately enhance the Bureau's geographic programs. 1.4 Objectives of the 21st Century MAF/TIGER Enhancements During interviews with Geography Division management, the following objectives were identified and associated with the four initiative components: 1. Correctly locate every street and other map feature in the TIGER data base, each MAF address, and implement an effective automated feature change detection methodology-- Integrate the address list, geographic update, and data collection activities Improve feature change detection Enhance the accuracy of geographic features Automate field data collection Add geographic coordinates for building structures. 2. Implement a modern processing environment for the MAF/TIGER system that will support rapid application development, allow extensive use of commercially available software, and reduce staff training time-- Modernize the processing environment Identify new technology and commercial software useful to the system. 3. Expand and encourage geographic partnership programs with state, local, and tribal governments that update the MAF/TIGER data base, including a ""rolling"" LUCA to maintain a current address list for use by all Bureau censuses and surveys and computerbased updates of governmental unit boundaries and other geographic areas-- Promote and expand partnerships with data providers Identify new address and geographic data sources.  1-9  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  4. Implement a comprehensive plan for periodic MAF/TIGER evaluation and corrective activities that will guide planning for cost-effective future coverage and geocoding improvement operations-- Improve the quality of geographic products Implement a MAF/TIGER quality assurance program Institute a field operation to evaluate the quality of MAF/TIGER (e.g., maps, lists, questionnaires) with electronic products. 1.5 Standards and Guidelines The 21st Century MAF/TIGER Enhancements initiative represents a significant investment in information technology for the U.S. Census Bureau. The Bureau will follow a management strategy that supports the information technology management improvement goals of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-16, OMB Circular A-119, Executive Order (E.O.) 12906, and related guidance provided by the Department of Commerce. Standards for geographic and spatial data have begun to emerge over the past few years. However, many of them are not yet mature or accepted by the industry, many are still in the discussion stage, and standards for many important topics have not yet begun to be developed. Regardless of the state of development of standards, it is in the interest of all federal government agencies, the U.S. Census Bureau in particular, to follow the policy of OMB Circular A-119 to comply with these emerging and voluntary standards. Failure to do so will compromise the ability of the Bureau to share data with other organizations in the future. The Geography Division should continue to monitor the development of geospatial data standards and participate in their development when appropriate. The primary organizations involved in the development of these standards are the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC); the International Standards Organization, Technical Committee 211 (ISO/TC 211); and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). In addition to the formal standards bodies, the Open GIS Consortium (OGC) is attempting to establish best practices for geospatial software developers to follow, which may become de facto standards in the future. Again, the Bureau should continue to monitor these activities and participate as appropriate. 1.6 Study Organization The MAF/TIGER Modernization Study has been organized into three chapters and includes eight appendixes. A brief description of each section follows: Chapter 1: Introduction and Background--Provides an introduction to the MAF/TIGER Modernization Study, including a high-level review of the challenges currently faced by the U.S. Census Bureau, a review of its overarching goals, and a review of the various geographic databases targeted by the initiative.

REQUIREMENTS AND OBJECTIVES The MAF/TIGER system is an aging national resource. It has been used to support not only the various censuses and household surveys managed by the U.S. Census Bureau, but also as the foundation of the burgeoning Geographic Information System (GIS) industry in the United States. Although the MAF/TIGER system has been able to meet, and often exceed, most of the Bureau's geographic requirements up through Census 2000, operational managers throughout the Bureau have expressed concerns that the Bureau cannot successfully conduct the 2010 census without significant enhancements to the system. To document these concerns the BoozAllen & Hamilton MAF/TIGER Modernization Study team conducted interviews and facilitated discussion groups with approximately 70 MAF/TIGER users and stakeholders (see Table 2-1). These users and stakeholders represented the Bureau's data collection and data analysis organizations; state, local, and tribal governments; and other federal agencies. The interviews and facilitated discussions were held between November 1999 and May 2000. Please refer to Appendix A for additional information concerning the organizations that participated in the interviews and facilitated discussions. Table 2-1. Organizational Areas Interviewed ORGANIZATIONS U.S. Census Bureau Customers Geography Program Managers Field Operations Managers External Users/Customers NUMBER OF INTERVIEWS/ DISCUSSIONS  4 14  After all of the interviews and facilitated discussions were completed, the BoozAllen & captured to facilitate the extraction of general requirements. All comments and opinions concerning a particular MAF/TIGER subject area were grouped together and combined where Technical, functional, administrative, and organizational areas were covered by the comments and opinions. The results of the interviews and facilitated discussions were then a result, 354 general MAF/TIGER requirements were identified. It is important to note that these general MAF/TIGER requirements are not intended to represent detailed functional requirements current MAF/TIGER system feel are not being satisfied. Once the general requirements were extracted, the Modernization Study team analyzed them. Based on this analysis, the team grouped the 354 general MAF/TIGER requirements into seven high-level categories. Table 2-2 provides a in each high-level category, and the sources that identified the requirement.  2-1  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  Table 2-2.

The U.S. Census Bureau must have a database that contains a record for each location for which the Bureau should collect data. For demographic censuses and surveys, these places would include housing unit building structures and also a wide variety of other locations used as primary residences, referred to as special places and group quarters. These special places and group quarters include college dormitories, hospitals, prisons, monasteries, nunneries, half-way houses, homeless shelters. Less permanent habitations, such as common areas where homeless people tend to congregate (e.g., tents, cardboard boxes), are not included in the database but are visited in special operations during censuses and surveys. For economic censuses and surveys, the Bureau has determined that it will not use the MAF/TIGER database as its source for nonresidential addresses. There is, however, a strong need for the nonresidential addresses in demographic data collection. The status of a structure may frequently change between residential and nonresidential, and frequently a mix exists within a single structure. Leaving nonresidential addresses out of the MAF/TIGER database results in an incomplete list of addresses, which can lead to uncertainty about the accuracy of the list. The incomplete list can also make it very difficult for field workers and local/tribal governments to determine which units are nonresidential and therefore not to be included in the demographic census or survey. Also, a list of nonresidential structures is needed to support demographic data collection related to the workplace. The major change proposed by the 21st Century MAF/TIGER Enhancements initiative is to base the residential and nonresidential inventory on building structures that are visible on the ground or in aerial/satellite imagery rather than lists of mailing addresses as has been done in the past. Mailing addresses are not a reliable source from which to determine a geographic location. Many mailing addresses cannot be geolocated (box numbers, rural routes), addressing schemes vary throughout the country, names of streets change or have alternates, house numbers are revised by local jurisdictions, and ZIP Codes are changed frequently by the U.S. Postal Service. Having a list composed of the coordinate location of each structure with the mailing address as an attribute will solve many of the problems of the past.  2-4  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  COMPONENT Maintain a mailing address for each structure.  BENEFITS AND IMPROVEMENTS Reduce duplicate addresses by basing the inventory on structures visible in imagery or on the ground rather than on mailing addresses. Reduce such as through and the the need for massive field operations, address listing and block canvassing the use of aerial or satellite imagery current MAF.  Maintain the geographic location of each structure by collecting a latitude/longitude coordinate.  Improve coverage by using imagery and field visits. Make structures in the field easier to find Tabulate data more accurately. Use GPS to locate structures. Identify new and missing structures through comparisons with sources outside of the Bureau. Use the results of matching for targeting areas for research through field operations or imagery. Make structures in rural areas easier to find.  Maintain the structure inventory by regular matching to other address list data files, such as USPS Delivery Sequence File, administrative records of the Social Security Service and other federal agencies, and files from local/tribal program participants. Maintain a link to a street segment for each structure.  2.1.2 High-Level Requirement #2--Maintain an Inventory of Legal and Statistical Geographic Areas Maintain an accurate and complete inventory of legal, administrative, and statistical geographic areas, their attributes and interrelationships. The Bureau must tabulate and report the data it collects for a wide variety of geographic areas. These include legal governmental areas, such as states, counties, cities, American Indian reservations; statistical areas, such as census tracts, census blocks, urbanized areas; and administrative areas, such as school districts, voting districts; and even internal administrative areas for census field work, such as regions, local census offices, and individual assignment areas. The current TIGER and GEOCAT data bases manage more than 9,000,000 geographic areas within 32 types of geographic activities. Detailed current boundaries are maintained along with identifying codes, names where appropriate, various status codes, relationships to other geographic areas, relationships to physical features, population and housing counts, and land and water areas. In addition to the data maintained in the past, the future MAF/TIGER data base should manage changes in geographic boundaries and their descriptions over time, provide ""boundary flags"" that  2-5  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  control the rules for changing boundaries, and maintain nonspatial relationships between geographic areas, such as place/minor civil division (MCD) dependency, coextensivity, American Indian Reservation--trust land relationships. COMPONENT Maintain accurate boundaries of all geographic areas including a record of their changes over time. BENEFITS AND IMPROVEMENTS Eliminate the need for historic or ""benchmark"" copies of TIGER to preserve past information. Improve update operations by maintaining ""boundary flags"" to direct the changes of related geographic areas. Improve boundary accuracy by including line work from the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) in MAF/TIGER. Maintain attribute information about each Allow for varying geographic area definitions geographic area including names, identification and relationships in different parts of the codes, area type classification, governmental country instead of forcing all states into the status. same model. Maintain nonspatial relationships between Provide more accurate control of geographic geographic areas. coverage in dependency and coextensive relationships. Eliminate need for separate ""collection Because building structures can be geography."" automatically allocated to any polygon based on the coordinate location of the structure, final tabulation census blocks can be generated by computer as soon as the final boundaries are available. Thus, there is no need for a separate set of blocks for collection purposes or massive ""block split"" operations. Impose standards for updating the database and Eliminate the practice of accepting the most create definitions for feature types. recently submitted change as the official version of the data or subjective interpretation of feature types. 2.1.3 High-Level Requirement #3--Maintain an Inventory of Road, Rail, Water, Landmark, Power Transmission Line, and Other Features Maintain an accurate and complete inventory of road, rail, water, landmark, power transmission line, and other features mapped for U.S. Census Bureau purposes. The current TIGER database maintains all street features along with their names, address ranges, and ZIP Codes where available. Water and rail features were derived from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Digital Line Graphs in rural areas and have been maintained only as needed for Bureau purposes. Within metropolitan areas, water and rail features were derived from Geographic Base File/Dual Independent Map Encoding (GBF/DIME) files and updated as  2-6  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  needed in response to Bureau operations. The overall positional accuracy of current TIGER features is in the 50100 meter range. In addition to the data above, the future system needs to contain a coordinate for every building structure, the lines from the Public Land Survey System (PLSS), more complete and more accurate hydrographic and rail features in urban areas; cadastral-level detail, such as street rightof-way and property lines in selected areas where needed to represent complex corporate boundaries and corridors; and all USPS geographic concepts, such as carrier routes and ZIP+4 Codes. Coordinates for all features must be corrected to within 48 meters of ground truth. COMPONENT Maintain information about each feature, such as feature type classification, coordinate location, names and postal geography. BENEFITS AND IMPROVEMENTS Expand geographic data from USPS and keep more current. Allow flexibility to represent unusual or alternative mailing addresses systems, such as Queens, Salt Lake City, Puerto Rico. Maintain the feature classification more simply and accurately, which will correct many problems with misleading symbolization on mapping products and reduce confusion in the field. Improve mapping products by providing continuity of features that cross international boundaries. Improve accuracy of boundaries that must follow poorly defined water features in urban areas. Improve the accuracy of the postal geography in MAF/TIGER.  Develop and impose a set of standards for feature classification and attribute content.  Include features from adjacent countries, such as Canada, Mexico, and Russia, near the borders of the United States. Provide adequate coverage of water features in former GBF/DIME file areas. Perform regular geocoding of the mailing addresses in the structure inventory to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the ZIP Codes, street names, and address ranges associated with each street segment. Impose standards for updating and provide precise metadata.  Eliminate the practice of accepting the most recently submitted change as the official version of the data.  2.1.4 High-Level Requirement #4--Use Geospatial Data Provided by External Sources Make use of geospatial data provided by federal, state, local, and tribal government partnerships, as well as private-sector sources, wherever possible. Many state, local, and tribal governments along with other federal agencies have collected data that is potentially very useful to the Bureau. The current methodology of gaining access to those data relies primarily on paper forms and maps and simple computer text files. The Geography  2-7  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  Division has developed an automated process for exchanging some geographic data (the digital exchange process), but that system requires expert manual intervention and is limited in the types of data that can be retrieved. Participant programs will be improved to allow Internet access to MAF/TIGER data and expanded electronic file submissions as well as continuing the traditional paper form and map methodology. COMPONENT Expand the use of geospatial data holdings from state, local, tribal governments, and other sources. Expand the use of electronic data exchange between the Bureau and program participants. Provide the ability for program participants to directly review and update MAF/TIGER. BENEFITS AND IMPROVEMENTS Reduce costs and improve accuracy by taking advantage of local geographic and address list knowledge. More accurate feature coordinates will allow automated matching of features between partner databases and MAF/TIGER. Reduce complaints from local/tribal partners about delay in feedback by providing direct access to MAF/TIGER on the Internet.  2.1.5 High-Level Requirement #5--Provide Geographic Products and Support Services Provide geographic and address list products and other support services to U.S. Census Bureau programs and census data users. To meet the needs of Bureau programs and data-user requirements, the Geography Division produces millions of paper maps, geocodes hundreds of millions of addresses, and creates a wide variety of data file extracts. Operations to provide these products consist of interactive update and database maintenance activities in the regional offices and the National Processing Center (NPC); cooperative partnership programs with state, local, and tribal governments; and massive batch computer processing supported by a highly automated work flow management system known as the Production Control System (PCS). Future product and support services will need to be expanded to send and receive data files to portable computers being used in field operations, provide on-demand data viewing and downloading capabilities throughout the Bureau, and provide data products via the Internet. COMPONENT Support operational and data user needs with mapping products. BENEFITS AND IMPROVEMENTS Reduce the need for paper maps through the increased use of computer displays of geographic information.  2-8  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  COMPONENT Expand and improve geocoding services.  BENEFITS AND IMPROVEMENTS Provide a National Geocoding System that is capable of geolocating any mailing address through a mix of automated and manual techniques. Provide interactive, on-demand geocoding for single addresses. Provide spatial and nonspatial data in formats that are commonly used with commercial software packages. With a coordinate location for building structures available, data tabulations can be done for any geographic area whose boundary is known. The data tabulation is performed on all housing units that fall within the boundary, and the relationship to census blocks is irrelevant. Provide on-demand viewing and data file downloads to data users inside the Bureau.  Improve data file extracts.  Provide ability to tabulate census data to any geographic area boundary.  Provide better MAF/TIGER viewing and browsing capabilities.  2.1.6 High-Level Requirement #6--Meet Requisite Standards Comply with applicable geographic data standards, guidelines and directives, and meet the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) objectives for the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) initiative, where appropriate. As mentioned in Chapter 1, standards for geographic and spatial data have begun to emerge over the past few years. However, many of them are not yet mature or accepted by the industry, many are still in the discussion stage, and standards for many important topics have not yet begun to be developed. Regardless of the state of development of standards, it is in the interest of all federal government agencies, the U. S. Census Bureau in particular, to follow the policy of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-119 to comply with these emerging and voluntary standards. Failure to do so will compromise the ability of the Bureau to share data with other organizations in the future. The Geography Division should continue to monitor the development of geospatial data standards and participate in their development when appropriate. In addition to the formal standards bodies, the Open GIS Consortium (OGC) is attempting to establish best practices for geospatial software developers to follow, which may become de facto standards in the future. Again, the Bureau should continue to monitor these activities and participate as appropriate. It must be noted that there are mandatory directives such as E.O. 12906 with which the Bureau must comply.  2-9  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  COMPONENT FGDC sponsored and recommended standards.  BENEFITS AND IMPROVEMENTS Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata. Spatial Data Transfer Standard. Cadastral Data Content Standard. Geospatial Positioning Accuracy Standard. The International Standards Organization Technical Committee 211 (ISO/TC 211) is in the process of developing standards for many major topics in geospatial data.  Other standards  2.1.7 High-Level Requirement #7--Improve Accuracy and Responsiveness of Geographic Support Improve the accuracy and responsiveness of the geographic support system to meet the needs of U.S. Census Bureau program managers, geographic program participants, and U.S. Census Bureau data product users. While both the TIGER and MAF databases were major innovations in the past, both are in need of very significant improvements to meet the needs of the future and solve problems of the past. Modernizing the database technology for MAF/TIGER can solve many operational problems of the past, such as multiuser access and availability of TIGER partitions. Commercial software and rapid application development techniques will reduce the amount of time and labor required for maintenance and product delivery. Use of GPS and portable computers can reduce labor in the field as well as in large office operations. Improving the accuracy of coordinate data will allow expanded partnership programs and reduce errors in many census and survey activities. COMPONENT Create an integrated geographic support database. Use modern database technology. BENEFITS AND IMPROVEMENTS Integrating MAF, TIGER, GEOCAT, GPP, PCS, PRS, and Windex will eliminate redundant and inconsistent data and the associated problems. Provide a seamless database of the entire United States without partitions; thus, eliminating long waits for access to partitions. Provide multiuser access as needed in update operations. Allow for multiple versions of the data rather than creating benchmark versions of the entire database.  2-10  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  COMPONENT Modernize the application development process.  BENEFITS AND IMPROVEMENTS Allow commercial GIS Packages to replace the functionality of custom-developed MAF/TIGER applications, where appropriate. Use other commercial software such as database report tools, spreadsheets, where possible. Use a component architecture for the development of all software modules to speed application development and allow for gradual system evolution. Attract programmers who will be able to further their careers with cutting-edge software. Provide computer-assisted navigation to lead field representatives to their assignments. Use portable computer displays instead of paper maps in field operations to provide more complete information. Use portable computers in field operations to provide automated error detection. Use GPS to locate structures for follow-up operations and to locate new structures and features. Avoid costly office operations by transmitting updates directly from the field rather than shipping, keying, and digitizing paper products. Use GPS for quality assurance of private sector and partner geospatial data. Use imagery to correct the location of features and locate building structures. Use the automated change detection capability of imagery to target areas of growth and change. Provide the ability to do automated matching and data transfer with other geospatial databases based on geometry.  Provide for computer-assisted field operations.  Use aerial and satellite imagery for data maintenance.  Expand and improve electronic digital exchange.  2-11  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  3. IMPLEMENTATION SCENARIOS In response to the feedback received during the interviews and facilitated discussions described in Chapter 2, the BoozAllen & Hamilton MAF/TIGER Modernization Study team has developed a number of suggested scenarios that would potentially satisfy the identified general requirements of MAF and TIGER. These suggested scenarios are directly related to the four objectives of the U.S. Census Bureau's 21st Century MAF/TIGER Enhancements initiative. The proposed scenarios include the use of GPS and aerial/satellite imagery technology, the use of commercially available database systems and associated software tools, the increased use of the Internet and electronic data exchanges, and the strengthening of existing quality assurance programs for the Bureau's geographic products and systems. The suggested scenarios were developed with sensitivity to both cost and schedule. Specifically, the scenarios provide approaches using different degrees of technology and contractor support, which influence the potential cost and the scenario's comprehensiveness in satisfying the objective. In support of the suggested scenarios, a potential implementation approach has also been developed by the BoozAllen & Hamilton MAF/TIGER Modernization Study team. This chapter provides a high-level description of these scenarios and their respective implementation approaches. 3.1 Objective 1--MAF and TIGER Data Objective 1 of the 21st Century MAF/TIGER Enhancements initiative is as follows: Correctly locate every street and other map feature in the TIGER data base, each MAF address, and implement an effective automated feature change detection methodology. For the Bureau's geographic databases to fully satisfy census requirements, the geographic locations of features and structures must be accurate enough to effectively locate them, and the linkage between the MAF and TIGER systems must achieve 99 percent accuracy. There are approximately 118 million housing units in the United States, and approximately 87 percent of these housing units are located on just 10 percent of the 3.8 million square miles that make up the United States. Clearly, a critical success factor in meeting the requirements for the Bureau's geographic databases is to focus its resources in these densely populated areas. To support the Geographic Support base program, the Bureau would continue to update geographic features and structures periodically in the MAF and TIGER data bases with input from local and tribal governments and from information received as a result of the Bureau's field operations conducted in support of other programs. In support of Objective 1, three scenarios were developed for validating and correcting the geolocations of the geographic features and structures in the TIGER data base.  3-1  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  3.1.1 Scenario 1--Local Government Files and Field Operations The first scenario proposes a number of activities that, when combined, will improve the accuracy of the location information in the TIGER data base. A key activity would be using local government files, where available, to more accurately depict the position of geographic features, update postal geography, and insert geographic locations of structures into the database. Another critical step in successfully implementing this scenario would be the Bureau conducting a specialized field operation to collect the geographic location of geographic features and of building structures in areas where local government files are not available. The GPS and mobile computer technology would be used in support of this field operation (see Appendix B--Mobile Computers and Global Positioning System). Figure 3-1 provides a graphical representation of the implementation of Scenario 1. Figure 3-1. Implementation of Scenario 1 for Objective 1  Local/Tribal File  Automated matching of streets/other map features and structures  Interactive review process for unmatched streets/ features/structures  MAF/TIGER  Address Listing Insert point landmarks using doorstep coordinates and link each to the appropriate MAF ID(s)  Reshape, add, and delete street and other map features  Maps  Field operation to collect GPS coordinates for doorsteps and feature anchor points (GR) 0004.15-07  3.1.2 Scenario 2--Off-the-Shelf Precision Imagery The second scenario would also use data obtained electronically from local governments but would introduce the use of high-precision imagery in correcting the locations of the geographic features and structures identified in the TIGER data base (see Appendix C--Imagery Assessment). Off-the-shelf high-precision imagery would be employed to provide images of 3-2 June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  high-growth areas in the United States while older high-precision imagery would be used to provide images of the more stable but densely populated areas of the United States. The highprecision imagery would be the basis for adjusting the locations of features in the TIGER data base and adding and deleting features. Contractor support would be required for extracting features and structures from the high-precision imagery and in reconciling the alignment of the extracted features and structures with the TIGER data base. For areas for which the use of high-precision imagery would not be cost effective, such as ""small settlements"" in rural areas, less expensive alternatives would be employed. For small settlements, a field operation using GPS-equipped vans would be initiated to collect structure locations and anchor points. For rural areas, older, less precise imagery would be used to correct feature positions and locations of structures. Figure 3-2 provides a graphical representation of the implementation of Scenario 2. Figure 3-2.

As an organization's information technology assets increase, more attention is focused on the processes and technology used to build and maintain those assets. When systems are small and support only a small portion of an organization's mission, it is possible to consider redesigning and replacing those systems that no longer adequately satisfy the business requirements or have become technologically obsolete. Systems that significantly support the mission of an organization are substantial investments, and their replacement would introduce a significant level of risk to an organization's operation. Increasingly, software that supports the core business processes of an organization is being viewed as an asset that represents an investment that grows in value. Therefore, a major challenge facing organizations today is how to build software assets whose technical design and environment support functional modularity, seamless 3-4 June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  integration, and architectural flexibility (see Appendix D--Current System Engineering Best Practices). As evidence of the increasing importance of software to organizations, attention is being focused on architecture and the systems that support the core business processes of an organization. Just as manufacturing industries have found they can leverage their asset base by restricting the amount of variation in their products, system developers are learning how to design and build software to serve multiple purposes by controlling and managing the amount of variation allowed in the software. They have learned that a core set of software assets can be leveraged to produce flexible inventories of software applications that can readily evolve to meet the changing requirements of an organization. In the recent past, traditional software development practices have produced systems that were custom developed as one-of-a-kind products. Integration between these types of systems can be effectively implemented only if the underlying business requirements are clearly understood. When systems can be successfully integrated, an organization has an information technology asset that effectively supports the targeted core business process or organizational mission. The core business processes supported by the Bureau's geographic databases require information technology assets that are both flexible and reliable. The current geographic databases used by the Bureau have adequately supported the core business processes but were designed and constructed as separate systems integrated through the use of links and pointers between related data sets. This design was established as a set of systems that require significant maintenance and locally acquired system knowledge. The MAF, TIGER, and PCS systems use the TIGER data base that was developed locally by the Bureau. The TIGER data base, developed for the 1990 census, provided the Bureau with a database management system that exceeded all expectations. In accordance with the SPAD report, the Bureau chose to develop the TIGER data base because no commercial alternative was available that supported the Bureau's geospatial requirements. Since the initial development of the TIGER data base, the geospatial capabilities of commercially available relational database management systems (RDBMS) have increased substantially (see Appendix E--Commercial Geospatial Software). In addition, the performance of current hardware platforms can easily compensate for any performance degradation that may result from any system overhead related to a relational model implementation (see Appendix F--Commercial Database Software). To support the Geographic Support base program, the Bureau would maintain the geographic databases and their associated application software as required to support the business processes of the Bureau. To improve the overall effectiveness of the geographic databases in supporting the Bureau's core business processes, three scenarios have been developed. The scenarios are based on the migration of the TIGER data base to a commercially available RDBMS. The three scenarios differ in the extent to which the databases are redesigned and the application software associated with the various geographic databases is adjusted or replaced.  3-5  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  3.2.1 Scenario 1--Database Migration In the first scenario, the MAF, TIGER, and PCS databases along with Windex and the PRS would be migrated to a commercially available RDBMS maintaining the current structure and data content of the two databases. The main effort required to successfully complete this scenario would be adjusting the respective system's application software to use the target RDBMS's application program interfaces (API) instead of the APIs that were previously used with the TIGER data base. The level of effort to complete this readjustment would be significant. Every application program would require individual inspection to determine where and how the program interacts with the TIGER data base and how it will interact with the targeted RDBMS. Once this analysis is completed, the application program would have to be modified, tested, and staged for implementation. The methodology to accomplish this scenario has characteristics that are similar to the effort required to prepare application software for the year 2000 transition. Figure 3-4 provides a graphical representation of the implementation of Scenario 1. Figure 3-4. Implementation of Scenario 1 for Objective 2 Design commercial database versions of MAF, TIGER, GEOCAT, and related systems  GEOCAT  MAF TIGER  Windex Load RDBMS databases  Production control  GPP  Problem Referral System  New TIGER New MAF  New GEOCAT  New Geographic Program Participant (GPP)  New Windex  New Problem Referral System  New Production Control Systems  Resume operations Convert all software applications to operate with a commercial database that will meet the geographic support needs of the U.S. Census Bureau (GR)0004.15-02  3.2.2 Scenario 2--System Redesign In the second scenario, the geographic databases would be migrated to a commercially available RDBMS, but the current data structure and content of the geographic databases would be 3-6 June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  redesigned. The current application software supporting the geographic databases would also be redesigned. It is expected that the software development effort would take advantage of the development tool suites associated with the selected RDBMS, such as Oracle's Developer 2000. Where practical, commercially available GIS would be incorporated into the system architecture design to provide system functionality rather than develop unique software to provide the functionality. Figure 3-5 provides a graphical representation of the implementation of Scenario 2. Figure 3-5. Implementation of Scenario 2 for Objective 2  Design a new database to meet all geographic support needs of the U.S. Census Bureau  GEOCAT  MAF  TIGER  Windex  Production Control Load RDBMS database  Geographic Program Participant ( GPP)  Problem Referral System  MAF/TIGER  Develop a new application suite from COTs products and custom-written modules  Resume operations  (GR)0004.15-03  3.2.3 Scenario 3--Commercially Available GIS In the third scenario, the functionality provided by the geographic databases would be migrated to a commercially available GIS product or suite of products. The geographic databases would be migrated to the database management system supported by the GIS vendor. In addition, a thorough gap analysis of the current functionality that the geographic databases provide the Bureau and the standard functionality supported by the GIS product(s) would be required. Any identified deficiencies would require adjustments to the Bureau's business processes that currently rely on the functionality or would require that the functionality be added to the GIS product(s) through custom development. Figure 3-6 provides a graphical representation of the implementation of Scenario 3.  3-7  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  Figure 3-6. Implementation of Scenario 3 for Objective 2  Design a new database to meet all geographic support system functions using a commercial GIS  GEOCAT  MAF TIGER  Product Control Windex Load GIS database Problem Referral System  Geographic Program Participant (GPP)  GIS MAF/TIGER  Customize GIS functions to meet the geographic support needs of the U.S. Census Bureau  Resume operations  ( GR) 0004.15-04  To support execution of the various scenarios, a structured project management approach would be followed that incorporates, where appropriate, a rigorous application development methodology. The application development methodology would be based on an incremental development strategy that supports the deployment of discrete segments of functionality as they are developed. 3.3 Objective 3--Geographic Partnerships Objective 3 of the 21st Century MAF/TIGER Enhancements initiative is as follows: Expand and encourage geographic partnership programs with Federal, state, local, and tribal governments that update the MAF/TIGER data base, including a ""rolling"" LUCA to maintain a current address list for use by all Bureau censuses and surveys and computerbased updates of governmental unit boundaries and other geographic areas. One of the reasons the information technology environment is changing so rapidly is the emergence of integrating infrastructures. With improved integration, the Internet, particularly the World Wide Web (WWW) and electronic commerce have flourished. Where once information systems were segregated and difficult to access, they are now engineered to be accessed using the Web and interfacing software (see Appendix G--Internet-Enabled Applications).  3-8  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  The Internet affords a number of innovative ways to connect users both inside organizations and between organizations. Within organizations, intranets are being used not only to connect divisions and departments but also to facilitate the interaction and collaboration of work groups and project teams located in disparate geographical locations. Between organizations, extranets connect businesses with their trading partners and customers. The extranet is becoming a medium for exchanging information and providing a clear channel for timely communications. The Bureau values the active participation of its geographic partners (i.e., state, local, tribal governments, and private sector) in maintaining the accuracy and currency of its geographic databases. The Bureau encourages local participation in its programs to the maximum extent feasible. The quality and meaningfulness of data describing the local communities are ensured when this partnership exists. This partnership has proven successful over the years but relies on processes and tools that have lagged behind changes in technology. To continue supporting the Geographic Support base program, the Bureau will follow established procedures and processes in soliciting current geographic information from its geographic partners. These procedures and processes support programs such as the Boundary and Annexation Survey, the Local Update of Census Addresses, and the Census 2000 Redistricting Data Program. These processes include providing printed materials that are manually updated by the geographic partners and returned for processing by the Bureau through manual office operations. Electronic files are also used for updating the geographic databases when available. To improve the interaction between the Bureau and its geographic partners, and in the process increase their level of participation, three scenarios have been proposed. 3.3.1 Scenario 1--Annual Boundary and Annexation Survey The first scenario calls for the development of an electronic data interchange program that supports the submission of boundary and other geographic changes in a computer file rather than on paper maps and forms. The BAS would determine the inventory of legally defined entities and the correct names, governmental descriptions, and legal boundaries of counties and equivalent areas; minor civil divisions; incorporated places; and Native American reservations. Specifically, the BAS would attempt to obtain current boundary information for local and tribal governments; information on the legal actions that had changed local and tribal governmental boundaries; the correct legal name and designation for an entity, such as a city, township, or reservation; updates to the streets and other information shown on Bureau maps; and correct address break information at the boundary of local or tribal governments. The development of an interactive process that facilitates the automated update of the Bureau's geographic databases from information supplied by the Bureau's geographic partners is key to this electronic data interchange program. The process would accommodate extracts from the geographic partner's GIS systems as well as updates supplied manually. Figure 3-7 provides a graphical representation of the implementation of Scenario 1.  3-9  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  Figure 3-7.

S. Census Bureau staff updates MAF/TIGER from maps and/or forms  Participant updates BAS maps and/or forms (GR ) 0004.15-05  3.3.2 Scenarios 2 and 3--""Rolling"" Local Update of Census Addresses Program In the second and third scenarios, an electronic data exchange program would be developed to support a continuous, or ""rolling,"" LUCA program. The LUCA program goal is to update the information concerning housing units, such as house number; street name and type, including any directional indicator (e.g., S Main St or Apple Blvd SW); unit designator for units in multiunit structures (e.g., 101 Main St, Apt A); and the five-digit ZIP Code. The LUCA program also solicits information to update the Bureau's maps, such as the location of any missing streets, corrections to street names, and to correct other information about streets, such as their location in relation to the boundary of the jurisdiction or displayed intersections. Both of these scenarios require that a Web-based application be established to support the ability of the Bureau's geographic partners to participate in the LUCA program. The initial scenario (Scenario 2) would establish the capability for geographic partners to access the Bureau's information for review purposes. Any updates to the Bureau's information would be communicated to the Bureau. The companion scenario, Scenario 3, would provide the capability for the geographic partner to update LUCA-related data through a Web application. Figure 3-8 provides a graphical representation of the implementation of both Scenario 2 and Scenario 3.  3-10  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  Figure 3-8.

An organization's success is measured by how successfully it meets its mission. To that end, the Bureau must first satisfy its customers' requirements. The geographic databases that support its numerous programs and activities are key to the Bureau's success. The systems that provide access to these geographic databases must be engineered to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the data and the products that are produced. Current software engineering practices specifically incorporate quality assurance and quality management as core attributes throughout the system development process. As a result, the quality of the system's data and its products is intrinsic to the system's overall design and operation. Although it is preferable to design quality into systems in their initial development, it  3-11  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  is also beneficial for existing systems to have quality controls retrofitted into their design to increase end-user confidence and satisfaction. In support of the Geographic Support base program, the Bureau will follow established quality control procedures and processes in reviewing samples of each output product to verify conformance to specifications. In addition, formal quality standards will be developed and published to control the acceptance of data from the Bureau's geographic partners. To strengthen the overall quality of the Bureau's geographic support products, three scenarios have been developed. The first two scenarios call for the programmatic improvement of the current systems that support the geographic databases in the area of quality assurance. The third scenario proposes a field evaluation program that would be designed to support the verification of the data in the geographic databases. 3.4.1 Scenario 1--Product Quality The first scenario is intended to strengthen the current systems that support the geographic databases by expanding their existing capability to monitor the quality of their respective products, such as maps and address lists. This initiative would be accomplished by adjusting the current application software to provide for automated error detection. New software would be developed that would support the error tracking from detection through resolution and facilitate the appropriate level of communication to interested parties. In addition, this scenario would provide for the development of specialized data extracts to support other quality assurance programs initiated by the Bureau. 3.4.2 Scenario 2--Comprehensive Quality Program The second scenario would expand the focus of Scenario 1 to all areas of the systems that support the geographic databases--not just the output functions. This would include the functions that support data entry and data manipulation. 3.4.3 Scenario 3--Field Verification The third scenario proposes that a field evaluation program be instituted to verify the accuracy of the data content of the address-related data in the geographic databases. Under this proposal, the Bureau would sponsor the periodic verification of the information in the geographic databases. This operation would be completed through the physical verification of data stored in the various geographic databases for a representative sample of 500,000 housing units. 3.5 Summary The successful implementation of the scenarios supporting the 21st Century MAF/TIGER Enhancements initiative will enable the Bureau to meet its identified goals. These goals are strengthening its existing partnership with state, local, and tribal governments by improving and simplifying the exchange of information; significantly increasing the accuracy and currency of the information contained in the Bureau's geographic support systems; and improving the quality of the products and tools that support the Decennial Census execution.  3-12  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  APPENDIX A REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAF/TIGER MODERNIZATION STUDY A.1 Background The BoozAllen & Hamilton team gathered the following requirements from interviews, meetings, and supporting documentation for potential support to the Master Address File/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Enhancements initiative. Interviews were the primary source of information for the detailed requirements. The BoozAllen & Hamilton team interviewed Geography Division management as well as staff in the Geography Division's branches and functional units; other U.S. Census Bureau divisions; and selected external U.S. Census Bureau customer, partnership, and advisory organizations to identify requirements for modernizing the MAF/TIGER data base. Meetings and interviews were held between November 1999 and May 2000. The results of all interviews were recorded in electronic format and were used in the development of functional requirements. A.2 Interviews and Requirements Meetings The complete list of Geography Division interviews and requirements meetings is as follows.

All responses to a particular question were grouped into a single document and similar answers were combined, where appropriate. The BoozAllen & Hamilton team developed a detailed requirements matrix to organize the requirements. The detailed organization of the requirements matrix includes--   Requirement Number --Indirectly associates each requirement within a category. Level of Importance--Indicates the level of importance of each requirement to the success of MAF/TIGER Modernization. Each individual requirement is coded with an E for essential, a D for desirable, or an O for optional. Detailed Requirement (by Major Category) --Provides a description of the requirement. Source of Requirement --The source for most requirements is interviews. The five sources of requirements are as follows:  Geography Program Managers. Labeled GEO Program Managers, this category is marked when a requirement's source is attributed to a meeting involving a Geography Division manager.  Field Operations Managers. Labeled Field Operations Managers, this category is marked when a requirement's source is attributed to feedback from the Field Division.  Program Sponsors/Analysts. Labeled Program Sponsors/Analysts, this category is marked when a requirement's source is attributed to a Geography Division interview.  Census Documents. Labeled Census Documents, this category is marked when a requirement's source is attributed to a document provided by the U.S. Census Bureau.  External Users/Customers. Labeled External Users/Customers, this category is marked when a requirement's source is attributed to a conversation/interview with a selected external U.S. Census Bureau-related organization. Base Program--Documents the extent to which the detailed requirement is being met by the current MAF/TIGER system. Labeled Base Program, this category uses the Harvey Ball methodology for estimating the extent to which the current system is meeting the requirement and is coded as follows: E V R A H       Current Current Current Current Current  system system system system system  does not meet this requirement at all meets 125 percent of this requirement meets 2650 percent of this requirement meets 5175 percent of this requirement satisfies all the requirement    21st Century MAF/TIGER Enhancements--At the highest level, the functional requirements are organized within the major elements of the Geography Division's  A-3  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  budget materials. The four high-level categories, in addition to the existing base program, are italicized and explained below:  Activities that build/maintain the MAF of housing units. Labeled MAF and TIGER Data, this category is checked when a requirement deals with correctly locating every street and other map feature in the TIGER data base, and each MAF address, and implementing an effective automated feature change detection methodology.  Continuing operations to integrate the MAF with TIGER data base. Labeled New Processing Environment, this category is checked when a requirement deals with implementing a modern processing environment that will support rapid application development, allow extensive use of commercially available software, and reduce staff training time.  Continuing partnerships with state, local, and tribal governments. Labeled Geographic Partnerships, this category is checked when a requirement deals with expanding and encouraging geographic partnership programs with state, local, and tribal governments that update the MAF/TIGER data base, including ""rolling LUCA"" to maintain a current address list for use by all Bureau censuses and surveys and computer-based updates of governmental unit boundaries and other geographic areas.  Quality assurance for geographic support products. Labeled Improve Quality, this category is checked when a requirement deals with implementing a comprehensive plan for periodic MAF/TIGER evaluation and corrective activities that will guide planning for future cost-effective future coverage and geocoding improvement operations.  Comment/Issue--Captures general comments and issues.  Once the requirements were extracted from all interviews, meetings, and supporting documentation, the BoozAllen & Hamilton team grouped all requirements into seven high-level requirements. The high-level requirements are intended to capture the main thoughts of the underlying requirements at a summary level. The team created an additional category labeled ""other observations"" to include requirements that did not fit into one of the seven high-level requirements but were captured in the requirements gathering. The seven high-level requirements are as follows: 1. Maintain an accurate and complete inventory of all residential, group quarters, and commercial building structures, along with the geographic location for each, and the within-structure designations when a structure contains more than one unit. Maintain an accurate and complete inventory of legal, administrative, and statistical geographic areas, their attributes, and interrelationships. Maintain an accurate and complete inventory of road, rail, water, landmark, power transmission line, and other features mapped for U.S. Census Bureau purposes. Make use of geospatial data provided by Federal, state, local, and tribal government partnerships, as well as private-sector sources, wherever possible.  2.  3.  4.  A-4  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  5.  Provide geographic and address list products and other support services to U.S. Census Bureau programs and census data users. Comply with applicable geographic data standards, guidelines, and directives and meet the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) objectives for the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) initiative, where possible. Improve the accuracy and responsiveness of the geographic support system to meet the needs of U.S. Census Bureau program managers, geographic program participants, and U.S. Census Bureau data product users.  6  7.

MOBILE COMPUTERS AND GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM Beginning with the first census in 1790, the doorstep of each resident. The U.S. years and has called upon technology to One of these improvements for the next electronic maps. paper maps have been vital to placing the enumerator at Census Bureau has been improving its processes for 200 help make the census more efficient and economical. census will be the use of mobile computers with  The challenge for the Bureau is ensuring that every person in America is counted once, and only once. For the past two decennial censuses, the census questionnaire mailings to the public have been receiving response rates of about 65 percent. An enumerator must visit the remaining 35 percent of the housing units to collect the census data. Mobile computers and the Global Positioning System (GPS) can support this door-to-door collection effort. The new direction of technology will allow enumerators to electronically validate the location of housing units that need to be visited. In addition, mobile computers could allow for collected census questionnaire information to be input directly while the enumerator is at the housing site and for the information to be transmitted directly to the Regional Office. Mobile computers for the enumerators will contain the housing addresses of the housing units, written and interactive map directions to each housing unit, data sheets to post collected questionnaire data, and a voice and data communication device for relaying data. The device will include encrypted security measures to prevent census data from being intercepted. This chapter provides information on the technology for mobile computers and GPS. An exhaustive list of these devices is not presented; rather, the capabilities of both industries are represented. B.1 Mobile Computer Systems Overview A convergence of powerful, inexpensive hardware; standardized communication protocols; and innovative software has provided the Bureau with several options for deploying geographic information system (GIS) layers in the field. Information technology (IT) industry analysts agree that it is unlikely that field GIS applications have reached more than a small percentage of their potential market. Even among organizations with a field computing strategy, most do not yet include a significant GIS component. The reason for this untapped potential is that GIS applications are complex. They are difficult to deploy in an office setting and even more so in the field. Large, complex data structures and equally complex user interfaces do not easily lend themselves to field use. To develop effective field systems, developers are bringing together state-of-the-art components from various enabling technologies, including wireless communications networks, Internet-based data delivery protocols, and a new generation of field-ready hardware and software applications. Fundamental technical challenges must also be met with an integration of specific technologies to create a reliable and functional mobile engineering environment.  B-1  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  In the field, enumerators with little or no exposure to computers will use one or two highly specialized applications. The leap from paper to sophisticated new applications can present major challenges in retraining and developing new fieldwork processes. Field-ready applications must be designed to maximize ease of use and functional efficiency in the field. Applications must be task-specific, simple to operate, and built to avoid potential errors. Hardware is just beginning to effectively address the particular needs of field workers. The price point for hardware that is suitable for the rigors of the field is also declining. Field systems must be used in remote locations miles from the nearest building, electrical outlet, or phone socket. They must be able to withstand exposure to rain, snow, mud, dirt, and extreme temperatures. In the near term, bandwidth will continue to be the primary limiting factor. Limits of 19.2 kilobits per second (Kbps) are suitable for dispatch and simple work-order data; but larger data files, like geospatial imagery and vector-based maps, are still accessed better via CD ROM or hard drive. That situation will improve dramatically during the next 2 to 5 years. Organizations are working to deliver low-cost broadband systems, optimizing their products for small-packet data formats that can function comfortably under low bandwidth constraints. Mobile computing requires a robust server and specific applications that integrate with key organization and operations management systems. As the backbone of a mobile information environment, the server must be scalable and powerful enough to support multiple field users. Data gathering will take place on handheld computers. The actual processing will occur at a site powerful enough to provide the processing horsepower that is lacking in the field. For several applications, the server will also need to support analysis and workflow management processes. To accommodate users, the server must be able to provide results of these processes as quickly and transparently as possible. Such mobile systems will also need to integrate with other field technologies such as the GPS. B.1.1 Software The software products profiled below represent only a sample of the mobile GIS mapping and asset management systems. Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), PenMetrics, Condor Earth Technologies, MapInfo, and Tadpole Technology are software vendors within this market and have products that meet the enterprisewide and fully scalable requirements of the MAF/TIGER Modernization initiative. B.1.1.1 ESRI ArcPad. ArcPad software is an easy-to-use, lightweight, low-cost solution for handheld and mobile mapping and GIS. ArcPad is designed to enhance portable touch-screen computers with intuitive mapping, GIS, and GPS functionality. ArcPad makes field data collection fast and easy, improves data accuracy, and provides immediate data availability and validation. Figure B-1 illustrates the capabilities and functionality of the ArcPad. ArcPad leverages existing mapping and GIS software systems and databases. When a user is finished editing data in the field, changes and additions can be uploaded into the master database in the office. ArcPad supports a multilayer environment with industry-standard vector map and raster image display that includes the ability to view aerial and satellite imagery. ArcPad allows users to create custom input forms from their existing GIS database for use in the field. B-2 June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  Figure B-1. Capability and Functionalities of the ArcPad GPS Input  ARC Pad  *  Internet Desktop GIS  ARC SDE ARC IMS Arc View GIS Data Distribution  Image courtesy of ESRI, Inc. (Redlands, CA)  ArcPad can also be integrated with an optional GPS or Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS). ArcPad enhances the GPS input by not limiting position information display to numerical coordinates but displaying it with a moving crosshair on an actual map. This enables users to view their exact location in the context of a map or image. ArcPad can use data directly from an individual's desktop or an organization's enterprise GIS system without the need to convert to unique portable formats. ArcPad uses vector data in ESRI shape-file format (as used by ArcInfo, ArcView GIS, ArcIMS, and other ESRI software programs). ArcPad directly supports the use of the following raster image formats: JPEG, MrSID (compressed images), Windows Bitmap, and CADRG raster maps. The ESRI ArcPad software costs $500 per license and the user, at an additional cost, defines the hardware options. B.1.1.2 PenMetric's FieldNotes for Mobile Mapping. FieldNotes for Mobile Mapping (FNMM) eliminates paper map sheets by permitting field enumerators to take digital maps into the field on pen-based or laptop computers. FNMM is a complete, portable, enterprisewide GIS software suite with powerful and easy-to-use map-viewing functionality, pop-up graphical user interface (GUI) windows, and the ability to integrate add-on modules. The GPS module allows the user to acquire and display coordinate and positional information by providing a software/hardware interface linking the GPS receiver to the mobile computer running FNMM. Applications that do not require maps or GIS data, such as the current U.S. Census 2000 shortand long-form questionnaires, can also be integrated into FNMM. This product is a usercustomizable, 32-bit application that provides the enterprisewide performance and flexibility to  B-3  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  construct non-map-based mobile field automation solutions. The application does not require intensive programming scripts or macros to assemble custom templates for data gathering activities. FNMM software costs approximately $1,500 to $2,000 per license. Hardware is an additional cost. B.1.1.3 Condor Earth Technologies PenMap. PenMap is a real-time, surveying, mapping, and GIS data collection software application that operates on any personal computer (PC), laptop, or pen computer running on Windows. PenMap has been integrated into several field data collection instruments, including reflectorless laser range finders, digital cameras, environmental sensors, and GPS receivers. Information collected in the field can be viewed and edited as it is collected, thereby eliminating unnecessary and costly remobilization. With PenMap, the user is not limited to one instrument or measurement method as is the case with other systems. User-defined data entry forms and menu buttons permit job-specific data entry. Raster and vector background images can be imported to PenMap and taken to the field. The PenMap software costs about $1,500 per license and runs on hardware using the Windows operating system. Hardware is an addition cost. B.1.1.4 MapInfo MapXtend. MapInfo's MapXtend is a wireless spatial technology that enables organizations to deliver their enterprise applications over the Internet to field workers. Applications built with MapXtend wireless spatial technology could allow enumerators to access live MAF/TIGER data via handheld Personal Digital Assistants (PDA) for faster and more efficient scheduling and servicing operations. MapXtend uses MapInfo's entire suite of Internet geocoding, routing, and mapping technologies to provide location-based intelligence for the enterprise field worker. MapXtend extends two-way wireless communications linking a handheld client and a server over the Internet. Figure B-2 shows the functionality of the MapXtend. MapInfo's MapXtend costs approximately $1,500 to $2,000 a license. Hardware is an additional cost.  B-4  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  Figure B-2. Functionality of the MapXtend  Diagram Courtesy of MapInfo Corporation (Troy, NY)  B.1.1.5 Tadpole Cartesia. Tadpole Technology has developed the Tadpole Cartesia field information system. Cartesia is a blend of Java software tools that take advantage of organization workflow to the mobile environment. The Cartesia is a field information system, combining simple-to-use, specialized software with rugged hardware that integrates critical relational database management system (RDBMS) information and detailed GIS mapping data and delivers it into the hands of field enumerators. The Cartesia spatially enabled field information system provides field teams on-line access to regional databases via digital cellular or conventional telephones from designed-for-the-field handheld computers. The Cartesia software interfaces with organizations' existing systems using intranet, Java, Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), and RDBMS connectivity tools to assemble and feed customized, task-specific job files to field teams. Cartesia-EFS works with a GIS program to extract detailed mapping information and makes this information available where it is needed. Once assembled by Cartesia interfaces, job files are made available locally to field enumerators to view and manipulate processed information. This includes full capability to interact with maps and forms-based text. Status messages can be used to track work in progress. As each task is completed, job information can be uploaded from the pen-based computer to organization headquarters where Cartesia-EFS returns it to the appropriate enterprise system. In the case of GIS, Cartesia provides a separate quality assurance application allowing GIS controllers to audit the quality of the captured information before it is committed to the enterprise system. The cost of the Cartesia software is approximately $1,500 to $2,000 per license. Hardware is an additional cost.

Xplore Technologies, Compaq, Xybernaut, Palm Computing, and Tadpole-RDI are hardware vendors within this market and have products that have the potential to meet the requirements of the MAF/TIGER Modernization initiative. Costs vary widely among the hardware products according to their capabilities, ruggedness, and functions. At the high end, the products are built to withstand the rigors of varied environments and are expandable to accommodate add-on functions. In addition, they may be highly specialized, suiting the needs of a specific user with little or no customization. At the low-end, the units are generally hand- or palm-held and engineered for many purposes. They are not ruggedized and may have limited capability for optional functionality.

The major improvements in this iteration focus on faster data transfer via the docking station and extended infrared functionality. The cost per unit is $400. Mobile mapping software costs are separate. B.1.2.6 Palm VII. Palm VII's wireless Internet product is iMessenger, a wireless e-mail client for sending and receiving messages (see Figure B-9). Although it is probably a good device for the functions for which it was designed, it has severe limitations for the needs of MAF/TIGER Modernization. By combining it with wireless connectivity software with its low 2 MB of RAM, there is virtually no free space to run a mobile GIS data collection solution with this unit. Also, an issue exists with the Palm VII's service coverage area. While Palm.Net's wireless service blankets the most populated parts of the country, rural users are likely out of range. This lack of coverage would hamper the Census Bureau's mission of mapping and collecting attribute data in suburban and rural areas, where gaps in service areas reduce production efficiency. The cost per unit is $500. Mobile mapping software costs are separate. Figure B-9. Palm VII  Image Courtesy of Palm, Inc. (Santa Clara, CA)  B.2 Global Positioning System Overview The U.S. Census Bureau has been conducting research on the capabilities of GPS during the past decade. The need for accurate housing units and street intersection locations has been the driving force for incorporating GPS data into TIGER files. The accuracy of GPS coordinates has been under review. With the potential introduction of imagery in support of TIGER alignment, comparable accuracy of GPS and imagery will be necessary. If their accuracies are not comparable, the discrepancies between TIGER data and GPS data would be obvious to all users and raise questions about accuracy. In addition to ensuring the accuracy of TIGER data, the GPS capabilities would assist enumerators in locating housing units in the field without running repeat visits. With the elimination of selected availability on May 1, 2000, the accuracy capabilities are at 34 meters on the average. Selected availability is intentional Department of Defense (DoD) interference to degrade the GPS signal to commercial GPS receivers, for security reasons. This section provides details of the GPS capabilities that can support the modernization of MAF/TIGER. GPS manufacturers are interested in many consumer markets, but portable GPS packages clearly target GIS and mapping users. Most GPS mapping systems consist of handheld receivers or  B-10  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  backpack systems that link GPS receivers to external data controllers, collectors, or PCs running data collection and real-time mapping applications. The packages more frequently use real-time differential (D)GPS because many systems now incorporate smaller, lighter, and less-expensive integrated beacon receivers and antennas. Therefore, operators can achieve greater GPS precision through real-time differential correction via free or subscription-based services. Depending on the system, collected GPS data can be stored in internal memory or add-on memory cards. However, a variety of powerful data loggers and rugged field computers (many pen-based) are used for mapping and asset management applications. Personal assistants (like Palm Pilots) and small Microsoft Windows CE-based handheld devices also are used. Software programs for GPS mission planning, data collection, editing, post-processing, and conversion are becoming better integrated, more functional, and easier to use. In addition, user interfaces are improving, and more flexible and substantial GPS data analyses are possible, allowing GPS users to assume more control and produce reliable GPS-derived GIS and computer-aided design (CAD) products. GPS-based tools for GIS data collection are well established and well suited to applications where precise position and detailed attribute information are required. They operate under a few constraints, because they need to be used in relatively open areas to receive the GPS signal, but offer the highest levels of positional accuracy, coupled with ease-of-use, low cost, and the ability to interface to complex attribute collection software. The GPS/GIS field procedure is simple: while the field worker describes the attributes of a feature (using keypad, stylus, or barcode wand), the GPS receiver computes its position. This information is stored on the field computer and subsequently downloaded for export to a GIS via an industry-standard interchange format. In the case of a point feature, the GPS data may be reduced to a single position. However, in the case of polylines and polygons, each feature has a number of associated GPS positions and other attributes. GPS technology is still relatively new and evolving rapidly. Many of the improvements in GPS/GIS systems are related more to packaging, ergonomics, and data flow than to intrinsic improvements in the GPS components themselves. When GPS-based systems were used solely for mapping and GIS data collection, data flow was one-way, from the field to the office. However, with the advent of data maintenance capabilities, data can flow in both directions. Wide-area DGPS augmentation systems provide free DGPS signals for the Americas, Europe, and Asia. In the future, most DGPS services at the meter level will be free of charge, with only premium-accuracy services carrying a subscription charge. At the same time, DGPS receivers have become more affordable. Such receivers have been integrated into some GPS systems so that only a single antenna is required to receive GPS signals and DGPS corrections. This level of integration reduces cost and makes systems both smaller and lighter. B.2.1 GPS Handheld and Integrated Units The mobile GPS/GIS solutions profiled represent only a sample of the GPS/GIS integrated spatial information management systems on the market. However, each of the profiled vendors offers a wide range of GPS/GIS integrated solutions beyond what can be covered in this report. B-11 June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  Furthermore, Trimble, Baker GeoResearch, and Ashtech/Magellan are top-tier hardware vendors within this market and have specific products that meet the requirements of the MAF/TIGER Modernization Initiative. B.2.1.1 Trimble GeoExplorer 3 and Pathfinder Pro XR/XRS. The GeoExplorer 3 handheld GPS mapping and GIS data collection/maintenance system is small and light, weighing only 1.4 pounds including the battery. The unit can be connected directly (no cable required) to Trimble's Beacon-on-a-Belt (BoB) differential correction receiver to use free U.S. Coast Guard corrections. The unit includes a 160-by-160 pixel graphical liquid crystal display (LCD) with two levels of backlighting. Users can upload their own vector GIS data into the unit to use as background information on a real-time display to verify and update positions and attributes. About 32,000 positions (1 MB of data) can be stored in the unit's internal memory, so users may have to perform frequent downloads of collected GPS data depending on the type of data they are collecting. However, battery life is long enough to permit a full day of GPS-based mapping. Trimble Pathfinder Office software is included, providing support for GPS mission planning, data import/export, differential correction, plotting, and data dictionary creation. The cost of the GeoExplorer 3 is $4,500. Trimble's Pathfinder Pro XR/XRS systems offer more advanced, but less portable, options for GIS data collection. The Pro XR is a 12-channel unit with integrated beacon receiver, and the XRS can receive beacon broadcast signals or differential corrections from wide-area satellite providers. The units can be used with the Trimble data collectors, or they can be connected to an external computer running real-time mapping software. The Aspen real-time mapping software works with all Pathfinder and 4000 series survey receivers, and it runs on notebook or pen-based computers. The cost of the Pathfinder Pro XR/XRS is $12,000. B.2.1.2 Baker GeoResearch GeoLink for Windows 95/98/NT and GPS Workhorse. GeoLink V6.0 (which also is referred to as PowerMap) operates with Windows 95/98/NT operating system. GeoLink incorporates a live, moving map display, including multiple vector and raster background maps, to help build map data with user-defined attributes for GIS. GeoLink for Windows 95/98/NT has been updated and expanded to use 32-bit architecture. Collected GPS data can be saved directly into ESRI shapefile format and/or exported to several different GIS and CAD formats. GeoLink also uses open database connectivity (ODBC), so georeferenced and non-georeferenced data can easily be imported from external databases. GeoLink runs on a user-supplied computer connected via a serial connection to a GPS receiver, GeoLink and supports several different GPS receivers. The cost of the GeoLink V6.0 is $1200. Computer hardware is not included. GPS Workhorse is an eight-channel, single frequency (L1) real-time-capable receiver built on Motorola's Oncore receiver, which includes innovative algorithms for satellite tracking in tree  B-12  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  canopies and urban canyons. With an added serial port, the receiver can become real-time differential capable to receive wide-area DGPS signal broadcasts. The cost of the GPS Workhorse is $1200, excluding computer hardware. B.2.1.3 Ashtech Inc./Magellan Corporation Reliance Field Asset Management System. Ashtech offers a line of Reliance GPS packages to support GIS/mapping and asset-management applications, including the Reliance Submeter (35-centimeter post-processed accuracy, $6,495 $8,495 or $7,495 real time). Prices differ depending on whether the system is bundled with a handheld PDA computer or a rugged pen-based computer. The Reliance RT systems also come bundled with an Ashtech BR2 beacon receiver for real-time differential corrections via U.S. Coast Guard beacons. Real-time DGPS accuracy is 45 centimeters. Non-RT Reliance systems can have real-time capability via appropriate receivers and/or antennas. All the packages feature Reliance Processor software, which includes modules for mission planning; data collection session management; feature file creation and editing; way-point editing; map viewing of previously collected data; post-processing differential correction; reprojection; and reformatting/export to CAD, GIS, and external database formats. The Reliance PenMap system includes a compact pen computer that runs PenMap real-time mapping software. With this system, background vectors and raster maps can be viewed while GPS data is collected in real-time. The PenMap software is designed to operate like a CAD product, with capabilities for symbolizing and annotating GPS-derived features. PenMap also can integrate GPS data with data from an array of third-party instruments, including laser range finders and imaging devices. The cost of the Reliance Submeter is between $6,500 and $7,500, depending on the need for real-time data results and computer hardware. B.3 Laser Range Finders Laser mapping devices measure distance by precisely measuring the flight time of several pulses of laser light to a target and back to the measuring device. Laser mapping instruments can vary in construction and functional capabilities, but they all have a laser diode, a laser rangefinder's primary sensor, which measures distance to a remote object. Most vendors sell their lower end rangefinders with the basic distance/ranging measuring capability. The higher end laser rangefinders include an inclinometer, which is used to measure the instrument vertical angle, and a compass that measures the horizontal angle of the instrument with respect to magnetic north. These two sensors are required if precise, x, y, and z coordinates are to be calculated for targets from a known ground control point or DGPS receiver integrated with the laser rangefinder. Laser rangefinders are useful for mapping high-volume features, especially point features such as housing units that are difficult to reach. Housing units under heavy tree canopy or between tall structures can be located and mapped with laser rangefinders. The effective range in which most laser rangefinders can operate is between 5 feet and 2,000 feet. Higher end rangefinders can have a maximum ranging distance of 32,000 feet using an external reflector to enhance the signal return from a longer distance to target.  B-13  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  Laser rangefinders do have limitations around water and in bright conditions. In both these cases, light scattering properties of water and bright sunshine severely hamper the return signal to the rangefinders. Environmental factors such as fog, haze, and dust can also limit the effectiveness of precise measurement. In addition, flat nonreflective surfaces that absorb light particles will be harder to map than a reflective surface that reflects light particles. The estimated cost of low-end rangefinders is $3,000 to $4,500; the high-end products range from $4,600 to $12,000. B.4 Summary The joint capabilities of mobile computers and GPS will enable the U.S. Census Bureau to provide small computer devices to the enumerators, allowing for a more accurate and efficient collection of housing unit locations. This capability will allow enumerators to be tasked via computer, directed to the correct housing unit, assisted with the collection of data, and to upload or download information to the server. The combined capabilities of these devices should reduce enumeration time and ensure more accurate collection of data.

Additionally, the vendors and products discussed herein should not be considered exclusive from other potential vendors and products in the event of future procurement requirements.  B-14  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  APPENDIX C. IMAGERY ASSESSMENT One of the major goals of the MAF/TIGER Modernization initiative is to improve the accuracy of the TIGER data base. Throughout the requirements interview process for this initiative, more than 50 organizations have stated their need for improved accuracy of TIGER data. One of the options for improved accuracy is to use aerial or satellite imagery to align existing coordinates with man-made features and existing housing units and place them in the TIGER data base. Improving the accuracy of coordinates will streamline the U.S. Census Bureau operations for gathering accurate housing unit location information in relation to the accurate base map, which will enable enumerators to relocate those structures in the field for follow-up operations. In addition, a more accurate TIGER base map will facilitate digital data exchange with Federal, tribal, state, local, and private partners. The imagery needs for meeting Bureau requirements are based on the locations of the U.S. population. Those locations within highly condensed urban areas require imagery that will easily distinguish one housing unit from another. Those areas in rural America where housing units are hundreds of feet, if not miles, apart require imagery that distinguishes the road and the structure at a specific location. Additional considerations when choosing the imagery collection systems that best support the TIGER accuracy needs include imagery resolution, accuracy, type, and cost. The imagery resolution directly affects the accuracy and cost. Spatial resolution refers to the size of the picture element (pixel) that makes up the scan line of the imaging system. The spatial resolution may or may not correlate to the smallest object or ground feature that can be seen on an image. The resolution of current satellite and aerial systems that would be useful to the TIGER modernization process ranges from a minimum of 8 meters in urban areas and 20 meters in rural areas. If these resolutions can be increased to 1 meter for urban areas and 5 meters for rural areas, the accuracy of the TIGER base map will be increased exponentially. The accuracy of the data reflects a position on the ground to its actual location on the Earth. Within urban areas, this accuracy would need to be to less than 8 meters if the housing units are to be depicted on the correct side of the street with a high degree of accuracy. This 8 meters translates to about 26.2 feet from the centerline of almost all roads and streets in an urban environment. This figure is based on half the road or street width (10 feet) plus the right-of-way (10 feet) and minimal distance to the front door (4 feet). In rural areas this accuracy would not need to be as stringent; 20 meters, or 65.6 feet might be acceptable. If the image shows a road and housing unit that are potentially off by 65.6 feet and the current TIGER data is aligned to it, the image would reveal the correct position of the structure in relation to the location of the road. However, at this gross accuracy the actual structure may appear to be on the side of a cliff or in water. The type of imagery for the MAF/TIGER Modernization is affected by alignment needs. The purpose of collecting imagery is to align TIGER data to it. The process to accomplish this is still being reviewed. Numerous commercial vendors have been contacted, and most have different approaches to solving this problem. The details of alignment or feature extraction between the imagery and the TIGER data base are discussed in Appendix E.  C-1  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  The imagery type needed depends on the approach to alignment/feature extraction. Some contractors claim the extraction can be done using panchromatic imagery (black and white); others claim the extraction requires color imagery; while yet others say it requires multispectral imagery. Feature extraction can be done using any of the mentioned imagery types. The success of the feature extraction depends on selecting the proper imagery type for the feature of interest. Eventually each imagery capability will have to be reviewed. The cost of the imagery is based on choices between capabilities of each imagery function. Figure C-1 depicts the type, platform, resolution, and accuracy of imagery. The choices in each box are aligned by cost, with the first choice being the most expensive and the last choice the least expensive. Figure C-1. Basis for Imagery Cost Type of Imagery Multispectral Radar Color Lidar Panchromatic  Collection Platform Satellite Aerial  Resolution Accuracy 2 Feet to 60 Meters 6 Inches 0.82 Meters 2.0 Meters 2.5 Meters 5.0 Meters 10.0 Meters  The cost of imagery data is dependent on the resolution of the collection and the accuracy required of the imagery. This chapter discusses the imagery sources and attributes and their applicability to the MAF/TIGER Modernization initiative. C.1 An Imagery Plan The best imagery options involve collecting data of the entire United States and its territories at 1-meter resolution or covering the densely populated areas (approximately 10 percent of the United States) at 1-meter resolution and the remaining rural areas (approximately 90 percent) at 5-meter resolution. The collection of imagery is only the first step in increasing the accuracy of the TIGER data and represents only part of the cost. Imagery processing is more expensive and time consuming than imagery collection. The level of processing correlates to the accuracy needed. Precision processing, which is the most costly, provides the minimum accuracy that  C-2  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  would be needed for aligning TIGER data to imagery. Following imagery collection and processing, TIGER data would be aligned to the imagery. The majority of this process would be automated. TIGER data that did not align satisfactorily with the imagery would be aligned manually. The best approach to manual alignment is using color imagery because of its natural colors. When all of the TIGER data is aligned correctly to the imagery, the TIGER files would be accurate to within at least 8 meters in urban areas and 20 meters in rural areas, assuming 1-meter and 5-meter imagery collections were used. The 1- and 5-meter figures are at the high end. It is estimated that these numbers could be lowered to a nationwide accuracy of 5 meters or less with new technologies in collection and particularly in processing that will be available in the very near future. All possibilities will be reviewed in this chapter. C.2 Imagery Sources Many sources of imagery are available to improve the accuracy of TIGER data, including--  Satellite Imagery Providers  Commercial  Federal Airborne Imagery Providers  Commercial  Federal Potential Satellite Imagery Partners  Federal  State and Local      The commercial systems fall roughly into two market groups. The first group concentrates on competing for shares of the aerial remote sensing market that uses high-spatial resolution scanners with smaller swath widths. Several of these systems have panchromatic sensors with less than 1-meter resolution. The second group concentrates primarily on resource management, which requires much wider swaths and a greater spectral range in return for lower resolutions (1020 meters). C.2.1 Satellite Imagery Providers More than 20 remote sensing satellite systems, with widely varying resolutions, are scheduled to be in operation by the year 2003. These include commercial systems that are designed for niche markets, with many emphasizing high-spatial resolutions and near-real-time receiving capabilities. Imagery data is also available from U.S. civil and military organizations. These include data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA), and the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). C.2.1.1 Commercial Satellites. By the year 2003, as many as five U.S. satellites and two foreign satellites could have 1-meter imagery capability. Satellites with 2.5-, 5-, and 10-meter  C-3  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  resolution capabilities will also exist. Satellite imagery providers and their specific capabilities are discussed in this section. C.2.1.1.1 Space Imaging. Space Imaging launched its IKONOS satellite in September 1999. Space Imaging also has the U.S. marketing rights to a constellation of remote sensing satellites already on orbit. These include the Landsat 4 and 5 satellites, the IRS satellites, Canada's RADARSAT, and the European Space Agency's Radar Satellite. Space Imaging also sells submeter resolution aerial imagery for applications requiring a high degree of detail and accuracy. IKONOS and IRS-1C capabilities are shown in Table C-1. Table C-1.

ORBIMAGE launched its first satellite in April 1995. This satellite, Orbview-1, provides dedicated weather-related imagery and meteorological products to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The company's second satellite, Orbview-2, was launched in August 1997 and provides images of land and ocean surfaces to commercial customers at a resolution of 1 kilometer. Orbview-3 and 4 are scheduled to launch in 2001. The features of Orbview 3 and 4 are listed in Table C-2. ORBIMAGE is completing the design of the high-resolution Orbview satellites that will provide a 1-meter high resolution panchromatic (black and white) capability, a 4-meter multispectral (color and infrared) capability and, in the case of Orbview-4, an 8-meter hyperspectral capability. Orbview-3 will have a revisit time at nadir of about 23 days. By adding Orbview-4, this revisit  C-4  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  rate will be reduced to nearly 12 days.

EarthWatch's QuickBird systems will feature high resolution, precise geolocational accuracy, large area collection, and variable imaging collection times. Locational information collected by QuickBird's star trackers and an onboard Global Positioning System (GPS) will enable EarthWatch and its customers to produce high quality and accurate large-scale maps without the need for ground control points. QuickBird-1 will be the only system in the new generation of high-resolution satellites with a non-sun-synchronous, 66degree, medium-inclination orbit. This orbit provides the benefit of viewing Earth features at various times of day under different sun angles and weather patterns. In certain geographic areas where clouds routinely gather at the same time each day, QuickBird-1's early-, mid-, and lateday imaging will afford users the opportunity to view features normally obscured by cloud cover.

Resource21is a remote sensing information company that plans to provide time-critical resource management and broad-area land surveillance products to users. Although the system parameters have been optimized for global production of agriculture needs, the benefit is a system concept that can contribute greatly to the information needs of the U.S. Census Bureau. The Resource21 system can supply a tip-off capability for monitoring new construction in fast-growing areas. The planned space collection segment will consist of three 5-band, 10-meter multispectral satellites that can cover the entire North American region twice a week with nadir coverage. Derived information can be produced and delivered electronically. The Resource21 satellite system is planned to be fully operational in 2003. The first satellite launch is expected to occur in the fall of 2002, and the final launch is to be completed by mid-2003. A fourth satellite will be built as a backup. The conceptual Resource21 system features pixel sizes of 10 meters visible near-infrared (VNIR) and 20 meters shortwave infrared (SWIR). This requirement is driven by the need to detect, locate, and characterize vegetation and other materials and determine their conditions at densities as low as 4 percent over areas as small as 1/40th acre. For the U.S. Census Bureau, this capability would make it possible to accurately and automatically detect and locate objects with a spatial extent on the order of 2 meters by 2 meters over large regions. For example, buildings under construction that do not precisely match their surrounding environment (e.g., roads, vegetation, sand, and trees) could be located within 5 meters. With the use of advanced computing technology, it is possible to extract even more information from small patches of geospatial information derived from high-quality multispectral data. For example, the spectral presence of construction equipment, disturbed soil, road paving materials, and metals could be used to request street addresses and names from other organizations. The impact of better revisit times, spatial performance, and radiometric performance would be a quantum leap in large-area change detection and analysis capability with important benefits. Subtle changes developing over intervals as short as 1 day and as long as several decades could be accurately characterized. Broad areas could be searched automatically in the spectral domain for events and conditions of interest. Table C-4 shows the Resource21 capabilities.

SPOT Image Corporation of Reston, Virginia, is the U. S. subsidiary of SPOT IMAGE, S.A., of Toulouse, France. The SPOT satellite Earth Observation System was designed by the French and developed with the participation of Sweden and Belgium. The system has been operational since 1986 with the launch of SPOT 1. Three satellites are operational currently: SPOT 1, SPOT 2, and SPOT4. SPOT 5 is scheduled for launch in late 2001. SPOT 5 will offer the main capability of interest to the U.S. Census Bureau (i.e., maintaining the scene size and increasing resolution). This new generation satellite will provide an enhanced performance using the latest technologies, including a highly innovative acquisition process called Supermode. This new process will allow SPOT 5 to acquire images using a 2.5-meter sampling grid while maintaining SPOT's 60 km by 60 km swath. This capability allows for maintaining the scene size and increasing the resolution, which could prove useful in rural areas of the United States. Further evaluation of th capability and cost of 2.5 meter SPOT imagery is needed. Table C-5 lists the SPOT capabilities. Table C-5.

In about the 2004 time frame, the commercial satellite companies will be launching their second-generation satellites. As the resolution improves, satellite imagery will be able to distinguish more at a higher accuracy. C.2.1.2.1 Half-Meter Imagery Resolution. Higher resolution imagery can increase resolution to about 18 inches with a potential for horizontal accuracy to 2 meters. Each of the 1-meter satellite companies has requested permission from the Department of Commerce to launch a half-meter system in 2004. The advantage of higher resolution data is that even more details would be seen. This resolution could have some uses in large metropolitan areas where more details are needed to distinguish structures. The disadvantages of higher resolution imagery include increased processing time, cost, and potentially more detail than the U.S. Census Bureau needs. C.2.1.2.2 Quarter-Meter Imagery Resolution. One of the satellite companies has requested permission from the U.S. Government to launch a quarter-meter resolution system. A great deal of controversy has arisen over this much detail being collected and provided to the public. At this resolution, the commercial satellites are nearing the capabilities of the military satellites. A satellite with this capability may not be allowed to be built. This much detail would probably far exceed Bureau needs. C.2.1.3 Federal (Military and Civil) Imagery Providers. The U.S. Government has launched many satellites over the years that could support MAF/TIGER modernization; however, in most cases these satellites are not available for various reasons. For example, the military satellites are focused on national defense and can be used only when all other sources have been exhausted. The NOAA/USGS/NASA Landsat 7 satellite data are available rather cheaply but have a low resolution. Information on these capabilities is provided below.  C-8  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  C.2.1.3.1 The Intelligence Community. The intelligence community provides access to classified remote sensing data through the USGS National Civil Applications Program (NCAP). National military satellite systems data are available to civil agencies under the following strict guidelines:        The satellite systems are not to be used for monitoring citizens. The satellite systems are not to be used by law enforcement officials. The satellite systems are not to be used in any manner that could be perceived as intelligence gathering. The civil community needs are second to intelligence needs. Tasking must be on a not-to-interfere basis. Requesting classified imagery must be considered only as a last resort. Commercial collection opportunities must be exhausted prior to this type of tasking. Data is available only at the Secret level.  Information derived from images collected by military satellites is called an imagery-derived product (IDP). Examples include photographs, maps, line drawings, and statistical data. All U.S. Federal Government agencies may request and use classified imagery to derive information only when use of commercial sources is infeasible. IDP may be used to revise TIGER data even though the image is classified. The image itself may not be used. C.2.1.3.2 NOAA/USGS/NASA Landsat 7. On April 15, 1999, the latest member of the Landsat family was launched into orbit. No other remote sensing system, public or private, can compete with Landsat in global change research or in civil and commercial applications. Landsat 7 imagery will be very useful in determining changes that occur during the time the MAF/TIGER modernization is taking place. For example, Landsat 7 imagery collection in 1999 and again in 2003 of the United States and its territories could be purchased at the beginning of the TIGER modernization project. From this data, major changes in construction could be located and emphasis placed on ensuring that the higher resolution imagery includes these areas. These change scenes could reduce the amount of high-resolution images needed. Table C-6 shows Landsat 7's capabilities.  C-9  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  Table C-6.

Because the USGS and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) have been using imagery for many years, they have acquired large amounts of imagery. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Transportation (DOT), and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) all have the need for imagery. Despite overlapping needs for national-level data, civil agencies are unable to provide much, if any, data because of the differences in their missions and imagery needs. The USGS has areas within the United States that have accurate digital orthophoto quarter quads (DOQQ) that exceed the requirements of the Bureau. However, the USGS has data on only about two-thirds of the United States and of this two-thirds, a third is older than 4 years. USGS wants to assist the Bureau in its MAF/TIGER Modernization but will not have the resources to collect imagery required by the Bureau in a timely manner. The USDA has imagery over portions of the United States at 10- to 30-meter resolutions. It has been using Landsats 4, 5, and 7, as well as SPOT imagery, for its imagery needs. The other civil agencies have requirements for imagery in support of their tasks and are beginning to determine how to obtain it. For example, the FEMA Mitigation Directorate has identified imagery requirements with horizontal postings of 5 meters, with 2 1/2-meter horizontal accuracy at the 95 percent confidence level and a vertical accuracy of 30 centimeters at the 95 percent confidence level. Often, the needs of the civil agencies are not commensurate with each other. C.2.2 Potential Satellite Imagery Partners The National Digital Orthophoto Program (NDOP) has become the focal point for imagery needs within Federal and state governments. Through this organization, imagery can be purchased that supports many other organizations and often at an inexpensive rate. But once again, it must be understood that these purchases do not satisfy the needs of all users. A Bureau purchase could be orchestrated through the NDOP for maximum distribution of the data.  C-10  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  State governments have inquired about partnerships with the U.S. Census Bureau in imagery purchases. The major drawback to these partnerships is the time frame of the availability of financing for the modernization projects. The states are looking for partnerships soon, and the Bureau monies for imagery may not be available for several years. A concise review of the states' imagery data and the age of that data is provided in Table C-9. Very little state imagery data comes from a satellite; nearly all is from aerial imagery. C.2.3 Airborne Imagery Providers The number of airborne imaging systems in operation is substantially greater than the number of satellite systems. Compared to the satellite sensors, airborne systems achieve higher spatial resolution, some in submeter resolution. Airborne collection parameters are more flexible than satellite collection parameters. In addition, variable collection altitudes permit imaging under cloud cover. The airborne platforms are also responsive to changing priorities and are easily relocatable, making custom collection requirements feasible. Although airborne collection at lower altitudes improves spatial resolution, it limits the size of the area covered. Larger areas require multiple flight lines for coverage. Mosaicking of multiple flight lines is usually required to obtain coverage of a large area of interest. Since illumination may vary considerably during the collection mission, the spectral quality of a mosaic may vary from flight line to flight line due to time intervals between flight lines. These variances can be compensated for through atmospheric corrections. A comparison between aerial and satellite imagery is provided in Table C-7. Table C-7. Comparison of Airborne and Satellite Collection CHARACTERISTICS Altitude Swath Width Resolution Illumination Revisit Responsiveness Flight Path AIRBORNE Low (up to 30,000 meters) Narrow (many strips for large area) Varied to meet needs Variable over large areas Frequent/flexible Relocatable Variable--user defined SATELLITE High (above 175 km) Wide (single strip for large area) Fixed by satellite orbit Constant over large areas Fixed by orbit Fixed by orbit Fixed by orbit  The number of aerial companies located throughout the United States is too large to list. These numerous aerial collectors provide imagery to Value-Added Resellers (VAR) that process imagery data and add value, such as map building and geographic information system (GIS) overlaying. Aerial imagery has advantages over satellite imagery as outlined in Table C-7. To better compare aerial imagery with satellite imagery for Census needs, Table C-8 is provided.

An organization that provides both collection and value-added services is the Management Association for Private Photogrammetric Surveyors (MAPPS). The member firms are engaged in surveying, photogrammetry, satellite and airborne remote sensing, aerial photography, hydrography, aerial and satellite image processing, GPS and GIS data collection and conversion. The intention of the association is to complement the technical programs of the American Congress on Surveying and Mapping (ACSM), the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS), Urban and Regional Information Systems Association (URISA), the Geospatial Information and Technology Association (GITA), or other organizations, and to be a forum and voice for the business aspects of mapping and GIS. C.2.3.2 NDOP. The NDOP is a Federal organization that assists in obtaining imagery of users' areas of concern. The NDOP attempts to involve all levels of government in the Federal purchases of imagery. In the past, most purchases have been arranged through the USGS DOQQ program, but now more Federal and state agencies require imagery. The Federal agencies have been banking on the notion that the cost for DOQQ maintenance will be less than the current USGS fixed price for DOQQs. Declining Federal budgets might still be able to maintain a significant level of DOQQ production with lower costs. If the paradigm for orthophotos moves to high-resolution data, DOQQ maintenance costs will rise extensively. Should the MAF/TIGER Modernization Project receive funding, and should it use imagery to realign TIGER, this imagery could be available to state and local governments to support their imagery/GIS programs. C.2.4 Potential Airborne Imagery Partners State and local governments are potential airborne imagery partners.  C-12  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  C.2.4.1 State and Local Governments. State and local governments have begun to use imagery in conjunction with their GIS data. Most often, these governments find it difficult to afford the cost of the imagery or they do not have the expertise to support the use of imagery data. Usually, only the larger cities have become successful with integrating imagery and GIS. Examples of the needs and uses of two cities and two states are provided below. C.2.4.1.1 Atlanta, Georgia. Atlanta believes that a continuous, on-line supply of accurate geographic information is of major importance to a modern society. The cost of creating and maintaining accurate and current digital data remains prohibitive to many organizations. Developing these databases by numerous institutions in a fragmented, wasteful, redundant, and noninteroperable manner is no longer acceptable economically and socially. This is why the Metro Atlanta Region has organized the Open Geodata Consortium. This group facilitates the regional on-line spatial data cataloging, data sharing between members, and spatial/geographic indexing for e-commerce portals by diverse industries and government agencies. This program saves millions of taxpayer dollars through integration of digital maps produced and maintained. It serves the regional community by serving an open consumer marketplace and by offering easy access to geographic information critical for government decision making, public safety, regional planning, transportation, utilities, real estate, property tax assessment, and many more basic aspects of everyday life. The imagery that supports this region is 6-inch resolution. All imagery and GIS information is available for purchase from the consortium. C.2.4.1.2 San Diego, California. San Diego City and County jointly initiated the Regional Urban Information System project in response to the increasing complexity of delivering efficient and effective municipal services to the residents of the region. The goals of the project are to improve productivity; reduce costs; provide access to accurate, timely information for decision making; and improve service to citizens. More than 200 layers of GIS information are available to county and city agencies through a distributed network. Revenue is generated from the sale of imagery and geographic products that cover all of San Diego County. C.2.4.1.3 New York State. The GIS Clearinghouse was established to disseminate information about New York's statewide GIS coordination program and to provide access to the New York State GIS metadata repository. The metadata repository was created to provide one central location where state agencies and local governments can list GIS data sets. The clearinghouse also provides information on links to GIS education and training and other state and Federal GIS resources that include data from USGS and the U.S. Census Bureau. Select imagery data is available in this clearinghouse. C.2.4.1.4 Alaska. The State of Alaska was imaged once by NASA between 1978 and 1984. This coverage is at 1:60,000 scale, with color infrared, and 1:100,000-scale panchromatic imagery. Through the Alaska Geographic Data Committee, which is made up of 48 organizations (10 of these are native groups), a proposal is being developed that would provide 5-meter imagery of the entire state and 1-meter coverage of all urban areas and villages. The project will be completed over a 4-year period between 2002 and 2006. The committee has requested and received support from the U.S. Census Bureau's Geography Division for this collection. This data, if collected, could be used to realign MAF/TIGER data in Alaska.  C-13  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  C.2.4.1.5 State Coverage.

Some of these groups have been informed about this project and have provided input into the requirements listing in Appendix A. None of these groups are involved in the collection or production of imagery. They have memberships that are interested in the final outcome of the modernization. Names of organizations that have been notified of this project are provided below. The Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) Urban and Regional Information Systems Association (URISA) American Congress on Surveying and Mapping (ACSM) The American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) Open GIS Consortium (OGC) National Civil Applications Program (NCAP) National Association of Counties (NACo) National State Geographic Information Council (NSGIC) The Association of American Geographers (AAG) The Management Association for Private Photogrammetric Surveyors (MAPPS) The Geospatial Information & Technology Association (GITA)  C-15  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  C.2.6 Imagery Distribution Restrictions In Tables C-1 through C-8 the restrictions placed on the imagery is shown to be limited to the initial buyer, in most cases. Currently all of the satellite imaging companies and a large percentage of the aerial imaging companies provide their lowest costs based on the imagery being restricted to the actual buyer. If the imagery is to be distributed to additional users, the cost of the imagery goes up. In only a few cases will the imagery data become the property of the buyer. Usually it remains the property of the imaging company that collected the data and for an additional fee they distribute its use. The U.S. Census Bureau has several options to handle these restrictions.   Negotiate the fees for greater distribution. The higher the distribution levels the higher the costs. Negotiate purchasing imagery from providers allowing the providers to sell the imagery for a period of time (i.e., 2 years). At the end of the time period, the imagery rights for restricted distribution would be lifted, and the imagery would be distributed freely by both the buyer and the imagery company. During the restricted time period, the buyer could use the data but not distribute it. Some aerial imaging companies allow the buyer to own the rights to the imagery data. When issuing requests for proposal (RFP), the Bureau should ensure that the RFP includes language supporting public domain rights for the imagery. If some companies can allow for public domain rights, others may be forced to relax their restrictions. Off-the-shelf imagery is cheaper and can have fewer restrictions on it. A purchase of this type of data would allow for the development of the MAF/TIGER imagery baseline. The imagery update restrictions to the baseline would require negotiation. This approach would limit the amount of imagery data under restrictions.      The imagery providers have stated that all the rights to imagery are negotiable. The restrictions on imagery can be worked out to ensure all MAF/TIGER imagery support data is available to the public. C.3 Imagery Capabilities  Many variables should be considered when deciding which of the various types of imagery and data to use for the MAF/TIGER modernization and which vendors or sources to use as resources. For instance, there are many different types of imagery, all with advantages and disadvantages. The amount and accuracy of visible detail varies from type to type and from vendor to vendor. The currency of the imagery and the areas covered by the imagery also are factors in making decisions about sources. This section outlines the various attributes and capabilities of imagery. C.3.1 Sensor Types The two general classes of remote imaging sensors are active and passive. Most satellite and aerial imagery is collected from passive sensors, which include those that do not provide their own illumination but detect and record reflected sunlight or emitted light energy from features,  C-16  June 7, 2000   MAF/TIGER Modernization Study  objects, and materials. Most passive sensors are not capable of imaging through clouds or other atmospheric conditions that significantly degrade the transmission of light energy. Active sensors emit, detect, and record electromagnetic energy reflected from the surface of a feature or object. These sensors can complement the passive sensors by providing information on terrain features that are not accessible by sensors that are dependent on the sun's energy. An example of a commonly used active sensor is radar. Many frequencies used by radar imaging systems can penetrate cloud cover, providing some measure of all-weather remote sensing. Three passive and two active sensors are described below.  Panchromatic Imagery--Panchromatic imagery is collected by a digital sensor that measures energy reflectance in one wide portion of the electromagnetic spectrum or band. Panchromatic data is represented as black and white imagery. This type of collection constitutes a majority of collection for"
GX007-38-6942578	"Impact of the American Community Survey on Other Federal Statistical Agencies   Discussion     By   Nancy Kirkendall              First, I’d like to thank the authors for their interesting papers.  I enjoyed reading them.  The American Community Survey (ACS) is an innovative alternative to the long form of the decennial census with great potential for enabling improvements to other surveys and programs within the Federal Statistical System.  The papers in this session address the possibility from the point of view of the Current Population Survey (CPS), the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) and from a broader perspective – use by local transportation planners.    The ACS was designed to replace the long form in 2010.  For this purpose it will:       streamline census processing, as there will only be the short form       eliminate differential response rates on short and long form.   help to reduce the big decennial bulge in both the Census Bureau's burden budget and dollar budget by collecting long form data in a rolling fashion over the decade.   result in an improved Master Address File (MAF) for use in the 2010 census.     result in more highly skilled interviewing staff available throughout the country for surveys and censuses conducted by the Census Bureau.   provide current demographic data through the decade for purposes of survey weighting, distributing federal funds to local areas, and supporting local planning activities.     This session focuses on potential benefits of the ACS to other surveys and programs.  Some of the benefits I noted above are also benefits to other Federal surveys -- and were pointed out in this set of papers.  In particular, other surveys will benefit from more highly skilled interviewing staff; and better data for weighting and estimation.      Ultimately the MAF should also be of great benefit to other surveys, although these papers are not making that claim.  Though the surveys will ultimately benefit, the benefit may not be achieved until the next major sample redesign activity following the 2010 census.  Still, the availability through the decade of an up-to-date Master Address File for households has great potential.        Use for Small Area Estimation and Screening    The most exciting innovation related to the availability of the ACS was pointed out by both Shail Butani (BLS) and Denise Lewis (BJS) -- the use of ACS data in conjunction with data from other surveys to prepare small area estimates.  These two applications are very good examples because they are in very different situations.  The ACS currently has a set of unemployment questions that might be useful in conjunction with CPS data for small area estimation.  So BLS can consider doing preliminary analysis soon.  On the other hand, at present there are no crime-related questions on the ACS, so the first challenge for BJS is to convince the Census Bureau to add a question (or questions) about crime.      The other potential benefit to ongoing surveys, is the possibility of using the ACS to provide screening information, or information for oversampling.  Again, for some surveys, no change is required to serve this purpose.  For example, if a survey needs to target households with kids, or with kids of a certain age group, the data are available on the ACS.  For other applications, for example the crime surveys, an additional question or questions would need to be added to the ACS.    From the BJS perspective, both of these possible applications require adding questions to the ACS.  This, of course, leads to the question of how likely it is that changes can be made?    In past decades, in preparation for the decennial census, an interagency working group, chaired by OMB, advised the Census Bureau concerning the content of the long form.  The Census Bureau is currently required to deliver the topics to be included in the long form to Congress on April 1 of xx07, and to deliver the questions themselves to Congress on April 1 of xx08.    With the ACS, of course, it is too early to know whether the content of the ACS will be required to be delivered to Congress with this same schedule.  It is also too early to know whether ACS will receive the same level of Congressional attention.  Recall that it was Congressional attention that convinced the Census Bureau to minimize the length of the long form questionnaire in 2000.    For the 2000 Census the content of the long form was limited to only those topics and questions required by law.  Most likely with the ACS, this Congressional pressure to keep the long form short will be eased – but, personally, I think that it will still be important to keep the ACS as short as possible – while maximizing the utility of the information.    As agencies consider developing the questions they would like to include on the ACS, they should also be reviewing their mandate to make small area estimates -- to assemble and develop solid arguments for needing the data.  These arguments could be key to getting new questions added to the ACS.    Two interesting themes of this conference are small are estimation and cognitive methods.  I would like to link these two ideas here.  Agencies that are interested in using ACS data in conjunction with their own survey data for small area estimation should develop a small number of very good questions to be asked on the ACS.  As part of this activity, they should also make sure that data from these questions are highly correlated with a broader set of very good questions on their on-going surveys.  Making sure the questions are ‘very good’ requires the application of cognitive methods and testing.  This work will stand agencies in good stead when the debate about the content of the ACS begins in 2002, or so.    In John Bailar’s talk yesterday, he stressed the importance of asking the right questions in ways they can be answered.  Now is the right time for agencies to improve their basic questionnaires, and to develop a carefully crafted set of questions that might be included in the ACS and used in conjunction with the basic data to develop small area estimates.    Concerns with Data Quality and Comparability    Shail Butani also pointed out some of the BLS concerns about the quality and comparability of data from the ACS.  Concerns she noted include differences due to mode effects (interviewer versus self-administered), differences in handling non-response, and the use of a rolling time period.   There are good questions, and they should be examined with the intention of continuing to improve both the ACS and the CPS.  I will cite one example Shail used to illustrate the benefits of adaptive interviewing – possible only in an interviewer administered mode.  When asked the question ""Did you work for pay or profit last week?"" respondents typically said something like ""just my regular job"".  In this case, the interviewer can help the person decide how to respond.  It is not clear how this question would be answered in a self-administered questionnaire.    Use for Local Planning     Daniel Hess presented a very interesting comparison of local data with ACS data via special transformations.  In the front of the paper they claim that they are ""focusing on the impact of the ACS on data for transportation planning and policy analysis.  An analytical approach is taken to document the validity of estimates from the ACS.""  I do not agree that they are documenting the validity of the estimates from the ACS, however the paper does provide a useful and informative analysis.    When differences are found between the ACS and the local data it is not clear which one is more likely to be in error.  In this case, it is the local data for which there are no metadata.  Still the comparisons are interesting and as more comparisons are made, the comparative approach may identify real problems that can be addressed and solved.  If no problems are found, comparisons can be used to convince users of the value of the ACS.  I would have been particularly interested in a similar comparison for the Portland area of the local data and the long form data in 1990.  That would have helped me to better understand the nature of the differences highlighted in this paper.    One of the discrepancies found in the current comparison is within the highest and lowest income groups.  The fact that the ACS uses a rolling time period for collecting income rather than the time period associated with the tax year may be one reason for these differences.  I am sure that the Census Bureau is continuing to evaluate the way the ACS collects income data.    The BTS paper provides a list of variables typically needed for travel demand forecasting.  It would be useful to apply cognitive studies and testing to fine tune a set of questions that could  be used to solicit this information.  No only could this help improve ACS questions, it could provide a valuable resource for local agencies that develop and implement local planning surveys.    One hopes that the timely and consistent ACS data will prove to be useful to local transportation planning groups -- and hence to minimize the need for, or at least the size of, special local surveys.  This would be yet another benefit of the ACS."
GX007-26-5795053	"Use of Census Data in Transportation Planning: San Francisco Bay Area Case Study  by  Charles L. Purvis,  Metropolitan Transportation Commission, Oakland, California     Back to MTC Census DataMart      This ""case study"" paper was prepared for the Transportation Research Board Conference  ""Decennial Census Data for Transportation Planning: Case Studies and Strategies for 2000""  held in Irvine, California, April 28 - May 1, 1996. The final version of this paper appears in the formal conference proceedings:  Decennial Census Data for Transportation Planning: Case Studies and Strategies for 2000: Conference Proceedings 13, Volume 2 , National Academy Press, Washington, D.C., 1997, pp. 58-67. The full proceedings are available from the Transportation Research Board at:   http://www.nas.edu/trb/about/publicat.html .        Abstract  This case study is an update to the resource paper prepared by Purvis for the 1994 conference on decennial census data and transportation. It focuses on the use of census data in transportation planning activities in the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area. Attention is paid to the use of decennial census data in various planning analysis activities, including general descriptive analyses, estimation of disaggregate and aggregate travel demand models, market segmentation in travel demand model forecasting systems, and the validation of demographic/travel model simulations. The paper discusses where the census data is critical for the application, and where the census data is desirable, but perhaps not required, for the application. The various census products that are used in the Bay Area: the standard summary tape files, the public use microdata sample, the census transportation planning package, and special tabulation products, are discussed within the context of the various planning analysis activities occurring in the Bay Area. Recommendations and expectations for Census 2000  are provided.         This case study discusses the use of census data in transportation planning activities in the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area. From an institutional perspective, this covers the use of census data in the metropolitan planning organization, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC); the council of governments, the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG); state agencies such as the California Department of Transportation (CalTrans); the various transit operators in the region; and local county and city planning, public works, and congestion management agencies. The primary focus is on census activities at MTC and ABAG, with reference to other creative work underway at the county and transit operator level.    This study also serves as an update to the resource paper prepared by Purvis ( 1 ) for the 1994 Conference on Decennial Census Data for Transportation Planning. The Purvis resource paper examined the use of census data in several major metropolitan areas, including the Bay Area, using published reports covering the 1970s through 1994. This paper will focus on Bay Area applications, as well as noting new uses of census data in the region between 1994 and 1996.    In terms of census products used in the Bay Area, the case study will discuss the use and application of data from standard Census Bureau data such as the summary tape files (e.g., STF1A, STF3A), the Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS); special Census Bureau / USDOT products such as the Census Transportation Planning Package (CTPP) including the Statewide Element (CTPP/SE) and the Urban Element (CTPP/UE); and special Census Bureau data files purchased by the MTC and the Santa Clara County Center for Urban Analysis.    Following this introduction, the paper will review the application of census data in several categories, including descriptive analysis; model estimation; market segmentation for travel forecasting systems; model validation; and miscellaneous transportation applications. The paper will conclude with a set of recommendations and expectations for the Year 2000 Decennial Census. This last section is essentially a strategic assessment of the decennial census in terms of the strengths and weaknesses of census data; and the opportunities for improvements and the threats of not getting what is needed to maintain analytical tools and databases for transportation planning.     DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS   In the context of this paper, the term ""descriptive analysis"" refers to the reports, working papers, summary data files, spreadsheets, maps, press releases, trend reports, newsletters, etc., related to the dissemination of information from the decennial census. In the Bay Area these analyses have traditionally been in the form of place-level or county-level ""profile reports"" (printing out all information from certain census files, say, STF1A, STF3A, or CTPP/SE); or in the form of ""working papers"" (providing more in-depth discussion and trend analysis of census data).      Information systems and information technology is a rapidly evolving field, and it is apparent that we are also evolving into a new era of data dissemination. While in the past the most common means of dissemination are the ""hard copy"" or ""dead tree-and-ink"" issuance of census data reports, the future (and current) nature of data dissemination involves online, perhaps even real-time provision of data needed in our planning activities.     A good example of the use of new information technology for data dissemination is a World Wide Web (WWW) page, developed by ABAG, allowing the user to pick any of the 140 some-odd places in the Bay Area, then pick any of a set number of topical reports, to pull in pre-developed ""profile reports."" This ABAG WWW page is demonstrated at  http://www.abag.ca.gov/bayarea/census90/pickhtml.html  .    This rather straightforward WWW interface to ""pick place / pick topic / view data"" may likely be superseded in the years to come with more elaborate ""data-on-demand"" query-and-display setups that provide the data analyst with exactly what data is needed for the analysis at hand.    The issue of access to computers and the Internet is in part addressed by the development of Public Access Networks, an example of which is the ""PAN Islands"" network hosted by government agencies such as MTC and ABAG, and sponsored by a consortium of private sector companies in the Silicon Valley (e.g., Smart Valley, Inc., Pacific Bell, 3COM, Yahoo, Surf-Watch, Arthur D. Little.) ( http://www.svi.org/PROJECTS/PAN/ISLND/  ). The principal actors involved in the public access to the Internet arena are local public libraries, many of which receive funds from the federal Library Services and Construction Act. Public access to the Internet via the public library system is critical to ensure universal access to census information.    Many clients and patrons still prefer the paper-and-ink versions of census reports. In the Bay Area, this is fulfilled by a comprehensive set of profile reports developed by the regional data center for the Bay Area, ABAG; and a set of transportation-related working papers authored by the staff at the MTC. A list of these MTC 1990 Census working papers is provided in Table 1 and are included in the references ( 2  -  12 ).

The electronic publication #3 is MTC's version of area-level profile reports using place-level data from the CTPP/SE. These place-level profiles were only issued in electronic format given a 13 page profile report for 140 places in the Bay Area, for a grand total of 1,820 pages of information included in 7.9 megabytes of data files.     The need and value of these types of descriptive census reports, electronic or otherwise, should not be underestimated. They serve a vital role in informing the public, the media, the policy-makers, and the planning professionals on many of the most relevant demographic and travel characteristics needed for informing public policy development. The census working papers have been some of the most well received products issued by the MTC, and have been of great assistance to the librarians and public information staff at MTC and throughout the Bay Area.      Looking towards the future, it is unlikely that MTC or others will completely abandon the practice of issuing major paper-and-ink reports on census data. It is highly probably, on the other hand, that the rapid changes in information technology will greatly enhance the ability of planners to electronically disseminate and exchange census and other planning databases with our clients and partners.     MODEL ESTIMATION   The previous resource paper by Purvis provides a fairly detailed discussion on the use, or potential misuse, of census data for estimating demographic and travel models. This section will report on new applications and insights for the 1994 to 1996 period.    It bears repeating that the best sources of data for the estimation of travel demand models are household travel surveys. Survey data is essential, disaggregate data that should provide the transportation planner with the necessary data for the estimation and calibration of demographic and travel demand models. Decennial census data can, at best, be used in the estimation of household-level models to predict workers-in-household or auto ownership levels ( 16 ), or perhaps in the estimation of other types of aggregate travel models. For model validation, on the other hand, decennial census data is a critical and invaluable database for the aggregate validation of various demographic and travel behavior models.     Two new examples of use of census data in model estimation are efforts at MTC in estimating aggregate, trip end mode share models; and work in progress at the Santa Clara County Center for Urban Analysis in estimating aggregate logit work destination choice models, stratified by household income quartile.     Trip End Mode Share Models for Predicting Bicycle and Walk Commuters     One set of new trip-end mode share models developed at MTC are aggregate regression models estimated on zone-level shares of bicycle and walk commuters, at the zone-of-residence and the zone-of-work ( 17 ). The models predict the percent of workers that commute via bicycle or walk modes based on aggregate zonal characteristics such as employment density, share of multi-family dwelling units of total units, local workers/job balance within the travel analysis zone, and dummy variables to reflect proximity to the university campuses in Stanford and Berkeley. Typical mode share models are estimated using zone-to-zone network levels-of-service and related demographic and land use characteristics. Typical mode share models are either logit in form or are of the ""diversion curve"" model style that were popular in the 1960s. The reason behind developing these atypical, aggregate, zone-level, ""trip end"" based models is the concern regarding too few sample walk and bicycle trips in the 1990 MTC household travel survey. Of the 18,300 sample total home-based work trips in the 1990 MTC household travel survey, only 478 sample trips (2.6%) were by walk mode and just 222 sample trips (1.2%) were by bicycle. Such a small and sparse dataset on walk and bicycle commuters may prove a challenge in the model estimation process. Final decision on whether to use aggregate trip end mode share models or a disaggregate trip interchange mode choice model depends on current work in progress at the MTC to estimate best practice nested work trip mode choice models.        Aggregate Work Destination Choice Models    Another example of travel model estimation using census data are ongoing efforts at the Santa Clara County Center for Urban Analysis (SCCCUA) to estimate aggregate logit work destination choice models. These logit destination choice models are estimated separately by household income quartile using data from a special census file purchased from the Census Bureau by MTC and SCCCUA. This special census file, denoted as STP-214 (Special Tabulation Product) by the Census Bureau, provides one cross-tabulation of block group-to-block group workers (within the nine-county Bay Area) stratified by 12 categories of means of transportation to work, by four household income levels (less than $25000; $25000 - $45000; $45000 - $75000; and greater than $75000 annual household income). MTC's analysis of this special tabulation product is included in Census Working Paper #11 ( 12 ). Work at the SCCCUA on these aggregate work destination choice models is continuing, and will be completed in 1996.    Comparisons of regional average and median trip length (in miles), and average and median commute duration (in minutes) is shown in Table 3. This table shows a notable increase in work commute duration and length with increasing household income levels, an indicator that supports the notion for an income-stratified work trip distribution (destination) choice model.

Methods of aggregation fall into three principal categories: the ""naive"" method, market segmentation, and sample enumeration ( 18 ). In a nutshell, the ""naive"" method assumes that everyone in a travel analysis zone has the same characteristics: for example, they have the same number of workers in the household, the same household income, and the same number of persons in the household. Zonal mean values are used exclusively in the ""naive"" method.    The market segmentation method assumes that there are distinct subgroups within each travel analysis zone, for example, households by auto ownership level, by workers in the household, and/or by household income level. In the market segmentation method, the analyst assumes that the average household size, the average workers per household, etc., is the same within each subgroup by each travel zone.    The third aggregation method, the sample enumeration method, does not use any group or subgroup mean of any input variable. Instead, the disaggregate model is applied at the disaggregate (i.e., household, person or trip) level, and then the predictions are aggregated for reporting purposes. The sample enumeration technique is also known as microsimulation, where the forecasting of travel or other activity behavior is made at the discrete individual level, rather than at the zone level.    At the MTC, use of market segmentation is a key feature of the aggregate forecasting system in place and under redevelopment ( 19 ). Also, sample enumeration is used at MTC for special analyses, such as evaluating the effectiveness of transportation control measures ( 20 ).     To apply disaggregate models in a market segmentation framework, analysts at MTC have used the 1980 and 1990 Census Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) databases as ""supplementary inputs"" to the model application process. Census PUMS data are critical because it provides information the analyst needs to adjust the input model parameters (e.g., household size, household income, percent multi-family) by the desired market segmentation. PUMS data is used because standard census products such as the STF3A or the CTPP do not provide the necessary data at the travel analysis zone level or any other geographic level.     MTC has a nested workers in household / auto ownership choice model (WHHAO). This model splits the households residing in a travel analysis zones into households by three workers in household levels (0, 1, 2+ workers/HH) by three auto ownership levels (0, 1, 2+ vehicles/HH). The input market segmentation to the WHHAO model is households by household income quartile. This means that the outputs of the WHHAO model application are the number of households in each travel zone stratified by household income (4) by workers in household (3) by auto ownership level (3), or four market segmentations  into  the model, thirty-six market segmentations coming  out  of the model application.    One of the input variables to the WHHAO model is average household size. Rather than using zonal average household size, the Census PUMS data is used to adjust zonal average household size to zonal average household size stratified by household income level. This is needed because low income households (less than $25,000 per year) are smaller in size than higher income households. PUMS data is used to develop county-level (or PUMA-level) adjustment factors. These county-level adjustment factors are then multiplied by the zonal average household size to yield zonal average household size by household income quartile. These county-level household size by income quartile and adjustment factors are summarized in Tables 4 and 5.

Using the San Francisco County adjustment factors, we estimate that the average low income (quartile #1) household in the North Beach has an average household size of 1.361 persons per household (1.719 * 0.792); the average medium-low income (quartile #2) household has an average household size of 1.709 (1.719 * 0.994); the average medium-high income household has an average household size of 2.020 (1.719 * 1.175); and the average high income household in the North Beach has an average household size of 2.228 persons per household (1.719 * 1.296). Thus, the subgroup mean household size in the North Beach ranges from 1.361 to 2.228 persons per household. The ""naive"" method would just use the zonal mean household size of 1.719.      These adjustment factors used in the market segmentation process could also be developed using data from local household travel surveys. The problem will be the reliability of these factors based on typically too few sample observations in the small-scale household travel survey. For example, the 1990 Bay Area household travel survey provides sample data on 10,800 households. The 1990 Census PUMS 5-percent sample includes disaggregate data on 108,500 Bay Area households. A valuable research project would be to calculate the standard errors of these adjustment factors comparing regional travel surveys, such as the 1990 Bay Area travel survey, to the 1990 Census PUMS-based adjustment factors.     DEMOGRAPHIC AND TRAVEL MODEL VALIDATION   One of the basic uses of census data is for the aggregate validation of demographic and certain travel demand models.  Validation  is the process of comparing predicted values to ""observed"" values, and making the necessary adjustments (calibrations) to each of the component models to produce a  valid  model simulation. The decennial census data serves a most valuable purpose as an independent, ""observed"" estimate of various demographic and travel behavior. The following is a list of various uses of census data in demographic/travel model validation:    Workers in household models can be validated against CTPP/UE data at the regional, county, superdistrict, district and travel analysis zone level.   Auto ownership level models can be validated against CTPP/UE data at the regional, county, superdistrict, district and travel analysis zone level.   Analysts can convert the zone-to-zone commuter matrices, derived from part 3 of the CTPP/UE,  into ""observed"" home-based work person trips using trips-per-worker conversion factors. Home-based work trip generation (production) and trip attraction models can be validated against these CTPP-derived observed home-based work trip tables at the regional, county, superdistrict, district and travel analysis zone level.    Home-based work trip distribution models can be validated against CTPP-derived observed home-based work person trips. In the Bay Area, the census STP-214 file can be used to calibrate and validate work trip distribution models stratified by household income quartile. The validation process for work trip distribution models should include a careful evaluation of model versus observed average trip lengths (and average trip duration) at the regional, county, superdistrict and perhaps zonal level; evaluation of regional trip length, and trip duration frequency distributions; and evaluation of county-to-county, superdistrict-to-superdistrict, and district-to-district predicted versus observed home-based work person trips.    Home-based work mode choice models can also be validated against CTPP-derived observed home-based work person trip tables by means of transportation. Ideally, a multi-day household travel survey or multi-day employer survey is used to adjust the ""usual means of transportation"" typology into an ""average means of transportation.""       In terms of what the census cannot be used for, the decennial census is not used for the validation of non-work trip frequency, non-work trip destination, or non-work mode choice travel demand models. Given that non-work trips may typically encompass 75 percent of a large region's travel, it is imperative that a suitably-sized household travel survey be on hand for the aggregate validation of non-work travel demand models. Also, it is very useful to have two competing sets of ""observed"" home-based work data. This gives the analyst flexibility in what he or she should be validating against. If the two observed databases (census and survey) are in agreement over a certain statistic, then that provides the analyst a general indication of confidence, or lack of confidence, in a particular census-based or survey-based estimate of work travel behavior.     MISCELLANEOUS TRANSPORTATION APPLICATIONS   Several new applications of census data for miscellaneous transportation planning and transportation research activities in the Bay Area are worth reporting on. The first application of interest is the use of 1990 Census PUMS data as part of the Bay Bridge Congestion Pricing Demonstration Project. This demonstration project, funded by the FHWA, included an analysis of the demographic characteristics of Bay Bridge commuters. MTC consultants were able to extract Bay Bridge commuters based on PUMA (Public Use Microdata Area) of residence and county-of-work. The analysis enabled MTC to understand the income and modal usage characteristics of Bay Bridge commuters in 1990 ( 21 ). In other words, who would be affected by a toll increase during peak travel times?     Census PUMS data has also been used by MTC staff to produce a demographic profile of workers working-at-home in Marin County ( 22 ). Analysis focused on the industry, occupation, earnings, sex, age, years of schooling, and hours worked ""last week."" The ""typical"" work-at-home worker in Marin County is female, highly educated, works part-time, is self-employed, is older, and earns less than workers who commute outside the home. Male work-at-home worker earnings are 140 percent higher than female work-at-home worker earnings ($42,500 male versus $17,500 female). The predominant industry for work-at-home in Marin County is real estate, management and public relations, and professional and business services. The predominant occupation of work-at-home in Marin are writers-artists-entertainers, and managers-administrators. The work-at-home commute share in Marin ranges from a low of 1.4 percent for government workers to a high of 25.1 percent of self-employed Marinites.    The above examples show but just two of the many applications that the creative transportation planner/analyst can produce using the census PUMS datasets. It is frankly one of the best transportation research databases offered by the Bureau of the Census.    An example of transit applications using census data is recent MTC work with the Central Contra Costa Transit Authority (CCCTA) on a GIS-based analysis of transit dependent population in the CCCTA service area. One of the layers in MTC's GIS system is local bus stops and rail stations. The analyst then used the GIS system to create a buffer zone around each bus stop to represent areas within a certain walking distance of the bus stop. The GIS program then performs a ""cookie cutter"" technique to split out demographic data within and outside the buffer zone. Demographic variables such as zero auto households, population age 62-and-over, and non-working households, were used as measures of transit dependency. This technique can then provide the transit market analyst the demographic characteristics of all persons residing within walking distance of each of the CCCTA routes, as well as the characteristics of persons not within walking distance of any of the system routes. Similar GIS efforts are underway at other Bay Area transit operators, including BART, Golden Gate Transit, and SamTrans.    Academic researchers at the University of California at Berkeley have made significant contributions to the research literature on urban structure, commuting, residential choice and job location choice behavior. The most recent research on the San Francisco Bay Area is included in a working paper by Cervero and Wu ( 23 ). Cervero and Wu provide an analysis of the polycentric commuting patterns in the Bay Area using commuter flow data from the CTPP/UE and housing price data from the STF3A data files. They find an emerging hierarchy of employment centers ranging from the San Francisco CBD to outlying suburban business parks, as well as shorter commute times to suburban employment centers.     SUMMARY   As a summary of the San Francisco Bay Area case study, an evaluation is given of the degree to which census data was crucial or essential to MTC planning and research applications and of the possibility that these applications could have been produced using other databases. The paper concludes with a discussion of recommendations and expectations for Census 2000.     Evaluation of Importance of Census Data and Possibility of Substitution    Descriptive Analysis    Descriptive analyses such as the census working papers and profile reports discussed in this paper are best served by a national census including a sample, ""long form"" data as well as the 100-percent count ""short form"" data. A national survey could be conducted to replace the census long form, and perhaps the national survey could be tailored to each metropolitan area's needs. The problem with a national survey is that the costs would probably be higher than the decennial census (approximate cost of $25 per census long form), the sampling rates would probably be substantially lower, and the statistical variance and standard errors would be substantially higher. So, if higher unit costs and lower accuracy are acceptable, then the census long form could conceivably be replaced by a national survey. Given that one component of descriptive analysis is the trend analysis of demographic characteristics at the small area level (e.g., census tract or block group), a smaller size national survey could not be used for trend analysis for finer grains of geographies, say, below place level. This would be a critical loss for city, county and metropolitan area planners who depend on decennial census long form data for neighborhood-level demographic characteristics.      Demographic Benchmarking   Though not discussed in this paper, one of the primary uses of census data at the metropolitan and local area level is for the benchmarking of most demographic variables, including housing units, households, population, household income and auto ownership. Much of the most important benchmarking data is included in the decennial census long form. The census long form could be replaced by national or local demographic surveys, but probably at a higher unit cost, lower sampling rates, and higher statistical variance and standard errors. In addition, total overall costs of a national survey or sets of metropolitan area surveys could conceivably exceed the cost of conducting the decennial census long form survey.       Model Estimation   MTC and others have demonstrated the use of decennial census data in estimating demographic and travel demand models, including workers in household, auto ownership, aggregate work trip mode choice models, and aggregate work trip destination choice models. The best datasets for demographic and travel demand models, however, are still the locally-conducted household travel surveys, oftentimes conducted concurrently with the decennial census (e.g., MTC's household travel surveys in 1981 and 1990).      The utility of future decennial censuses for model estimation could be enhanced by developing a ""contextual PUMS"" program. This contextual PUMS program is where the Census Bureau hires researchers as ""special sworn employees"" in order to conduct research using raw, disaggregate census microdata records within the confines of a Census Bureau research station. An example of this is a research data center opened in January, 1994 in Boston to examine topics relevant to current economic issues ( 24 ).      Market Segmentation in Travel Models   The decennial census is the largest, most accurate database available to transportation planners for use in determining the demographic characteristics of subgroups of the population. Census PUMS data could be replaced by national or metropolitan area survey data, but at higher unit costs, lower sampling rates, and higher variance and standard errors. Research should be conducted to determine just how less accurate it is to use metropolitan area survey data as opposed to Census PUMS data for market segment adjustments.      Demographic and Travel Model Validation     It may sound redundant, but the decennial census is the best database that can be used for the aggregate validation of several demographic and travel behavior models, including: workers in household models, residential and job location choice models (land use allocation models), auto ownership level models, and work trip generation, distribution and mode choice models. The decennial census cannot be used for the aggregate validation of non-work travel behavior models, so the best source for aggregate validation of these models are metropolitan household travel surveys.      The census is used to represent ""observed"" conditions. Household travel surveys can also be used to represent ""observed"" conditions, but problems with the lumpiness and sparseness of typical metropolitan travel surveys renders it quite difficult to use surveys as an aggregate validation database at any fine level of geography, say, district or superdistrict. With the decennial census, aggregate validation can be performed at almost any geographical level, perhaps even down to the travel analysis zone (neighborhood) level.      It is conceivable that metropolitan areas in the United States return to the 5-percent sample surveys that were more typical in the 1950s and 1960s. A 5-percent sample survey of the 2.465 million households expected to reside in the Bay Area in the Year 2000 would be approximately 123,000 sampled households. At a current dollar cost of approximately $125 per household, this expanded metropolitan household travel survey could cost on the order of $15.4 million in current US dollars. (This is a substantially larger amount than the Bay Area spent on the 1990 household travel survey: $1.0 million.) A national set of metropolitan travel surveys of this size could very well cost more than any conceivable decennial census.      Transportation Research Applications   The transportation planning and research community have made considerable progress in using various census products in research efforts. PUMS data has been used in analyzing markets for congestion pricing, for work-at-home commuters, and for analyzing the demographics of transit users in the San Francisco Bay Area. The CTPP and other standard census products are used in studies on urban structure and economic development. Certainly the microdata records from household travel surveys provide the researcher with the most flexibility in any intended analysis. However, the decennial census data, especially the microdata files, affords the researcher the opportunity to delve into the demographic, household and commuter characteristics of the rare or hard-to-reach populations.         Recommendations & Expectations for Census 2000    Maintain Census Long Form   The census long form is critical to provide the accurate and precise data needed to support demographic analysis and transportation planning and research activities. The likely substitute, in absence of a census long form, would be a set of metropolitan travel surveys that would be more costly and less accurate than a properly conducted national census.     Increase Involvement of Metropolitan and Local Planners To Improve Quality of Workplace Geocoding   Accuracy of workplace geocoding is still an issue to be reckoned with. Improvements in geographic information technology will certainly help, as will a cooperative program between the Census Bureau and local persons knowledgeable of local conditions. Legal barriers that limit the involvement of local planning staffs to assist in census data processing should be liberalized to allow greater involvement of local census partners and stakeholders.   Develop Contextual PUMS Program To Facilitate Improved Planning Research   In order to increase the relevance of transportation planning research it is desirable to create a census microdata research program. This program would allow bona fide researchers the opportunity to add value to census microdata and prepare more in-depth research than would otherwise be doable.   Embrace Changes in Information Technology To Provide Better, More Relevant Data   Rapid changes in information systems and information technology should be dealt with in terms of Census Bureau plans to collect, analyze and disseminate decennial census data. New information technology should lessen the need for paper-and-ink publications in favor of electronic data-on-demand. Public access to the Internet should be a high priority to facilitate collection and dissemination of decennial census data.    Given these changes in information technology, it may not make sense to talk about improvements to the Census Transportation Planning Package for the Year 2000. Things may be changing to the degree that future analysts may get what-they-want, when-they-need-it, and how-they-asked-for-it. This type of chaotic flexibility will likely be a challenge in terms of data consistency and comparability, so the Census Bureau may need to prepare standard census products in order to  facilitate a transition from the highly structured products of the past to the chaotic data-on-demand; products of the future.
