Species         About 800, see  text         Ficus  is a  genus  of about 850  species  of woody  trees ,  shrubs ,  vines ,  epiphytes , and  hemiepiphyte  in the  family   Moraceae . Collectively known as  fig trees  or  figs , they are native throughout the  tropics  with a few species extending into the semi-warm  temperate  zone. The so-called  Common Fig  ( F. carica ) is a temperate species from the Middle East and eastern Europe (mostly Ukraine), which has been widely cultivated from ancient times for its  fruit , also referred to as  figs . The fruit of most other species are also edible though they are usually of only local economic importance or eaten as  bushfood . However, they are extremely important food resources for wildlife. Figs are also of paramount cultural importance throughout the tropics, both as objects of worship and for their many practical uses.

Take, for example, the  Common Fig , a small temperate deciduous tree whose fingered  fig leaf  is well-known in art and  iconography ; or the  Weeping Fig  ( F. benjamina ) a hemi-epiphyte with thin tough leaves on pendulous stalks adapted to its  rain forest  habitat; or the rough-leaved  sandpaper figs  from  Australia ; or the  Creeping Fig  ( F. pumila ), a vine whose small, hard leaves form a dense carpet of foliage over rocks or garden walls. Moreover, figs with different plant habits have undergone  adaptive radiation  in different  biogeographic  regions, often leading to very high levels of  alpha diversity . In the tropics, it is quite common to find that  Ficus  is the most species-rich plant genus in a particular forest. In Asia as many as 70 or more species can co-exist. [ 1 ]   The specific identification of many of the species can be difficult, but figs as a group are relatively easy to recognize. Many have  aerial roots  and a distinctive shape or habit, and their fruits distinguish them from other plants. The fig fruit is an enclosed  inflorescence , sometimes referred to as a  syconium , an urn-like structure lined on the inside with the fig's tiny flowers. The unique fig  pollination  system, involving tiny, highly specific wasps, know as  fig wasps  that enter these closed inflorescences to both pollinate and lay their own eggs, has been a constant source of inspiration and wonder to biologists [ 2 ] . Finally, there are three vegetative traits that together are unique to figs. All figs possess a white to yellowish sap ( latex ), some in copious quantities; the twig has paired  stipules  or a circular stipule scar if the stipules have fallen off; and the lateral veins at the base of the leaf are steep, forming a tighter angle with the midrib than the other lateral veins, a feature referred to as a ""tri-veined"".   Unfortunately, there are no unambiguous older  fossils  of  Ficus . However, current  molecular clock  estimates indicate that  Ficus  is a relatively ancient genus being at least 60 million years old [ 2 ] , and possibly as old as 80 million years. The main radiation of  extant  species, however, may have taken place more recently, between 20 and 40 million years ago.     [ edit ]   Ecology and uses           Coppersmith Barbet  feeding on  White Fig  ( Ficus virens ) fruit       Figs are  keystone species  in many  rainforest   ecosystems . Their fruit are a key resource for some  frugivores  including  fruit bats ,  capuchin monkeys ,  langurs  and  mangabeys . They are even more important for some  birds .  Asian barbets ,  pigeons ,  hornbills ,  fig-parrots  and  bulbuls  are examples of  taxa  which may almost entirely subsist on figs when these are in plenty. Many  Lepidoptera   caterpillars , for example of several  Euploea  species (Crow butterflies), the  Plain Tiger  ( Danaus chrysippus ), the  Giant Swallowtail  ( Papilio cresphontes ), the  Brown Awl  ( Badamia exclamationis ), and  Chrysodeixis eriosoma ,  Choreutidae  and  Copromorphidae   moths  feed on fig leaves. The  Citrus long-horned beetle  ( Anoplophora chinensis ), for example, has larvae which feed on  wood , including that of fig trees; it can become a  pest  in fig plantations. Similarly, the  Sweet Potato Whitefly  ( Bemisia tabaci ) is frequently found as a pest on figs grown as  potted plants  and is spread through the export of these plants to other localities. For a list of other diseases common to fig trees, see  List of foliage plant diseases (Moraceae) .          Leaves of the  Sacred Fig  ( F. religiosa )       The wood of fig trees is often soft and the  latex  precludes its use for many purposes. It was used to make  mummy   caskets  in  Ancient Egypt . Certain fig species (mainly  F. cotinifolia ,  F. insipida  and  F. padifolia ) are traditionally used in  Mesoamerica  to produce  papel amate  ( Nahuatl :  matl ).  Mutuba  ( F. natalensis ) is used to produce  barkcloth  in  Uganda .  Pou  ( F. religiosa  leaves' shape inspired one of the standard  kbach rachana , decorative elements in  Cambodian  architecture.  Weeping Fig  ( F. benjamina ) and  Indian Rubber Plant  ( F. elastica ) are identified as powerful air-cleaning plants in the  NASA Clean Air Study .  Indian Banyan  ( F. bengalensis ) and the Indian Rubber Plant, as well as other species, have use in  herbalism . The latter is known to be a  hyperaccumulator  of  benzene  and  methane [ dubious     discuss ] , and urban or potted plants should be considered toxic for that reason.          A page from the  Mexican   Huexotzinco Codex , painted on  matl       Figs have figured prominently in some human cultures. There is evidence that figs, specifically the  Common Fig  ( F. carica ) and  Sycamore Fig  ( F. sycomorus ), were among the first - if not the very first - plant species that were deliberately bred for agriculture in the  Middle East , starting more than 11,000 years ago. Nine  subfossil   F. carica  figs dated to about  9400-9200 BC  were found in the early  Neolithic  village  Gilgal I  (in the  Jordan Valley , 13 km north of  Jericho ). These were a  parthenocarpic  type and thus apparently an early cultivar. This find predates the cultivation of  grain  in the  Middle East  by many hundreds of years. [ 3 ] .     [ edit ]   Cultural and spiritual significance   Fig trees have profoundly influenced culture through several religious traditions. Among the more famous species are the  Sacred Fig  tree ( Peepul, Bodhi, Bo,  or  Po, Ficus religiosa ) and the  Banyan  Fig ( Ficus benghalensis ). The oldest living plant of known planting date is a  Ficus religiosa  tree known as the  Sri Maha Bodhi  planted in the temple at  Anuradhapura , Sri Lanka by King Tissa in 288 BC. It is one of the two sacred trees of  Islam , and there is a  sura  in Quran named ""The Fig"" or  At-Tin ( ), and in  East Asia , figs are pivotal in  Buddhism ,  Hinduism  and  Jainism .  Siddhrtha Gautama , the Supreme  Buddha , is traditionally held to have found  bodhi  (enlightenment) while meditating under a  Sacred Fig  ( F. religiosa ). The same species was  Ashvastha , the "" world tree "" of Hinduism. The  Plaksa  Pra-sravana  was said to be a fig tree between the roots of which the  Sarasvati River  sprang forth; it is usually held to be a Sacred Fig but more probably seems to be a  Wavy-leaved Fig  ( F. infectoria ). The Common Fig tree is cited in the  Bible , where in Genesis 3:7, Adam and Eve cover their nakedness with fig leaves. The fig fruit is also included in the list of food found in the Promised Land, according to the Torah ( Deut.  8). Other important plants reported included:  wheat , barley,  grapes ,  pomegranates ,  olives , and dates (representing the honey). Jesus cursed a fig tree for bearing no fruit ( Mark 11:12-14 ).     [ edit ]   Fig pollination and fig fruit     See also:  Common Fig            A  Common Fig   syconium  (fruit)       Many are grown for their fruits, though only  Ficus carica  is cultivated to any extent for this purpose. Furthermore, the fig fruits, important as both food and traditional medicine, contain laxative substances, flavonoids, sugars, vitamins A and C, acids and enzymes. However, figs are skin allergens, and the sap is a serious eye irritant. The fig is commonly thought of as fruit, but it is properly the flower of the fig tree. It is in fact a  false fruit  or  multiple fruit , in which the flowers and seeds grow together to form a single mass. The genus  Dorstenia , also in the figs family ( Moraceae ), exhibits similar tiny flowers arranged on a receptacle but in this case the receptacle is a more or less flat, open surface.

Source:  USDA Nutrient database       A fig ""fruit"" is derived from a specially adapted type of  inflorescence  (an arrangement of multiple flowers). In this case, it is an involuted, nearly closed receptacle with many small flowers arranged on the  inner  surface. Thus the actual flowers of the fig are unseen unless the fig is cut open. In  Chinese  the fig is called  w hu gu  ) Traditional Chinese :   ;  Simplified Chinese :   ; ), ""fruit without flower"" [ 4 ] . In  Bengali , where the Common Fig is called  dumur , it is referenced in a proverb:  tumi jeno dumurer phool hoe gele  (""You have become [invisible like] the  dumur  flower"").   The syconium often has a bulbous shape with a small opening (the  ostiole ) at the outward end that allows access to  pollinators . The flowers are pollinated by  very small wasps  that crawl through the opening in search of a suitable place to lay eggs. Without this pollinator service fig trees cannot reproduce by seed. In turn, the flowers provide a safe haven and nourishment for the next generation of wasps. This accounts for the frequent presence of wasp larvae in the fruit. Technically, a fig fruit proper would be one of the many tiny mature, seed-bearing flowers found inside one fig - if you cut open a fresh fig, the flowers will appear as fleshy ""threads"", each bearing a single seed inside.   The fig plants can be monoecious (hermaphrodite) or dioecious (hermaphrodite and female): [ 5 ]     All the native fig trees of the American continent are hermaphrodites, as well as species like  Indian Banyan  ( F. benghalensis ),  Weeping Fig  ( F. benjamina ),  Indian Rubber Plant  ( F. elastica ),  Fiddle-leaved Fig  ( F. lyrata ),  Moreton Bay Fig  ( F. macrophylla ),  Chinese Banyan  ( F. microcarpa ),  Sacred Fig  ( F. religiosa ) and  Sycamore Fig  ( F. sycomorus ).   On the other hand the Common Fig ( Ficus carica ) is a dioecious plant, as well as  F. aspera ,  Roxburgh Fig  ( F. auriculata ),  Mistletoe Fig  ( F. deltoidea ),  F. pseudopalma ,  Creeping Fig  ( F. pumila ) and related species.     The hermaphrodite Common Figs are called  ""inedible figs""  or  caprifigs ; in traditional culture in the  Mediterranean region , they were considered food for  goats  ( Capra aegagrus ). In the female fig trees, the male flower parts fail to develop; they produce the  ""edible figs"" .  Fig wasps  grow in Common Fig caprifigs but not in the female syconiums because the female flower is too long for the wasp to successfully lay her eggs in them. Nonetheless, the wasp pollinates the flower with pollen from the fig it grew up in. When the wasp dies, it is broken down by enzymes inside the fig. Fig wasps are not known to transmit any diseases harmful to humans.   When a caprifig ripens, another caprifig must be ready to be pollinated. In temperate climes, wasps hibernate in figs, and there are distinct crops. Common Fig [ verification needed ]  caprifigs have three crops per year; edible figs have two. The first ( breba [ 6 ] ) produces small fruits called  olynth . Some  parthenocarpic   cultivars  of Common Figs do not require pollination at all, and will produce a crop of figs (albeit  sterile ) in the absence of caprifigs or fig wasps.   There is typically only one species of wasp capable of fertilizing the flowers of each species of fig, and therefore plantings of fig species outside of their native range results in effectively sterile individuals. For example, in  Hawaii , some 60 species of figs have been introduced, but only four of the wasps that fertilize them have been introduced, so only four species of figs produce viable seeds there. This is an example of  mutualism , i.e. one organism (fig plant) can not propagate itself without the other one (fig wasp).   The intimate association between fig species and their wasp pollinators, along with the high incidence of a one-to-one plant-pollinator ratio have long led scientists to believe that figs and wasps are a clear example of  coevolution . Morphological and reproductive behavior evidence, such as the correspondence between fig and wasp larvae maturation rates, have been cited as support for this hypothesis for many years [ 7 ] . Additionally, recent genetic and molecular dating analyses have shown a very close correspondence in the character evolution and  speciation  phylogenies of these two clades.

Ficus citrifolia , also known as the  Shortleaf Fig ,  Giant Bearded Fig  or  Wild Banyantree , is a species of  banyan  native to southern  Florida , the  Caribbean ,  Central America , and northern  South America  south to  Paraguay . It is distinguished from the closely-related Florida Strangler Fig ( Ficus aurea ) mainly by the finer veining in the  leaves .           Contents       1   Description   2   Ecology   3   Keystone Species   4   Genetic Mosaics   5   History   6   Medicine   7   References   8   External links               [ edit ]   Description          Leaves and seeds, So Paulo, Brazil       Ficus citrifolia  trees typically grow 15 m (50  ft ) tall, and may cover a wide area due to their ability to drop aerial roots from branches and spread horizontally, fusing with the parent tree as they grow. They have a broad top, light grey bark, some aerial roots and milky sap. The leaves of  F. citrifolia  are dark green. They are oval shaped with a rounded base and pointed tip. Small flowers are enclosed in open ended fruit. The fruit appears on the ends of long stalks protruding from the leaf axils. Fruit turn from yellow to dark-red when ripe. This fruit is sweet and can be eaten raw. [ 1 ]     [ edit ]   Ecology   New trees begin their life as an  epiphyte , a strategy which allows them to avoid competition for light and land.  F. citrifolia  commonly attacks palms,  bald cypress ,  oaks  and other trees, strangling them as it grows.   Ficus citrifolia  is under strong selective pressure to flower and produce fruit year round due to its mutualistic relationship with its pollinating  agaonid  wasp. Agaonid wasps have a symbiotic relationship with figs such that a given agaonid species acts as a pollinator for just one species of fig, and a particular fig species is pollinated by just one species of wasp.  F. citrifolia  is pollinated by  P. asseutus . After pollination, figs ripen quickly. Fruit bearing figs are heavily laden; a single tree may produce up to 1,000,000 fruits with a diameter of 1-2.5 cm. The fruit of  F. citrifolia  tends to have a purgative effect on the digestive systems of many animals; ripe fruits are eaten and seeds are spread widely through dung. [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Keystone Species   Ficus citrifolia  is considered a  tropical   keystone species . Figs are a major component of the diets of more species of animals than any other tropical perennial fruit. Since  F. citrifolia  fruits year round many primates, birds and other species, feed exclusively on figs during seasons when other fruit is scarce. Additionally, the knobby, hollow, lattice-like trunk of this tree provides a home for thousands of invertebrates, rodents, bats, birds and reptiles. [ 3 ]   F. citrifolia  is considered common and is not in danger of extinction.     [ edit ]   Genetic Mosaics   F. citrifolia  may fuse with figs of other species types, creating a cumulate tree that is a genetic mosaic. Research suggests that the frequency of genetic mosaicism among strangler figs may be quite high; it is unknown how this variation effects flowering in mosaic figs. (Thomson et al., 1995). Thomson et al. suggest that if genetically different segments of a single tree flower asynchronously, agaonid wasp populations may be more resistant to low host population sizes that previously thought. Alternately, genetic mosaicism could mean that the number of certain varieties of fig in an ecosystem may be far lower than biologists have previously thought, and given populations may not have enough trees to maintain their symbiotic relationship with their pollinating wasps. [ 4 ]     [ edit ]   History   One theory is that the Portuguese name for  F. citrifolia , ""Os Barbados"", gave  Barbados  its name. It appears on the  Coat of arms  of  Barbados , and the removal of one specimen, over 100 years old, was enough to draw attention. [ 5 ]     [ edit ]   Medicine   An extract of  F. Citrifolia  may have therapeutic value for  chemotherapy  patients. [ 6 ]     [ edit ]   References     ^  How to be a Fig, Daniel H.

The  Common fig  ( Ficus carica ) is a large,  deciduous ,  shrub  or small  tree  native to southwest  Asia  and the eastern  Mediterranean  region (from  Greece  to  Pakistan ).   It grows to a height of 3-10m tall, with smooth grey  bark .   The  leaves  are 1225 cm long and 1018 cm across, and deeply lobed with three or five lobes.   The  fruit  is 35 cm long, with a green skin sometimes ripening towards purple. The  sap  of the tree's green parts is an irritant to human skin.

Fig can also be found in continental climate with hot summer, as north as Hungary, and can be picked twice or three times a year.Thousands of  cultivars , most unnamed, have been developed or come into existence as human migration brought the fig to many places outside its natural range. It has been an important food crop for thousands of years, and was also thought to be highly beneficial in the diet.   The edible fig is one of the first plants that were cultivated by humans. Nine  subfossil  figs of a  parthenocarpic  type dating to about 94009200 BC were found in the early  Neolithic  village  Gilgal I  (in the  Jordan Valley , 13 km north of Jericho). The find predates the domestication of  wheat ,  barley  and  legumes , and may thus be the first known instance of  agriculture . It is proposed that they may have been planted and cultivated intentionally, one thousand years before the next crops were domesticated ( wheat  and  rye ). [ 1 ]   Figs were also a common food source for the  Romans .  Cato the Elder , in his  De Agri Cultura , lists several strains of figs grown at the time he wrote his handbook: the Mariscan, African, Herculanean, Saguntine, and the black Tellanian ( De agri cultura , ch. 8). The fruits were used, among other things, to fatten geese for the production of a precursor of  foie gras .   Figs can be eaten fresh or dried, and used in  jam -making. Most commercial production is in dried or otherwise processed forms, since the ripe fruit does not transport well, and once picked does not keep well. In  Bengal , the fruit is called  Dumur . It is cooked as a vegetable and is believed to be good for heart ailments. It is called Anjeer (@0) in Hindi and used in sweets apart from other usage in India.

Dried figs         [ edit ]   Figs and health   Figs are one of the highest plant sources of  calcium  and fiber. According to USDA data for the Mission variety, dried figs are richest in fiber, copper, manganese, magnesium,  potassium , calcium, and vitamin K, relative to human needs. They have smaller amounts of many other nutrients. Figs have a  laxative  effect and contain many antioxidants. They are good source of  flavonoids  and  polyphenols [ 2 ] . In one study, a 40-gram portion of dried figs (two medium size figs) produced a significant increase in plasma antioxidant capacity [ 3 ] .     [ edit ]   Pollination, propagation, and fruit   Although commonly referred to as a fruit, the fig fruit is actually the flower of the tree, known as an  inflorescence  (an arrangement of multiple flowers), a  false fruit  or  multiple fruit , in which the flowers and seeds grow together to form a single mass. The genus Dorstenia, also in the figs family ( Moraceae ), exhibits similar tiny flowers arranged on a receptacle but in this case the receptacle is a more or less flat, open surface. The flower is invisible, as it blooms inside the fruit. The small orifice visible on the middle fruit is a narrow passage, which allows a very specialised wasp, the  fig wasp , to enter the fruit and pollinate the flower, whereafter the fruit grows seeds.  See  Ficus: Fig pollination and fig fruit .   Figs are easy to propagate through several methods. For propagation in the mid-summer months, air layer new growth in August (mid-summer) or insert a hardened off new 6-10"" tip in moist  perlite  or a sandy soil mix, keeping the new cuttings in a shaded area until new growth appears, then gradually moving into full sun. An alternative propagation method is bending over a taller branch, scratching the bark to reveal the green layer, then pinning the scratched area tightly to the ground. Within a few weeks, new roots will develop and then the rooted piece can be clipped from the mother plant and transplanted where desired.   For spring propagation, before the tree starts new growth, cut 6-10"" tips that have healthy buds at their ends and set into a moist perlite and/or sandy soil mix, and move to a shaded area. Once the plant starts to leaf out bury the whole plant up to the bottom leaf to give the plant a good start.   Most fig varieties grown in the U.S.A. are of the variety that do not require the fig wasp, that is, they are self fertilizing and the fruit grows seeds. However, to propagate by using those seeds is not the preferred method since the above methods of propagation are quicker and more predictable.     [ edit ]   Cultural aspects   In the book of  Genesis  in the  Bible ,  Adam and Eve  clad themselves with  fig leaves  (Genesis 3:7) after eating the "" forbidden fruit "" from the  Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil . Likewise, fig leaves, or depictions of fig leaves, have long been used to cover the  genitals  of nude figures in painting and sculpture. Often these fig leaves were added by art collectors or exhibitors long after the original work was completed. The use of the fig leaf as a protector of modesty or shield of some kind has entered the language.   The biblical quote ""each man under his own vine and fig tree"" (1 Kings 4:25) has been used to denote peace and prosperity. It was commonly quoted to refer to the life that would be led by settlers in the American West, and was used by  Theodor Herzl  in his depiction of the future  Jewish Homeland [ citation needed ] .   There is a chapter in the Quran named after the fig tree, and the fruit is also mentioned in  Qur'an  in many places. The Prophet  Muhammad  mentioned figs and then stated, ""If I had to mention a fruit that descended from paradise I would say this is it because the paradisiacal fruits do not have  pits ...eat from these fruits for they prevent  hemorrhoids , prevent  piles  and help  gout ."" (Bukhari)  [1]   Since the flower is invisible, there is a  Bengali  proverb:  tumi jeno dumurer phool hoe gele , you have become (invisible like) the dumur flower. The derisive English idiom  I don't care a fig  probably originates from the abundance of this fruit.   In  Greek mythology  the god  Apollo  sends a crow to collect water from a stream for him. The crow sees a fig tree and waits for the figs to ripen, tempted by the fruit. He knows that he is late and that his tardiness will be punished so he gets a snake from the stream and collects the water. He presents Apollo with the water and uses the snake as an excuse. Apollo sees through the crow's lie and throws the crow, goblet, and snake into the sky where they form the constellations  Hydra ,  Crater  and  Corvus .   The word "" sycophant "" actually means  ""showing the figs""  (derived by the Greek words 溿,  skon , ""fig"", and Ʊ,  phanM , ""to show"") and was used in ancient  Athens  for those who informed against another for exporting figs (which was forbidden by law) or for stealing the fruit of the sacred fig-trees, whether in time of famine or on any other occasion (Plutarch, Life of Solon, 24, 2.). Figs from  Attica  were especially prized and were a valuable export commodity. As a result, Athens had decreed that the very profitable fig business was to be a state  monopoly  and all fig growers were obliged to sell their entire produce to the state. Falsely accusing someone of clandestine transactions with figs was therefore a convenient way to  slander  them before the courts.   The figrid tree is sacred to  Dionysus  Sukites (źķ).

The  Common fig  ( Ficus carica ) is a large,  deciduous ,  shrub  or small  tree  native to southwest  Asia  and the eastern  Mediterranean  region (from  Greece  to  Pakistan ). It grows to a height of 3-10m tall, with smooth grey  bark . The  leaves  are 1225 cm long and 1018 cm across, and deeply lobed with three or five lobes. The  fruit  is 35 cm long, with a green skin sometimes ripening towards purple. The  sap  of the tree's green parts is an irritant to human skin.

Fig can also be found in continental climate with hot summer, as north as Hungary, and can be picked twice or three times a year.Thousands of  cultivars , most unnamed, have been developed or come into existence as human migration brought the fig to many places outside its natural range. It has been an important food crop for thousands of years, and was also thought to be highly beneficial in the diet.   The edible fig is one of the first plants that were cultivated by humans. Nine  subfossil  figs of a  parthenocarpic  type dating to about 94009200 BC were found in the early  Neolithic  village  Gilgal I  (in the  Jordan Valley , 13 km north of Jericho). The find predates the domestication of  wheat ,  barley  and  legumes , and may thus be the first known instance of  agriculture . It is proposed that they may have been planted and cultivated intentionally, one thousand years before the next crops were domesticated ( wheat  and  rye ). [ 1 ]   Figs were also a common food source for the  Romans .  Cato the Elder , in his  De Agri Cultura , lists several strains of figs grown at the time he wrote his handbook: the Mariscan, African, Herculanean, Saguntine, and the black Tellanian ( De agri cultura , ch. 8). The fruits were used, among other things, to fatten geese for the production of a precursor of  foie gras .   Figs can be eaten fresh or dried, and used in  jam -making. Most commercial production is in dried or otherwise processed forms, since the ripe fruit does not transport well, and once picked does not keep well. In  Bengal , the fruit is called  Dumur . It is cooked as a vegetable and is believed to be good for heart ailments. It is called Anjeer () in Hindi and used in sweets apart from other usage in India.

Dried figs         [ edit ]   Figs and health   Figs are one of the highest plant sources of  calcium  and fiber. According to USDA data for the Mission variety, dried figs are richest in fiber, copper, manganese, magnesium,  potassium , calcium, and vitamin K, relative to human needs. They have smaller amounts of many other nutrients. Figs have a  laxative  effect and contain many antioxidants. They are good source of  flavonoids  and  polyphenols [ 2 ] . In one study, a 40-gram portion of dried figs (two medium size figs) produced a significant increase in plasma antioxidant capacity [ 3 ] .     [ edit ]   Pollination, propagation, and fruit   Although commonly referred to as a fruit, the fig fruit is actually the flower of the tree, known as an  inflorescence  (an arrangement of multiple flowers), a  false fruit  or  multiple fruit , in which the flowers and seeds grow together to form a single mass. The genus Dorstenia, also in the figs family ( Moraceae ), exhibits similar tiny flowers arranged on a receptacle but in this case the receptacle is a more or less flat, open surface. The flower is invisible, as it blooms inside the fruit. The small orifice visible on the middle fruit is a narrow passage, which allows a very specialised wasp, the  fig wasp , to enter the fruit and pollinate the flower, whereafter the fruit grows seeds.  See  Ficus: Fig pollination and fig fruit .   Figs are easy to propagate through several methods. For propagation in the mid-summer months, air layer new growth in August (mid-summer) or insert a hardened off new 6-10"" tip in moist  perlite  or a sandy soil mix, keeping the new cuttings in a shaded area until new growth appears, then gradually moving into full sun. An alternative propagation method is bending over a taller branch, scratching the bark to reveal the green layer, then pinning the scratched area tightly to the ground. Within a few weeks, new roots will develop and then the rooted piece can be clipped from the mother plant and transplanted where desired.   For spring propagation, before the tree starts new growth, cut 6-10"" tips that have healthy buds at their ends and set into a moist perlite and/or sandy soil mix, and move to a shaded area. Once the plant starts to leaf out bury the whole plant up to the bottom leaf to give the plant a good start.   Most fig varieties grown in the U.S.A. are of the variety that do not require the fig wasp, that is, they are self fertilizing and the fruit grows seeds. However, to propagate by using those seeds is not the preferred method since the above methods of propagation are quicker and more predictable.     [ edit ]   Cultural aspects   In the book of  Genesis  in the  Bible ,  Adam and Eve  clad themselves with  fig leaves  (Genesis 3:7) after eating the "" forbidden fruit "" from the  Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil . Likewise, fig leaves, or depictions of fig leaves, have long been used to cover the  genitals  of nude figures in painting and sculpture. Often these fig leaves were added by art collectors or exhibitors long after the original work was completed. The use of the fig leaf as a protector of modesty or shield of some kind has entered the language.   The biblical quote ""each man under his own vine and fig tree"" (1 Kings 4:25) has been used to denote peace and prosperity. It was commonly quoted to refer to the life that would be led by settlers in the American West, and was used by  Theodor Herzl  in his depiction of the future  Jewish Homeland [ citation needed ] .   There is a chapter in the Quran named after the fig tree, and the fruit is also mentioned in  Qur'an  in many places. The Prophet  Muhammad  mentioned figs and then stated, ""If I had to mention a fruit that descended from paradise I would say this is it because the paradisiacal fruits do not have  pits ...eat from these fruits for they prevent  hemorrhoids , prevent  piles  and help  gout ."" (Bukhari)  [1]   Since the flower is invisible, there is a  Bengali  proverb:  tumi jeno dumurer phool hoe gele , you have become (invisible like) the dumur flower. The derisive English idiom  I don't care a fig  probably originates from the abundance of this fruit.   In  Greek mythology  the god  Apollo  sends a crow to collect water from a stream for him. The crow sees a fig tree and waits for the figs to ripen, tempted by the fruit. He knows that he is late and that his tardiness will be punished so he gets a snake from the stream and collects the water. He presents Apollo with the water and uses the snake as an excuse. Apollo sees through the crow's lie and throws the crow, goblet, and snake into the sky where they form the constellations  Hydra ,  Crater  and  Corvus .   Cato the Elder was a Roman statesman who urged the Romans to the Third Punic War to destroy Carthage. Before the Senate, he produced a handful of fresh figs, said to be from Carthage. This showed its proximity to Rome (and hence the threat) - figs are also associated with femininity (due to the appearance of the inside of the fruit), and an insult may have been intended.  http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00hdd5x/In_Our_Time_The_Destruction_of_Carthage/   The word "" sycophant "" actually means  ""showing the figs""  (derived by the Greek words ,  skon , ""fig"", and ,  phan , ""to show"") and was used in ancient  Athens  for those who informed against another for exporting figs (which was forbidden by law) or for stealing the fruit of the sacred fig-trees, whether in time of famine or on any other occasion (Plutarch, Life of Solon, 24, 2.).

It is widespread but not terribly common, usually appearing as an individual plant amongst other species. It was discovered by  Meriwether Lewis  in 1804.           Philadelphus lewisii  flowers       The shrub is rounded and grows to 1.5-3 m in height. It sends out long stems which are red when new and fade to gray with age, the bark shredding in small flakes. The opposite leaves vary in size across individual plants but they are usually oval, 3-5 cm long, smooth or serrated along the edges, and light green in color with a rough texture. The  flowers  are produced in clusters at the ends of long stems, with four white petals 5-40 mm long and numerous yellow  stamens . At the height of flowering, the plant is covered in a mass of blossoms. The flowers have a heavy, sweet scent similar to  orange blossoms  with a hint of  pineapple . The  fruit  is a small hard  capsule  1 cm long with woody, pointed wings, containing many brown 2.5-3 mm long seeds.   Native American tribes used  P. lewisii  for numerous purposes. The hard wood was useful for making hunting and fishing tools, snowshoes, pipes, and furniture. The leaves and bark, which contain  saponins , were mixed in water for use as a mild soap.   Other names include ""wild mock-orange"" (though this can apply to any species in the genus), and ""Syringa"", a confusing name as it usually refers to the unrelated  lilacs .     [ edit ]   Cultivation   Lewis's Mock-orange prefers full sun to partial sun. It is drought-tolerant and will grow in poor soils, and provides a landscape with flashy flowers and a fruity scent.   Philadelphus lewisii is the  state flower  of  Idaho .

Species         About 800, see  text         Ficus  is a  genus  of about 850  species  of woody  trees ,  shrubs ,  vines ,  epiphytes , and  hemiepiphyte  in the  family   Moraceae . Collectively known as  fig trees  or  figs , they are native throughout the  tropics  with a few species extending into the semi-warm  temperate  zone. The so-called  Common Fig  ( F. carica ) is a temperate species from the Middle East and eastern Europe (mostly Ukraine), which has been widely cultivated from ancient times for its  fruit , also referred to as  figs . The fruit of most other species are also edible though they are usually of only local economic importance or eaten as  bushfood . However, they are extremely important food resources for wildlife. Figs are also of paramount cultural importance throughout the tropics, both as objects of worship and for their many practical uses.

Take, for example, the  Common Fig , a small temperate deciduous tree whose fingered  fig leaf  is well-known in art and  iconography ; or the  Weeping Fig  ( F. benjamina ) a hemi-epiphyte with thin tough leaves on pendulous stalks adapted to its  rain forest  habitat; or the rough-leaved  sandpaper figs  from  Australia ; or the  Creeping Fig  ( F. pumila ), a vine whose small, hard leaves form a dense carpet of foliage over rocks or garden walls. Moreover, figs with different plant habits have undergone  adaptive radiation  in different  biogeographic  regions, often leading to very high levels of  alpha diversity . In the tropics, it is quite common to find that  Ficus  is the most species-rich plant genus in a particular forest. In Asia as many as 70 or more species can co-exist. [ 1 ]   The specific identification of many of the species can be difficult, but figs as a group are relatively easy to recognize. Many have  aerial roots  and a distinctive shape or habit, and their fruits distinguish them from other plants. The fig fruit is an enclosed  inflorescence , sometimes referred to as a  syconium , an urn-like structure lined on the inside with the fig's tiny flowers. The unique fig  pollination  system, involving tiny, highly specific wasps, know as  fig wasps  that enter these closed inflorescences to both pollinate and lay their own eggs, has been a constant source of inspiration and wonder to biologists [ 2 ] . Finally, there are three vegetative traits that together are unique to figs. All figs possess a white to yellowish sap ( latex ), some in copious quantities; the twig has paired  stipules  or a circular stipule scar if the stipules have fallen off; and the lateral veins at the base of the leaf are steep, forming a tighter angle with the midrib than the other lateral veins, a feature referred to as a ""tri-veined"".   Unfortunately, there are no unambiguous older  fossils  of  Ficus . However, current  molecular clock  estimates indicate that  Ficus  is a relatively ancient genus being at least 60 million years old [ 2 ] , and possibly as old as 80 million years. The main radiation of  extant  species, however, may have taken place more recently, between 20 and 40 million years ago.     [ edit ]   Ecology and uses           Coppersmith Barbet  feeding on  White Fig  ( Ficus virens ) fruit       Figs are  keystone species  in many  rainforest   ecosystems . Their fruit are a key resource for some  frugivores  including  fruit bats ,  capuchin monkeys ,  langurs  and  mangabeys . They are even more important for some  birds .  Asian barbets ,  pigeons ,  hornbills ,  fig-parrots  and  bulbuls  are examples of  taxa  which may almost entirely subsist on figs when these are in plenty. Many  Lepidoptera   caterpillars , for example of several  Euploea  species (Crow butterflies), the  Plain Tiger  ( Danaus chrysippus ), the  Giant Swallowtail  ( Papilio cresphontes ), the  Brown Awl  ( Badamia exclamationis ), and  Chrysodeixis eriosoma ,  Choreutidae  and  Copromorphidae   moths  feed on fig leaves. The  Citrus long-horned beetle  ( Anoplophora chinensis ), for example, has larvae which feed on  wood , including that of fig trees; it can become a  pest  in fig plantations. Similarly, the  Sweet Potato Whitefly  ( Bemisia tabaci ) is frequently found as a pest on figs grown as  potted plants  and is spread through the export of these plants to other localities. For a list of other diseases common to fig trees, see  List of foliage plant diseases (Moraceae) .          Leaves of the  Sacred Fig  ( F. religiosa )       The wood of fig trees is often soft and the  latex  precludes its use for many purposes. It was used to make  mummy   caskets  in  Ancient Egypt . Certain fig species (mainly  F. cotinifolia ,  F. insipida  and  F. padifolia ) are traditionally used in  Mesoamerica  to produce  papel amate  ( Nahuatl :  matl ).  Mutuba  ( F. natalensis ) is used to produce  barkcloth  in  Uganda .  Pou  ( F. religiosa  leaves' shape inspired one of the standard  kbach rachana , decorative elements in  Cambodian  architecture.  Weeping Fig  ( F. benjamina ) and  Indian Rubber Plant  ( F. elastica ) are identified as powerful air-cleaning plants in the  NASA Clean Air Study .  Indian Banyan  ( F. bengalensis ) and the Indian Rubber Plant, as well as other species, have use in  herbalism . The latter is known to be a  hyperaccumulator  of  benzene  and  methane [ dubious     discuss ] , and urban or potted plants should be considered toxic for that reason.          A page from the  Mexican   Huexotzinco Codex , painted on  matl       Figs have figured prominently in some human cultures. There is evidence that figs, specifically the  Common Fig  ( F. carica ) and  Sycamore Fig  ( F. sycomorus ), were among the first - if not the very first - plant species that were deliberately bred for agriculture in the  Middle East , starting more than 11,000 years ago. Nine  subfossil   F. carica  figs dated to about  9400-9200 BC  were found in the early  Neolithic  village  Gilgal I  (in the  Jordan Valley , 13 km north of  Jericho ). These were a  parthenocarpic  type and thus apparently an early cultivar. This find predates the cultivation of  grain  in the  Middle East  by many hundreds of years. [ 3 ] .     [ edit ]   Cultural and spiritual significance   Fig trees have profoundly influenced culture through several religious traditions. Among the more famous species are the  Sacred Fig  tree ( Peepul, Bodhi, Bo,  or  Po, Ficus religiosa ) and the  Banyan  Fig ( Ficus benghalensis ). The oldest living plant of known planting date is a  Ficus religiosa  tree known as the  Sri Maha Bodhi  planted in the temple at  Anuradhapura , Sri Lanka by King Tissa in 288 BC. It is one of the two sacred trees of  Islam , and there is a  sura  in Quran named ""The Fig"" or  At-Tin ( ), and in  East Asia , figs are pivotal in  Buddhism ,  Hinduism  and  Jainism .  Siddhrtha Gautama , the Supreme  Buddha , is traditionally held to have found  bodhi  (enlightenment) while meditating under a  Sacred Fig  ( F. religiosa ). The same species was  Ashvastha , the "" world tree "" of Hinduism. The  Plaksa  Pra-sravana  was said to be a fig tree between the roots of which the  Sarasvati River  sprang forth; it is usually held to be a Sacred Fig but more probably seems to be a  Wavy-leaved Fig  ( F. infectoria ). The Common Fig tree is cited in the  Bible , where in Genesis 3:7, Adam and Eve cover their nakedness with fig leaves. The fig fruit is also included in the list of food found in the Promised Land, according to the Torah ( Deut.  8). Other important plants reported included:  wheat , barley,  grapes ,  pomegranates ,  olives , and dates (representing the honey). Jesus cursed a fig tree for bearing no fruit ( Mark 11:12-14 ).     [ edit ]   Fig pollination and fig fruit     See also:  Common Fig            A  Common Fig   syconium  (fruit)       Many are grown for their fruits, though only  Ficus carica  is cultivated to any extent for this purpose. Furthermore, the fig fruits, important as both food and traditional medicine, contain laxative substances, flavonoids, sugars, vitamins A and C, acids and enzymes. However, figs are skin allergens, and the sap is a serious eye irritant. The fig is commonly thought of as fruit, but it is properly the flower of the fig tree. It is in fact a  false fruit  or  multiple fruit , in which the flowers and seeds grow together to form a single mass. The genus  Dorstenia , also in the figs family ( Moraceae ), exhibits similar tiny flowers arranged on a receptacle but in this case the receptacle is a more or less flat, open surface.

Source:  USDA Nutrient database       A fig ""fruit"" is derived from a specially adapted type of  inflorescence  (an arrangement of multiple flowers). In this case, it is an involuted, nearly closed receptacle with many small flowers arranged on the  inner  surface. Thus the actual flowers of the fig are unseen unless the fig is cut open. In  Chinese  the fig is called  w hu gu  ) Traditional Chinese :   ;  Simplified Chinese :   ; ), ""fruit without flower"" [ 4 ] . In  Bengali , where the Common Fig is called  dumur , it is referenced in a proverb:  tumi jeno dumurer phool hoe gele  (""You have become [invisible like] the  dumur  flower"").   The syconium often has a bulbous shape with a small opening (the  ostiole ) at the outward end that allows access to  pollinators . The flowers are pollinated by  very small wasps  that crawl through the opening in search of a suitable place to lay eggs. Without this pollinator service fig trees cannot reproduce by seed. In turn, the flowers provide a safe haven and nourishment for the next generation of wasps. This accounts for the frequent presence of wasp larvae in the fruit. Technically, a fig fruit proper would be one of the many tiny mature, seed-bearing flowers found inside one fig - if you cut open a fresh fig, the flowers will appear as fleshy ""threads"", each bearing a single seed inside.   The fig plants can be monoecious (hermaphrodite) or dioecious (hermaphrodite and female): [ 5 ]     All the native fig trees of the American continent are hermaphrodites, as well as species like  Indian Banyan  ( F. benghalensis ),  Weeping Fig  ( F. benjamina ),  Indian Rubber Plant  ( F. elastica ),  Fiddle-leaved Fig  ( F. lyrata ),  Moreton Bay Fig  ( F. macrophylla ),  Chinese Banyan  ( F. microcarpa ),  Sacred Fig  ( F. religiosa ) and  Sycamore Fig  ( F. sycomorus ).   On the other hand the Common Fig ( Ficus carica ) is a dioecious plant, as well as  F. aspera ,  Roxburgh Fig  ( F. auriculata ),  Mistletoe Fig  ( F. deltoidea ),  F. pseudopalma ,  Creeping Fig  ( F. pumila ) and related species.     The hermaphrodite Common Figs are called  ""inedible figs""  or  caprifigs ; in traditional culture in the  Mediterranean region , they were considered food for  goats  ( Capra aegagrus ). In the female fig trees, the male flower parts fail to develop; they produce the  ""edible figs"" .  Fig wasps  grow in Common Fig caprifigs but not in the female syconiums because the female flower is too long for the wasp to successfully lay her eggs in them. Nonetheless, the wasp pollinates the flower with pollen from the fig it grew up in. When the wasp dies, it is broken down by enzymes inside the fig. Fig wasps are not known to transmit any diseases harmful to humans.   When a caprifig ripens, another caprifig must be ready to be pollinated. In temperate climes, wasps hibernate in figs, and there are distinct crops. Common Fig [ verification needed ]  caprifigs have three crops per year; edible figs have two. The first ( breba [ 6 ] ) produces small fruits called  olynth . Some  parthenocarpic   cultivars  of Common Figs do not require pollination at all, and will produce a crop of figs (albeit  sterile ) in the absence of caprifigs or fig wasps.   There is typically only one species of wasp capable of fertilizing the flowers of each species of fig, and therefore plantings of fig species outside of their native range results in effectively sterile individuals. For example, in  Hawaii , some 60 species of figs have been introduced, but only four of the wasps that fertilize them have been introduced, so only four species of figs produce viable seeds there. This is an example of  mutualism , i.e. one organism (fig plant) can not propagate itself without the other one (fig wasp).   The intimate association between fig species and their wasp pollinators, along with the high incidence of a one-to-one plant-pollinator ratio have long led scientists to believe that figs and wasps are a clear example of  coevolution . Morphological and reproductive behavior evidence, such as the correspondence between fig and wasp larvae maturation rates, have been cited as support for this hypothesis for many years [ 7 ] . Additionally, recent genetic and molecular dating analyses have shown a very close correspondence in the character evolution and  speciation  phylogenies of these two clades.

Fig can also be found in continental climate with hot summer, as north as Hungary, and can be picked twice or three times a year.Thousands of  cultivars , most unnamed, have been developed or come into existence as human migration brought the fig to many places outside its natural range. It has been an important food crop for thousands of years, and was also thought to be highly beneficial in the diet.   The edible fig is one of the first plants that were cultivated by humans. Nine  subfossil  figs of a  parthenocarpic  type dating to about 94009200 BC were found in the early  Neolithic  village  Gilgal I  (in the  Jordan Valley , 13 km north of Jericho). The find predates the domestication of  wheat ,  barley  and  legumes , and may thus be the first known instance of  agriculture . It is proposed that they may have been planted and cultivated intentionally, one thousand years before the next crops were domesticated ( wheat  and  rye ). [ 1 ]   Figs were also a common food source for the  Romans .  Cato the Elder , in his  De Agri Cultura , lists several strains of figs grown at the time he wrote his handbook: the Mariscan, African, Herculanean, Saguntine, and the black Tellanian ( De agri cultura , ch. 8). The fruits were used, among other things, to fatten geese for the production of a precursor of  foie gras .   Figs can be eaten fresh or dried, and used in  jam -making. Most commercial production is in dried or otherwise processed forms, since the ripe fruit does not transport well, and once picked does not keep well. In  Bengal , the fruit is called  Dumur . It is cooked as a vegetable and is believed to be good for heart ailments. It is called Anjeer () in Hindi and used in sweets apart from other usage in India.

Dried figs         [ edit ]   Figs and health   Figs are one of the highest plant sources of  calcium  and fiber. According to USDA data for the Mission variety, dried figs are richest in fiber, copper, manganese, magnesium,  potassium , calcium, and vitamin K, relative to human needs. They have smaller amounts of many other nutrients. Figs have a  laxative  effect and contain many antioxidants. They are good source of  flavonoids  and  polyphenols [ 2 ] . In one study, a 40-gram portion of dried figs (two medium size figs) produced a significant increase in plasma antioxidant capacity [ 3 ] .     [ edit ]   Pollination, propagation, and fruit   Although commonly referred to as a fruit, the fig fruit is actually the flower of the tree, known as an  inflorescence  (an arrangement of multiple flowers), a  false fruit  or  multiple fruit , in which the flowers and seeds grow together to form a single mass. The genus Dorstenia, also in the figs family ( Moraceae ), exhibits similar tiny flowers arranged on a receptacle but in this case the receptacle is a more or less flat, open surface. The flower is invisible, as it blooms inside the fruit. The small orifice visible on the middle fruit is a narrow passage, which allows a very specialised wasp, the  fig wasp , to enter the fruit and pollinate the flower, whereafter the fruit grows seeds.  See  Ficus: Fig pollination and fig fruit .   Figs are easy to propagate through several methods. For propagation in the mid-summer months, air layer new growth in August (mid-summer) or insert a hardened off new 6-10"" tip in moist  perlite  or a sandy soil mix, keeping the new cuttings in a shaded area until new growth appears, then gradually moving into full sun. An alternative propagation method is bending over a taller branch, scratching the bark to reveal the green layer, then pinning the scratched area tightly to the ground. Within a few weeks, new roots will develop and then the rooted piece can be clipped from the mother plant and transplanted where desired.   For spring propagation, before the tree starts new growth, cut 6-10"" tips that have healthy buds at their ends and set into a moist perlite and/or sandy soil mix, and move to a shaded area. Once the plant starts to leaf out bury the whole plant up to the bottom leaf to give the plant a good start.   Most fig varieties grown in the U.S.A. are of the variety that do not require the fig wasp, that is, they are self fertilizing and the fruit grows seeds. However, to propagate by using those seeds is not the preferred method since the above methods of propagation are quicker and more predictable.     [ edit ]   Cultural aspects   In the book of  Genesis  in the  Bible ,  Adam and Eve  clad themselves with  fig leaves  (Genesis 3:7) after eating the "" forbidden fruit "" from the  Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil . Likewise, fig leaves, or depictions of fig leaves, have long been used to cover the  genitals  of nude figures in painting and sculpture. Often these fig leaves were added by art collectors or exhibitors long after the original work was completed. The use of the fig leaf as a protector of modesty or shield of some kind has entered the language.   The biblical quote ""each man under his own vine and fig tree"" (1 Kings 4:25) has been used to denote peace and prosperity. It was commonly quoted to refer to the life that would be led by settlers in the American West, and was used by  Theodor Herzl  in his depiction of the future  Jewish Homeland [ citation needed ] .   There is a chapter in the Quran named after the fig tree, and the fruit is also mentioned in  Qur'an  in many places. The Prophet  Muhammad  mentioned figs and then stated, ""If I had to mention a fruit that descended from paradise I would say this is it because the paradisiacal fruits do not have  pits ...eat from these fruits for they prevent  hemorrhoids , prevent  piles  and help  gout ."" (Bukhari)  [1]   Since the flower is invisible, there is a  Bengali  proverb:  tumi jeno dumurer phool hoe gele , you have become (invisible like) the dumur flower. The derisive English idiom  I don't care a fig  probably originates from the abundance of this fruit.   In  Greek mythology  the god  Apollo  sends a crow to collect water from a stream for him. The crow sees a fig tree and waits for the figs to ripen, tempted by the fruit. He knows that he is late and that his tardiness will be punished so he gets a snake from the stream and collects the water. He presents Apollo with the water and uses the snake as an excuse. Apollo sees through the crow's lie and throws the crow, goblet, and snake into the sky where they form the constellations  Hydra ,  Crater  and  Corvus .   The word "" sycophant "" actually means  ""showing the figs""  (derived by the Greek words ,  skon , ""fig"", and ,  phan , ""to show"") and was used in ancient  Athens  for those who informed against another for exporting figs (which was forbidden by law) or for stealing the fruit of the sacred fig-trees, whether in time of famine or on any other occasion (Plutarch, Life of Solon, 24, 2.). Figs from  Attica  were especially prized and were a valuable export commodity. As a result, Athens had decreed that the very profitable fig business was to be a state  monopoly  and all fig growers were obliged to sell their entire produce to the state. Falsely accusing someone of clandestine transactions with figs was therefore a convenient way to  slander  them before the courts.   The figrid tree is sacred to  Dionysus  Sukites ().

Fig Fruit Facts Page Information                      Availability  by variety                                  Figs are believed to be indigenous to western Asia and to have been distributed     by man throughout the Mediterranean area. Remnants of figs have been found in     excavations of sites traced to at least 5,000 B.C.             In the United States, the major centers for commercial production of cultivated     figs are California and Texas. The more popular Californian varieties are packed     fresh or dried. Most Texas figs are canned.             Figs were brought to California by the Spanish missionary fathers who first     planted them at the San Diego Mission in 1759. Fig trees were then planted at     each succeeding mission, going North through California. The Mission fig,     Californias leading black fig, takes its name from this history. The popular     Calimyrna fig, golden brown in color, is the Smyrna variety that was brought to     Californias San Joaquin Valley from Turkey in 1882, and was renamed Calimyrna     in honor of its new homeland.

clueweb09-en0008-44-37179	"                                     HISTORY           A. Old World           The fig is mentioned         frequently in the Bible and is included in the garden of Eden. It is a         traditional food in the Jewish Passover celebration. The fig tree         figures in the founding of great cultures and religions. Romulus and         Remus, the founders of Rome, were suckled by a she-wolf under a fig         tree, which later, in the time of Pliny, was revered as a sacred tree.         While sitting under a fig tree, Siddhartha Gautama had the revelation         that formed the foundations of Buddhism. Figs have been prized for both         medicinal and dietary value. Mithridates, the Greek king of Pontus         (120-63 B.C.), heralded figs as an antidote for all ailments and         instructed his physicians to consider its uses as a medicine. Pliny of         Rome (62-113) said ""Figs are restorative. The best food that can be         eaten by those who are brought low by long sickness and are on the way         to recovery. They increase the strength of young people, preserve the         elderly in better health and make them look younger with fewer         wrinkles"". The early Greeks so highly prized figs that it was         considered an honor to bestow the foliage and fruit. In the original         Olympic games, winning athletes were crowned with fig wreaths and given         figs to eat.                    The common fig probably originated in the fertile part of southern         Arabia (Solms-Laubach 1885). Ancient records indicate both King         Urukagina of the Sumarian era (2900 B.C.) and the Assyrians (2000 B.c.)         were familiar with it. No records of its introduction to this area         exist, but the caprifig, ancestor of the edible fig, is still found         there growing wild. From southern Arabia the Bahra tribe brought the fig         to ancient Idumaea and Coelsyria (Lagarde 1881). Over a period of         several centuries, it slowly spread from there to Syria and the         Mediterranean coast. Once figs reached the coast, they rapidly spread         throughout the Mediterranean region aided by the maritime nations. They         were known in Crete by 1600 B.C.                     While it is probable         that the home of the edible fig is ancient Arabia, the origin of the         cultivated fig industry is most certainly elsewhere. Almost all         currently cultivated subtropicals, e.g., citrus, almonds, pistachios,         walnuts, peaches, olives, dates, and prunes, were initially cultivated         in unknown locations in western Asia or Asia Minor. The only known         civilization of sufficient age and sophistication capable of these         accomplishments is that of the Mesopotamians, who dwelt in the Tigris         and Euphrates river valleys over 10,000 years ago and are credited as         the original cultivators of many modem important horticultural and         agronomic crops (Eisen 1901).                    The Phoenicians and the Greeks, the greatest Old World colonizers,         independently, and via different routes, were responsible for spreading         fig culture throughout the Old World. By the end of the 14th century         B.C. the older of the two, the Phoenicians, had colonized the islands of         the          Mediterranean: Cyprus, Rhodes, Sicily, Malta, and Corsica. Their         colonization to the south included the coasts of Africa, Spain,         Portugal, and France and up to the English Channel. Evidence indicates         the fig industry spread with these explorations prior to its         introduction into Greece and Italy.                    The recorded history of the fig industry begins with its introduction         into the Mediterranean outside Asia, and particularly into Greece. Some         of the earliest Greek reportings of figs are in mythological literature.         According to Greek mythology, Zeus was pursuing Ge and her son, Sykeus,         In the war of the Titans when, to save him, she metamorphosed into a fig         tree. The ancient city of Sykea is named for this myth. Another Greek         myth credits the goddess Demeter (Ceres) as introducing the ""fruit         of autumn"" to humans. Among the Hellenes, figs were sacred to the         libidinous and bibulous god, Dionysius. According to myth he placed a         phallus of fig wood on the grave of Polyhymnos as a substitute for a         promised favor, which he kept for himself. To this day the phallus         carried at Dionysian festivals is carved of fig wood and the fig tree is         the tree of phallic worshippers. The use of figs among early Greeks         paralleled their rise in the literature: when mention of figs was         infrequent in the literature, fresh figs were a luxury of the rich.         Later, when references were common, figs had become an important dietary         staple, particularly dried figs during winter months.                    It is uncertain when figs were first introduced to Europe. They are         hardly mentioned in the Homeric songs (ca. 850 B.C.), the oldest         existing European literature. There is no reference to them in the         Iliad, the description of the Trojan war waged by the Greeks. However,         in the Odyssey, the description of Odysseus' wanderings after the war,         figs are mentioned three times; during the agonies of Tantulus in the         lower world he tried in vain to reach the fruits almost within his         grasp: ""...pomegranates, pears, apples, sweet figs and dark         olives."" As the Homeric songs were probably composed in the ninth         century B.C. these references would be among the earliest. However,         later investigations st the verses mentioning figs were interpolations         of a later date. The st mention of undoubted authenticity is by the         seventh-century B.C. Archilochus, who tells of figs being cultivated on         the isle of Paros. these few references it can be deduced that figs were         introduced Greece in the eighth century B.C., probably from the Semitic         nations s from Palestine and Asia Minor. Thereafter, in the seventh         century, B.C., Attica and Sikyon, the latter named after syke 'fig' in         Greek became famous for their figs. Because they were so highly valued,         the in ruler Solon, (639-559 B.C..) decreed against their export,         reserving Lise solely for the Greeks. Xerxes, the king of Persia, ate         Attican figs to remind him of the desirability of conquering a place         that could ice such fine fruit.                    Once introduced fig cultivation quickly spread throughout Greece to         become an important article of diet for both rich and poor. The term         ""sycophant"" has its origins in ancient Greece. Athenians were         particularly fond of figs and were nicknamed ""sycophants"" (syke         or fig-eaters). Later, when members of the same population informed         authorities of illegally exporting figs from Attica, the word assumed         its modern meaning. From this time on the fig is mentioned frequently in         Greek literature.                    From Greece, fig culture spread to northern Mediterranean and Adriatic         shores until it reached southern Italy. There it must have been         established by the eighth century B.C. as it is mentioned in the         earliest Roman mythology in conjunction with the founding of Rome, as         previously mentioned.                    Figs were sufficiently important to Romans that considerable effort         expended developing new cultivars. These were sufficiently numerous and         distinct for Pliny (23-27) to note: ""We see from this how the real         law which preserves the types of the species may vary."" The         cultivars described by Theophrastus, Cato, and Pliny can no longer be         identified with certainty and probably have long since been discarded in         of better ones. The many cultivars mentioned by Greek and Latin authors         indicate that fig culture was extensively distributed and of great         importance. Also, from these writings it appears that the best figs were         those of Syria. During the reign of the emperor Tiberius (42 B.C.-37         A.D.) was considerable trade in Syrian figs.                    By the end of the Roman Empire in the fifth century, fig culture was         well distributed throughout the Mediterranean and along the shores         of  the Atlantic; it stretched from Africa, Portugal, France,         Channel Islands, and the southern part of England. However, Syria was         preeminent in the cultivation and drying of figs. The hieroglyphic for         fig was bakou and was often referred to as a country rich in wine, oil,         and bakou (Chabas 1782).                    Seventeen hundred years after the Phoenician colonization, the Arabic         conquests retraced their route. They carried the fig in its numerous new         permutations, and raised fig culture to a degree of importance it had         never attained since Syria. The Arabic invasion extended through         northern Africa to Spain and Portugal and in these countries fig culture         flourished rapidly and became even more important than it had been in         Greece or Italy. Arabs esteemed figs above all other fruits.         Zamakkhschari, an Arabian interpreter of the Koran, reported that         Mohammed said, ""If I could wish a fruit brought to paradise it         would certainly be the fig.""                    These Arabic medieval invasions indelibly stamped their mark on fig         culture in the occupied territories. The figs grown there were vastly         superior to those of the Greek and Roman colonies. Algarve In Portugal,         the most southern of the Greek colonies outside the Pillars of Hercules,         was later occupied by Arabs, and with its almost ideal climate, it         produced a fig that dominated Western European and English markets well         into the nineteenth century. The now dominant Smyrna fig did not         supplant the Portuguese figs until late in the nineteenth century.         Arabic influence is still felt today in Portugal where caprifigs are         referred to as fico de toca, from the Arabic name tokkar, and in Malta         where the name tokar is still in use.                    Figs moved east more slowly than they moved west as they thrive in arid         climates and are not suited to the humid tropics of India and Asia. They         became a dietary staple in Greece centuries before they were introduced         to Media or Persia. This lack of knowledge of figs caused the Greeks to         consider the Medes and Persians barbaric. A Greek military advisor of         the time warned his king, Kroisos, not to wage war with         ""...barbarians who know neither wine nor figs"" (Hehn 1877).         However, wild varieties similar to caprifigs are still found in Persia         and India which could have been used to produce an edible fig.         Therefore, it is possible, although no evidence exists, that figs were         cultivated prior to the fourteenth century in Persia and India.           The fig spread slowly         through Asia Minor and Syria to Mesopotamia, Persia, and the Arabian         desert. Fig culture was still unknown in the lowlands between the Tigris         and Euphrates (Solms-Laubach 1885) by the time it had been highly         developed in Iran, Armenia, and Afghanistan. India first cultivated figs         in the fourteenth century and edible native varieties are now found         growing in the Punjab hills.                    Figs supposedly reached China in 127 during the reign of the emperor         Tschang-Kien, who supported an expedition to Turin, Italy, but some feel         this early report is a myth. The fig is first mentioned by Chinese         writers in the eighth century, and therefore it is generally thought         figs reached China no earlier than the Tang period (618-907).         Hia-tscheng-Shi in his work on Chinese trade, Yu-yang-tsa-tsu, speaks of         tin-tin; tin is 'fig' in Arabic, from Fo-tin (Palestine). He mentions         that this fruit was produced without blossoms, which is the appearance         figs give. A type of fig, apparently not identical to our own, was grown         in China in the fourteenth century. The first verifiable report of fig         culture in China was that of the celebrated writer Le-Shi-tschen who         described figs growing in Chinese gardens. From this point on it is safe         to assume the fig was firmly established in the Far East.                    Although well regarded in Egypt, the fig never assumed great prominence;         a papyrus from 1552 B.C.. extols it as a tonic for the body. Tombs at         Benihassan depict fig trees being harvested (Unger 1859; Zohary 1975).         The spread of figs southward in Africa was even slower, not reaching         South Africa until the nineteenth century.                    B. New World           Figs were first         introduced into the New World by Spanish and Portuguese missionaries.         The Spanish historian Puente y Olea (1900) located records of European         fig shipments from Seville, Spain to the West Indies in 1520. Oviedo y         Validez (1526) tells of fig trees growing on the Island of Espanola (now         Cuba). Then, as now, market protection existed. While the island was a         Spanish colony, families were each allowed only one fig tree to prevent         competition with the mother country (Canova 1910). Simultaneously, the         Spanish also introduced figs to Peru in 1528 (Acosta 1590; Tamaro 1920).                    From the West Indies figs spread to both coasts of the United States         (Unger 1859, 1860). Initially, they were quickly adopted by local         populations. However, by the twentieth century they had become a         thriving industry In the southwest and a dooryard tree In the         southeastern United States.           1. Eastern United         States. From Cuba, figs were introduced to Santa Elena (Parris Island,         South Carolina) on the southeastern coast of the United States in 1575         and quickly spread throughout the region (Menendez 1500; Martinez 1577).         Independently, they were introduced to Virginia from Bermuda in 1621         (Brown 1898). A town in Florida, established In 1763 by one Dr. Turnbull         who sponsored the immigration of 1500 Greeks and Minorcans, was named         New Smyrna, after the popular cultivar of fig produced there (Forbes         1821). In 1720, figs from France were introduced by the French         missionaries to their colony, the Louisiana Territory (Hamilton 1910).         Figs thrived throughout the region and reports of them in the         Southeastern United States were numerous after this time (Brickell 1737;         Berquin-Duvallon 1806; Nuttall 1821; Ash 1836; Starnes 1903; Evans 1904;         Hall 1910; Hamilton 1910; Smith 1910; Sandford 1911; Gould 1919; Gray         1933; Snydor 1938; Bartram 1940).                    However, while fig trees themselves quickly spread, predominantly north         and westward, the development of an industry did not follow throughout         the southeastern United States. The naturalist Bartram (1942) was         surprised that figs were not more prevalent in Florida. Other historians         remarked on the small size and lack of development of such a potentially         lucrative industry (Bruce 1935; Beverly 1947). Walker (1919) stated that         the fig tree"". . . grows easily and luxuriantly-but there is no         recorded effort of its being dried in marketable quantities, and it has         never become as it might, a staple crop."" This failure was not due         to lack of interest on the part of influential horticulturists or         nurserymen. Both Thomas Jefferson and the horticulturist Thomas Affleck         actively imported and distributed new cultivars, primarily from France (Affleck         1842, 1844; Edwards 1943; Betts 1944; Hedrick 1950). Other enthusiastic         horticulturists from Ohio, Illinois, and Washington, D.C. attempted to         develop an industry in the same manner, offering new cultivars and         publishing circulars detailing fig culture (Worthington 1869; Needham         1879; Benson 1886). One, G. F. Needham of Washington, D.C., wrote"".         . . no other crop can be raised which will give so certain and so large         returns in our Middle and Northern States as that delicious fruit, the         fig."" A conversation overheard by Margaret Smith (1906), in a         Washington, D.C. restaurant in 1835, underscores their popularity:         ""No nuts, raisins, figs, etc.?"" ""Oh, no, no, ma'am, they         are quite vulgar.""                    Despite these efforts and an obviously successful fig tree culture in         the southeastern United States, a fig industry failed to develop. Some         records of failed attempts exist. J. K. Russell of Olustee, Florida,         destroyed his orchard due to high labor costs and foreign competition (Reasoner         1891). This is interesting in light of the fact that competition from         Old World countries is still one of the most pressing problems facing         the California industry today. Other Florida plantings were given up as         ""unsuccessful"" (Reasoner 1891) or were frozen out (Swingle         1893). Some successful records exist; in 1910 F. C. Reimer (1910)         reported one orchard of figs in Raleigh, North Carolina, which         ""during the past five years netted the owner greater returns than         any acre in other fruits in the eastern half of the state.""         However, these individual success stories are rare. H. P. Gould reported         in 1919 that fig trees are common only as garden or dooryard trees in         the fig belt east of the Mississippi where they were found as large and         lovely additions to historic towns, and estates (Irving, 1860; Orr,         1871; Hoppin, 1926; Sale, 1930).           2. Western United         States. A complete history of the fig in California has been documented         in detail by Wickson (1888), Eisen (1901), Roeding (1903), Swingle         (1908), Rixford (1918), Butterfield (1938), and Condit (1933), and         therefore, this review will only touch upon the main events.                    In spite of the fact that figs were well distributed throughout the         southeastern United States they did not spread initially from there to         the western United States. Rather, they were imported from the West         Indies to Spanish missions in Mexico. It Is generally accepted that they         subsequently spread from Mexico to California with the Franciscan         missionaries. The first California figs were planted in 1769 in the         gardens of the mission at San Diego. These same figs were planted in the         string of missions stretching northward to Sonoma, and according to         Mission records, they existed in Santa Clara by 1792 and in Ventura by         1793 (Vancouver 1798). Hence, the first figs in California were         'Mission' or 'Franciscan' figs.                    'Mission' figs remained the only figs in California until the arrival of         American settlers from the east in 1850 who then imported a wide variety         of figs from the eastern United States and Europe. These imports led to         the establishment of the first commercial fig orchards in California. By         1867 there were over 1000 acres (400 ha) in the Sacramento Valley and 35         acres (15 ha) in the San Joaquin Valley. 'White Adriatic' was the most         widely planted cultivar. A 27-acre (11 ha) orchard of 'White Adriatic'         figs planted in Fresno in 1885 produced the first carload of dried figs         sent east in 1889.                    The 'White Adriatic' fig remained the most popular California fig until         the twentieth century. W. A. Taylor (1898) wrote of the 'White         Adriatic': (it) has many points of merit. . . but the fact that its         quality when dried is inferior to that of the imported dried fruit from         Smyrna has resulted in several efforts to introduce and grow the Smyrna         type of fig."" The first California introduction of its successor,         the true Smyrna ('Lob Injir') fig, was made in 1880 by P, C. Rixford,         manager of the San Francisco Evening Bulletin. Within ten years, more         Smyrna cultivars were introduced by a Fresno nursery, the California         State Board of Horticulture, and the USDA. These rooted cuttings and         trees were planted in various San Joaquin and Sacramento Valley         locations, including Governor Leland Stanford's Vina ranch.                    All these imports grew vigorously, but they displayed a common problem.         Although they profusely produced buds and set fruit, the fruit did not         persist beyond walnut size; uniformly all fruits dropped by early         summer. The widespread notion that worthless Smyrna cuttings had been         distributed was quelled when Smyrna figs propagated from seeds produced         the same result.                    This problem renewed interest in the long simmering debate concerning         pollination of Smyrna-type figs. Eisen had previously reported in detail         the necessity of pollinating, or caprifying, Smyrna-type figs (Condit         1947). Not until 1890 when C. Roeding of Fresno demonstrated that         caprification was necessary for fruit set did the California industry         attempt to obtain the fig wasp, and its vehicle, the inedible monoecious         caprifig. The first caprifigs entered California in 1890 with separate         fig imports from Asia Minor (Swingle 1908). Smyrna, and Mexico. Repeated         failures to successfully achieve pollination at this point led to the         conclusion that each Smyrna cultivar required a specific blastophaga.         Therefore, the USDA agricultural explorer W. T. Swingle continued         collecting caprifigs from Greece and Algeria through the nineteenth         century. Finally, mamme Smyrna-type figs that reached Fresno,         California, in April of 1899 successfully issued wasps on June 23, 1899.         This date is the 'true beginning of the California commercial fig         industry.                     The story of         blastophaga's California' introduction has a colorful subplot. As early         as 1868 a Mr. Gates of Modesto, California claimed to have a caprifig         tree with a mamme crop that harbored the fig wasp (Swingle and Rixford         1911). Roeding (1910), the introducer of record, disputed the claim with         Gates in parallel columns of the Dec. 29, 1910 California Cultivator.         Roeding concluded his argument with: ""Is it possible as a poor         despised worm, ant, and fly, you have resided in Stanislaus county these         many years? Oh! that I could believe it.""                    With Smyrna fig production now assured the fledgling industry set about         promotion. ""No horticultural event since the discovery and         propagation of the navel orange can compare in commercial importance to         the recent establishment of Smyrna fig culture in California. Its         successful introduction into the state marks a new epoch in our fruit         interests and those who engage in it first will reap large         profits."" Thus stated a promotional circular of the Ceres Fig Lands         Company. As with many commercial ventures this initial assessment was         true for a time, and the Smyrna fig, soon known as the 'California         Smyrna' or 'Calimyrna', became its leading cultivar.                    The beginning of the twentieth century through 1943 was the heyday of         the California fig industry. By 1943, California had 34,499 acres         (14,000 ha) of figs, 96% of it bearing and virtually all of it In the         central San Joaquin Valley. The bearing crop area consisted of 40% 'Calimyrna',         26% 'White Adriatic', 18% 'Black Mission' and 15% 'Kadota'. The 1943         crop, largest of record, was 29,400 t merchantable and 6,700 t         substandard grade fruit. From this zenith the industry entered a decline         that persisted through 1972. At its nadir California fig area dropped to         16,628 acres (6,753 ha) with 93% of it bearing, and consisting of 54% 'Calimyrnas',         26% 'White Adriatic', 11% 'Kadota', and 10% 'Black Mission' figs. The         primary reason for the decline was the perennial problem of foreign         competition with its relatively low cost labor. This coupled with         increasing domestic labor costs, encroachment of residential and         industrial development into the primary production areas, and an         unfavorable tax structure that taxed agricultural land on adjacent         property rather than actual use, caused the California fig industry to         decline.                    The 1967 Arab-Israeli conflict, which closed the Suez Canal and         therefore Mediterranean shipping channels from the east, created a         demand for California figs. The availability of abundant, inexpensive,         irrigated land on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley as a result of         the completion of the California Aqueduct, and the need to plant an         early-bearing crop to defray taxes and stand-by water charges,         facilitated new fig plantings. The net result was a resurgence in the         industry starting with increased plantings in 1968. From 1973 through         1967 the industry area has fluctuated between a low of 15,910 acres         (6,439 ha) in 1978 to a 1981 high of 21,520 acres (8,709 ha). The         current cultivar percentage has shifted toward 'Calimyrnas' (59%) and         'Black Missions,' (16%), and away from 'White Adriatics' (19%) and 'Kadotas,'         (7%) (California Fig Advisory Board 1988).                    Currently, California ranks third in world fig production after Turkey         and Greece, and ahead of Spain and Portugal. The state produces 100% of         domestic fig production and 65% of the figs consumed in the country. In         1987 it produced a total of 15,000 t of figs with a total value of $16         million. Of the 26 noncitrus fruit crops produced in California, figs         rank 22nd in value and 18th in bearing area (Moyer 1989).                    The California fig industry has formed a mandatory California State         Dried Fig Marketing Order for the purposes of grade and quality standard         enforcement, market development, and production research support. The         industry also voluntarily supports the California Fig Advisory Board and         the California Fig Institute-organizations formed to administer product         and market development, and production research,                    III. BOTANY           A. Taxonomy           The mulberry family,         Moraceae, to which figs belong contains 60 genera and possibly more than         2,000 species of trees, shrubs, vines, and herbs. Common edible figs and         their pollinating counterpart, caprifigs, are members of the subgenus         Eusyce within Ficus carica-a species characterized by only unisexual         axillary flowers and by gynodioecism. It is the only member of its genus         cultivated for its fruit. Several allied members of this subgenus         closely resemble true Ficus species, and members intermediate in form         between true Ficus and these allied species suggest hybridization among         them. This could explain some of the difficulties among botanists with         species delineation and characterization of Ficus spp. Numerous studies         exist on the classification of Ficus (Condit 1955, 1969; Condit and         Enderud 1956), but there are great disagreements. The estimated number         of species in the genus Ficus range from 600 (Engler 1889; Lyon 1922,         1929; Ridley 1922, 1930) to 800 (Verdoorn 1938) to 900 (Corner 1933,         1960ab, 1962, 1964, 1965, 1967) to 1,000 (Condit 1969) to 1,500 (Sata         1944) to 1,600 (Krause 1953) to 2,000 (Merrill 1943).                    With such a large number of fig species, and the obvious disagreement         about classification within the genus, it would be expected that,         without fruit present, common fig trees would be hard to distinguish         from other Ficus app. However, its deciduous character and twig and leaf         characteristics make the common fig readily identifiable when using the         keys devised by Condit (1941, 1969).                                                History             of the Fig    Nutritional             Information    Recipes     Recipe             Submission               Packaging/Sales                 Contact             Us    Email       Fig             Advisory Board    Home              "

The  Common fig  ( Ficus carica ) is a large,  deciduous ,  shrub  or small  tree  native to southwest  Asia  and the eastern  Mediterranean  region (from  Greece  to  Pakistan ). It grows to a height of 3-10m tall, with smooth grey  bark . The  leaves  are 1225 cm long and 1018 cm across, and deeply lobed with three or five lobes. The  fruit  is 35 cm long, with a green skin sometimes ripening towards purple. The  sap  of the tree's green parts is an irritant to human skin.

Fig can also be found in continental climate with hot summer, as north as Hungary, and can be picked twice or three times a year.Thousands of  cultivars , most unnamed, have been developed or come into existence as human migration brought the fig to many places outside its natural range. It has been an important food crop for thousands of years, and was also thought to be highly beneficial in the diet.   The edible fig is one of the first plants that were cultivated by humans. Nine  subfossil  figs of a  parthenocarpic  type dating to about 94009200 BC were found in the early  Neolithic  village  Gilgal I  (in the  Jordan Valley , 13 km north of Jericho). The find predates the domestication of  wheat ,  barley  and  legumes , and may thus be the first known instance of  agriculture . It is proposed that they may have been planted and cultivated intentionally, one thousand years before the next crops were domesticated ( wheat  and  rye ). [ 1 ]   Figs were also a common food source for the  Romans .  Cato the Elder , in his  De Agri Cultura , lists several strains of figs grown at the time he wrote his handbook: the Mariscan, African, Herculanean, Saguntine, and the black Tellanian ( De agri cultura , ch. 8). The fruits were used, among other things, to fatten geese for the production of a precursor of  foie gras .   Figs can be eaten fresh or dried, and used in  jam -making. Most commercial production is in dried or otherwise processed forms, since the ripe fruit does not transport well, and once picked does not keep well. In  Bengal , the fruit is called  Dumur .

Dried figs         [ edit ]   Figs and health   Figs are one of the highest plant sources of  calcium  and fiber. According to USDA data for the Mission variety, dried figs are richest in fiber, copper, manganese, magnesium,  potassium , calcium, and vitamin K, relative to human needs. They have smaller amounts of many other nutrients. Figs have a  laxative  effect and contain many antioxidants. They are good source of  flavonoids  and  polyphenols [ 2 ] . In one study, a 40-gram portion of dried figs (two medium size figs) produced a significant increase in plasma antioxidant capacity [ 3 ] .     [ edit ]   Pollination, propagation, and fruit   Although commonly referred to as a fruit, the fig fruit is actually the flower of the tree, known as an  inflorescence  (an arrangement of multiple flowers), a  false fruit  or  multiple fruit , in which the flowers and seeds grow together to form a single mass. The genus Dorstenia, also in the figs family ( Moraceae ), exhibits similar tiny flowers arranged on a receptacle but in this case the receptacle is a more or less flat, open surface. The flower is invisible, as it blooms inside the fruit. The small orifice visible on the middle fruit is a narrow passage, which allows a very specialised wasp, the  fig wasp , to enter the fruit and pollinate the flower, whereafter the fruit grows seeds.  See  Ficus: Fig pollination and fig fruit .   Figs are easy to propagate through several methods. For propagation in the mid-summer months, air layer new growth in August (mid-summer) or insert a hardened off new 6-10"" tip in moist  perlite  or a sandy soil mix, keeping the new cuttings in a shaded area until new growth appears, then gradually moving into full sun. An alternative propagation method is bending over a taller branch, scratching the bark to reveal the green layer, then pinning the scratched area tightly to the ground. Within a few weeks, new roots will develop and then the rooted piece can be clipped from the mother plant and transplanted where desired.   For spring propagation, before the tree starts new growth, cut 6-10"" tips that have healthy buds at their ends and set into a moist perlite and/or sandy soil mix, and move to a shaded area. Once the plant starts to leaf out bury the whole plant up to the bottom leaf to give the plant a good start.   Most fig varieties grown in the U.S.A. are of the variety that do not require the fig wasp, that is, they are self fertilizing and the fruit grows seeds. However, to propagate by using those seeds is not the preferred method since the above methods of propagation are quicker and more predictable.     [ edit ]   Cultural aspects   In the book of  Genesis  in the  Bible ,  Adam and Eve  clad themselves with  fig leaves  (Genesis 3:7) after eating the "" forbidden fruit "" from the  Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil . Likewise, fig leaves, or depictions of fig leaves, have long been used to cover the  genitals  of nude figures in painting and sculpture. Often these fig leaves were added by art collectors or exhibitors long after the original work was completed. The use of the fig leaf as a protector of modesty or shield of some kind has entered the language.   The biblical quote ""each man under his own vine and fig tree"" (1 Kings 4:25) has been used to denote peace and prosperity. It was commonly quoted to refer to the life that would be led by settlers in the American West, and was used by  Theodor Herzl  in his depiction of the future  Jewish Homeland [ citation needed ] .   There is a chapter in the Quran named after the fig tree, and the fruit is also mentioned in  Qur'an  in many places. The Prophet  Muhammad  mentioned figs and then stated, ""If I had to mention a fruit that descended from paradise I would say this is it because the paradisiacal fruits do not have  pits ...eat from these fruits for they prevent  hemorrhoids , prevent  piles  and help  gout ."" (Bukhari)  [1]   Since the flower is invisible, there is a  Bengali  proverb:  tumi jeno dumurer phool hoe gele , you have become (invisible like) the dumur flower. The derisive English idiom  I don't care a fig  probably originates from the abundance of this fruit.   In  Greek mythology  the god  Apollo  sends a crow to collect water from a stream for him. The crow sees a fig tree and waits for the figs to ripen, tempted by the fruit. He knows that he is late and that his tardiness will be punished so he gets a snake from the stream and collects the water. He presents Apollo with the water and uses the snake as an excuse. Apollo sees through the crow's lie and throws the crow, goblet, and snake into the sky where they form the constellations  Hydra ,  Crater  and  Corvus .   The word "" sycophant "" actually means  ""showing the figs""  (derived by the Greek words ,  skon , ""fig"", and ,  phan , ""to show"") and was used in ancient  Athens  for those who informed against another for exporting figs (which was forbidden by law) or for stealing the fruit of the sacred fig-trees, whether in time of famine or on any other occasion (Plutarch, Life of Solon, 24, 2.). Figs from  Attica  were especially prized and were a valuable export commodity. As a result, Athens had decreed that the very profitable fig business was to be a state  monopoly  and all fig growers were obliged to sell their entire produce to the state. Falsely accusing someone of clandestine transactions with figs was therefore a convenient way to  slander  them before the courts.   The figrid tree is sacred to  Dionysus  Sukites ().

Species         About 800, see  text         Ficus  is a  genus  of about 850  species  of woody  trees ,  shrubs ,  vines ,  epiphytes , and  hemiepiphyte  in the  family   Moraceae . Collectively known as  fig trees  or  figs , they are native throughout the  tropics  with a few species extending into the semi-warm  temperate  zone. The so-called  Common Fig  ( F. carica ) is a temperate species from the Middle East and eastern Europe (mostly Ukraine), which has been widely cultivated from ancient times for its  fruit , also referred to as  figs . The fruit of most other species are also edible though they are usually of only local economic importance or eaten as  bushfood . However, they are extremely important food resources for wildlife. Figs are also of paramount cultural importance throughout the tropics, both as objects of worship and for their many practical uses.

Take, for example, the  Common Fig , a small temperate deciduous tree whose fingered  fig leaf  is well-known in art and  iconography ; or the  Weeping Fig  ( F. benjamina ) a hemi-epiphyte with thin tough leaves on pendulous stalks adapted to its  rain forest  habitat; or the rough-leaved  sandpaper figs  from  Australia ; or the  Creeping Fig  ( F. pumila ), a vine whose small, hard leaves form a dense carpet of foliage over rocks or garden walls. Moreover, figs with different plant habits have undergone  adaptive radiation  in different  biogeographic  regions, often leading to very high levels of  alpha diversity . In the tropics, it is quite common to find that  Ficus  is the most species-rich plant genus in a particular forest. In Asia as many as 70 or more species can co-exist. [ 1 ]   The specific identification of many of the species can be difficult, but figs as a group are relatively easy to recognize. Many have  aerial roots  and a distinctive shape or habit, and their fruits distinguish them from other plants. The fig fruit is an enclosed  inflorescence , sometimes referred to as a  syconium , an urn-like structure lined on the inside with the fig's tiny flowers. The unique fig  pollination  system, involving tiny, highly specific wasps, know as  fig wasps  that enter these closed inflorescences to both pollinate and lay their own eggs, has been a constant source of inspiration and wonder to biologists [ 2 ] . Finally, there are three vegetative traits that together are unique to figs. All figs possess a white to yellowish sap ( latex ), some in copious quantities; the twig has paired  stipules  or a circular stipule scar if the stipules have fallen off; and the lateral veins at the base of the leaf are steep, forming a tighter angle with the midrib than the other lateral veins, a feature referred to as a ""tri-veined"".   Unfortunately, there are no unambiguous older  fossils  of  Ficus . However, current  molecular clock  estimates indicate that  Ficus  is a relatively ancient genus being at least 60 million years old [ 2 ] , and possibly as old as 80 million years. The main radiation of  extant  species, however, may have taken place more recently, between 20 and 40 million years ago.     [ edit ]   Ecology and uses           Coppersmith Barbet  feeding on  White Fig  ( Ficus virens ) fruit       Figs are  keystone species  in many  rainforest   ecosystems . Their fruit are a key resource for some  frugivores  including  fruit bats ,  capuchin monkeys ,  langurs  and  mangabeys . They are even more important for some  birds .  Asian barbets ,  pigeons ,  hornbills ,  fig-parrots  and  bulbuls  are examples of  taxa  which may almost entirely subsist on figs when these are in plenty. Many  Lepidoptera   caterpillars , for example of several  Euploea  species (Crow butterflies), the  Plain Tiger  ( Danaus chrysippus ), the  Giant Swallowtail  ( Papilio cresphontes ), the  Brown Awl  ( Badamia exclamationis ), and  Chrysodeixis eriosoma ,  Choreutidae  and  Copromorphidae   moths  feed on fig leaves. The  Citrus long-horned beetle  ( Anoplophora chinensis ), for example, has larvae which feed on  wood , including that of fig trees; it can become a  pest  in fig plantations. Similarly, the  Sweet Potato Whitefly  ( Bemisia tabaci ) is frequently found as a pest on figs grown as  potted plants  and is spread through the export of these plants to other localities. For a list of other diseases common to fig trees, see  List of foliage plant diseases (Moraceae) .          Leaves of the  Sacred Fig  ( F. religiosa )       The wood of fig trees is often soft and the  latex  precludes its use for many purposes. It was used to make  mummy   caskets  in  Ancient Egypt . Certain fig species (mainly  F. cotinifolia ,  F. insipida  and  F. padifolia ) are traditionally used in  Mesoamerica  to produce  papel amate  ( Nahuatl :  matl ).  Mutuba  ( F. natalensis ) is used to produce  barkcloth  in  Uganda .  Pou  ( F. religiosa  leaves' shape inspired one of the standard  kbach rachana , decorative elements in  Cambodian  architecture.  Weeping Fig  ( F. benjamina ) and  Indian Rubber Plant  ( F. elastica ) are identified as powerful air-cleaning plants in the  NASA Clean Air Study .  Indian Banyan  ( F. bengalensis ) and the Indian Rubber Plant, as well as other species, have use in  herbalism . The latter is known to be a  hyperaccumulator  of  benzene  and  methane [ dubious     discuss ] , and urban or potted plants should be considered toxic for that reason.          A page from the  Mexican   Huexotzinco Codex , painted on  matl       Figs have figured prominently in some human cultures. There is evidence that figs, specifically the  Common Fig  ( F. carica ) and  Sycamore Fig  ( F. sycomorus ), were among the first - if not the very first - plant species that were deliberately bred for agriculture in the  Middle East , starting more than 11,000 years ago. Nine  subfossil   F. carica  figs dated to about  9400-9200 BC  were found in the early  Neolithic  village  Gilgal I  (in the  Jordan Valley , 13 km north of  Jericho ). These were a  parthenocarpic  type and thus apparently an early cultivar. This find predates the cultivation of  grain  in the  Middle East  by many hundreds of years. [ 3 ] .     [ edit ]   Cultural and spiritual significance   Fig trees have profoundly influenced culture through several religious traditions. Among the more famous species are the  Sacred Fig  tree ( Peepul, Bodhi, Bo,  or  Po, Ficus religiosa ) and the  Banyan  Fig ( Ficus benghalensis ). The oldest living plant of known planting date is a  Ficus religiosa  tree known as the  Sri Maha Bodhi  planted in the temple at  Anuradhapura , Sri Lanka by King Tissa in 288 BC. It is one of the two sacred trees of  Islam , and there is a  sura  in Quran named ""The Fig"" or  At-Tin ( ), and in  East Asia , figs are pivotal in  Buddhism ,  Hinduism  and  Jainism .  Siddhrtha Gautama , the Supreme  Buddha , is traditionally held to have found  bodhi  (enlightenment) while meditating under a  Sacred Fig  ( F. religiosa ). The same species was  Ashvastha , the "" world tree "" of Hinduism. The  Plaksa  Pra-sravana  was said to be a fig tree between the roots of which the  Sarasvati River  sprang forth; it is usually held to be a Sacred Fig but more probably seems to be a  Wavy-leaved Fig  ( F. infectoria ). The Common Fig tree is cited in the  Bible , where in Genesis 3:7, Adam and Eve cover their nakedness with fig leaves. The fig fruit is also included in the list of food found in the Promised Land, according to the Torah ( Deut.  8). Other important plants reported included:  wheat , barley,  grapes ,  pomegranates ,  olives , and dates (representing the honey). Jesus cursed a fig tree for bearing no fruit ( Mark 11:12-14 ).     [ edit ]   Fig pollination and fig fruit   See also:  Common Fig          A  Common Fig   syconium  (fruit)       Many are grown for their fruits, though only  Ficus carica  is cultivated to any extent for this purpose. Furthermore, the fig fruits, important as both food and traditional medicine, contain laxative substances, flavonoids, sugars, vitamins A and C, acids and enzymes. However, figs are skin allergens, and the sap is a serious eye irritant. The fig is commonly thought of as fruit, but it is properly the flower of the fig tree. It is in fact a  false fruit  or  multiple fruit , in which the flowers and seeds grow together to form a single mass. The genus  Dorstenia , also in the figs family ( Moraceae ), exhibits similar tiny flowers arranged on a receptacle but in this case the receptacle is a more or less flat, open surface.

Source:  USDA Nutrient database       A fig ""fruit"" is derived from a specially adapted type of  inflorescence  (an arrangement of multiple flowers). In this case, it is an involuted, nearly closed receptacle with many small flowers arranged on the  inner  surface. Thus the actual flowers of the fig are unseen unless the fig is cut open. In  Chinese  the fig is called  w hu gu  ) Traditional Chinese :   ;  Simplified Chinese :   ; ), ""fruit without flower"" [ 4 ] . In  Bengali , where the Common Fig is called  dumur , it is referenced in a proverb:  tumi jeno dumurer phool hoe gele  (""You have become [invisible like] the  dumur  flower"").   The syconium often has a bulbous shape with a small opening (the  ostiole ) at the outward end that allows access to  pollinators . The flowers are pollinated by  very small wasps  that crawl through the opening in search of a suitable place to lay eggs. Without this pollinator service fig trees cannot reproduce by seed. In turn, the flowers provide a safe haven and nourishment for the next generation of wasps. This accounts for the frequent presence of wasp larvae in the fruit. Technically, a fig fruit proper would be one of the many tiny mature, seed-bearing flowers found inside one fig - if you cut open a fresh fig, the flowers will appear as fleshy ""threads"", each bearing a single seed inside.   The fig plants can be monoecious (hermaphrodite) or dioecious (hermaphrodite and female): [ 5 ]     All the native fig trees of the American continent are hermaphrodites, as well as species like  Indian Banyan  ( F. benghalensis ),  Weeping Fig  ( F. benjamina ),  Indian Rubber Plant  ( F. elastica ),  Fiddle-leaved Fig  ( F. lyrata ),  Moreton Bay Fig  ( F. macrophylla ),  Chinese Banyan  ( F. microcarpa ),  Sacred Fig  ( F. religiosa ) and  Sycamore Fig  ( F. sycomorus ).   On the other hand the Common Fig ( Ficus carica ) is a dioecious plant, as well as  F. aspera ,  Roxburgh Fig  ( F. auriculata ),  Mistletoe Fig  ( F. deltoidea ),  F. pseudopalma ,  Creeping Fig  ( F. pumila ) and related species.     The hermaphrodite Common Figs are called  ""inedible figs""  or  caprifigs ; in traditional culture in the  Mediterranean region , they were considered food for  goats  ( Capra aegagrus ). In the female fig trees, the male flower parts fail to develop; they produce the  ""edible figs"" .  Fig wasps  grow in Common Fig caprifigs but not in the female syconiums because the female flower is too long for the wasp to successfully lay her eggs in them. Nonetheless, the wasp pollinates the flower with pollen from the fig it grew up in. When the wasp dies, it is broken down by enzymes inside the fig. Fig wasps are not known to transmit any diseases harmful to humans.   When a caprifig ripens, another caprifig must be ready to be pollinated. In temperate climes, wasps hibernate in figs, and there are distinct crops. Common Fig [ verification needed ]  caprifigs have three crops per year; edible figs have two. The first ( breba [ 6 ] ) produces small fruits called  olynth . Some  parthenocarpic   cultivars  of Common Figs do not require pollination at all, and will produce a crop of figs (albeit  sterile ) in the absence of caprifigs or fig wasps.   There is typically only one species of wasp capable of fertilizing the flowers of each species of fig, and therefore plantings of fig species outside of their native range results in effectively sterile individuals. For example, in  Hawaii , some 60 species of figs have been introduced, but only four of the wasps that fertilize them have been introduced, so only four species of figs produce viable seeds there. This is an example of  mutualism , i.e. one organism (fig plant) can not propagate itself without the other one (fig wasp).   The intimate association between fig species and their wasp pollinators, along with the high incidence of a one-to-one plant-pollinator ratio have long led scientists to believe that figs and wasps are a clear example of  coevolution . Morphological and reproductive behavior evidence, such as the correspondence between fig and wasp larvae maturation rates, have been cited as support for this hypothesis for many years [ 7 ] . Additionally, recent genetic and molecular dating analyses have shown a very close correspondence in the character evolution and  speciation  phylogenies of these two clades.

Build Raised Beds    Growing in raised beds has many advantages: It can be easier on aging backs and knees, and the soil conditions inside a raised bed can easily be kept optimal.         Text by Kelly Wood/Photos by Rhoda Peacher                                                                                           Step 4                                       Growing in raised beds has many advantages: It can be easier on aging backs and knees, and the soil conditions inside a raised bed can easily be kept optimal. By relegating external areas to the compaction of walking and wheelbarrows, the contained soil stays aerated, thus draining better. Raised beds can be maintained by simply topping with compost or mulch.   They extend a gardener's growing season because the walls collect early spring sun and warm up before native soil, giving plants and seeds a jump on the growing season. I also like that my raised beds look tidy, since I mow right up to the wooden edge of the bed itself.                                                  Materials List                                              Saw (power or chop)                  Power drill with screwdriver bit and small drill bit for pilot holes                  Measuring tape                  Pencil                   4 12-foot, 2""x6"" cedar boards                   4 8-foot, 2""x6"" cedar boards                  1 6-foot, 2""x6"" cedar board, cut into 6 pieces (no more than 11 inches each)                  40 2¼-inch decking or exterior screws                   A helper! This project is tricky (but possible) to assemble with only one set of hands (and feet)                                                                                                                Instructions Step One.   Determine where you want the beds to be and how large an area you want to grow in. While the sides can be as high as you'd like, raised beds should not be so wide that you can't reach the middle from either side for planting, harvesting and maintenance.       Step Two.   Obtain the lumber to build the beds. This is often a complicated decision because of the many choices. In our Oregon area, cedar, while expensive, is the most common choice. When we lived in California, redwood was by far the most prevalent. Both of these woods have a natural resistance to rot and decay, which is imperative since they will be filled with dirt and water for their entire useful lives.                                                                         Pile It On Whenever I read articles about starting a garden, they always advise paying close attention to site location.                   Exposure to light, wind and elements is important, but soil is also an important consideration. While it's usually listed second to exposure, I personally feel it's No. 1 in importance. It's possible to change the exposure of your growing area, whether by selective tree trimming, shade cloth and screens, or planting hedges to reduce wind and increase warm microclimates. Soil, however, is a much more difficult thing to change. No one in their right mind wants to remove tons of native soil and replace it with imported, no matter how high quality. And even if this were possible, and not prohibitively expensive, some experts say that it's impossible to completely rectify soil problems, particularly overall pH levels. I believe that piling on top of existing conditions is the best way to improve your soil, building it up with compost and beneficial amendments, much as happens in a deciduous forest. The easiest way to achieve this is with a raised bed.                   Raised beds can be placed almost anywhere, provided other garden conditions have been metgood exposure and convenience for the gardener. If your beds are out of the way or difficult to get to, their regular care will fall to the wayside and success will be elusive. There are a few caveats when placing raised bedsideally, you want to avoid placing them over the root systems of large, thirsty trees whose roots will invade the improved soil area and steal water and nutrients from the intended bed residents. If you have pernicious rodents like gophers or field mice, you can lay hardware cloth at the base to impede invaders. Other than that, beds can even be placed over excessively weedy areas or on solid subsurfaces like pavement, as long as protective underlayment or gravel to aid drainage is provided before filling.                                                      Another option is newer, recycled ""lumber,"" commonly known by the brand name Trex, which is a mix of sawdust and recycled plastic.       Although expensive, this will last indefinitely and often can be bent into interesting shapes to increase visual interest. Other alternatives are stone, cinder blocks, fieldstone, bricks and more; pretty much anything, except treated lumber that can leach hazardous chemicals, can be used as bed edges.       Step Three.   Cut the material to the desired sizes for your bed walls. Remember to account for overlap at the ends. For sides that are longer than 4 or 5 feet, plan to have upright supports in the middle to prevent the longer boards from bowing out.       Step Four.   Drill pilot holes in the wood to prevent splits during assembly. Screw the wall pieces onto the support braces. Use screws instead of nails since screws will hold better as the wood shrinks and swells over time and seasons. Nails have a tendency to loosen and pop out.       Step Five.   With a helper, screw the side walls to the end walls. When complete, the raised bed will be ready to place.                                                                                           Step 5                                                       Step Six.   Again with a helper, carry the finished bed to its intended location.       By having a ""free-floating"" bed, you can move it around and adjust it until you're happy with the location. At this point, it can be left as is; the weight of the wood combined with filling will keep it in place. Otherwise, you can sink metal stakes inside the walls and secure them with pipe clamps prior to filling. This lends some additional support to the walls and prevents shifting of the finished bed. These pipes can also be used to support hoops or trellising. I salvage old metal pipe, but wooden stakes can also be used. Make certain they are a rot-resistant variety and screw them to the bed walls from the outside.                                                                                           Step 7                                                        Step Seven.   Put underlayment in the bed. This can be as simple as newspaper to block grass and other tenacious weeds or as elaborate as landscape cloth and metal mesh. On top of this you can place either manure or unfinished compost, which will eventually rot, providing roots with a nutrition boost, or simply fill the raised bed with planting soil or finished compost. If you start with unfinished compost, be sure to top it off with a fine-textured planting mix or finished compost when doing final planting.                                                                         About the Author Kelly Wood farms and heavily mulches her raised beds in Portland, Ore.                                                             Step Eight.   Enjoy! With regular mulching, you can keep the beds filled and see a happy, thriving population of earthworms and other beneficial organisms that perform the tilling and incorporating work for you.

You can dig up                    a good amount of soil from your existing garden as it will have                    many of the minerals and nutrients your plants need to grow.                    If, however, you’ve had any problems with plant diseases                    in your garden, it’s best to start off with fresh soil.                    Talk to your local extension agent for details.                                        You can use roughly 25% soil from your yard as a base. Add in                    equal parts sand and compost to form a good, well-draining soil.                    After you’ve mixed your soil, check the pH to make sure                    it isn’t too acidic or alkaline. If you don’t know                    much about soil or composting, we recommend visiting this  on-line                      compost guide , which will get you on your way to composting                    and creating the perfect soil for your raised beds. Looking for a terrific soil recipe for your raised bed garden? Try the  Square Foot Gardening soil mix . It is amazingly good.                                        To discourage pests from attacking your plants, you can add                    extra protection to both the top and the bottom of your raised                    beds. If you’ve got an  elevated                      raised bed  you can cover the bottom of the bed with chicken                    wire or a similar kind of material to stop animals such as rodents                    from eating your vegetables. Birds also like to eat veggies                    and fruits, so you can consider placing bird netting over your                    raised beds.                                         To avoid problems with weeds, make sure to mulch your raised                    beds. An organic bark mulch will work well, and black plastic                    mulches or weed guards are another option for added protection                    against weeds. In general, you’ll find that weeding your                    raised beds is much easier than a traditional garden bed.                                         If your plants are hit by a soil-based disease, you can change                    out the soil in the bed and continue gardening. This is quite                    different than with traditional garden beds, where you need                    to let the bed rest for sometimes up to two years to let the                    risk of disease to dissipate.                                         Raised beds are very easy to irrigate, and they will help cut                    down on your water bill. You will only need to water where you                    plants are growing, and not the spaces between the rows or areas                    for walking around and working in your garden. There are a number                    of irrigation systems appropriate for your raised beds. For                    example, soaker hoses and drip irrigation are ideal. These systems                    will ensure that your plants get a good deep soaking and that                  the foliage stays dry.                    Overhead watering with a hose may cause                    your plants to become more susceptible to disease as foliage                    that stays moist too long can be a host of fungus and other                  diseases. Collecting water with  rain barrels  is one eco friendly way to keep your garden irrigated without using city water.                                                                                                                 Note that the sides of your raised beds may heat up in the summer                    and cause the soil to dry out a little quicker. Simply monitor                    the soil in your raised beds during the hottest months of the                    year so that your plants stay healthy and aren’t stressed.                    Note that this same characteristic of raised beds allows them                    to heat up faster in the spring and fall, which means you can                    cultivate your plants earlier in the growing season.                                         This site from  Colorado State University has tips on watering                      and using your raised bed .                                        In addition to traditional gardening with your raised beds,                    you can easily modify them to further enhance the gardening                    experience. For example, you can quickly transform your raised                    beds into a kind of greenhouse if you place a simple plastic                    structure around them to hold in the heat during colder months.                    This is a simple kind of  green                      house called a cold frame . You can be as elaborate as you                    want with your cold frame, and can design them so you can remove                    the plastic liner or break down the entire structure during                    the summer to allow easier access to your raised beds. For                     more information on building a cold frame , see this site                    from the University of Missouri.                                           Maintaining                      Your Raised Bed Garden                    Maintaining your raised beds is easy. All you really need to                    do is work the soil periodically and add organic matter. It’s                    best to add organic compost in the early spring before you plant                    so that your soil will have adequate nutrients throughout the                    growing season. When you’re resting your raised bed for                    the winter, you can also add a thin layer of crushed leaves                    or other garden waste to the top of the raised bed.                                         In the rare case that your plants have suffered from a soil-borne                    disease, you may need to remove all the soil from the bed and                    replace it will fresh soil. Also, keep track of soil drainage                    after several growing seasons, as you may need to add more sand                    or organic material and rework the soil.                                        You’ll also need to monitor the conditions of the building                    materials for your raised beds. Woods like cedar are very sturdy                    and should be fine for many growing seasons. If you’ve                    built your raised beds from concrete blocks or bricks, periodically                    check the mortar and make sure the structure is still sturdy.

Raised bed gardens offer a host of advantages, and is aesthetically      pleasing. Some of the prettiest and best kept gardens, are grown in raised      beds. There is something about a raised bed garden, that make gardeners more      conscious about the appearance of their plants. And, the benefits are many.             Making a raised bed garden  frame is relatively easy. All you need is      a hammer, saw, wood and some nails. If you want an even easier set-up, you      can buy long lasting, heavy duty plastic raised beds, that are both quick      to set-up, and strikingly attractive.                                Benefits:               Warmer soil-  The soil is elevated above ground level, allowing the      sun and air to warm it faster. This facilitates earlier planting, and better      seed germination, especially in colder, more northern climates.              Easy to reach-  Less bending over and stretching makes the joys of      working in your garden and harvesting it far more pleasurable. People with      back or knee problems, other handicaps, and elderly people really appreciate      the ease of access.              Good drainage-  Because the soil is above ground level, heavy rains      drain off much better. Standing water is entirely eliminated. And, the existence      and length of waterlogged soil after heavy downpours is minimized.              Control of soil content-  Sure, you can use soil from the surrounding      area. But, people with raised beds will bring in as much as 100% of the soil,      compost and manure they need to fill the beds. The resulting mix is a vast      improvement over the soil in your back yard. In addition, growers seek a      soil mix that is ideal for the plants they will grow in their raised beds.              Appearance-  Raised beds make for just about the most attractive gardens      around. Maybe, it just seems that way, or it's personal preference. More      likely, it's the fact that people who use raised beds tend to care more about      the overall appearance of their garden .                                            How to make Flower and Vegetable Raised Garden Beds:              The frame can be landscape timbers, railroad ties, two by tens, concrete      blocks or just about any other durable and strong material that will hold      in your soil. Even an old tractor trailer tire can be used. Years ago, this      was in fashion. Make sure the frame is sturdy enough to hold in the soil.      Anchor the sides from collapsing outward if need be. The bottom should be      open. If you are using a box or container of any kind, remove the bottom      to provide good drainage. Do not line the bottom of the frame with plastic      which will impede drainage.              Tip:  Make sure the width of the bed is no more than two arms lengths.This      way you can reach any part of the garden without stretching or climbing across      the bed and plants.              The soil-  While you can use soil from the surrounding area, it is      best to select the soil mixture that is ideal for the plants you are planning      to grow. If the raised bed is really high, use soil from the surrounding      area at the bottom.              Drip hose-  This is optional. You can use sprinklers or hand water.      But a drip hose makes the raised bed more maintenance free and efficient.      Add it at or just below the soil level . Make sure to work it in a pattern      that will evenly cover the entire area in the raised bed.              Mulch-  To make your raised bed almost maintenance free, use plastic      mulch to keep weeds out. Add organic mulches of your choice for appearance.             Make a series of smaller beds. Landscape around the beds with stone, mulch      or add paving blocks to create whatever style and look you desire.                                     Raised Bed Garden Soil:              One of the best things about having a raised bed frame in your garden, is      the soil you put into it. Here is where gardeners excel.                    Filling your raised bed starts with lots and lots of compost. Most raised      beds contain far more compost than the garden itself. While you will want      to add ample amounts of compost, and some decomposed manure, you should also      mix in some regular garden soil.                     Tip:  After filling and mixing the soil in your raised bed frame, check      the soil pH. The materials you use in the frame, could easily need adjustment      to reach an ideal pH level for your plants.

Moths         Emperor Gum Moth,  Opodiphthera eucalypti         Scientific classification             Kingdom:   Animalia       Phylum:   Arthropoda       Class:   Insecta       Order:   Lepidoptera             A  moth  is an  insect  closely related to the  butterfly , both being of the  order   Lepidoptera . The  differences between butterflies and moths  are more than just  taxonomy . [ citation needed ]  Sometimes the names "" Rhopalocera "" (butterflies) and "" Heterocera "" (moths) are used to formalize the popular distinction. Many attempts have been made to subdivide the Lepidoptera into groups such as the Microlepidoptera and Macrolepidoptera, Frenatae and Jugatae, or Monotrysia and Ditrysia. Failure of these names to persist in modern classifications is due to the fact none of them represents a pair of "" monophyletic groups "". The reality is that butterflies are a small group that arose from within the ""moths"" [ citation needed ]  and there is thus no way to group all of the remaining taxa in a monophyletic group, as it will always exclude that one descendant lineage.   Most species of moth are  nocturnal , but there are  crepuscular  and  diurnal  species. They can be distinguished from butterflies in several ways.

Northumbrian "" mohe "") from Common Germanic (compare  Old Norse  "" motti "",  Dutch  "" Mot "" and  German  "" Motte "" all meaning "" moth ""). Perhaps its origins are related to Old English "" maa "" meaning "" maggot "" or from the root of "" midge "" which until the 16th century was used mostly to indicate the larva, usually in reference to devouring clothes.   The study of butterflies and moths is known as  lepidoptery , and  biologists  that specialize in either are called lepidopterists. As a pastime, watching butterflies and moths is known as  butterflying  and  mothing . The latter has given rise to the term ""mother"" for someone who engages in this activitysometimes written with a hyphen (moth-er) to distinguish it from its  usual meaning . This confusion does not arise in speech as it is pronounced differently ( IPA :  /m/ , not  /m/ ).     [ edit ]   Economic significance of moths          An adult male Pine Processionary Moth ( Thaumetopoea pityocampa ). This species is a serious forest pest when in larvar state. Notice the bristle springing from the underside of the hindwing (frenulum) and running forward to be held in a small catch of the forewing, whose function is to link the wings together.               Poplar hawk-moth caterpillar   Laothoe populi       Moths, and particularly their  caterpillars , are a major  agricultural  pest in many parts of the world. The caterpillar of the  gypsy moth  ( Lymantria dispar ) causes severe damage to forests in the northeast United States, where it is an  invasive species . In temperate climates, the  codling moth  causes extensive damage, especially to fruit farms. In tropical and subtropical climates, the  diamondback moth  ( Plutella xylostella ) is perhaps the most serious pest of  brassicaceous  crops.   Several moths in the family  Tineidae  are commonly regarded as pests because their larvae eat  fabric  such as  clothes  and  blankets  made from natural  proteinaceous  fibers such as  wool  or  silk . [ 1 ]  They are less likely to eat mixed materials containing artificial fibers. There are some reports that they can be repelled by the scent of wood from  juniper  and  cedar , by lavender, or by other natural oils. However, many consider this unlikely to prevent infestation.  Naphthalene  (the chemical used in  mothballs ) is considered more effective, but there are concerns over its effects on human health. Moth larvae may be killed by freezing the items which they infest for several days at a temperature below 8 C (17.6 F). [ 2 ]   Moths are sturdy and usually are more resistant to pesticides than are mosquitoes and flies. [ citation needed ]   Some moths are  farmed . The most notable of these is the  silkworm , the larva of the domesticated moth  Bombyx mori . It is farmed for the silk with which it builds its  cocoon . As of 2002 [update] , the silk industry produces over 130 million kilograms of raw silk, worth about 250 million  U.S. dollars , each year. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ]  Not all silk is produced by  Bombyx mori . There are several species of  Saturniidae  that are also farmed for their silk, such as the Ailanthus moth ( Samia cynthia  group of species), the Chinese Oak Silkmoth ( Antheraea pernyi ), the Assam Silkmoth ( Antheraea assamensis ), and the Japanese Silk Moth ( Antheraea yamamai ).   The mopane worm, the caterpillar of  Gonimbrasia belina , from the family  Saturniidae , is a significant food resource in southern Africa.   Despite being framed for eating clothing, most moth adults do not eat at all. Most like the Luna, Polyphemus, Atlas, Prometheus, Cercropia, and other large moths do not have mouths. When they do eat, moths will drink nectar. [ 1 ]     [ edit ]   Attraction to light          Time exposure at floodlight showing moth flight paths       Moths frequently appear to circle artificial lights. One hypothesis advanced to explain this behavior is that moths use a technique of  celestial navigation  called  transverse orientation . By maintaining a constant angular relationship to a bright celestial light, such as the  Moon , they can fly in a straight line. Celestial objects are so far away, that even after travelling great distances, the change in angle between the moth and the light source is negligible; further, the moon will always be in the upper part of the visual field or on the horizon. When a moth encounters a much closer artificial light and uses it for navigation, the angle changes noticeably after only a short distance, in addition to being often below the horizon. The moth instinctively attempts to correct by turning toward the light, causing airborne moths to come plummeting downwards, and - at close range - which results in a spiral flight path that gets closer and closer to the light source. [ 6 ]             This article  needs additional  citations  for  verification .  Please help  improve this article  by adding  reliable references . Unsourced material may be  challenged  and removed.  (August 2007)       In 1972, Henry Hsiao, now a professor of  biomedical engineering , suggested that the reason for moths circling lights may have to do with a visual distortion called a  Mach band . [ 7 ]  He says that they fly towards the darkest part of the sky in pursuit of safety and are thus inclined to circle ambient objects in the Mach band region.   Hsaio says that the celestial navigation theory should cause moths to circle lights, not to head directly toward them, as many are seen to do. He conjectures that moths, which are nocturnal creatures, must find a place to hide from predators when daylight comes, but cannot do so in darkness. Their instinct when morning comes is to fly toward the light (presumably up) and then down again, with some probability landing on a surface which matches their camouflage. [ 6 ]   A theory which has been advanced in an attempt to explain the attraction male moths have for candles specifically is based on olfaction. There is evidence that olfaction might be, in some cases, mediated by detection of the infra-red spectra of substances. [ 8 ]  The spiky infrared spectra of a candle flame happens to contain a number of emission lines which coincide with the vibrational frequencies of the female moth's pheromone. [ 9 ]  The male moth is thereby powerfully attracted to the flame. Sources, eg. hurricane lamps, with different spike patterns are less powerful attractants.   Night-blooming  flowers  usually depend on moths (or  bats ) for  pollination , and artificial lighting can draw moths away from the flowers, affecting the  plant 's ability to reproduce. A way to prevent this is to put a cloth or netting around the lamp. Another way is using a colored light bulb (preferably red).

Moths are also eaten by some species of  lizards , some  cats , some  dogs , some  rodents , and some  bears . Moth larvae are vulnerable to being parasitized by  ichneumonidae .   Baculoviruses are parasite  double-stranded DNA   insect  viruses that are used mostly as  biological control  agents. They are members of the  Baculoviridae , a family that is restricted to insects.

They have striking coloration; two yellow stripes run down their mottled-black back, interspersed with blue spots. Their bodies are covered with white spines. They feed on various broad leaved plants (see list below).   The adult moth's wings are black with cream and chestnut markings, with a wingspan of approximately 50 mm (2.0 in).

clueweb09-en0002-83-20795	"     Ohio State University Extension Fact Sheet   Horticulture and Crop Science   2021 Coffey Rd., Columbus, Ohio 43210-1086     Raised Bed Gardening   HYG-1641-92    Pete Lane    Gardening in raised beds, a common practice before colonial times, is enjoying a resurgence of popularity among home vegetable growers. In parts of the world with greater population densities or less tillable land, gardening in beds is still the norm.  What are ""raised beds""?    The ""raised"" part means that the soil level in the bed is higher than the surrounding soil, and ""bed"" implies a size small enough to work without actually stepping onto the bed. A bed should be no wider than 4 feet, but length can be whatever suits the site or gardener's needs. Wider beds can be subdivided into sections accessible from planks or stepping stones. The bed does not have to be enclosed or framed, but if unframed, the use of power tillers is feasible. Framing offers several other opportunities, however; and a properly maintained bed will not need powercultivation.  Higher Yields    There are many reasons for the raised bed revival, but probably the most important is more production per square foot of garden. In a traditional home garden, good management may yield about .6 pounds of vegetables per square foot. Records of production over three years in a raised bed at Dawes Arboretum near Newark, Ohio, indicate an average of 1.24 pounds per square foot, more than double the conventional yield. Raised beds do not require the usual space between rows because no walking is done in the bed to cultivate or harvest. Hence, vegetables are planted in beds at higher densities - ideally spaced just far enough apart to avoid crowding but close enough to shade weeds.  Improved Soil Conditions    Another reason for greater production in a given space is the improvement of soil conditions. Soil compaction can reduce crop yields up to 50 percent. Water, air and roots all have difficulty moving through soil compressed by tractors, tillers or human feet. Plows, tillers or spades have been the usual answer to this problem, but gardeners can avoid the problem completely by creating beds narrow enough to work from the sides. Soil organic matter content can be increased greatly without getting bogged down.   Raised beds also help in situations where compaction is not the only culprit. Homeowners may have low spots unsuited for conventional gardens because of ponding or excessive erosion from runoff. Raised beds rise above these, with frames as a foundation. Gravity becomes an ally, not only in avoiding soggy soils but in reducing a problem common to western Ohio - alkaline soils. Saturated soils get a dose of lime every spring via percolation. In a raised bed, gravity reduces percolation to a trickle from capillary action. Soil acidity can be maintained in the 5.8 to 6.8 pH range that vegetables prefer.  Ease of Working    The gardener shares some benefits from raised beds as well. The first, and most important, is the increased ease of timely planting and harvesting. Most people avoid working traditional gardens in rainy weather to avoid compaction and muddy feet. Because raised beds are designed for walking around, not in, there is no reason for mud to delay operation. Spaces between beds may be left in sod, mulched or even paved with stone or brick.  Ease of Pest Control    Pest control becomes less difficult in raised beds. If burrowing rodents are abundant, the bottom of the bed can be lined with poultry wire or hardware cloth. Rabbits and groundhogs can be discouraged by placing their favorite foods in a framed bed with a low fence. The narrow dimensions of beds even make bird netting suspended on flexible conduit frames practical. Weed control with plastic mulch can be achieved economically, as the width of the bed can be spanned by one roll.  Water Conservation    The narrow dimensions of beds are advantageous for water conservation. There are several watering systems that ensure the water gets only where it is needed. Canvas soaker hoses, perforated plastic sprinkle hoses and drip-type irrigation disperse water in a long, narrow pattern well-suited to beds. They also reduce disease by directing water to the soil instead of wetting leaf surfaces as with overhead irrigation.   For those who are producing for more than just family or friends, raised beds may not be the answer. Certain vegetables, such as squash, melons and sweet corn might do as well on ground level due to the extensive space they shade.  Construction Tips    There are only a few guidelines to remember in raised bed construction:  Keep the beds narrow and match their length to the site and the watering system. A north-south orientation is best for low-growing crops, allowing direct sunlight to both sides of the bed. Beds that will contain taller crops such as pole beans, trellised peas or caged tomatoes might do better on an east-west axis. Thus, lower-growing crops could be planted on the south side of the bed and still get full sun.   Avoid the use of creosote or pentachlorophenol-treated lumber for bed frames. These chemicals can leach out and injure plants. Use pressure-treated lumber, redwood, cement block or brick, and be aware that the cement in block will raise soil pH over time.   Even if the soil is heavy clay, at least  one-third of the volume of the bed's root zone should consist of existing soil. There are a lot of good minerals in clay and by loosening it up with one-third compost or peat and one-third coarse sand, it will make a good growing medium. Add a little garden fertilizer and test the soil after the first crop year.   Raised bed possibilities are endless. Beds elevated 2 feet or more offer the promise of gardening without bending and can have benches built on the sides for even more convenience. Because a bed warms up quicker than the ground, it can easily double as a cold frame by covering it with a lightweight clear plastic cover. Imagine being able to start plants early in beds with covers and never having to transplant them!  Supports for poles, cages and trellises can be mounted to the frame for longer life and ease of installation and removal.   Many of the same principles used in raised beds are being adopted on a larger scale in field crops. Ridge tillage, solid seeding and controlled traffic are all new techniques designed to deal with drainage, weed or compaction problems and to increase productivity. Traditional gardens with orderly rows on wide intervals have mimicked their larger farm counterparts for years. Maybe it is time for them to change their role model to the new farm, or the ancient garden.   The author gratefully acknowledges James D. Utzinger who reviewed the original fact sheet.

Hardy Kiwis        ( Actinidia sp. )            Sponsored links:                  The kiwi is a small, soft-fleshed fruit with a delectable and distinctive taste.  The kiwi is really a vine not a tree, but it grows so large that one needs to treat it much like a tree, so we include it in this tree-fruit section.    Kiwis come in two broad classes:  the ""standard"" kiwi (often called the ""fuzzy kiwi""),  A.  deliciosa , which is perhaps lemon-sized and which has a fuzzy skin requiring that it be peeled before use, and the smaller ""hardy kiwis"",  A.  arguta  and  A.  kolomikta , which can be eaten entire, rather like a good-sized grape.  (There is another, the ""Chinese kiwi"",  A chinensis , not yet much seen outside of China, though it is very popular there.)    The fuzy kiwi, though it long dominated the rapidly growing kiwifruit market, is the least flavorsome of the types, and also the greatest nuisance to prepare or eat, owing to its skin. The so-called ""hardy kiwi"" types are now emerging as the preferred alternative, inasmuch as they may be eaten out of hand, are better tasting, and have a wider growing zone.    Four important things to know about growing hardy kiwis:         Male and female flowers are born on different plants, so both males and female vines must be planted, preferably interspaced for optimum pollen spread.      The plants often take several years to mature--from 3 to as many as 9 years (though more than 3 is unusual, and some are even quicker).      Though the  plants  are extremely winter-hardy, they develop shoots early in the spring that are quite sensitive to frost.  There can be ""shoot burn"" in many years; though the   plant usually survives, regrows, and fruits despite, fruit will not develop  that year .      Hardy kiwi are extremely vigorously growing vines, requiring a substantial supporting trellis.            But, as one source says,  Despite the challenges, once one has sampled the fruit, kiwi growing seems well worth the trouble.  The fruit is aromatic, with fuzzy kiwi, banana, strawberry, and pear flavors all wrapped up in one delightful package.    Fortunately,  Actinidia kolomikta  is not only described as ""best suited to short-season and cold-winter areas""--that's us--but is said to fruit in its first year after planting [Yeesss, Pinky!].  The species is hardy to Zone 3, and only needs about 130 frost-free days to ripen its fruit, which sometimes drop when ripe.    One source, albeit speaking of commercial operations, states that ""Under optimum conditions, yields of . . . about 200 pounds per vine can be expected"".  Cut that  even by  ten  to allow for home-growing, plant two vines, and you've got 40 pounds a season--and probably more--when the vines are mature.       Hardy Kiwi Cultivars       The typical ""hardy kiwi"" used to be the  A.  arguta  species; what held its development back was fear by the commercial growers that its smaller size would be a marketing handicap--but its special and superior flavor has made it a success anyway.  Regrettably, though  A.  arguta  is significantly hardier than the old standard kiwifruit, it is not quite hardy enough for really northerly climates.  Fortunately, the other hardy kiwi species,  A.  kolomikta   is , with only modest grower care, hardy enough for regions like ours.  The choice of  A.  kolomikta  for our kiwi species is really a no-brainer.    That said, what of particular cultivars?    At least in North America, there seems so far little cultivar distinction.  One reads of ""Arctic Beauty"", but that seems to be mostly or entirely just a nickname for the entire   kolomikta  species, rather than any cultivar of it.    The few named varieties (all female--the males seem to have no cultivar names) mentioned in the literature, not counting things identified only by codes, are:        September Sun : no information--this appears to be the  Sentyabraskaya  also listed below     Red Beauty : no information--this  might  be a commercial name for some other cultivar in this list     Krupnopladnaya :  large-fruited; flavor is said to be excellent; sugar content c. 14% when fully ripe); low to moderate vigor but cold-hardy and productive.     Pautske :  a vigorous cultivar; its fruit are large and of good quality; the plants are more vigorous than those of  Krupnopladnaya  but still really vigorous.     Aromatnaya :  medium-size fruit; sugar content c. 20% when fully ripe; fruit ripens in late summer; productive.     Tomoko :  no information save the name.     Matovaya :  no information save the name.     Sentiabrskaya :  no information save the name--now marketed as ""September Sun"".     Aromatnaya :  no information save the name.     Paukðtës Ðakarva :  no information save the name.     Landë :  no information save the name.     Lankë :  no information save the name.     Laiba :  no information save the name.     Anyksta :  no information save the name.     Dr. Szymanowski :  no information save the name.      The USDA  classes  two of those-- Krupnopladnaya  and  Pautske --as ""economically important"".    The particular variety we are putting in is called by the nursery  September Sun   A.  kolomitka  (the male being simply known as ""Artic Beauty"").  Of that female (under its old, original name of  Sentiabrskaya ), one source says:      Exceptionally proliferating very hardy Ukraine female cultivar.  White slightly lemon scented flowers borne In May.  In order to bear fruit a plant requires about   130 days without frost.  Tasty berries ripen in August and fall to the ground.  Leaves either green or green-white slpashed with pink.  The variegation appears in its second, third year   after planting and is more prominent on leaves in full sun.  It grows up to 4m [c.  13'] tall (1-2 m [c.  3' to 6'] of annual growth).  Pruning is best done in late autumn or winter   (before the vegetation period), or in summer after the stems have partially grown thick and woody; otherwise the vine will bleed sap.       Kiwi Culture    These are just a few summary notes--consult the varous web pages linked farther below for more detail.       Conditions    The hardy kiwi prefers a sound, loamy, pH-neutral soil.  Above all, the soil drainage must be perfect.  Full sun is said to be best for good fruit production, but many sources recommend partial shade for optimum overall success.  Either way, it should definitely be well-sheltered from wind, especially in the colder months.    A.  kolomikta  is inherently quite cold resistant (but see farther below), with dormant plants hardy down to at least -20°F.  The chief problem encountered in growing hardy kiwi is that they are fairly low-chill plants, meaning that they are all too likely to break bud a lot sooner than we'd like, and consequently encounter late-spring-freeze damage to the developing buds (even though the  plants  are safe enough).  In a bad year, spring freeze damage can mean no crop that year.    The vines grow well on a wall, and can also be grown into trees.  (Beware: cats are very fond of this plant, and can easily damage it by scratching at it.)  They are vigorous  climbers, and require a sturdy support.       Growing    Plant the largest vines available, allowing one (nonfruiting) male for up to eight (fruiting) females.  The vines can be supported on a T-trellis that is about six feet high and wide, with 3-5 wires strung between the arms of the T. In that scheme, space posts sixteen feet apart, with plants at half that distance.    Although hardy kiwifruits are, as their name implies, cold hardy,  that cold-hardiness comes only with age ;  young  plants commonly freeze back, delaying production.  So plant the largest vines you can get hold of, and protect the developing trunks from winter sun and cold with ""Tree-Shelters"", corn stalks, burlap, pipe insulation, or tree-wrap material.  Keep in mind that the trunks of hardy kiwifruits are rarely exposed to full sunlight in the wild, so don't be afraid to wrap them well.    Fruit is produced on second-year wood, or on fruit spurs on older wood; pruning is best carried out in the winter, while the plant is dormant.    Prune annually.  Remove 70% of the wood--all the spent, misplaced, and tangled wood--leaving approximately 30% percent, composed of the previous year's new growth.  When plants are young, be sure you have one trunk, two cordons, and last year's pencil-sized new lateral growth (fruit spurs - close nodules).  Removing more than about 70% will throw the plant out of balance and it will become vegetative the following year:  you need last year's fruit spurs present.

Odds and Ends    Biology    The genus  Actinidia  contains about 60 often quite various species.  All  Actinidia  species are perennial, climbing, or scrambling plants; most are deciduous, though a few from warmer areas are evergreens.  All species appear to be dioecious:  that is, the flowers on male vines produce viable pollen but lack a properly developed ovary, ovules, or styles, while the flowers of female vines appear perfect, but the pollen they release is shrivelled and non-viable.  That all means that one must have both male and females vines present to  produce fruit.    The fruits of the various  Actinidia  species are all berries, in that they are fleshy, have many seed embedded in the flesh, and do not split open at maturity.  Horticulturally, however, they display great diversity, often in the attributes that are important to growers.  For example, the fruit can occur singly, in small bunches of three to five fruit, or sometimes in larger bunches or infructescences containing up to 30 or more fruit.  They can vary in size, shape, hairiness, and external color.  Some species change color as they ripen. The flesh can also vary in color, juiciness, texture, and composition.  The fruits of some species are basically inedible or, at best, unpalatable, whereas the flavor of the fruit of others is considered superb.    The four species of use for edible fruit are  A.  deliciosa , the ""standard"" kiwifruit;  A.  chinensis  (only recognized as a distinct species in the early 1980s), a type a bit smaller, and much more nearly hairless, than  A.  deliciosa  and reportedly of much better flavor, and now very popular in China;  A.  arguta , which is the more common sort of what is now called the ""hardy kiwi"", and has a significantly better flavor than the ""standard"" kiwi; and  A.  kolomikta , another ""hardy kiwi"" that is even hardier than  A. arguta .       History    The kiwi, unlike most common fruits, is a strikingly modern development.  A mere century ago it was just a wild plant growing in China; by 1970, it had been developed into a major new fruit crop in New Zealand.  Today, the kiwi is an important commercial crop grown in several regions of the world:  it has also become an important element of international trade , the three biggest producer countries exporting almost all the kiwifruit they produce.  Total world production now exceeds that of such well-established crops as raspberries and currants, and is likely to soon exceed the production of strawberries and apricots.    Almost all kiwifruit cultivars being grown in orchards outside China are descended from just three plants--two female and one male--themselves derived from  a single seed  introduced to New Zealand in 1904, a seed probably collected at Hubei or Sichuan in China.       Envoi    Kiwifruit contain large quantities of the enzyme actinidin, which will tenderize meat, for those who still eat dead animals.

Vines are excellent for providing a fast screen. They will give height to a landscape while needing little ground space and are therefore useful in small gardens.     Vines grown on an arbor can give shade much sooner than most trees can. On steep banks where a lawn will not grow, vines may be used as groundcovers. Vines are not only useful; they are beautiful, with bright flowers, luxuriant foliage, fragrance and interesting stem patterns.       SELECTING A VINE        Selecting a suitable vine depends on its intended use, location, soil adaptability and type of support. Select vines with dense foliage and rapid growth for screening. Plant vines with fragrant flowers near windows or near porches and patios.     Vigorous, tall growing vines such as grapes or wisteria are ideal for growing on a large arbor to give shade, while a vine for decorating a mailbox support should be much smaller in ultimate size.     Deciduous vines will shade in summer and let light through in winter when they are bare. Annual vines allow experimenting with vine designs.       TYPES OF VINES       Vines climb by tendrils, by twining or by clinging. These three types of climbing methods will determine the kind of support needed.     Tendrils are slim, flexible, leafless stems that wrap themselves around anything they contact. Grapes are the best known vines that climb by tendrils. Vines that use tendrils to climb will need supports such as wire or thin wood stakes.     Twining vines wind their stems around any available support. Honeysuckle and wisteria use this method of climbing. Twining and tendril-type vines climb best on wires, trellises and arbors. They can be grown on flat surfaces only if proper supports are also provided. Vine supports should be constructed with sturdy, durable materials.     Clinging vines, like Boston ivy, climb by attaching small rootlike holdfasts to walls, trees or other rough-textured surfaces as a means of support. Clinging vines can be used on either brick or masonry walls. They should never be used on the walls of frame buildings. Their method of climbing has a tendency to damage wood.     GROWING VINES    Most vines grow well in moist but well-drained soil, but there are vines for almost every soil and light condition.     Vines will need pruning to limit growth, to thin the stems and branches and to remove dead or damaged wood. Vines that grow rapidly may need to be pruned at frequent intervals. Vines may develop sparse foliage low on the trellis and develop a mass of foliage at the top. To prevent this, pinch back the ends of the stems as they develop.

clueweb09-en0002-83-20774	     Ohio State University Extension Fact Sheet   Horticulture   2001 Fyffe Court, Columbus, OH 43210     Kiwifruit and Hardy Kiwi   HYG-1426-93   John Strang  Richard C. Funt    Kiwifruit, which has replaced the old English name of 'Chinese gooseberry', are native to the mountains and hills of southwestern China where they grow wild in trees and on bushes. The kiwifruit was introduced to the United Kingdom, Europe, United States, and New Zealand between 1900 to 1910 from China. Commercial plantings were made in New Zealand about 1930 and have become widespread over the last 20-30 years.   There are over 50 species in the genus  Actinidia  to which the kiwifruit belong. All of these are long-lived perennial vines or creeping types. The plants are dioecious which means that male and female flowers are found on different plants. Thus, one male plant is needed for each eight female plants for pollination. Male plants do not produce fruit. Fruit range from round to oblong in shape and from smooth-skinned to hairy. Flesh color may be green, orange, or yellow.   'Hayward' is a female variety of  A. deliciosa  var. deliciosa that is now the primary variety grown commercially. This is because of its large fruit size, superior keeping quality (up to 6 months) and fine flavor. There are now a number of strains of 'Hayward' being grown.   'Hayward' fruit are fuzzy, brown and oblong in shape. The flesh is tart-sweet and tastes like a combination of citrus, melon, and strawberry. When fruit are cut crosswise the emerald-green flesh has a ring of small black edible seeds. This variety is primarily grown in California's Central Valley in the United States. It is only winter hardy down to approximately 10 degrees F and consequently will not survive in the mid west.   A. arguta is more cold hardy than the kiwifruit and is reported to survive temperatures of -25 degrees F. This is the species that has been purchased and planted by many backyard fruit growers in the midwest. Fruit size is considerably smaller than that of 'Hayward' and is about the size of a large sweet cherry. The skin of A. arguta is smooth and consumed with the fruit. Fruit are greenish-yellow in color and acidic until ripe. When ripe they are very sweet and juicy and the flavor is considered to be better than that of the kiwifruit.   A. kolomikta  has smaller fruit than  A. arguta .  A. kolomikta  is very winter hardy and will survive temperatures down to -30 degrees F. Fruit are very sweet and have a superb aroma and flavor. They are also very high in vitamin C which can be one percent of the fresh weight. The vine is the least vigorous of the three Actinidias discussed here. It is generally known as a landscape plant for its pink and white variegated leaves which are particularly attractive on the male plants.   Both  A. arguta  and  A. kolomikta  are called hardy kiwi and have not succeeded in commercial plantings thus far. They are primarily grown by amateur horticulturists in areas where midwinter temperatures prevent the growth of kiwifruit.  Frost Hardiness    One of the primary problems in growing any of the  Actinidia  species is that the plants begin growing early in the spring and the young shoots and developing flower buds are extremely susceptible to injury from spring frosts. They can be damaged by even brief exposures to 30 degrees F or lower. Thus, the flower buds are normally killed by spring freezes and the plants rarely produce fruit. Successful cropping of kiwifruit may require a long frost-free growing season of about 220 days.   The plants, particularly young plants, are susceptible to trunk injury from spring frosts. The trunk increases in hardiness as it gets older and develops a thicker layer of bark, but it is recommended that the trunks be protected. This has been done by laying the plants on the ground and covering them with leaves, wrapping the trunks or using sprinklers and heaters for frost protection.  Site Selection and Planting    Hardy kiwi often do not survive the first growing season. This is generally due to planting in a poorly drained soil and the development of root rot or neglect after transplanting.   Survival can be improved by growing them in a five gallon container for the first season. Plants should be staked and transplanted only after they have become well established late in the first growing season or after the danger of frost is past the following season. The plant must be transplanted to the yard or the container must be protected during the winter to prevent the roots from freezing. Water the plants adequately, but not excessively.   Select a planting site that has good air drainage, and one that is protected from high winds and is not frost prone. The soil should be a well-drained loam, since heavy clay soils make plants much more prone to root rot. Plants do best when the soil pH is around 6.5. Set plants 15-18 feet apart in the row.  Fertilization    Fertilization involves mixing one pound of organic fertilizer or 2 to 4 oz of a slow release fertilizer with the soil at planting. The roots are very sensitive to fertilizer burn, so over fertilization should be avoided. At the end of the growing season apply one-half pound of 10-10-10. In subsequent years fertilize twice a year, once in early spring when the plants are dormant and then just after bloom in early June. Apply 1 lb of 10-10-10 in the spring and 0.75 lb after bloom the second year and 2 lbs. in the spring and 1 lb. after bloom the third and future years. Distribute the fertilizer well over the entire root system to avoid root injury.  Trellising    There are several different trellis types and training systems available. The T-bar trellis will be described here. Construct your trellis prior to or shortly after planting. It must by strong enough to support the weight of the plants. Use posts that are from four to six inches in diameter and eight to nine feet long. Locate a post at each plant (15-18 ft apart) and set them two to three feet deep. Brace the end posts well. Attach a five-foot long two-by-four cross-arm to the top of each post and brace it back to the post with wire or wood. Then stretch three 8 to 12 gage wires along the tops of the cross-arms. Place two of the wires at the ends of the cross-arms and one down the center.  Training Young Plants    Train a single shoot up each post to the top of the trellis by removing any lateral growth. Tie the shoot, which will form the trunk loosely to the post and prevent it from winding around the post.   At the top of the trellis, train the shoot along the center wire in one direction. The following year a shoot will be trained along the center wire in the opposite direction. These two shoots will form the permanent leaders on the vine. Prevent these leaders from twisting around the center wire, since this can weaken the vine in future years. The lateral canes that develop from these leaders are tied perpendicular to the leaders to the outer wires. These canes will be the fruiting canes the following year.  Dormant Pruning    The main leaders that were trained to the center T-bar wire are permanent unless they become weak or winter injured. Then they are renewed by tying down a new vigorous shoot. Replace all other wood on an annual cycle in late February. Pruning should be done well before growth starts in the spring to prevent vine bleeding. Remove most of the wood that fruited the previous year and any twisted or broken canes. Retain vigorous one-year-old canes that have not fruited and are well spaced (about every 10-15 inches) along the leaders and form a single canopy layer. Prune these back to the first eight buds. Where vigorous one-year-old canes have not developed or vegetative vigor is reduced, retain the fruiting arms that fruited the previous year by cutting back to eight buds past the last fruit bearing leaf axil. A small percentage of spurs are also retained for fruit production. These are short laterals that have terminated their growth back close to the leaders. They are produced usually when strong shoots are cut back.   As an alternative to the single trunk training practiced in most areas where the hardy kiwi is grown, recommendations for the Eastern United States suggest the use of multiple main trunks. This is primarily due to trunk splitting and injury due to spring frosts. Multiple trunks can be developed from the ground and each trained as a leader on the trellis. If one trunk is injured, it can be removed and still leave a large proportion of the plant.   Inspect plants in the spring for trunk damage. If the bark is lifted completely around the trunk, prune the trunk off below this damage. Vigorous regrowth from the stump will replace the trunk.  Summer Pruning    Summer pruning is begun just before flowering. Remove shoots that do not have flowers that originate outside the wires. Flowering shoots are cut back four to six leaves past the last flower. Tangled shoots are also removed. Later in the summer, shoots that are not needed for replacement canes are removed and replacement canes are tipped to prevent tangling.  Pruning Male Plants    Since male plants do not produce fruit they can be particularly vigorous. These plants are pruned immediately after flowering and the flowering shoots are cut back to vigorous new growth closer to the leader. Male plants are not pruned during the dormant season so that maximum flowering is achieved.  Irrigation    Irrigation is important for a number of reasons. Lack of water will reduce fruit size, reduce flower numbers, and induce early fruit drop. Drought will also induce leaf drop and early fruit ripening which leads to uneven ripening and poor fruit flavor. Water stress also delays the development of vine maturity and appears to reduce vine fall hardiness.  Flowering    Flowering on vines that have not been damaged by spring frost normally occurs on three-year-old vines. If the plants were propagated from juvenile vines instead of mature vines by the nursery, flowering may take an additional year or two to begin. Flowering takes place in late May.  Fruit Development and Harvest    The fruit quickly sizes after pollination and reaches its full size in the middle the summer. However, the remaining portion of the season is required to mature the fruit. Harvest usually takes place in late September and the fruit are picked before they are ripe. Fruit taste better when picked, refrigerated and ripened as opposed to ripened on the vine.   To determine when to pick, harvest a few fruit and allow them to soften for a few days. When fruit ripens to a suitably sweet flavor, harvest all of the fruit and refrigerate them. Fruit will store in the refrigerator for five to six weeks. Removal from the refrigerator initiates softening and ripening and should be done several days before eating. All of the hardy kiwi varieties have a similar flavor. Hardy kiwi often reach sugar levels of 20 percent and are considerably sweeter than the 'Hayward' kiwifruit. The fruit also contains large quantities of the enzyme actinidin, which will tenderize meat.  Diseases and Pests    Phytophthora crown and root rot is one of the more serious diseases of hardy kiwi. It causes weak plant growth and the development of small yellow leaves. Terminal growth may be stunted or die back. Plants often collapse and die during hot weather. This disease occurs on heavy wet clay soils and these soil types should be avoided when planting. Over irrigation can also lead to Phytophthora root rot.   Hardy kiwi plants are also damaged by root knot nematodes. Two-spot spider mites can build up on plants during hot, dry weather, particularly on greenhouse grown plants and occasionally outside. Japanese beetles will do some leaf feeding.   There are several reports of cats digging up the roots and clawing the plants and foliage. Hardware-cloth or chicken wire trunk protectors are recommended for this problem.

Now you have to know that its harder to set up a raised bed than a normal bed and it also needs more attention, but the rewards you get for your effort are in my opinion well worth it! I will explain to you exactly how you plan your garden, then select the right plants and then plant and keep them alive.     Crucial step that almost nobody does is to first draw a small map of the garden. It doesn't has to be great looking, just make a quick sketch so that you have an idea on where everything is and where the space is. Go ahead and select all the places you could use for raised beds.     I usually find a lot of places, in front of the porch, left and right of the porch and everywhere in the garden itself. Let your creativity lead you to what you think is beautiful. Raised Bed gardening does not need alot of space, just fit the beds everywhere you think they look good.     The next step on your journey is to select the plants you want. You can buy a variety of plants for raised bed gardening, vegetables, flowers and even herbs. If you want to get started right away, just buy the plants and not the seeds since you have to sow most of them in the late winter indoors. Though a lot of flowers are fine with being sowed a little bit later outside.     If you know what you want don't buy it yet, first go and build the raised beds. The idea of an raised bed is following: you put a layer of stones or something else on the ground, then fence it with wood pieces or even railroad ties and then you fill the bed with new soil. This has alot of advantages like that the plants will be less likely to be attacked by diseases or pests and its especially helpful if the soil in your garden is not nutrient enough or simply too badly drained to keep plants alive. If you create a bed this way it will be very well drained and the soil will also be fluffy which is also good for alot of plants. You can of course also use something different from stones, I also like to elevate the whole bed, use two bigger pieces of wood on the ground and then build a smaller bed on top of it. With this though you have to make sure that it is well drained, drill some wholes into the bottom you use for the elevated bed.     Once you've built the bed its time for the soil. You should definitely use some soil out of your garden but if its not that great also get some pot soil from the gardening shop and some sand (this should be about 50% of the mix soil). Mix it all together to get a great soil. In Addition to this i often use compost to make it more nutrient. Renew this about every month for vegetables and herbs though its also fine to just use alot of compost. Water the plants daily if its not raining and you will be fine.     If you planted your plants a good idea is to use some mulch to protect them from diseases and frost in the colder seasons.     So you are now almost ready for raised bed gardening. One thing that you have to know though is that even with raised bed gardening you still have to rotate the vegetables every year.     Ok now you know it, plan the garden, select the plant and then build the raised beds. That's how you do  raised bed gardening .       Want to know more?

Mainland, Emeritus Professor and Extension     Specialist     Connie Fisk, Extension     Associate      Department of Horticultural Science, NCSU      (Duplin County)                  History       The kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa) is a large, woody, deciduous vine native to the Yangtze Valley of China. Seeds from China were taken to New Zealand and planted in 1906. Plants developing from these seeds first fruited in 1910. Commercial planting began in New Zealand in about 1940 and by 1970 there were 900 acres. Commercial planting in California began in the late 1960s. From 50 acres in 1970, the industry in California had grown to more than 8,000 acres by 1988 (University of California Cooperative Extension estimate). US kiwifruit production has been declining since the 1990s. Acreage in 2006 was reported as 4,300 by the California Kiwifruit Commission. In 1974 kiwifruit became the internationally accepted name, replacing Chinese gooseberry and kiwi.             In the eastern United States, kiwifruit vines have fruited at Virginia Beach, Virginia, and at several locations in South Carolina, and are part of evaluation programs in Alabama and Georgia. The first commercial shipments began in 1980 from a planting in South Carolina located about 30 miles north of Augusta, Georgia. In North Carolina, several vines were planted at a research farm near Raleigh in the early 1970s, but these did not survive the first winter. A 1979 planting at the Horticultural Crops Research Station near Wilmington was severely damaged when the temperature dropped to 2°F in early March of 1980. Almost half of the vines were completely killed, and the other half were killed to the ground. Surviving plants sprouted from below the soil line and slowly reestablished vine growth in 1980. No vine damage occurred in the winter of 1980-81. Vine vigor increased during the summer of 1981, but severe trunk and arm cracking occurred in January, 1982, following a temperature of 5°F. Surviving vines only fruited twice in the following 9 years. Severe winter damage occurred about once every three years. As a result of poor survival and fruiting, the vines were removed in the fall of 1991.          Reducing Winter Damage      Several techniques, including planting on the north side of a building and piling pine straw around the base of the plant in the fall, have reduced damage. Damage is usually the most severe on the lower 18 inches of the trunk. If this area is not warmed by afternoon sun or is protected by pine straw prior to a freezing night, less damage has been observed. Another alternative is to plant a species of kiwifruit that is more winter hardy. These kiwifruit species are known as hardy kiwifruit because they can withstand temperatures below -10ºF. However, even hardy kiwifruit require protection from frost injury in the form of overhead irrigation or another frost protection strategy when temperatures are expected to drop below 32ºF after bud break. A. arguta is the most common of the winter hardy species that are offered by commercial propagators.             Potential in North Carolina         Based on experience over the past 18 years, there is little reason to be optimistic about successful commercial kiwifruit production in North Carolina. However, the more positive results in several Virginia and South Carolina locations provide sufficient encouragement to continue kiwifruit trials on a limited scale. Vine establishment during years with less severe winters combined with increased cold tolerance of older vines may account for the success in Virginia and South Carolina. The information and suggestions in this leaflet were gathered from New Zealand, California, Oregon, Virginia, and South Carolina sources. The purpose of the information is to provide a basis for establishing trial or home plantings and not as tried and proven recommendations for commercial kiwifruit production in North Carolina.             Fruit and Vine Characteristics         A. deliciosa kiwifruit is about the size and shape of a large hen's egg with a fuzzy, dull-brown exterior. Inside, the flesh is emerald green with rows of black, edible seeds. Fruit texture is similar to strawberry and the flavor resembles a blend of strawberry and pineapple. Vines are very vigorous. Large, thick leaves combined with a fruit crop that may exceed 14,000 lb per acre contribute to a very heavy trellis load.         Hardy kiwifruit (A. arguta, A. kolomikta) are much smaller than A. deliciosa in size. Their size is similar to that of a grape and few are larger than a man's thumb. Instead of the fuzzy skin, A. arguta has a smooth, edible skin. On the interior, hardy kiwifruit resemble fuzzy kiwifruit in color, texture and flavor, though they are usually described as having more intense flavor and sweetness. From our experience, the fruit is best when soft-ripe at harvest and will only ripen during storage if harvested after the fruit reaches a stage of physiological maturity (after seeds turn black and sugar content [measured as soluble solids with a refractometer] reaches 8-14%). Storage life of the fruit is short. Variable fruit quality, dehydration, and short storage life seem to give A. arguta limited commercial potential. However, hardy kiwi is being grown and marketed as ""baby kiwi"" in Oregon and as ""grape kiwi"" in British Columbia. The primary cultivar is ‘Ananasnaya,' sometimes shortened to ‘Anna.' ‘Ananasnaya' came to North America from the Russian breeding program of Ivan Michurin during the Stalin regime. ‘Issai,' a less hardy A. arguta cultivar came from Japan in 1986. Based on recent research findings, ‘Ananasnaya' in particular may be worthy of trial in North Carolina.             Adaptation         Classified as a subtropical plant, A. deliciosa kiwifruit will not tolerate winter temperatures much lower than 10°F. When the winter minimum temperatures decline gradually over a number of weeks with a few warm days interspersed, well hardened, mature vines have survived temperatures approaching 0°F with little damage. However, in the fluctuating temperatures of North Carolina, damage often occurs just below freezing. The long growing season required for fruit to mature can also limit production. A frost free period of at least 220 days is required for adequate fruit ripening. In southeastern North Carolina, the vines can be expected to leaf in mid- to late-March and flower in mid-May. Fruit should be sufficiently mature for harvest in late October or early November. Temperatures lower than 29°F between leafing and harvest can damage the leaves, blossoms and fruit. If new growth is damaged in the spring before blossoms develop, no blossoming will occur. A. arguta has been reported to tolerate winter temperatures as low as -25°F, but freeze damage to new growth in the spring is similar to the damage described for A. deliciosa. A. arguta fruit begins ripening in mid-August in southeastern North Carolina.     Culture    Kiwifruit plantings can be handled much like muscadine grapes, however, they are much more susceptible to wind damage and root-knot nematodes, and require more supplemental irrigation than muscadine grapes. Many soil types are suitable, provided they are well drained. The soil pH should be adjusted to 6.0 to 6.5 and nematodes controlled before planting.             Planting  - Dormant plants from a nursery can be planted in the spring after there is little chance of freezing weather. Plant to the same depth as the plants grew in the nursery. After planting, prune the plant back to a single, healthy shoot 6-12 inches long.          Training and Trellising  - See North Carolina Cooperative Extension Circular AG-94, Muscadine Grape Production Guide for North Carolina, for examples of training and trellising systems. Similar to grapes, commercially grown kiwifruit plants are trained to a permanent framework, either a T-bar (like a clothesline with 4-5 wires) or pergola (solid overhead canopy with wires going in both directions). Vines can also be trained to a simple single wire or double wire system. For ease of harvest, the wires of the trellis should be at least 6 ft above the ground. Cross arms on the T-bar and double wire systems should be 5-6 ft long. Solid cross arms made from pressure treated 2- to 6-inch lumber attached to a treated post with a top diameter of at least 4 inches should support the vines if large (>6 inch), well-braced end posts are used.            Because kiwifruit vines are more vigorous than muscadine grape vines, more space should be allowed between rows. On a single wire the spacing should be 10-12 ft and with the double wire, 15-16 ft. The width of equipment to be used in the planting may influence row spacing. Space vines 18-20 ft apart in the row.            After growth begins on newly set plants, select a strongly growing shoot as the main leader to carry the vine up to the wire. Remove side shoots at least once a week for maximum growth of the main shoot. A bamboo stake is a convenient support for training the vine up to the wire. Follow the training instructions for muscadine grapes.             Pruning  - With weekly attention to training, shoots that will develop into the permanent arms (cordons) will extend the length of the wire in 1 to 2 years. After cordons extend the length of the wires, lateral shoots (canes) are allowed to grow but may require thinning to maintain a distance of 8-12 inches between them on the cordon. Mixed buds that produce both flowers and vegetative growth will develop in the leaf axils of these side branches. The following spring these buds will develop into new shoots with flowers at the first 3 to 6 nodes.            Both summer and winter pruning are required to maintain a balance between vine growth and profitable fruit production. Excessive vine growth is removed during the growing season to keep the vines open and avoid shading of the fruiting wood. If summer pruning is neglected, the fruit will be smaller and of poorer quality and winter pruning will take considerably more time. During winter pruning, shoots that are less than a pencil width in diameter should be cut back as well as wood that fruited the previous year. New fruiting wood usually will have developed at the base of the previous year's canes.             Pollination and Varieties  - A kiwifruit vine produces either male or female flowers. Plants of both sexes are essential for fruit production and they must flower at the same time to ensure pollination. Male vines are usually spaced every third vine in every third row and represent 10% of the planting. In California, 3 to 4 hives of honeybees are provided per acre.             A. deliciosa  varieties grown in New Zealand are Abbott, Allison, Bruno, Hayward, and Monty. Large fruit size and excellent keeping quality are responsible for Hayward becoming the predominant commercial variety. The Chico or Chico Hayward plants available from U.S. nurseries are similar to the New Zealand Hayward or are a selection that is almost identical. Hayward females are successfully pollinated by Chico-male, Matua or Tomori in California. For earlier flowering female varieties such as Abbott, Allison and Bruno, the male variety Matua is a better choice.             Fertilization  - Kiwifruit respond to high rates of fertilizer application. In California, 150 lb of nitrogen per acre is recommended on mature vines. New Zealand recommendations go as high as 200 lb of nitrogen per acre. Only nitrogen is generally applied in California, but a complete fertilizer with a ratio of about 3-1-2 is recommended.            On sandy soils in North Carolina, use repeated applications of small amounts of fertilizer to avoid injury. Several weeks after planting when rain or irrigation has thoroughly settled the soil around the roots, begin fertilizer application. Apply 1 oz of a complete fertilizer such as 10-10-10 uniformly within a circle 12 inches from the plant. Avoid concentrations of fertilizer around the plant base. Repeat these applications after 4 inches of rain or irrigation until mid-June. Later applications could increase winter damage by causing the plant to continue growth late in the season. During the second growing season, begin applications in early March following the first year schedule, but increase the rate to 2 oz per vine and increase the diameter of the application circle to 18 inches. Every other application, 2 oz of calcium nitrate or 1 oz of ammonium nitrate may be substituted for the 2 oz of 10-10-10. During the third year, follow the second year schedule but increase the rate to  1 /4  to  1 /2  lb per vine of 10-10-10, calcium nitrate or ammonium nitrate at each application within a 24- to 36-inch circle around the vine. From the fourth year on, broadcast the fertilizer over the entire area, increasing the amount gradually as production increases. In the fourth year, 200 lb per acre of 10-10-10 in early March, followed by 100 lb per acre of ammonium nitrate in early May and mid June should stimulate adequate plant vigor without contributing to increased susceptibility to winter damage. Rates can be increased or decreased in subsequent years, depending on vine vigor. Please note: do not use fertilizer containing chloride (such as KCl) as kiwifruit vines are very sensitive to chloride.             Irrigation  - In California, vines are generally irrigated weekly during the first three growing seasons. A combination of 1 inch to 1 1 /2  inches per week of natural rainfall and irrigation during the growing season would be desirable in North Carolina.            Sprinkler irrigation offers the potential for protecting from freeze damage to tender new growth in the spring and fruit in the fall as well as providing soil moisture.             Weed Control  - Permanent sod is often maintained between plant rows. Frequent mowing reduces competition with the vines. Competition for moisture and fertilizer is further reduced by destroying all vegetation in a 4-6 ft band under the vines with a herbicide or shallow cultivation. Deep cultivation can seriously damage the shallow, fleshy kiwifruit roots.             Pests  - Few serious insect and disease problems have been encountered by kiwifruit growers. Root-knot nematodes have been found on roots in all production areas as well as the trial planting in North Carolina. However, the nematodes do not seem to seriously reduce vine vigor. If a high population exists in the soil, fumigation prior to planting may be desirable. Japanese beetles occasionally feed on the foliage, but they prefer other plants. New pests can be expected as plantings increase. Close observation of the vines increases the chance for control of a new insect or disease before serious damage occurs.             Wind Damage  - Spring winds can break the tender young shoots at their point of attachment to the arm. Wind rub while the fruits enlarge and mature can cause flesh bruising and unsightly blemishes on the skin. Use of a pergola trellis minimizes wind damage. Lombardy poplar (Populus nigra var. italica) has been used as a windbreak in New Zealand and South Carolina. Plants are spaced 16-20 inches apart around the planting and perpendicular to the prevailing wind between every 4-6 kiwifruit rows.             Harvesting  - In California, vines generally provide their first commercial crop in the fourth season. Full production is reached within 8-12 years.         A. deliciosa fruits reach almost full size in August but are not mature enough for harvest until late October or early November (after the seeds turn black and sugar content is >6.5%). Fruit will soften off the vine if harvested after the sugar content reaches 4%, but full flavor does not develop until the sugar content reaches 6-8% on the vine. Starch in the fruit is converted to sugar following harvest. When the fruit is ready to eat, it should contain 12-15% sugar.            Fruits are harvested by snapping the stem at the abscission layer at the base of the fruit. Commercially, kiwifruit vineyards are harvested all at one time, but in the home garden the largest fruit can be removed first and the smaller fruit allowed to develop more size.        Storage and Ripening  - Mature A. deliciosa fruit can be stored for 4-6 months at 31-32°F if protected from dehydration. Storage life is substantially reduced if ethylene producing fruits such as apples or pears are present in storage. For maximum storage life, store kiwifruit alone. Fruit will ripen at room temperature when removed from cold storage. Ripening can be hastened by exposure to ethylene. This hastened ripening can be accomplished in the home by placing kiwifruit in a plastic bag with an apple.             From our experience, A. arguta is best when soft at harvest, but can be harvested firm (after seeds turn black and sugar content reaches 8-14%) and stored in vented plastic bags or clamshell packages under refrigeration for up to 6 weeks. Ripen at room temperature as for A. deliciosa. Soft, vine-ripe hardy kiwifruit will not store.

CCAT was forced to destroy the Jenkins house, thus leaving CCAT with a huge empty plot of land.  CCAT has allocated this land for appropriate technologies to be constructed.   Unfortunately, since the foundation of the Buck house was destroyed, the soil is no suitable for garden use, due to the high percentage of toxic chemical residue left over by the Buck house.  This meant that to turn the space into a garden would be impossible, unless they found a sustainable way to build garden beds.  The garden beds would serve as a solution since plants would be growing in controlled beds of soil, instead of soil with toxic in it.  Also the site in which the house used to be on, has soil which contains to much clay to grow food in it.  By building garden beds and growing within a controlled environment will make the plants grow healthier and also will prevent toxic chemicals from leaching their way into whatever will be grown in the beds.      [ edit ]    Description of Opportunity    The opportunity I have taken on for my project is building garden beds for CCAT. CCAT is interested in having garden beds built in their front lawn.  This is because they want to use the land as efficiently as they can.  The toxic soil presents it's self with a little bit of a challenge, since my goal is to make sure that none of the toxins in the soil leak their way into whatever is growing in the beds.    [ edit ]    Criteria      Cost - How expensive the project will be, making sure it cost within a reasonable budget agreed upon      by my client and I.      Aesthetics -  How the project looks when it is finished.  My client wants it too look nice and fit well with other structures at CCAT    Reusable resources used - Part of the appropriateness of my project will be the materials I use to complete this project.      Mobility - My client has asked that the garden beds be mobile, so that if they ever have to move them they can.      Companion planting - Once the garden beds are installed, my client has asked I plant companion plants in the garden beds to utilize space and make the beds more manageable for CCAT employees.      Rotational Crops - Rotational crops will be planted so the soil will stay nutrient for many seasons.  This is in hopes, CCAT will get the most out of the soil I choose to put in the beds.      Local - Almost all the materials must be bought locally, this is because supporting local business helps keep money in the community, thus sustaining the locally community.  This is very important to my client.      Time management - The project must be done with a reasonable time bracket.  Since planting season starts early-mid march, the garden beds must be built by the end of Humboldt State Spring semester mid semester break, which is March, 19, 2008.  This will allow time for planting to start and hopefully artistic expression to take place.     Artistic Expression -  CCAT has asked that the beds have some artistic expression to them to add to the aesthetics of the project.      Size -  The beds must fit within the space allocated by CCAT.  CCAT is in the process of building many things in a small space, the garden beds must fully utilize the space provided, along with being accessible and workable by CCAT community and employees.  Creating a garden bench - CCAT would like the sides of the beds to be incorporated in to some kind of sitting area so visitors to CCAT can enjoy the gardens.        Appropriateness  - The project must present it's self as an  appropriate technology , fitting into all the previous listed criteria.    [ edit ]    Literature Review    [ edit ]   Garden Bed Basics   Garden Beds are raised beds that provide a control environment for crops to grow. Raised Beds are rather simple to assemble, but if used efficiently can help maintain a weed-free garden all year round. Garden Beds, unlike conventional row gardening, can be less labor intensive, easier to maintain and can use garden space more effectively. They can also allow you to grow a diversity of different varieties of plants in a smaller space. For garden beds to be successful, special planting techniques must be understood, such as companion planting, crop rotation, succession planting and interplanting. Soil compaction occurs from walking in the garden, garden beds can be a solution to soil compaction and promote better drainage.     [1]     [ edit ]   Advantages of Raised Garden Beds   Better Drainage  Building Garden Beds is an optimal choice for individuals who have poor soil quality or compacted soil.  The soil within the beds can be controlled, thus improving soil structure, drainage and nutrient-holding capacity.      Higher Yielders  Plants will be able to have better root growth from the rich nutrients in controlled soil beds.  Intensive planting means more plants can be grown in Raised Beds, then in traditional row-planting.      Expanded Growing Season Better Drainage allows the soil to become warmers faster, thus allowing the gardener to plant earlier and harvest earlier.  This increases the lengthy of the growing season.      Maintenance  Due to the controlled environment in which the plants are being grown and the fact they are being grown in raised soil beds, decreases the amount of weeds and other unwanted plants.  This makes maintaining them a lot easier then a traditional garden.      Using Difficult Site  Garden Beds can be placed on any type of soil, this makes them optimal for any site that you traditionally you may not be able to plant in.      [2]       [ edit ]   Garden Bed Concerns   When deciding where to build a garden bed, one of the most basic concerns is how much sun is the bed going to get and at what time of day will the bed receive the most sunlight. The best spot to put a garden is in a somewhere that receives at least 6 hours of sunlight a day, preferably 8. It is also important to consider nearby trees a concern when deciding the spot of your garden bed. Over time trees will grow, thus increasing the area they provide shade too. It is important to put your garden beds somewhere, where there are not a lot of trees to avoid this issue. Soil is also another main factor in the final quality and quantity of what you produce in your garden beds.   [3]     [ edit ]   Types of Garden Beds   There are three different types of garden beds.  They include ground bed, raised beds and containers.     Ground Bed     Ground Beds are bed that place below the ground surface. For these beds there may be signs of a surface or edge surrounding the bed, but the bed its self does not go higher than the grounds surface. These systems usually rely on existing soil, although soil amendments such as compost and different types of fertilizers can be added to benefit the soil quality. These beds do not exceed 3 feet, so whoever is working on them does not have to step into the bed. This will help avoid soil compaction. Benefits to these beds include, low cost, no imported materials or soil, easy to build, makes good use of resources that are already there. The cons to a ground bed are that you need to find a plot and it might be hard to keep out gophers and other small underground animals.     Raised Beds      Raised Beds often times sit on top of the soil and there surface is often 2 to 3 feet above the surface of the soil. These beds are typically made out of nontoxic materials such as rock, stone, cider, blocks, bricks, untreated wood and fiber glass. These beds are optimal because you can plant earlier, due to the fact they retain heat much quicker then ground soil and you can grow longer. These beds are beneficial in places with poor soil; the edges can be used as a seating area. They can also be a good place to grow invasive species such as horseradish and mint.     Containers      Containers can be used indoors or outdoors and come in a variety of different sizes. Containers should be build out of breathable materials and have proper drainage. Containers use a special mixture, instead of just regular soil. There are numerous ways to obtain the proper soil for containers or you can make your own out of 1/3 compost, 1/3 coco pith, 1/3 horticulture sand. The pros to having containers are can be used on top of asphalt or where there is no soil, can be placed pretty much anywhere, and in on wheels can be moved from outdoors to indoors for convince, can be wheelchair accessible and are good for areas with small space. The cons to containers are they can be costly, require special soil and containers need to be water and fertilized more often than ingrown bed and raised beds.    [ edit ]   Size of Garden Beds   When building a garden bed, one of the most important things to take in to consideration is the size and dimension of the garden bed.  Beds should be no wider than 4 ft.  This is so the gardener can have easy accessibility to both sides of the bed when gardening.  The beds should be no higher than 3 feet, so they are easy to garden in.     [ edit ]   Constructing Raised Garden Bed    Lay out the Perimeter of your garden bed, so that you can determine the appropriate dimensions of each bed and how they will fit within the landscape you wish to place them in.    Remove existing vegetation, this can be done by putting a clear sheet of plastic over the plot in which you desire to plant.  This can also be done by excessive tilling, although clear plastic works much better at killing unwanted weeds and pest.     Level the land in which you plan to build the bed on so when build your beds, they are built on a flat surface or at a desired sloped, depending on the surface in which you intend to build. Level each piece of timber as it is put in place.   If the structure is perminent, secure the first few pieces of lumber you put down but driving a piece of rebar into pre-drilled holes and into the ground at a 20 degree angle. Continuously do this for the rest of the timber put in place to make sure the structure is sound.     Install an irrigation system to ensure proper drainage.  This should be done before soil is added to beds.   Before adding soil, make sure to install a weed barrier, to keep out unwanted weeds such as burdmudagrass.  This should be placed between the edging and the soil.     Add Soil.  Soil should not be too sandy as it will not hold water well.  An optimum mixture of soil includes sandy clay loom soil mixed with peat moss, composted manure and saw dusk or ground bark.    [4]     [ edit ]    Materials     2 lbs. Nails   2 lbs.

Once the bed's frame was built 1""x8"" was used to side the frame.      [ edit ]    Construction                       Fig. 0:The site before we started construction on it.  Kind of boring eh?                           Fig. 1: This is the beginning of building the base for our frame.                           Fig. 2: This is after we added re-enforcements to out frame to ensure it could with sand being moved if need be.                           Fig. 3 This is a picture of the land we built the beds on.  We laid down cardboard to serve as a barrier between the soil in the beds and the ground soil.  This will help prevent weeds from growing up into the beds.                    1.  The first thing we did was locate a spot in which would be appropriate to place the Garden Beds.  CCAT had an idea of where they wanted them, so they flagged off 2 4x8 ft. plots for us to start construction.   2.  We then used a garden hoe, to excavate the land and made it flat, so we could begin construction.    3.  We laid down a layer of cardboard (which will desolve in the soil) to serve as a barrier between the soil in the beds and the ground soil.  This will help prevent any weed seeds that were in the the ground soil from growing up into the soil we place in the beds.    4.  We then began construction!!!!                        Fig. 4: Here is what the frames look like while being assembled.                           Fig. 5: This is what the frame of the Garden Beds looked like before we put on the siding.                           Fig. 6: This is us pre-drilling holes into the wood that was used for the frame.                           Fig. 7 : Before we pre-drilled we measured all the aliments.                  5.  After we assembled the frame, we began to side the exterior of the bed.  This was done with garden grade redwood.  We used screws to hold the pieces of redwood in place, this is so that if CCAT ever has to take apart the beds they can do so without destroying the wood.    6.  The next step was placing a top on the beds.  Since the garden grade redwood was really rough and CCAT wanted people to be able to use the beds as a place to sit, We purchased some nicer grade redwood for the top of the bed.                         Fig. 8: : Here is what the frames look like while being assembled.                           Fig. 9: This is another image of us putting the siding on the beds using a drill.                  7.  We then sanded down the edges, as a safety pre-caution.      8.  Gravel was added to serve a drainage barrier between the soil in the beds and the top soil on the ground.  This will help the beds drain quicker and hopefully prevent puddling from happening around the beds.   9.  We then varnished the beds with a coat of Linseed oil, to prevent the wood from decaying.  This protective layer will help prevent damage from the rain.     10.  Potting Soil, that was donated from a friend were then added to the beds.    10. It's time to Plant!!!    [ edit ]    How ""Appropriate"" was this ENGR305 project    [ edit ]   Cost   Originally we estimated the cost of the project to be over $1000.00, but because we shop around to local stores we were able the make a deal with Almquist Lumber in Arcata, who were very generous in donating free milling of Arcata Community Forest Redwood.      [ edit ]   Local   All the materials used were purchased locally. Local products were chosen whenever they were a viable option. The redwood used for the siding of the beds was redwood that was sustainable farmed out of the Arcata Community Forest after a huge storm that happened during December 2006.      [ edit ]   Use of Recycled Materials   The soil that was placed inside the beds was reused from someones previous garden.  We also salvaged a whole bunch of screws out of the yurt at CCAT.  The cardboard used was salvaged.    [ edit ]    Trouble!!!    Unfortunately time was not on our side in building these garden beds.  Appropriate Materials proved hard to find and sometimes way beyond our price range.  Also, building the beds took longer then we thought.  Coordinating schedules was often times chaotic.  Unfortunately we were not finished on time, but the project was still a success. Most of the criteria set for the project was met with the exception of time management.    A week before the creation of this appropedia page, the camera used to take the final pictures of the project was stolen and with it so were the pictures.

clueweb09-en0005-78-34061	"                 Fig, Common   (Ficus Carica  LINN.)   Click on graphic for larger image        Fig, Common   Botanical: Ficus Carica (LINN.)  Family: N.O. Urticaceae     Description   Cultivation   Constituents   Uses   Medicinal Action and Uses                 ---Part Used--- Fruit.        ---Habitat--- The  Common Fig-tree  provides the succulent fruit that in its fresh and dried state has been valued from the earliest days. It is indigenous to Persia, Asia Minor and Syria, but now is wild in most of the Mediterranean countries. It is cultivated in most warm and temperate climates and has been celebrated from the earliest times for the beauty of its foliage and for its 'sweetness and good fruit' (Judges ix. 2), there being frequent allusions to it in the Scriptures. The Greeks are said to have received it from Caria in Asia Minor - hence the specific name. Under Hellenic culture it was improved and Attic figs became celebrated in the East. It was one of the principal articles of sustenance among the Greeks, being largely used by the Spartans at their public table; and athletes fed almost entirely on figs, considering that they increased their strength and swiftness. To such an extent, indeed, were figs a part of the staple food of the people in ancient Greece that there was a law forbidding the exportation of the best fruit from their trees.       Figs were early introduced into Italy. Pliny gives details of no less than twentynine kinds known in his day, and specially praises those of Tarant and Caria and also those of Herculaneum. Dried Figs have been found in Pompeii in our days and in the wall-paintings of the buried city Figs are represented together with other fruits. Pliny states that homegrown Figs formed a large portion of the food of slaves, especially in the fresh state for agricultural workers.       The Fig plays an important part in Latin mythology. It was dedicated to Bacchus and employed in religious ceremonies. The wolf that suckled Romulus and Remus rested under a Fig tree, which was therefore held sacred by the Romans, and Ovid states that among the celebrations of the first day of the year by Romans, Figs were offered as presents. The inhabitants of Cyrene crowned themselves with wreaths of Figs when sacrificing to Saturn, holding him to be the discoverer of the fruit. Pliny speaks also of the Wild Fig, which is mentioned also in Homer, and further classical references to the Fig are to be found in Theophrastus, Dioscorides, Varro and Columella.        [ Top ]                  ---Description--- Ficus Carica  is a bush or small tree, rarely more than 18 to 20 feet high, with broad, rough, deciduous, deeply-lobed leaves in the cultivated varieties, though in wild forms the leaves are often almost entire.       Considered botanically, the Fig, as we eat it, is a very remarkable form of fruit. It is actually neither fruit nor flower, though partaking of both, being really a hollow, fleshy receptacle, enclosing a multitude of flowers, which never see the light, yet come to full perfection and ripen their seeds - a contrary method from the strawberry, in which the minute pistils are scattered over the exterior of the enlarged succulent receptacle. In the Fig, the inflorescence, or position of the flowers is concealed within the body of the 'fruit.' The Fig stands alone in this peculiar arrangement of its flowers. The edge of the pear-shaped receptacle curves inwards, so as to form a nearlyclosed cavity, bearing the numerous fertile and sterile flowers mingled on its surface, the male flowers mostly in the upper part of the cavity and generally few in number. As it ripens, the receptacle enlarges greatly and the numerous one-seeded fruits become embedded in it. The fruit of the wild kind never attains the succulence of the cultivated kinds. The Figs are borne in the axils of the leaves, singly.        [ Top ]          ---Cultivation--- The Fig is grown for its fresh fruit in all the milder parts of Europe, being cultivated in the Mediterranean countries, and in the United States of America. With protection in winter, it succeeds as far north as Pennsylvania. (Prof. Nancy Traill, York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada points out..  ""In some parts of Pennsylvania, people bury the trees. In Philadelphia, a mulch is necessary, and the fig is a ""die-back"" shrub. Ficus carica varieties have been grown in Southern Ontario for many years. Though by no means very much north of Pennsylvania, it is still further north. The figs need mulching, as in Philadelphia, and are die-back shrubs but they do produce very sweet fruit. Some that I have seen will grow back to about 10 or more feet in height, others about 6 or 7 feet, in a season. Some years the crop is quite heavy. People who bury their trees, as some still do, or give them the shelter of a house wall and some insulation, often have small trees, and these bear quite heavily."" ) It is said to have been introduced into England by the Romans, but was probably introduced from Italy early in the sixteenth century, when the Fig tree still growing in Lambeth Palace garden is said to have been planted.       The trees live to a great age, and along the southern coast of England bear fruit abundantly as standard trees, though in Scotland and many parts of England a south wall is indispensable for their successful cultivation out of doors. Old quarries are good situations for them. The roots are free from stagnant water and they are sheltered from cold, while exposed to a hot sun, which ripens the fruit perfectly. The trees also succeed well planted in a paved court against a building with a south aspect.       The best soil for a Fig border is a friable loam, not too rich, but well-drained; a chalky subsoil is congenial to the tree. To correct the tendency to over-luxuriance of growth, the roots should be confined within spaces surrounded by a wall enclosing an area of about a square yard. Grown as a standard, the tree needs very little pruning. When against a wall, a single stem should be trained to a height of a foot and a shoot be trained to either side - one to the right and the other to the left.       The principal part needing protection in the winter is the main stem, which is more tender than the young wood.       Fig trees are  propagated  by cuttings, which should be put into pots and placed in a gentle hot-bed. They may be obtained more speedily from layers, and these when rooted will form plants ready to bear fruit the first or second year after planting.       There are numerous varieties of Fig in cultivation, bearing fruit of various colours, from deep purple to yellow or nearly white.       The Fig produces naturally two sets of shoots and two crops of fruit in the season. The first shoots generally show young Figs in July and August but those in England rarely ripen and should therefore be rubbed off. The late midsummer shoots also put forth fruit buds which, however, do not develop till the following spring, ripening in late September and October, and these form the only crop of Figs on which the English gardener can depend.       There is sometimes a failure in the Fig crop, many immature receptacles dropping off in consequence of the pistils of the florets not having been duly fertilized by the pollen of the stamens. It is supposed that fertilization is caused naturally by the entry of insects through the very small orifice which remains open in the flowering Fig. Fig growers therefore adopt an artificial means of ensuring fertilization: a small feather is inserted and turned round in the internal cavity, the pollen thus being brushed against the pistils. This process is called 'Caprification,' from the Latin  caprificus  (a wild Fig), as the same result was originally obtained in the countries where the Fig grows wild, by placing branches of the Wild Fig in flower over the cultivated bushes, so that the pollen might be shaken out over the orifices of their receptacles, thus ensuring the development of the young fruit.       Most of our supplies of dried Figs come from Asia Minor, Spain, Malta and the South of France. When the fruits are ripe, they are collected and dried in the sun. 'Natural' Figs are those which are packed loose and retain to some extent their original shape. 'Pulled' Figs have been kneaded and pulled to make them supple; they are usually packed for exportation in small square or circular boxes the latter being termed 'drums' - and are considered to be the best variety. A few bay leaves are put upon the top of each box, to keep the fruit from being injured by a gnat which feeds on it and is very destructive. 'Pressed' Figs have been closely packed into boxes so that they are compressed into discs. Maltese Figs are very good, but those from Smyrna, which are thin-skinned and soft (the best kind known as 'Elemi'), are most valued. Greek Figs are thicker skinned, tougher and have less pulp.          ---Constituents--- The chief constituent of Figs is dextrose, of which they contain about 50 per cent.        [ Top ]          ---Uses--- Figs have long been employed for their nutritive value and in both their fresh and dried state form a large part of the food of the natives of both Western Asia and Southern Europe.       A sort of cake made by mashing up inferior Figs serves in parts of the Greek Archipelago as a substitute for bread.       Alcohol is obtained from fermented Figs in some southern countries, and a kind of wine, still made from the ripe fruit, was known to the Ancients and is mentioned by Pliny under the name of Sycites.         ---Medicinal Action and Uses--- Figs are used for their mild, laxative action, and are employed in the preparation of laxative confections and syrups, usually with senna and carminatives. It is considered that the laxative property resides in the saccharine juice of the fresh fruit and in the dried fruit is probably due to the indigestible seeds and skin. The three preparations of Fig of the British Pharmacopoeia are  Syrup of Figs , a mild laxative, suitable for administration to children;  Aromatie Syrup of Figs, Elixir of Figs , or  Sweet Essence of Figs , an excellent laxative for children and delicate persons, is compounded of compound tincture of rhubarb, liquid extract of senna, compound spirit of orange, liquid extract of cascara and Syrup of Figs.  The Compound Syrup of Figs  is a stronger preparation, composed of liquid extract of senna, syrup of rhubarb and Syrup of Figs, and is more suitable for adults.       Figs are demulcent as well as nutritive. Demulcent decoctions are prepared from them and employed in the treatment of catarrhal affections of the nose and throat.       Roasted and split into two portions, the soft pulpy interior of Figs may be applied as emolient poultices to gumboils, dental abscesses and other circumscribed maturating tumours. They were used by Hezekiah as a remedy for boils 2,400 years ago (Isaiah xxxviii. 21).       The milky juice of the freshly-broken stalk of a Fig has been found to remove warts on the body. When applied, a slightly inflamed area appears round the wart, which then shrivels and falls off. The milky juice of the stems and leaves is very acrid and has been used in some countries for raising blisters.       The wood of the tree is porous and of little value, though a piece, saturated with oil and spread with emery, is in France a common substitute for a hone.        Green Fig Jam  is excellent. Choose very juicy Figs. Take off the stalks, but do not peel them. Make a syrup of 1/2 lb. of sugar and a glass of water (1/2 pint) for each pound of fruit. Put the Figs into it and cook them till the syrup pearls. Boil a stick of cinnamon with them and remove it before pouring the jam into pots.       The Sycamore Fig ( Ficus Sycamorus ) is a tree of large size, with heart-shaped, somewhat mulberry-like leaves. It is a favourite tree in Egypt and Syria, being often planted along roads, deep shade being cast by its spreading branches. It bears a sweet, edible fruit, somewhat like that of the Common Fig, but produced in racemes, on the older branches. The Ancients, after soaking it in water, preserved it like the Common Fig. The porous wood is only fit for fuel.       Our northern Sycamore tree is in no way related to this Sycamore Fig, but has wrongly acquired its name, Prior says, through a mistake of the botanist Ruellius, who transferred the Greek name,  Sycamoros , properly the name of the Wild Fig, to the great Maple.       'This mistake,' says Prior, 'arose perhaps from this tree, the great maple, being on account of the density of its foliage, used in the sacred dramas of the Middle Ages to represent the Fig tree into which Zaccheus climbed and that in which the Virgin Mary on her journey into Egypt had hidden herself and the infant Jesus to avoid the fury of Herod; a legend quoted by Stapel on Theophrastus and by Thevenot in his  Voyage de Levant : ""At Mathave is a large sycamore or Pharaoh's Fig, very old, but which bears fruit every year. They say that upon the Virgin passing that way with her son Jesus and being pursued by the people, this Fig tree opened to receive her and closed her in again, until the people had passed by and then opened again. The tree is still shown to travellers."" ' (See Cowper's  Apocryphal Gospels .)        See INDIARUBBER TREE.

Digging loosens the soil and keeps it higher than surrounding ground  if there is no foot or equipment traffic.      Raised-Bed Gardening    Christopher J. Starbuck  Department of Horticulture    Raised-bed gardening is a popular technique for growing plants in Missouri.  Beds are both useful and attractive in the landscape. Vegetables, fruits, flowers,  trees and shrubs may be grown in raised beds.   Advantages of raised-bed gardening     Better drainage    Growing plants in raised beds is a logical choice for gardeners with  heavy, poorly drained soils. Raised beds permit plant roots to develop in soil  held above water-logged or compacted zones. This provides a more optimum soil  environment for root growth. As beds are built up, compost or other forms of organic  matter may be incorporated, further improving soil structure, drainage and nutrient-holding  capacity.   Higher yields    Better root growth from improved soils leads to higher yields for food  crops and lusher growth of ornamental plantings. Also, intensive planting in raised  beds means more plants can be grown in a smaller area than with conventional row-cropping  techniques. No space is wasted between rows.    Expanded growing season  Better drainage speeds soil warming and allows earlier spring planting.  In wet seasons, soil dries out faster, permitting planting to proceed between  rains.    Maintenance    Because plants are growing above the level of walkways, less stooping  is required for weeding, watering and other chores. Intensively planted raised  beds provide dense foliage cover, shading out much weed growth.   Using difficult sites    Raised beds make gardening possible on sites where growing plants would  otherwise be impossible. Rooftop gardens and raised beds on top of solid rock  are examples. Terraced raised beds turn hillsides into productive growing areas  while reducing soil erosion potential.     Types of raised beds    Temporary raised beds work well for many backyard vegetable gardeners. As  the soil is tilled, it is loosened. If tillage equipment and foot traffic are  kept off tilled beds, the loosened soil remains slightly raised above surrounding  pathways. Adding compost or other organic matter to the bed raises it even farther  (Figure 1).    The main advantage of temporary raised beds is their simplicity. No expense  is involved in constructing framework to contain the soil. Temporary beds are  less labor intensive to make than permanent beds. However, temporary beds flatten  over the course of a growing season and require reconstruction the following year.  Because there is no wall to contain the soil, it may erode from the top of the  bed into walkways or down hillsides.    Permanent raised beds are more satisfactory for most situations. In the landscape,  planting berms may be constructed by hauling in topsoil to create noise and traffic  barriers as well as providing visual interest. When planted and mulched, berms  need no edging to keep the soil in place. Walled raised beds may be used in the  landscape or for vegetable gardens. Although there will be initial expense and  labor in constructing walls for raised beds, the finished product should last  for many years. Besides controlling erosion better than temporary beds, walled  beds permit deep soil amendment. You may choose the wall construction materials  to coordinate with other features in the landscape.      Figure 2  A grouping of barrels makes a convenient herb garden on the patio. Make certain  that drainage is provided.       Construction materials    The choice of framework to use for walls depends on the availability and expense  of the construction material, as well as the desired appearance of the final product  in the landscape. Treated landscape timbers and used railroad ties are popular  materials. Naturally rot-resistant lumber, such as redwood or cedar, may also  be used. Other possibilities include concrete blocks, bricks and stones, or synthetic  lumber made of recycled plastic. A group of half barrels can make a convenient  raised bed for use on a patio (Figure 2). For a consistent look, match materials  to those used elsewhere in the landscape.    Generally, wood-based products are less expensive than stone or masonry materials.  However, resourceful gardeners may be able to find used bricks, concrete blocks  or other materials at little or no cost.    Certain national gardening publications have raised concerns about the safety  of using treated lumber in food gardens. Pressure-treated lumber uses CCA (chromated  copper arsenate) or ACA (ammoniacal copper arsenate) as a preservative. However,  studies done by Texas A&M Agricultural Extension Service showed insignificant  movement of these compounds into surrounding soil. Pressure-treated lumber has  no proven effect on plant growth or food safety. However, on Feb.12, 2002, the  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a voluntary decision by the  lumber industry to move consumer use of treated lumber products away from a variety  of pressure-treated wood that contains arsenic by Dec. 31, 2003, in favor of new,  alternative wood preservatives. Alkaline cooper quaternary (ACQ) is a relatively  new wood treatment that is available in some areas of the country. This product  is higher in copper than CCA but is free of arsenic.    Creosote, which is used to treat railroad ties, may cause injury or death  to plants that come into direct contact with it. After a few years the effect  diminishes. Old, discarded ties do not injure plants (Figure 3). However, injury  may occur if ties are still oozing black, sticky creosote or smell intensely.  If you are uncertain about the safety of treated lumber, place a heavy plastic  liner between the treated lumber and soil used for growing plants to prevent direct  contact of plant roots with the treated lumber. Be careful not to tear the plastic  when tilling the bed.      Figure 3  Old railroad ties make a satisfactory raised bed if they are not oozing creosote, which could injure plants.     Raised-bed design    Raised beds take many forms, depending on the gardener's goals. Taming  a hillside with terraces may require different bed dimensions than those used  for flat-land vegetable gardens. On hillsides, follow the contour of the land  and adjust the depth of beds according to the slope of the hill.    Typically, raised beds are laid out in a rectangular pattern. Level the area  first to make a flat base for starting the building project.    A convenient width to use for beds is 4 feet. At this width, the center of  the bed is easily accessible from either side. Lumber for constructing beds is  readily available in 4-foot length multiples, minimizing the amount of sawing  necessary and the amount of waste produced in building the bed. If the bed is  accessible only from one side, limit the width to 3 feet. Most gardeners find  it uncomfortable to reach farther than 3 feet to tend the bed.    The length of a raised bed is not critical. It is only limited by the dimensions  of the yard. However, break up long distances into shorter beds. To prevent soil  compaction, foot traffic and garden equipment such as wheelbarrows should not  be permitted to go through the raised beds. For example, instead of building one  long bed, breaking a 50-foot length into two 24-foot long beds with a 2-foot walkway  between them will save gardeners many steps.    The depth of your raised beds is to a great extent up to your discretion.  Most plants need at least a 6- to 12-inch rooting zone, but deeper would be better.  With deep tillage, some of the rooting depth may come from soil at or below the  existing grade. Beds built higher than 18 to 24 inches require retaining walls  with foundations and supports, which are topics beyond the scope of this publication.    Stakes to hold raised-bed walls in place should be twice the height of the  raised bed. Bury half the stake in firm ground. Leave half of the stake projecting  above the ground as a support.      Figure 4  Landscape timbers make an attractive raised bed. Drill holes through the timbers  to drive re-bar into the ground as far as the bed extends above ground.Hold  landscape timbers and railroad ties in place with construction re-bar (Figure  4). Drill holes all the way through each layer every 4 feet, staying 6 to 8 inches  in from the ends of timbers. Drive a length of construction re-bar through the  holes and into the ground below. Tie individual layers together by driving spikes  from one layer into the next.      Use decay-resistant wooden stakes to hold dimensional lumber such as 2 x 8s  in place. If placed on the inside of the board, the stakes will not be visible  once the bed is filled with soil.    For a unique-looking raised bed, cut landscape timbers or posts to uniform  1- to 3-foot lengths. Set the posts vertically in the ground, half buried and  half above ground.    Figure 5  Stacked concrete blocks make a simple raised bed. For greater stability, offset  the layers of blocks.      For raised beds less than 2 feet tall, stones or cement blocks may be stacked  on top of one another without mortar or footings (Figure 5). Carefully place  irregularly shaped stones to enhance the stability of the wall. Offset seams and  gaps from one layer to the next to help tie the wall together. You may use mortar  for greater strength.    Make pathways between raised beds wide enough for easy access to beds. For  foot traffic only, 1-foot wide paths are adequate. However, keep in mind that  plants at the border of raised beds will hang over the edge, cutting into the  available walk space. To allow room for a wheelbarrow or garden cart, plan on  2- to 3-foot wide walkways. To conserve space, one option is to make most paths  narrow, occasionally adding a wider path for access with garden equipment.    Several additional design features increase the convenience of raised beds.  Seating can be made on the edges of wooden raised beds by capping the walls with  a 2 x 6 or 2 x 8 inch board. If you regularly use a roto-tiller for tilling the  beds, ramps into the raised beds save heavy lifting. Hollow pipes attached to  the inside wall and spaced regularly along raised beds double as support posts  for spring and fall season-extending cold frames or summer trellises for vine  crops.    To make a raised bed wheelchair accessible, construct walls about 2 feet high  and limit the width of the bed to about 3 feet (Figure 6).      Figure 6  Raised beds can be made wheelchair accessible by making the walls about 2 feet  tall and limiting the width of the bed to about 3 feet.   Soil mix    Good quality existing topsoil may be used in raised beds. However, add additional  organic matter to soils with a high clay or sand content. Peat moss, compost and  decomposed manures are good sources of organic matter.     To take full advantage of the deep rooting potential with raised beds, the  base soil should be worked up by roto-tilling or hand digging before bringing  in additional soil. Many gardeners double dig beds.      Figure 7  To double dig prior to establishing a raised bed, remove all the soil from the bed one spade's depth. Dig the next layer down, leaving the soil in place. Return  the topsoil to the bed and thoroughly mix the layers. Double digging permits deeper  rooting by plants growing in the bed.      Double digging involves removing the topsoil the depth of a spade, setting  the soil aside and then loosening the subsoil another spade's depth (Figure 7). Finally, the topsoil is returned with added amendments, such as compost,  manure or fertilizers. This labor-intensive soil preparation method provides an  excellent rooting zone for plants. However, less-intensive methods also permit  satisfactory plant growth.    Avoid hauling in new layers of soil without mixing them into existing soil.  Distinct layers of soil create barriers through which water will not readily penetrate  and roots will not easily grow.   Maintenance of raised beds    Soil in raised beds warms faster and dries out more quickly than soil at ground  level. In spring and fall, these traits are desirable. But through the heat of  summer, soil temperatures are higher and drying in raised beds is faster than  in surrounding soil.    Use of organic mulches, such as straw or hay, in vegetable gardens or wood  chips placed on landscape fabric weed barriers around ornamental plantings helps  combat both problems. Soil temperatures are lower under organic mulches, less  water is lost through evaporation, and weed growth is suppressed. Use irrigation  to supplement natural rainfall during dry periods. Soaker hoses or drip irrigation  may be placed directly on the bed. Overhead sprinklers can also be used, but because  they wet foliage they are more likely to spread diseases.    For vegetable gardens at the end of the growing season plant residue can be  tilled into the soil, adding organic matter. Additional compost may be added before  successive plantings. Over time, the soil may become improved enough so little  additional tillage will be necessary.    Fertilization of plants grown in raised beds is similar to that of plants  grown conventionally. For most crops, a complete fertilizer such as 10-10-10 applied  at the rate of 1 to 2 pounds per 100 square feet is satisfactory. Organic fertilizers  and manures may also be used. For more specific fertilizer suggestions, rely on  recommendations based on soil tests.    This guide was developed by Denny Schrock, former extension associate, Department  of Horticulture.

The basic idea of a raised bed is that instead of battling against poor soil conditions, you build above ground, where you have absolute control over the soil texture and ingredients.   What is a Raised Bed Garden?    A raised bed garden is a garden built on top of your native soil, sometimes incorporating native soil, sometimes not. Raised bed gardens can be contained, such as when you build a wood or stone structure to keep the bed intact, or they can be more free form, with soil and amendments merely piled several inches high. You can plant anything from herbs and vegetables to perennials and shrubs in a raised bed.   Advantages of a Raised Bed Garden    Aside from avoiding the issue of gardening in poor soil, raised bed gardens offer several advantages:    Raised beds warm more quickly in spring, allowing you to work the soil and plant earlier.   Raised beds drain better.   The soil in raised beds doesn't get compacted, because they are constructed with accessibility in mind.   It's easy to tailor the soil for your raised bed to the plants you plan to grow there.   After the initial construction process, raised beds require less maintenance than conventional garden beds.      How to Make a Raised Bed Garden    Contained raised beds are the most popular type of raised beds, and they're great for vegetable and herb gardens, as well as flower gardens. Fruits, such as strawberries, grapes, blueberries, and raspberries, also do very well in a contained raised bed.   You can choose from a variety of materials to construct your raised bed. Wood is a very popular choice, because it is easy to work with and it is inexpensive. Concrete blocks, natural stone, or brick are also nice options, but there is definitely an added expense and labor to consider in using them. Some gardeners go the ultra-simple route, and simply place bales of hay or straw in whatever configuration they desire, then fill it with good soil and compost and plant it up. This solution will only give you a year of use, because the straw will decompose, but it's worth trying if you don't mind replacing the bales yearly, or if you're still developing a more permanent solution.   Since most contained raised beds are constructed from wood, here are instructions for building your own wood raised bed garden.   Step One: Select your site.  If you know that you'll be growing vegetables or herbs, or sun-loving flowers in your new garden, select a site that gets at least eight hours of sun per day. A flat, level area is important, and you should also make sure that the area has easy access to water sources as well as room for you to work.    Step Two: Determine the size and shape of your garden.  Make sure that you can access all parts of the garden without stepping into the bed. One of the main advantages of a raised bed is that the soil doesn't get compacted the way it might in a conventional bed because they are planned for accessibility. It is a good idea to keep the garden to around four feet wide, because this way you can access the middle of the bed from either side. If you're placing your bed against a wall or fence, it should be no more than three feet wide. Any length you like will work, as long as you keep the width in control.     Step Three: Prep Your Site.  Once you know the size and shape of your bed, you can get to work prepping the site. How much prep you will have tot do is determined by the depth of the bed you're planning, as well as the plants you're planning to grow there. If you are planning a vegetable or herb garden, a six-inch deep bed is perfect. To save yourself some labor, you can use newspaper, landscape fabric, or cardboard to cover and smother it, then put your soil and amendments right on top. However, to ensure that your plant's roots have plenty of room to grow, it is a good idea to dig out the existing sod and loosen the soil with a shovel or garden fork to a depth of eight to twelve inches.     Step Four: Construct the Bed.  Using rot-resistant lumber such as cedar or one of the newer composite lumbers, construct your bed. Two by six lumber is perfect, as it is easy tot work with and will give you six inches of depth. Cut your pieces to the desired size, then attach them together to make a simple frame. You can attach them in a variety of ways. You can make a simple butt joint at each corner, pre-drilling and then screwing the corners together with galvanized screws. You can use a small piece of wood in the corner,and attach each side tot it. Another easy way is to use galvanized ""L” brackets and attach the sides that way. Any of these methods will work perfectly, it's just a matter of whatever is easier for you to do. Once they're constructed, put your frames in place.    Step Five: Level Your Frames.  Using a level, make sure your frame is level in all directions. This is a necessary step because if your bed is not level, you will have a situation where water runs off of one part of the garden and sits in another. If part of your frame is high, just remove some of the soil beneath it until you have a level frame.    Step Six: Fill Your Garden.  The whole point of a raised bed garden is that it gives you the opportunity to garden in perfect soil. Take this opportunity to fill your bed with a good mixture of quality topsoil, compost, and rotted manure. Once they're filled and raked level, you're ready to plant or sow seeds.    Maintaining a Raised Bed Garden    Happily, raised bed gardens require very little maintenance. Each spring or fall, it's a good idea to top dress with fresh compost and manure, or, if your bed only holds plants for part of the year, go ahead and dig the compost or manure into the top several inches of soil. As with any garden, mulching the top of the soil will help retain moisture and keep weeds down. Moisture retention is important, because raised beds tend to drain faster than conventional beds.    Gardening in a raised bed is a real joy. The work you do up front pays off year after year, when you enjoy the bounty that grows in your raised beds, without any of the hassle and annoyance that comes from fighting the battle against poor soil. Your plants, and your back, will appreciate it.

Most species of moth are only active at night. They can be told apart from butterflies in several ways. Moth antenna look like little feathers, and their wings are held flat on their backs when they are not flying.

Caterpillars eat the plants that farmers grow and sometimes kill them. The caterpillar of the gypsy moth ( Lymantria dispar ) causes great harm to  forests  in the northeast  United States . In warm climates, the diamondback moth ( Plutella xylostella ) is perhaps the most serious pest of  cabbage  crops.   Several different kinds of moths are commonly regarded as pests because their  larvae  eat  fabric  such as clothes and blankets made from natural fibers such as  wool  or  silk . They are less likely to eat fabric containing artificial fibers. There are some reports that they can be repelled by the scent of wood from  juniper  and  cedar  trees, by  lavender , or by other natural oils. However, many consider this unlikely to prevent moths from living somewhere. Chemicals are the most effective way to keep moths away, however, there are concerns about the chemicals being dangerous to people. Moth larvae are not killed by freezing the items they live in.   Moths are difficult to kill and usually not killed by poisons that work on  mosquitoes  and  flies .   Some moths are farmed. The most important of these is the  silkworm . It is farmed for the  silk  with which it builds its  cocoon . The silk industry produces over 130 million  kilograms  of raw silk, worth about 250 million U.S. dollars, each year.     [ change ]   Attraction to light   Moths will fly around bright objects, and appear to be attracted to light. Most  scientists  think that this is because moths use the light of the  moon  to help them fly in a straight line. The light from lamps confuses the moths.   Night-blooming flowers usually depend on moths (or bats) to  pollinate  them, and artificial lighting can draw moths away from the flowers, hurting the plant's ability to reproduce.

Vegetables are healthy and should be eaten regularly. It is nice to grow vegetables by yourself and eat them. But the question arises as to how to grow vegetables. We shall further see some tips and hints on how to grow vegetables.   If you are thinking on how to grow vegetables in the house then it is not very difficult. Growing vegetables requires a lot of sunlight. So it is necessary to see that your garden does get sufficient sunlight. Start from the spring season. It is always better to have a vegetable garden close to the kitchen. This way you have easy access into the garden that would provide faster cooking. The seeds need to be soaked and require moisture. Once they are a little plump they are ready to be grown. Some vegetables like cabbage and broccoli do not require you to soak their seeds. Over doing the soaking the process could cause harm to the seeds. Do not leave them overnight.   Thinking of how to grow vegetables in the cold then you will have to utilize tepees that are filled with water around the vegetables that are gentle. There are certain plastic sheets that are available in the market which acts as a barrier to the plant once water is filled. Sun can also easily pass through this sheet so that the plants stay warm later.   Wondering how to grow vegetables that are leggy then, you should be planting them deep inside. If you have planted them inside the house then they may grow a little awkward and tumble in the garden. So if it is more deeply sown then they get more support. Tomatoes require to be planted horizontally in the trench. This is not necessary to be sown deep in the soil. It would grow well without it itself.   Try to avoid cutworms that spoil gentle and tender plants. When planting vegetable plants always try to put them vertically, this would save some place. Vegetables like cucumber, beans, melons etc. can be left to go on trees or pillars rather than spreading them across. All the vegetables require fertilizers timely. So do take care that you take good care of them. This would ensure that they keep giving vegetables at regular intervals.   Cucumbers and melons can easily grow in compost. Any kind of remaining food and fruits can be thrown into them. They would act as manure and see that the vegetable grows well. This is the best way to grow such vegetables.

So, you have decided to grow a garden. Congratulations! A garden, whether it is a flower garden or a vegetable garden, has many benefits – and it is so easy to do!   If you have decided to grow fruits or vegetables with your garden, you will be pleasantly surprised by how much better the food tastes when you grow it yourself. Not only can you enjoy vine-ripened   goodies that have the added flavor only nature can provide, you will also have the satisfaction of knowing that you grew your fruit and veggies on your own. And, don’t forget, it is convenient and   pleasurable to have a variety of tasty treats growing in your own backyard.   A flower garden provides you with a magnificent retreat where you can relax after a stressful day. Similarly, it adds beauty and value to your home when done right. Not only that, you can actually take   care of problematic areas in your yard with a little creativity and a few flowers, shrubs, and trees.   Whether you are planting a flower garden or a vegetable garden, you will discover that one of the great satisfactions of gardening is just getting out there and getting your hands dirty. Gardening is a great activity for reducing anxiety and reducing stress as you feel yourself getting closer to nature.   Yet, you might be asking yourself: How do I start a garden? What do I need to have in order to grow a garden? Are there any tricks of the trade I should know? Is it costly? How do I maintain my garden   once I get it started? Will it take all of my time?   The first thing you will need to consider when planning a garden is the location. If you will be planting a vegetable garden, you will likely need to choose a location that receives a great deal of sunlight. This   is because most vegetables require eight hours or more of sunlight in order to grow properly and to form strong roots and stems.   Since you will need a great deal of sunlight for your vegetable garden, you should never plant it next to large trees that will cast shadows throughout the day. Similarly, it is generally best to avoid planting a vegetable garden right next to a building or a home. The shadow cast by the home can prevent adequate sunlight from reaching your garden. If you aren’t sure about a specific area, take a day to monitor the position of the sun and the shade it produces in the area you are considering for your garden. You don’t need to stand out there all day! Rather, check on the area once per hour in order to get an idea of how much sunlight the area receives.   With a few more facts and tricks, you can have your own  beautiful flower or vegetable garden.  It’s easier than you might think!   Pete Cullen runs  http://Great-Web-Resources.com .

One reason is that there are Old World strains that just ‘have that certain taste’ that comes with a specific variety not offered from U.S. growers. You can be assured that some of these Italian vegetable seeds will do very well here. At www.growitalian.com, they maintain that Italy has much the same climate in the south as southern California and their northern growing temperatures match that of some of our own northern states. They do suggest that a head start may be necessary because Italy has a longer growing season.   Of course, we would be remiss if we didn’t mention that an area’s soils contribute differences to each vegetable’s taste. Different soils can alter flower colors from the same batch of seeds. Wine made from identical grapes grown in different soils taste different. So it just stands to reason that Italian vegetable seeds don’t necessarily make veggies that taste ‘like the Old Country’!   But you’re welcomed to try! The types of Italian vegetable seeds offered include basil and fennel. Can you imagine what a really good Italian dish would be if you got the ‘original’ fresh spices instead of the dried American counterparts? You might not even like the result it might be so different, but wouldn’t it be a hoot to try?   Other Italian vegetable seeds available include the entire gamut of the vegetable line. At www.italianseedandtool.com, they even have an end of season special, where you can order bulk seed packets at a discount! Again, don’t forget about eBay, which is a buyer’s dream, international and otherwise. Cucuzzi Seeds hosts a vegetable seed auction. You just might nab a bargain.   Whether you are a connoisseur or an eclectic gardener, you might enjoy trying some of these special order Italian vegetable seeds as a way to spice up your gardening for 2005. If you do, let us know how they grow, and more importantly, how they differ in taste from the your local store-bought veggies!   Vegetarian Fun: For vegetables and fruits lovers!

In some places these gardens feed the family throughout the year, but in other places they are grown more for pleasure than for food. Sure, the people that grow in these areas will enjoy the produce as well, but for the most part it is something that is done for pleasure. One thing that all people with vegetable gardens are interested in, however, is growing great vegetables.   If you want to grow some of the best vegetable plants that you can grow you are going to need to plan carefully and give them plenty of care throughout the growing season. Some of the most typical variety of garden vegetables will have various results, simply according to the amount of time that is spent on them throughout the year. For example, most people with vegetable gardens grow tomatoes. They are a hardy plant that will grow without much attention from the gardener. In fact, most people simply grow them in a cage and pick their fruit when they become ripe. You could do the same thing, but why not grow a better tomato plant?   Tomato plants will put off shoots that come up in between the stalk and branches. They are typically called suckers because they do not give your tomato plant anything, they simply take away from it’s strength. If you pinch these suckers off when they first appear you will give your tomato plants a chance to grow strong and produce well throughout the season. If you are consistent with this process you can expect to have some strong plants that produce extra large fruit and most people love having large tomatoes.   You will also need to keep your tomato plants upright. Some people use cages to keep their plants off of the ground but if you have been pulling your suckers like we discussed earlier then you will need something more. I always use tall wooden stakes to keep my tomatoes upright. These stakes are sometimes 6 feet in length and get driven into the ground a couple of feet. I put one by each plant and then keep the tomato tied to it by use of old nylons.   The first year that I used this method I ended up having to get taller stakes, simply because they were growing so tall. They also produced some of the largest, best tasting tomatoes that I ever grew. So if you want to grow great tomatoes, try giving them the care they deserve. If you take care of them, believe me, they will take care of you.   New to gardening?

Planting your very own vegetable garden allows you to control whether harmful chemicals are used on the foods you eat, allows you to have fresh vegetables for cooking or eating raw during harvesting season, and saves you money both in the summer and winter, because you can freeze or can the vegetables you grow and use them throughout the year.   Planting a vegetable garden is not difficult either, but there are a few steps involved. First you have to plan the location of your vegetable garden, then you need to prepare the soil for your vegetable garden, then you will plant your seeds or starter plants. From then on, it’s just a matter of caring for your vegetable plants and keeping the weeds away. And before very long you will find yourself outside picking fresh vegetables right off the vine.   Planning your Vegetable Garden   The first thing you’ll need to learn about how to plant a vegetable garden, is that location is very important. Vegetables need five to six hours a day of full sunlight, so where you place your vegetable garden plays an important role in how successful that garden will be.   You will also need to plan your space wisely. Depending upon how many vegetables you want to plant, and how much of each vegetable you’d like to be able to harvest, you might find you need quite a bit of room for your vegetable garden. A family of four for instance, generally needs rows of vegetables approximately ten feet long to provide enough harvest for the entire family. So if you want to plant twenty different vegetables, you will need a lot of space.   Vegetable gardens can be planted in containers however, so this might be an alternative option for you to consider. Many vegetables can grow in one container too. Your best bet for the first time planting a vegetable garden is to start small. Choose maybe five vegetables to plant for instance, or try planting smaller amounts of many different vegetables.   Preparing your Soil   The next step you will need to learn about how to plant a vegetable garden, is that soil preparation is very important. There’s a lot to learn in this area, so we won’t cover it in detail here. But the basic steps involved with preparing your vegetable garden soil involve turning the soil, and enriching it with compost or other organic matter.   Vegetables need a lot of nutrition to grow well, so the better you prepare the soil before planting, the better chances you have of producing a bountiful crop.   Planting Your Vegetables   The third step in learning how to plant a vegetable garden is the fun part. You will plant your vegetable garden seeds or starter plants in the newly prepared garden soil.   Now, if you’re planting your vegetables in traditional rows, you’ll simply sprinkle seeds along the top of a row, then cover then lightly with a thin layer of soil. If you’re using starter seedling plants for your vegetable garden, you will make a slight hole in the top of the row, put your starter plant down in the hole, then pack the mounded soil around it lightly.   Planting vegetables into raised garden beds is done the same way when you’re using rows. If you decide you’d like to plant your vegetables in square blocks however, that’s easily done in the same ways too. Alternatively, you can randomly place your vegetable plants and seeds, and you will get a more natural growth look from your vegetable garden when the sprouts begin to create leaves and produce.

Consider growing your garden in raised garden boxes. Elevated raised gardens require less bending for planting, weeding, watering, and harvesting. A raised vegetable garden is also an excellent alternative for growing vegetables in difficult sites, such as hillsides. In these areas, depths can be adjusted easily to fit the slope of the hill. Depending on your individual needs, raised beds can take many forms, making them quite practical as well as beautiful.   How to make a home made raised garden   Nearly anything that holds soil and maintains shape is the best way to build a raised garden bed. Wood, concrete, bricks, stones, or containers that are situated in tiers can all be implemented for use in a raised bed. Normally, wood is the most commonly used; you should try to stay away from using any lumber which has been pressure treated, however, since the chemicals that are used to treat the wood can get into the soil and harm plants.   Typically, raised garden boxes are laid out in a rectangular pattern approximately 3 feet in width. This layout allows all areas of the bed, including the center, to be easily accessible.The length of a raised vegetable garden mainly depends on your particular landscape needs. The depth of raised garden boxes generally require at least 6-12 inches for the proper root development of plants.   Creating paths between the beds makes the maintenance easier and looks attractive, too. You can create this effect by adding a layer of plastic or other gardening fabric between each bed and covering it with a suitable mulching material, such as gravels or pebbles. The pathways should be wide enough for easy accessibility to the beds with additional room for a wheelbarrow. Generally, a width of approximately 2 to 3 feet is sufficient.   Raised garden beds - preparation of location   One of the most important aspects of a raised vegetable bed is proper location. Choose a site that provides sufficient sunlight and water. When it comes to the best way to build a raised garden bed, areas that get at least 5 to 8 hours of full sun is recommended. Try to place the beds facing north to south to take full advantage of the sun. The soil in a raised bed warms faster and dries out more quickly than soil at ground level; therefore, you will need to water your raised vegetable garden often, especially during hot, dry weather.   When considering how to make a home made raised garden, it is just as important for the plants to be in an area that is accessible to rainwater as well. When applying water to elevated raised gardens, it is often better to use soaker hoses which can be placed directly on the bed; the use of sprinklers can also be used but are more likely to spread diseases if the foliage stays excessively wet. The use of  organic  mulches, such as straw or hay, can also be used to help retain moisture within these vegetable gardens.   Soil for raised vegetable garden     Raised garden boxes have looser soil, which is ideal for root crops, providing a more optimum soil environment for root growth. When you are ready for raised garden beds preparation of soil in your beds, fill them with commercial soil or mix the existing soil with  compost  or manure. As beds are built up, keep adding compost to further improve its soil structure and drainage. When you begin planting crops into the beds, the taller varieties should be placed nearer the north to prevent shading of the smaller crops.   Enjoy your raised garden boxes     Elevated raised gardens are easier for you to maintain since it is accessible on all sides. Since plants are growing above the level of walkways, there is less need for bending or stooping as you care for your crops. Raised beds offer other benefits as well. They save on space and allow crops to grow closer together, resulting in more moisture for the crops and less weed growth. With raised beds, you also have the option of creating the bed as small as you like and then adding onto it as time, experience, and your individual needs permit.

But, best of all, they produce more and healthier flowers, vegetables      and herbs. Raised bed gardeners know this fact, and are more successful growers.                    Whether you call them Raised Garden Beds, or Raised Bed Gardens, the results      are the same..... Great looking flowers, a bountiful vegetable harvest.                    A raised bed kit consists of landscape timber and corner brackets. Plastic      landscape timber is by far the most common material. It lasts for a long,      long time. Wood boards or wood landscape timbers are also used. They have      a limited life, and lose their neat and tidy appearance fairly quickly as      they age. Please note: Avoid using pressure treated lumber or landscape timber.      While pressure treated wood lasts longer, they can contain harmful chemicals      that can leach into your soil.                            Why are raised gardens so much more successful in helping you to produce      a spectacular crop?                       The elevated surface allows for good drainage, especially during wet spring   weather, and summer downpours.                The soil in your raised bed frame warms up earlier in the season. This promotes   earlier seed germination, and healthier early season plants.                Ease of use - Senior citizens and people with handicaps love the elevated   gardens.                It's easier on the back and knees.                People who have a raised bed garden, are more avid gardeners who take pride   in their gardens.                           Guarden raised bed garden frames are the most popular units on the market.      They don't skimp on material,which affects the strength of the plastic timber.      Unlike other models, the 4' X 8' Guarden raised bed frames are so strong,      they do not need a center support that gets in the way of you and your plants.                     Creative Uses of the Guarden Raised Bed Frames:                         Senior citizen facilities place a sheet of plywood atop sawhorses. The frame   is placed on the plywood, and filled with soil.                Use smaller sizes on balconies, decks, patios and high rise rooftops. Just   place a piece of plastic sheeting under the frame. Fill the frame with soil,   and you are ready to garden almost anywhere.                           Raised bed frames come in a variety of sizes. They can be single deep (5      1/4"" high), or extra deep(10 1/2"" high), using one or two plastic timbers.      Extra deep models, are by far the most popular. The extra height makes it      easier to work and harvest your plants.             Popular sizes are:                       2' X 4'                3' X 6'                4' X 4'                4' X 8'                     Buy or browse now                                      Hobby Greenhouses                            Add a cover system to your raised garden, and you have....  A hobby      greenhouse!

Moths         Emperor Gum Moth,  Opodiphthera eucalypti         Scientific classification             Kingdom:   Animalia       Phylum:   Arthropoda       Class:   Insecta       Order:   Lepidoptera             A  moth  is an  insect  closely related to the  butterfly , both being of the  order   Lepidoptera . The  differences between butterflies and moths  are more than just  taxonomy . [ citation needed ]  Sometimes the names "" Rhopalocera "" (butterflies) and "" Heterocera "" (moths) are used to formalize the popular distinction. Many attempts have been made to subdivide the Lepidoptera into groups such as the Microlepidoptera and Macrolepidoptera, Frenatae and Jugatae, or Monotrysia and Ditrysia. Failure of these names to persist in modern classifications is due to the fact none of them represents a pair of "" monophyletic groups "". The reality is that butterflies are a small group that arose from within the ""moths"" [ citation needed ]  and there is thus no way to group all of the remaining taxa in a monophyletic group, as it will always exclude that one descendant lineage.   Most species of moth are  nocturnal , but there are  crepuscular  and  diurnal  species. They can be distinguished from butterflies in several ways.

Northumbrian "" mohe "") from Common Germanic (compare  Old Norse  "" motti "",  Dutch  "" Mot "" and  German  "" Motte "" all meaning "" moth ""). Perhaps its origins are related to Old English "" maa "" meaning "" maggot "" or from the root of "" midge "" which until the 16th century was used mostly to indicate the larva, usually in reference to devouring clothes.   The study of butterflies and moths is known as  lepidoptery , and  biologists  that specialize in either are called lepidopterists. As a pastime, watching butterflies and moths is known as  butterflying  and  mothing . The latter has given rise to the term ""mother"" for someone who engages in this activitysometimes written with a hyphen (moth-er) to distinguish it from its  usual meaning . This confusion does not arise in speech as it is pronounced differently ( IPA :  /m/ , not  /m/ ).     [ edit ]   Economic significance of moths          An adult male Pine Processionary Moth ( Thaumetopoea pityocampa ). This species is a serious forest pest when in larvar state. Notice the bristle springing from the underside of the hindwing (frenulum) and running forward to be held in a small catch of the forewing, whose function is to link the wings together.               Poplar hawk-moth caterpillar   Laothoe populi       Moths, and particularly their  caterpillars , are a major  agricultural  pest in many parts of the world. The caterpillar of the  gypsy moth  ( Lymantria dispar ) causes severe damage to forests in the northeast United States, where it is an  invasive species . In temperate climates, the  codling moth  causes extensive damage, especially to fruit farms. In tropical and subtropical climates, the  diamondback moth  ( Plutella xylostella ) is perhaps the most serious pest of  brassicaceous  crops.   Several moths in the family  Tineidae  are commonly regarded as pests because their larvae eat  fabric  such as  clothes  and  blankets  made from natural  proteinaceous  fibers such as  wool  or  silk . [ 1 ]  They are less likely to eat mixed materials containing artificial fibers. There are some reports that they can be repelled by the scent of wood from  juniper  and  cedar , by lavender, or by other natural oils. However, many consider this unlikely to prevent infestation.  Naphthalene  (the chemical used in  mothballs ) is considered more effective, but there are concerns over its effects on human health. Moth larvae may be killed by freezing the items which they infest for several days at a temperature below 8 C (17.6 F). [ 2 ]   Moths are sturdy and usually are more resistant to pesticides than are mosquitoes and flies. [ citation needed ]   Some moths are  farmed . The most notable of these is the  silkworm , the larva of the domesticated moth  Bombyx mori . It is farmed for the silk with which it builds its  cocoon . As of 2002 [update] , the silk industry produces over 130 million kilograms of raw silk, worth about 250 million  U.S. dollars , each year. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ]  Not all silk is produced by  Bombyx mori . There are several species of  Saturniidae  that are also farmed for their silk, such as the Ailanthus moth ( Samia cynthia  group of species), the Chinese Oak Silkmoth ( Antheraea pernyi ), the Assam Silkmoth ( Antheraea assamensis ), and the Japanese Silk Moth ( Antheraea yamamai ).   The mopane worm, the caterpillar of  Gonimbrasia belina , from the family  Saturniidae , is a significant food resource in southern Africa.   Despite being framed for eating clothing, most moth adults do not eat at all. Most like the Luna, Polyphemus, Atlas, Prometheus, Cercropia, and other large moths do not have mouths. When they do eat, moths will drink nectar. [ 1 ]     [ edit ]   Attraction to light          Time exposure at floodlight showing moth flight paths       Moths frequently appear to circle artificial lights. One hypothesis advanced to explain this behavior is that moths use a technique of  celestial navigation  called  transverse orientation . By maintaining a constant angular relationship to a bright celestial light, such as the  Moon , they can fly in a straight line. Celestial objects are so far away, that even after travelling great distances, the change in angle between the moth and the light source is negligible; further, the moon will always be in the upper part of the visual field or on the horizon. When a moth encounters a much closer artificial light and uses it for navigation, the angle changes noticeably after only a short distance, in addition to being often below the horizon. The moth instinctively attempts to correct by turning toward the light, causing airborne moths to come plummeting downwards, and - at close range - which results in a spiral flight path that gets closer and closer to the light source. [ 6 ]             This article  needs additional  citations  for  verification .  Please help  improve this article  by adding  reliable references . Unsourced material may be  challenged  and removed.  (August 2007)       In 1972, Henry Hsiao, now a professor of  biomedical engineering , suggested that the reason for moths circling lights may have to do with a visual distortion called a  Mach band . [ 7 ]  He says that they fly towards the darkest part of the sky in pursuit of safety and are thus inclined to circle ambient objects in the Mach band region.   Hsaio says that the celestial navigation theory should cause moths to circle lights, not to head directly toward them, as many are seen to do. He conjectures that moths, which are nocturnal creatures, must find a place to hide from predators when daylight comes, but cannot do so in darkness. Their instinct when morning comes is to fly toward the light (presumably up) and then down again, with some probability landing on a surface which matches their camouflage. [ 6 ]   A theory which has been advanced in an attempt to explain the attraction male moths have for candles specifically is based on olfaction. There is evidence that olfaction might be, in some cases, mediated by detection of the infra-red spectra of substances. [ 8 ]  The spiky infrared spectra of a candle flame happens to contain a number of emission lines which coincide with the vibrational frequencies of the female moth's pheromone. [ 9 ]  The male moth is thereby powerfully attracted to the flame. Sources, eg. hurricane lamps, with different spike patterns are less powerful attractants.   Night-blooming  flowers  usually depend on moths (or  bats ) for  pollination , and artificial lighting can draw moths away from the flowers, affecting the  plant 's ability to reproduce. A way to prevent this is to put a cloth or netting around the lamp. Another way is using a colored light bulb (preferably red). This will take the moth's attention away from the light while still providing light to see by.     [ edit ]   Predators and parasites of moths   Nocturnal insectivores often feed on moths; these include some  bats , some species of  owls , but also other species of  birds . Moths are also eaten by some species of  lizards , some  cats , some  dogs , some  rodents , and some  bears . Moth larvae are vulnerable to being parasitized by  ichneumonidae .   Baculoviruses are parasite  double-stranded DNA   insect  viruses that are used mostly as  biological control  agents. They are members of the  Baculoviridae , a family that is restricted to insects. Most baculovirus isolates have been obtained from insects, in particular from Lepidoptera.

[ ? ] Subscribe To This Site                   WHAT IS LASAGNA GARDENING OR NO DIG GARDENING OR SHEET MULCHING?           <<        Now there is a term for you! I am sure many of you have heard of lasagna gardening I know most of you have eaten great lasagna but how many of you have eaten vegetables,herbs and grown flowers from a lasagna garden? This can also be referred to as no dig gardening or even the term sheet mulching has been used in identifying this style of gardening.   This style of gardening really began with a lady by the name of Ruth Stout in the early nineteen hundreds. This type of gardening was eventually called no dig gardening. Then along came a lady and renamed the procedure lasagna gardening which I must agree is a more exotic name for this style of gardening. The term sheet mulching I think is less well known.   Anyway a lasagna garden is really out of the scope of normal organic gardening because the total concept is devoted to a lasagna layering method hence the name lasagna. This garden method is developed by creating layers similar to the layering of ingredients in a pasta lasagna. It greatly reduces the need for watering and weeding through the use of heavy layers of mulch. However this mulch comes in a variety of ingredients not just your typical bagged mulch although that maybe used. The lasagna garden layering method builds its own soil with amazing rich nutrients which just yields higher garden production.   You Can Learn How To Reduce Your Carbon Footprint And Help Reverse The Effects Of Global Warming. Keeping My Earth Green Is A Three Part Series That That Will Enlighten You And Your Family To The Facts And Fixes To Help Preserve Our Mother Earth.   Click Here!                   THE DIFFERENCES IN LASAGNA GARDENING            The Lasagna garden encompasses thick layers of organic mulch as well as other ingredients. You can utilize chopped up leaves(done with a lawn mower),grass clippings,hay,straw as pictured  here,sawdust,a little wood ash,compost,humus,animal manure newspaper,cardboard,peat moss,bonemeal,and bloodmeal. This of course in no way implies that all of these materials need be used in your lasagna layering garden. I would presume that the use of ingredients would vary with the availability of materials in your locale.   The bonemeal provides phosphorus which should be sprinkled on top of your finished lasagna garden. The blood meal would make an excellent substitute for ether manure or grass clippings.           LET'S BUILD A LASAGNA GARDEN              FIRST STEP  You must choose a spot for your lasagna garden. This can be either in your exisiting garden,on the lawn,or in raised garden beds. There will be a few preparation steps in lasagna gardening if you utilize the exisitng lawn or decide on the use of raised garden beds.   The lawn most be mowed and the grass clippings saved for layering in your garden. The raised garden beds concept will require you to construct a rectangular preferably out of cedar for weather resistance. Never construct the raise bed out of treated wood it maybe toxic to you or your vegetables that are planted. I would construct the raised garden beds with 8-12 inch high cedar and maybe four feet long and three feet wide. This is only for ease of working in your lasagna garden. There are some folks who only construct three sides but I feel for stability it should have four sides.    I need to point out here that the raised bed below is not deep enough. In order to have a depth of between 18 and 24 inches will require you to use posts 30-36 inches in length that need to be buried in the ground to some depth of between 6-8 inches. Then attach one cedar board,assuming each board is eight inches in width, on top of another until your height is equivalent to 24 inches. You can do with less if you are not going to the maximum depth of lasgana layering. The length of your raised bed is up to you, You can use less boards if the the board width is 12 inches.   This is an example of a well constructed raised bed.It will be filled with the same ingredients as your garden or lawn built lasagna garden. There is one note of caution here I would like you to check. Your going to lay end to end newspapers first in the lasagna gardening procedure but I want you to check the soil in your garden,in your lawn,or in the bottom of the frame of your raised garden beds. How compact is your base soil which you are about to cover? If the soil is badly compacted you may have to deviate from no dig gardening to just a little digging.     Here is why this maybe necessary;The fertile layers you are about to construct will certainly encourage the earthworms and you need these guys to assist in soil building. They also need a  place to be sheltered from excessive heat,hot,dry,cold,and wet conditions.This may require going down several feet in the soil to find this shelter. There will also be worms that at first tunnel up under newspaper and add an additional depth of 3- 4 inches to the soil under the newspaper while the paper is breaking down. If none of this can happen because of compacted soil then either the worms will move away or die. There are a lot of organic gardeners who have translated no dig or lasagna gardening into never dig.In the case of compacted soil it may work fine in the beginning,can cease to be productive.I say  CHECK YOUR SOIL BEFORE PROCEEDING.      SECOND STEP:  If not using raised gardening beds then stake out your lasagna gardening area with stakes making your garden four feet long and about three feet wide. You want to work in it and not fall in it. A tub should be filled with water for the purpose of soaking your newspaper. I should also inject the use of flatten cardboard as permissible but I perfer the ease of newspaper. You should soak 4 to 6 pages of the newspaper at a time. Please don't use the glossy inserts with colored ink unless you want your cabbage to be a color other than red or green.Apply the wet paper to the ground making sure you overlap the edges by at least two inches this will prevent the unwanted weeds from intruding into your lasagna garden.         NOW AS THEY SAY LET THE LASAGNA LAYERING GARDEN BEGIN         <<        THIRD STEP: I am going to suggest here what I used from the list of materials I discussed earlier on this web page. This does not mean that the other materials are somehow inferior it just means this web page would become a novel if I discussed every scenario. The most important fact here is to end up with a  layer at least 18 to 24 inches thick. A lot of stuff I agree but remember by next year it will be maybe 5-8 inches high and require more feeding.    You have your newspaper and to continue your lasagna gardening add two-three inches of a water absorbent material like peat moss. I would add 4-8 inch layer of either humus,easily obtainable at your local garden shop or compost from your composter or scraps saved from your kitchen just as long as its organic. I prefer humus less messy even though you can apply kitchen scraps and other matter wihout using a composter. Then deposit another layer of peat moss followed by a layer of grass clippings. This can be followed by a layer of chopped or ground leaves and on and on until you have reached the depth of 18-24 inches.    As you proceed with your lasagna layering garden make sure each dry layer is sprayed with water so as to be as damp as a well squeezed out sponge. If you decide to use materials that may harbor weed seeds such as hay or uncomposted horse manure,place these in the bottom layers of your lasagna gardening to lessen the possibility of weed growth.     LASAGNA GARDENING PLANTING IMMEDIATE OR WAIT    There are many schoOls of thought on this issue one being by the lady who presented lasagna gardens to the world in her book entitled  LASAGNA GARDENING . This gal  immediately plants her gardens without waiting for percolation of her just constructed bed. She has great success in this method. THere are others who will tell you to wait a year prior to planting in your lasagna garden. A third method is surprisingly called cook the lasagna.   You cover the mulched area with black plastic and weight the edges with rocks or heavy branches. THe dark color will more effectively soak in the sun's heat and really hasten the decomposition of your lasagna garden. In any case you are now ready for the planting of your favorite vegetables,flowers or bulbs. Happy lasagna gardening.

It gets you out into the fresh air and sunshine which we all need and require and besides it provides you with healthy and tasty food. There is one drawback to all of this wonderfulness it does require hard work to achieve the final result.  It should be noted first that planning your vegetable gardening is the number one objective. It would be a rare happening to toss a few seeds into a garden patch and have a ready crop in a few months. You really should layout the size requirement of your plot,depending what you may plant,be sure to pick the proper location including sun and shade necessary for your vegetables. The soil should be prepared along with proper compost to insure a healthy happy home vegetable garden.    Fertilizing is required prior to the planting of any seeds in your vegetable gardening chores. It is also necessary during the growing of your crops. The type of fertilizer and how much to apply depends solely on the types of plants,the soil factor see  You can get more information about the proper soil for your  gardening    A word of caution should be interjected here about fertilizing. There are so many varieties available today that the directions should be closely followed in each and every case. One of the worst things you can do is over fertilize leading,using the wrong type,to killing the plant more often than if you had never applied any.   You may want to decide if organic methods should be used in your vegetable gardening or maybe you will want to rely on more modern procedures. Today it seems that the two ideologies have led to the inability to differentiate since tried and true organic methods have learned from modern science and modern science has seen the usefulness of combining natural ideas and procedures into producing the safest result.   87 Page Step-by-step Gardening Manual For Beginners To Learn How To Grow Their Own Healthy, Organic Food - Saving Money And Eating Chemical Free! Great Bonuses With This E-manual. Revised  Edition Just Released.   Click Here!           The investigation of what to plant or sow is just as important as any scientific ideas to make it happen. Like your personal tastes in vegetables,or ease of growth and length of time to produce your end result. However a lot of this special interest is going to be dictated by your climate and soil rather than your personal preference for onions.   Vegetable gardening will bring rewarding results whether your plot is large or small. It is mostly the effort that you desire to provide that will have the final impact. This is simply an introduction into this home gardening and now I am going more specific on the techniques of pulling this off. and see  home vegetable gardening for specific information on many vegetables      Vegetable Gardening Its Time For Preparation For Planting        Now maybe you have made the decision as to vegetables you are going to plant. There are still necessary ingredients to make your vegetable gardening successful. One of the most important is the soil you have chosen to plant your vegetable crop. It could well be that previous plantings have depleted the soil of necessary nutrients. The soil could also be compacted and will not absorb water in a particular good fashion. These are items that can be easily fixed with a few easy steps on your part. Specific vegetables are discussed at home vegetable gardening as to planting,growing and harvesting so just click here    I would immediately pay a visit to my local garden supplier and procure an inexpensive soil testing kit. These kits will give you a good indication on the nutrient levels,ph and other good information. You can also pay a visit to your local Extension Office to acquire more accurate results.    Your ph levels can be corrected with small amounts of sulfur or lime. Plants vary in their desire to have the soil either alkaline or slightly acidic. You will have to check the directions that arrived  with your plant or seeds to determine this factor. Your local garden shop can also assist you if no indications are present with the plants or seeds. I do not recommend planting a garden beneath or near a pine tree, for example, because the falling needles add a small amount of acid to the earth. A medium level is best for your vegetable gardening such as a ph between 6.0-6.5.   As previously mentioned the compactness of your soil has everything to do with both water absorbtion and the ease of your plants to put down roots. You have to determine if you are working with clay,sandy, or sandy loam or a mixture of these which will determine how much tilling is required to loosen the soil. You can either rent a tiller or purchase one for this purpose.              This is all necessary for your vegetable gardening because the soil needs to be aerated just like your lawn to provide the proper amount of oxygen and the freedom required for your plants to spread their roots. This can not be emphasized enough that compact soil will make it difficult if not impossible for nutrients and water to flow and drain. The result of this is shallow roots and weak plants subject to disease and the ultimate failure of your beautiful garden.   Weed control right from the start is an important factor.  See the discussion of what can be used for immediate control of weeds  You might also want to consider a weed control fabric that makes it more difficult for weeds to appear in your garden. I might add here that neither method is full proof. You must follow the directions of the weed preventor and  PULL  all previously exisitng weeds it only  PREVENTS  weeds it does not kill existing weeds. THe fabric requires you to make holes in order to plant your vegetables and sometimes these holes produce weeds along with plants or weed seeds become imbedded in the fabric and start to grow. You will have to check,in either case, periodically for this occurrence.       <<        It is the perfect time to attack bacteria and other evil things that could eat and destroy your plants. This would be a good spot to check out  and see what insects could attack your brand new home garden  You might also want to check  and see what you can be done to prevent plant diseases or recognize symptoms for later observation in your garden  The application of pesticides that are appropriate for your garden is very effective and should entail a wide enough range to assist in the prevention of potential pests. The same thing will apply for plant diseases once you have shoots large enough to treat and prevent plant diseases. A word of caution here should be noted as early application of some preventive plant disease formula could be harmful to your tender plants.       Vegetable Gardening And The Importance Of Water    Water is definitely the vital ingredient in the health of your vegetable gardening. Its use plays a vital role in the distribution of nutrients to your plants. It provides the necessary firmness and stiffness to the cell structure in your vegetable plants. This requires about an inch of water per week for most gardens. In a larger context,this can be calculated to be about 65 gallons per 100 square feet of garden over the course of a garden season. If the natural moisture does not provide this amount from April through September then you will need to provide the diffference.   The watering of vegetable plants is fortunately not as difficult as flowering plants. In moderate temperatures you can apply watering directly to the top without fear of wilting. There are,however, rules that do apply to both types of plants. It would be good to water early in the day this allows the leaves and the top layer of soil to become dry before the night time temperatures settle into your garden. You still have the problems with fungus and this method of watering will help prevent the fungus from gaining the upper hand.   You can accomplish the same thing with the use of drip irrigation. This method is employed especially in the dryer portions of our world and where water is expensive or maybe both conditions exist. Drip irrigation allows the water to be applied in a consistent manner. It also provides the advantage of slow application at the plant location and results in all the water being applied to the root area.   You can encounter problems with this method. The drip holes in your tubing are susceptible to clogging from small particles or salts present in your water. This is a good justification for providing a filtering system for your vegetable gardening. This can be done with relative inexpensive cartridge filters. Even with the use of this system you must think through and plan the use of this application. Nitrogen and organic fertilizers that are soluble can be adminstered through drip lines. There are still many phosphate fertilizers and organic fertilizers that require special application devices,which are available on the market to adminster this type of nitrogen to your drip lines.   Gardening Books at deep discounts are available at this location:           The tried and true methods are still the best. This would be to fertilize the soil prior to even planting your vegetable plants. I can tell you that the definitely best fertilizer for vegetable crops is poultry manure. It completely meets the needs of nutritional requirements but must be applied in prudent amounts and the soil tilled about three weeks before planting. If you have acccess to a local farmer or even inquire at your local garden shop to obtain a supply of this vegetable fertilizer.   In summary of this important step don't plant more then you can irrigate efficiently with your exisiting water supply. Many people become so enthusiastic about their vegetable gardening that more is planted then can be attended to or eaten for that matter. A word also about the drip irrigation should be noted. The system must be operated in a frequent fashion in order to both maintain moisture and to stop the clogging of the small transmission holes. The rule to follow and one that I adhere to is to turn on the system for approximately an hour every two to three days.  Of course during extreme dry spells more frequent use maybe required.   You can search the web for more information on irrigation equipment:                 Enter your search terms     Submit search form                         Vegetable Gardening With Raised Bed Gardens    I guess a real good reason for vegetable gardening via the raised bed method would be the reduction in soil compaction. Your plant roots always need air and with your ordinary gardening procedures it requires you stepping into the garden and compacting the soil wherever you step.A well designed raised bed garden allows all the work to be accomplished from the garden path ,stone or lawn.   You can easily space your plants a little closer to each other because you need not allow for places to step. There are exceptions to this rule. Tomato plants require room to spread even though you may have them contained by cages. I have found in 4x6 raised bed 6 tomato plants is sufficent allowing enough room for spreading branches and room to plant smaller plants among them.   The raised garden bed allows for excess moisture to drain away and enables the plant roots with the ability to breath. This is especially helpful in areas that have moisture laden soils like Florida and other southern areas. It maybe the sole method of growing some types of vegetable plants at all.   The soil conditions are kept well under control in this type of environment and the soil types can be modified from raised garden bed to raised garden bed depending on the requirements of the vegetable plants. Your water,fertilizer,mulch can be an easier chore to apply because they only need to be applied to the raised bed gardens and not the entire garden.   It has been noted by various reports that a raised garden bed results in 1.4 to 2 times as much product per square foot as your common gardening area. It makes your job easy to manage with less work and definitely with less diseases as those in the ordinary garden. It also results in more product than the ordinary garden.   LET'S TALK ABOUT CONSTRUCTION OF YOUR RAISED BED    The  BEST  raised garden is built within the walls of wooden sides and this is especially desirable if your soil content is heavy. I first prepared an area in a grassy section of my lawn by using cloth fabric to smother the grass after the sides of my raised garden bed was assembled with cedar or redwood. It is not adviseable to use treated wood because of the chemicals present in the wood. The dimensions should be kept to four foot wide and six foot long using a board that is at least 8 inches high to 10 inches. Why you might ask why so high? You know those critters like rabbits and squirrels are prevented from getting into the garden as long as you have the  raised bed away from trees or hanging branches.   I would assemble the raised bed garden using lag screws which I will explain later. After the application of the cloth fabric, I added a medium fine stone over the fabric to a depth of about two to three inches allowing for excellent drainage into the earth beneath. I purchased forty pound bags of top soil from the local garden shop to the tune of about thirty to thirty five bags. You will actually have to be the judge of your depth. I know I made two trips because I did not have enough on the first attempt.   You also need to purchase some compost or other organic material to mix with your top soil. I would try to maintain one-third mixed with your top soil. However if a loam top soil is available you will require less organic matter. The soil must be dry when you mix it with the organic matter and if clumps in either the compost or soil exist they must be seperated and mixed evenly with the soil before putting them into the bed.   I mentioned previously the use of lag screws to assemble your raised bed garden. I personally see no reason for this procedure to be followed but some gardeners may want to disassemble their raised beds. The only reason I could think of for doing this maybe a redesign or a rearrange of your garden.   Now if you framed your raised bed with something other than what I discussed before like railroad ties,timbers,or landscape blocks you have an extreme amount of work to perform.   If you assembled it like I suggested then its a simple matter of detaching the lag screws and moving the sides to another location without damaging the wood by use of other methods of attachment.   You will have the problem of transporting all that top soil and stone to the next location. This could be a real tough job and back breaking. My advice is to look  REAL HARD  at where your original placement is going to be with the thought in mind of  NEVER  moving the raised beds.      It would be a good idea to have some kind of time watering system or even a dedicated hose in the area of your raised garden bed. I have a sprinkler that looks like a duck with a six foot pole attached and it spins projecting the water over several water beds postioned to catch the water. THe timer is set for 7am and shuts down at 9am providing two hours of a good soaking. You can also use a hose but you never know if you have really applied enough water to your beds. I do shut down the timer if there is rain predicted or wet and cloudy conditions exist for several days.   We have covered in another area of this site container gardening.

It is an abundant species of  Europe  and the  Near East  and one of very few  Lepidoptera  of temperate regions in which the adults are active even in the depth of winter.   The female of this species is virtually wingless and cannot fly but the male is fully winged and flies strongly. Its  wingspan  is 28-33 mm with alternating pale buff and darker brown  fascia  on the forewings and a similar pattern, but much paler, on the hindwings. The adults are active at night throughout the winter from October to February  [1] . Males are attracted to light and females.   After mating, females lay their eggs in tree bark crevices or in other sheltered locations, and all adults die. The eggs hatch in the spring when temperatures average around 13C (55F). After hatching, the young larvae crawl up tree trunks and produce silken thread that can carry them in the wind to new areas. This dispersal method, called ""ballooning,"" is common among defoliators.   The  larva  are green loopers with pale lines on the sides and a darker one along the top. They will feed on virtually any  tree  or  shrub  (see list below) and can be a serious  pest  in  apple   orchards . Generally, their feeding is completed by mid-June.   Winter Moths are considered an  invasive species  in North America; Nova Scotia experienced the first confirmed infestations in the 1930s. The moth is now found in  British Columbia ,  Washington ,  Oregon ,  New Brunswick ,  Prince Edward Island , and  Massachusetts . There have been unconfirmed reports of infestations in southern  New Hampshire  and northern  Rhode Island .

By  Tracy Wilkinson            May 20, 2008                                          As the name suggests, green fields stretch in every direction here in Campoverde. But where grapes once dominated, the landscape now has a new king: kiwi.     Somewhat improbably, Italy has grown to become the world’s largest producer of the odd furry fruit, according to the   National Institute of Agricultural Economics ,  surpassing even New Zealand, which coined the name for the fruit once known as the Chinese gooseberry.    You don’t think “kiwi” when you think Italy. In fact, two of the letters that spell the word don’t even form part of the Italian alphabet.      Nevertheless, kiwi cultivation is booming, with annual production at more than 400,000 tons, earning millions of dollars for farmers and reviving the economy in once-moribund sections of Italy that people might have otherwise abandoned for the city.     A kiwi plant, it turns out, adapts fairly easily to the infrastructure used for grapes. It is planted along the same configuration of long, furrowed rows; The thin trunk is latched to a post, and its branches spread laterally to form a canopy, just like the grape vine. From a distance you might not even spot the difference, except that the leaves of the kiwi plant are rounder, fuller and a deeper shade of green.     Here in Italy’s central Latina province, where farms replaced swampland drained during the Mussolini era, Gianni Cosmi has gradually been converting his family farm over to kiwi. He still dedicates about 50 acres to grapes, much of which ends up as wine. But 35 acres is now planted with kiwi. Sure, he agreed, it’s a shift in identity. But it’s a profitable one.      “ With grapes and wine, there is history,” Cosmi, 47, said. “With the kiwi, there is adventure.”     Or, what one might call the wow factor. It is quite the attention-grabber when you say you raise kiwi, Cosmi marveled as he surveyed the rows and rows of spindly kiwi trees covering his land.      “ If you provide kiwi to the world, everyone takes note,” he said. “It is still seen as exotic and something different.”     About 80% of Italy’s kiwi production is exported, the bulk to Europe and 15% going to the United States. Italy sends kiwis at roughly the opposite end of the calendar from when other big producers such as New Zealand do, providing the  U.S.  a virtual year-round supply.     Even though kiwis need a lot more water than grapes, the green, tart fruit can earn three times the profit that grapes bring in, Cosmi said.    It requires a bit more manual labor, as well. Workers inspect the round pre-fruit pods for the perfect shape. Those that are judged lopsided are picked and tossed.    The fruit thrives in central Italy because of the climate, with its relatively mild winters and warm-but-not-scorching summers, and because of the area’s mineral-rich volcanic soil.     And, it’s naturally organic, said Cosmi, a former mayor of nearby Aprilia. No need for pesticides and only a little fertilizer.     Italian kiwi took root here in Latina, and Renato Campoli was its pioneer. Thirty years ago, as a young man, Campoli was one of the first Italians to plant the fruit, almost on a lark.      “ I was looking for something new to do in agriculture,” said Campoli, suntanned and with thick white hair. The tomatoes, beets and cows raised on his little family farm didn’t yield much of a living. A friend in Sweden had come across a mysterious fruit called a kiwi, and he challenged Campoli: Plant that!       “ I didn’t know a thing about it, not how to cultivate it, water it, prune it,” Campoli, 57, recalled with a laugh. That first year, he was ready to give up. He was on the verge of destroying the first several hundred boxes of kiwi that he had grown because, traveling the length and breadth of Italy, he couldn’t find a buyer. Finally, an organic co-op near Lake Bolsena agreed to take the fruit.     Slowly, Campoli built what he assumed would be a niche market. But, over time, business took off as the fruit’s popularity grew across the world and Italy positioned itself to fill in the Southern Hemisphere’s production gaps. Campoli’s life was transformed. His five-acre farm is today a 50-acre spread. His son, who would assuredly have run off to the city in search of work, is instead getting an environmental engineering degree and will come home to run the business.     Campoli didn’t even taste a kiwi before he started growing it. It was a bit strange; some of his relatives thought it too sour. Today he is expanding into a new variety of the fruit, with yellow flesh, called “Kiwigold.”     The sweeter golden kiwi, unlike the green version, was patented by the New Zealand company that developed it, and so Italian growers such as Campoli have to get a license to plant it. Word has it that efforts are underway to create a red version.    Italians are learning to love kiwi, sort of. More kiwi is eaten in Italy than anywhere else in Europe, and per capita consumption is seven times that in the  U.S.  Its price has come down over the years and these days costs only a few cents more than apples or bananas.     But here where it’s grown, kiwi still hasn’t permeated the culture the way, say, garlic is king in Gilroy. There are no gigantic kiwi statues at local gas stations here. There are no kiwi festivals, the way Tuscany has olive festivals and  cinghiale  (wild boar) festivals. You can order and be served a kiwi at the Campoverde coffee bar, but the barman might not cut it correctly (as he didn’t the other day when a visitor ordered one).     Cosmi, the former mayor and proud kiwi grower, hopes this will change. He is also president of the Latina Kiwi Consortium, an umbrella grouping of the province’s farmers. The consortium’s logo is a kiwi cut in half and plopped inside an image of the ancient Roman Colosseum.     Italian kiwi farmers, who have a trade magazine and biannual conventions (standing room only the last few years), plan to launch a publicity campaign with radio and  TV  spots, billboards and other promotional gimmicks, Cosmi said. They will extol the fruit’s vitamin-rich nutritional virtues, as well as its environmentally friendly cultivation, in an effort to expand both consumption and the market.      “ Come back in 10 years,” Cosmi said, gesturing toward the green-checkered horizon, “and it will all be kiwi.”       wilkinson@latimes.com                                           Save/Share:                                                                                                                                                                                         More articles by Tracy Wilkinson             More articles from the World section                  California and the world.

The original name of the Manor here was  Great Maytham . In 1721 James Monypenny built a house here which he called  Maytham Hall . This was completed by his son Robert Monypenny in 1760 but was largely burned down in 1893. This house consisted of a main block of 2 storeys and basement and 2 pavilions containing the laundry and stables. These eighteenth century wings largely survive, but the main building was rebuilt two storeys higher by  Sir Edwin Lutyens  in 1909-12 for the Right Honourable  H. J. Tennant , a prominent Liberal  Member of Parliament , who reverted to the use of the original name,  Great Maytham .   The house and grounds fell into decline after  World War II . In 1965 Great Maytham Hall was purchased and restored by the Mutual Households Association, later the  Country Houses Association , a charity dedicated to saving and preserving historic stately homes. The house was converted into fifteen flats, with residents sharing the reception rooms, entrance hall and drawing room; its first residents then set about restoring the gardens and grounds. In December 2003 the  Country Houses Association  announced that it was closing down its residential business and selling the eight Grade I and II listed buildings it owned.

Its author,  Frances Hodgson Burnett , lived at Great Maytham Hall from 1898 to 1907, where she found the old walled garden dating from 1721 sadly overgrown and neglected. [ 3 ]  Aided by a robin, Burnett discovered the door hidden amongst the ivy, and began the restoration of the garden, which she planted with hundreds of roses. She set up a table and chair in the gazebo, and dressed always in a white dress and large hat, she wrote a number of books in the peace and tranquility of her scented secret garden.   When Lutyens rebuilt Great Maytham Hall he retained the old walled garden as an adjunct to the grand new brick house in the manner of Sir  Christopher Wren , but landscaped the terraced lawns and surrounding parkland in his signature style, in partnership with  Gertrude Jekyll , who planted his design. The gardens and grounds were well cared for by the Tennants until the outbreak of the Second World War, when the house was requisitioned by the army. As part of the "" Dig for Victory "" campaign, Frances Hodgson Burnett's beautiful roses were replaced with cabbages and leeks, and the manicured lawns were patriotically planted with potatoes and carrots. A jettisoned German bomb in the middle of the former lawn did not help to improve matters, and after the war the house stood empty for many years, and the gardens were left to decline.

All have two characteristics in common: they are short and, to varying degrees, considered  invasive plants . Out of these four perennials for dry shade, only English ivy is such a vigorous grower that its invasiveness may pose a serious problem to your landscape.      5.  English Ivy Plants      English ivy vines may produce insignficant, greenish-white flowers in the fall, but these perennials for dry shade are grown primarily for their foliage. A popular plant for many years, a growing number of homeowners now choose not to grow English ivy, due to its negative impact on forests in some regions (when it escapes from cultivation). If you do choose to grow English ivy, don't plant it near your trees. The vines climb up tree trunks and may eventually engulf the whole tree, drastically reducing the amount of sunlight that reaches the leaves of the host tree. For more information on English ivy, please consult the following resource:      English Ivy Plants      The next three perennials for dry shade are safer choices. They're also all deer-resistant, to boot.      6.  Japanese Pachysandra       Pachysandra terminalis  produces white blooms in spring but, like English ivy, is grown primarily for its robust green foliage. To learn more about Japanese pachysandra, please consult the following resource:      Japanese Pachysandra       7.  Vinca Minor Vines      But what if you want more than greenery from a short ground cover?  Vinca minor  may provide the answer for you, with the adorable blue flowers it yields in spring. To learn more about vinca, please consult the following resource:      Vinca Minor Vines       8.  Spotted Dead Nettles      Or perhaps you're content with nice foliage, only you'd prefer its color be something other than green? Well, these perennials for dry shade provide an interesting silvery foliage. To learn more about spotted dead nettles, please consult the following resource:      Spotted Dead Nettles     The final two entries in my list of perennials for dry shade are spring-flowering bulbs.      9.  Snowdrops      These perennials for dry shade are as impatient for spring to come as  you  are. Sometimes, they can be seen pushing up through a recalcitrant layer of snow! To learn more about snowdrops, please consult the following resource:      Snowdrops       10.  Scilla Siberica     The bulb, squill is also called ""scilla,"" because its Latin name is  Scilla siberica . If the white blooms of snowdrops aren't what you want after looking at the color, white all winter, then the blue of these perennials for dry shade may be more to your liking. Scilla does need a good deal of water during its growing season, which is spring. But considering the abundance of moisture in many regions during spring, this usually isn't a problem. For more information on squill, please see the following resource:      Scilla Siberica            Prev 1 2 Next    Resources Related to Dry Shade Plants All Articles on Landscaping Plants for Deer Control Ground Covers Resources Related to Dry Shade Plants Landscape Design Tips Annual Flowers Flowering Shrubs Resources Related to Dry Shade Plants Landscape Plants Flower Pictures Sample Landscape Plan for Shady Areas    Related Articles Moonbeam Coreopsis Picture Flowering Plants for Dry Areas: Drought Tolerant Perennials English Ivy Plants | Picture of English Ivy Plants Plants for Dry Shade Choosing Perennial Plants to Suit Your Garden and Gardening Style      Guide since 2002 David Beaulieu Landscaping Guide Sign up  for my Newsletter My Blog My Forum                                     Explore Landscaping   Must Reads Landscaping Pictures, Ideas NEW Course: ""Alternative Landscaping"" Landscape Design for Beginners How-To Videos Common Landscaping Mistakes Most Popular Landscape Design Landscaping Ideas, Pics Install French Drains Landscape Design Ideas Landscaping Pictures          See More About: short plants english ivy pachysandra scilla snowdrops      By Category Landscaping Pictures Landscape Design Ideas Water Gardens, Rock Gardens Landscaping Shrubs Landscape Plants Landscaping Trees Patios, Walls Lawn Care Tips Fences, Driveways Decks, Arbors Landscaping Problems Yard Maintenance Organic Pest Control Organic Weed Control Help for Beginners More from About.com Super Bowl XLIII From the field to the party, wee got you covered.

The  differences between butterflies and moths  are more than just  taxonomy . [ citation needed ]  Sometimes the names "" Rhopalocera "" (butterflies) and "" Heterocera "" (moths) are used to formalize the popular distinction. Many attempts have been made to subdivide the Lepidoptera into groups such as the Microlepidoptera and Macrolepidoptera, Frenatae and Jugatae, or Monotrysia and Ditrysia. Failure of these names to persist in modern classifications is due to the fact none of them represents a pair of "" monophyletic groups "". The reality is that butterflies are a small group that arose from within the ""moths"" [ citation needed ]  and there is thus no way to group all of the remaining taxa in a monophyletic group, as it will always exclude that one descendant lineage.   Most species of moth are  nocturnal , but there are  crepuscular  and  diurnal  species. They can be distinguished from butterflies in several ways.           Contents       1   Etymology   2   Economic significance of moths   3   Attraction to light   4   Predators of moths   5   Notable moths   6   See also   7   Gallery   8   References   9   External links                 Etymology   The  Modern English  word "" moth "" comes from  Old English  "" moe "" (cf. Northumbrian "" mohe "") from Common Germanic (compare  Old Norse  "" motti "",  Dutch  "" Mot "" and  German  "" Motte "" all meaning "" moth ""). Perhaps its origins are related to Old English "" maa "" meaning "" maggot "" or from the root of "" midge "" which until the 16th century was used mostly to indicate the larva, usually in reference to devouring clothes.   The study of butterflies and moths is known as  lepidoptery , and  biologists  that specialize in either are called lepidopterists. As a pastime, watching butterflies and moths is known as  butterflying  and  mothing . The latter has given rise to the term ""mother"" for someone who engages in this activity  sometimes written with a hyphen (moth-er) to distinguish it from its  usual meaning . This confusion does not arise in speech as it is pronounced differently ( IPA :  /mRZ/ , not  /mZ/ ).       Economic significance of moths          An adult male Pine Processionary Moth ( Thaumetopoea pityocampa ). This species is a serious forest pest when in larvar state. Notice the bristle springing from the underside of the hindwing (frenulum) and running forward to be held in a small catch of the forewing, whose function is to link the wings together.               Poplar hawk-moth caterpillar   Laothoe populi       Moths, and particularly their  caterpillars , are a major  agricultural  pest in many parts of the world. The caterpillar of the  gypsy moth  ( Lymantria dispar ) causes severe damage to forests in the northeast United States, where it is an  invasive species . In temperate climates, the  codling moth  causes extensive damage, especially to fruit farms. In tropical and subtropical climates, the  diamondback moth  ( Plutella xylostella ) is perhaps the most serious pest of  brassicaceous  crops.   Several moths in the family  Tineidae  are commonly regarded as pests because their larvae eat  fabric  such as  clothes  and  blankets  made from natural  proteinaceous  fibers such as  wool  or  silk . They are less likely to eat mixed materials containing artificial fibers. There are some reports that they can be repelled by the scent of wood from  juniper  and  cedar , by lavender, or by other natural oils. However, many consider this unlikely to prevent infestation.  Naphthalene  (the chemical used in  mothballs ) is considered more effective, but there are concerns over its effects on human health. Moth larvae may be killed by freezing the items which they infest for several days at a temperature below 8 C (17.6 F). [ 1 ]   Moths are sturdy and usually are more resistant to pesticides than are mosquitoes and flies. [ citation needed ]   Some moths are  farmed . The most notable of these is the  silkworm , the larva of the domesticated moth  Bombyx mori . It is farmed for the silk with which it builds its  cocoon . As of 2002 [update] , the silk industry produces over 130 million kilograms of raw silk, worth about 250 million  U.S. dollars , each year. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ]  Not all silk is produced by  Bombyx mori . There are several species of  Saturniidae  that are also farmed for their silk, such as the Ailanthus moth ( Samia cynthia  group of species), the Chinese Oak Silkmoth ( Antheraea pernyi ), the Assam Silkmoth ( Antheraea assamensis ), and the Japanese Silk Moth ( Antheraea yamamai ).   The mopane worm, the caterpillar of  Gonimbrasia belina , from the family  Saturniidae , is a significant food resource in southern Africa.   Despite being framed for eating clothing, most moth adults do not eat at all. Most like the Luna, Polyphemus, Atlas, Prometheus, Cercropia, and other large moths do not have mouths. When they do eat, moths will drink nectar. Only one species of moth eats wool. [ citation needed ]  The adults do not eat but the larvae will eat through wool clothing.       Attraction to light          Time exposure at floodlight showing moth flight paths       Moths frequently appear to circle artificial lights. One hypothesis advanced to explain this behavior is that moths use a technique of  celestial navigation  called  transverse orientation . By maintaining a constant angular relationship to a bright celestial light, such as the  Moon , they can fly in a straight line. Celestial objects are so far away, that even after travelling great distances, the change in angle between the moth and the light source is negligible; further, the moon will always be in the upper part of the visual field or on the horizon. When a moth encounters a much closer artificial light and uses it for navigation, the angle changes noticeably after only a short distance, in addition to being often below the horizon. The moth instinctively attempts to correct by turning toward the light, causing airborne moths to come plummeting downwards, and - at close range - which results in a spiral flight path that gets closer and closer to the light source. [ 5 ]             This article  needs additional  citations  for  verification .  Please help  improve this article  by adding  reliable references . Unsourced material may be  challenged  and removed.  (August 2007)       In 1972, Henry Hsiao, now a professor of  biomedical engineering , suggested that the reason for moths circling lights may have to do with a visual distortion called a  Mach band . [ 6 ]  He says that they fly towards the darkest part of the sky in pursuit of safety and are thus inclined to circle ambient objects in the Mach band region. This hypothesis is not scientifically accepted and has never been confirmed. [ citation needed ]   Hsaio says that the celestial navigation theory should cause moths to circle lights, not to head directly toward them, as many are seen to do. He conjectures that moths, which are nocturnal creatures, must find a place to hide from predators when daylight comes, but cannot do so in darkness. Their instinct when morning comes is to fly toward the light (presumably up) and then down again, with some probability landing on a surface which matches their camouflage. [ 5 ]   A theory which has been advanced in an attempt to explain the attraction male moths have for candles specifically is based on olfaction. There is evidence that olfaction might be, in some cases, mediated by detection of the infra-red spectra of substances. [ 7 ]  The spiky infrared spectra of a candle flame happens to contain a number of emission lines which coincide with the vibrational frequencies of the female moth's pheromone. [ 8 ]  The male moth is thereby powerfully attracted to the flame. Sources, eg. hurricane lamps, with different spike patterns are less powerful attractants.   Night-blooming  flowers  usually depend on moths (or  bats ) for  pollination , and artificial lighting can draw moths away from the flowers, affecting the  plant 's ability to reproduce. A way to prevent this is to put a cloth or netting around the lamp. Another way is using a colored light bulb (preferably red). This will take the moth's attention away from the light while still providing light to see by.       Predators of moths   Nocturnal insectivores often feed on moths; these include some  bats , some species of  owls , but also other species of  birds . Moths are also eaten by some species of  lizards , some  cats , some  dogs , some  rodents , and some  bears . Moth larvae are vulnerable to being parasitized by  ichneumonidae .       Notable moths     Atlas moth  ( Attacus atlas ), the largest moth in the world   White Witch moth ( Thysania agrippina ), the Lepidopteran with the biggest wingspan   Madagascan Sunset moth  ( Chrysiridia rhipheus ), considered to be one of the most impressive and beautiful Lepidoptera [ 9 ]   Death's-head hawkmoth  ( Acherontia  spp.), is associations with the supernatural and evil and was featured in art and movies   Peppered moth  ( Biston betularia ), the subject of a now well-known study in evolution   Luna moth  ( Actias luna )   Emperor Gum moth  ( Opodiphthera eucalypti )   Polyphemus moth  ( Antheraea polyphemus )   Bogong moth  ( Agrotis infusa ), south eastern Indigenous Australians were known to have feasted on the moths.

Yellow and red flowers in spring. Evergreen in all but the coldest winters. Most soils; tolerates poor drainage. Sun to Shade. This is a good, evergreen vine which grows fast (and even faster in rich, moist soils), and will do well in sun or shade. It clings with tiny claw-like tendrils, so you do not need to string up support for it. Flowers are large, trumpet-shaped, and two-toned yellow and brick red, and appear profusely in the spring, very sporadically in summer. They attract the spring-migrating hummingbirds.       Campsis radicans   TRUMPET VINE      20-40 ft. Brilliant orange flowers June-September. Deciduous. Most well drained soils. Sun to Part shade. The huge orange flowers that cover this vine in the summer never fail to attract hummingbirds. The vine grows quickly, gets large, and clings with aerial rootlets (do not plant this against the house--it can damage brick, mortar, and roofs). Do plant it up old trees, on fences, or on unsightly out-buildings. Flowers appear in clusters at the end of a stem; long attractive seedpods follow the spent flowers. The native form is extremely invasive; we sell the 'Madame Galen' hybrid, which is less aggressive. Give it extra water west of Ft. Worth. We also sell a yellow-flowered trumpet vite Buff yellow color combines delightfully with adobe and stucco walls. The yellow form is not as invasive as the native orange form. Please specify 'Madame Galen' or yellow when ordering.       Clematis pitcheri   PURPLE LEATHERFLOWER      8-10 ft. Lavender flowers May to July. Deciduous. Most well drained soils. Part shade. This shade-loving vine grows from the roots each spring, so does not get very large. It looks best growing over low structure, perhaps around a birdbath or garden sculpture. The small, delicate purple flowers look like small bells with pointed ends curled back. It is native to Dallas County.       Clematis texensis   SCARLET CLEMATIS      8-10 ft. Red flowers spring and summer. Deciduous. Most well drained soils. Part shade to Shade. This delicate vine produces lovely bell-shaped flowers in various shades of red. Like Clematis pitcheri, it dies to the roots each year, so does not get very big. Use it in the same way, planting it where you can get close to it and enjoy its delicate beauty. This vine is native to the Hill Country.       Lonicera sempervirens  CORAL HONEYSUCKLE      10-15 ft. Coral red flowers in mild weather followed by red berries. Evergreen, deciduous in cold winters. Most soils; tolerates poor drainage. Sun to Part shade. This is not the fragrant, but rampant, yellow honeysuckle that will swallow whole yards. This civilized and beautiful vine grows quickly and aggressively, but stays where you want it. It twines, so will need support to get started. Flowers are a beautiful coral red, long, thin trumpet; the interior is yellow and seems to glow. They are not fragrant, but hummingbirds love them and birds appreciate the large red berries that follow. It will need some extra water and shade for its roots if it is grown in full sun. It is native to Dallas County and will grow on limestone, but given deep, rich soil, will grow rapidly into a wonderfully lush vine       Parthenocissus quinquefolia   VIRGINIA CREEPER      20-30 ft. Deciduous, good fall color. Most well drained soils. Sun to Shade. This vigorous vine is grown for its foliage, which is lush and green in the summer and brilliant red in autumn. It grows best in partial sun or full shade, although fall color is more subdued if grown in shade. Mature plants produce small black berries appreciated by birds in the winter. It clings with aerial disks, so needs no trellis. You may see three leaves at the base of the stem or on immature plants, but follow the stem up and you'll see that this plant has five leaves, so you can be assured you haven't planted and tended a lovely stand of poison ivy.       Passiflora incarnata   PASSIONFLOWER, MAYPOP      6 ft. Blue flowers May-August. Deciduous. Most soils. Sun to Part shade. This drought tolerant native will put up with heavy clay. The flowers are extremely unusual and hard to describe--petals overlaid with many long, thin tendrils. You have to see them to get the idea. They die back to the roots each year so never get big.       Rosa setigera   CLIMBING PRAIRIE ROSE      9-15 ft. Pink flowers in May. Deciduous. Most well drained soils. Sun to Part shade. The flowers on this healthy rose start out dark pink and fade to near white, so when it is blooming you'll see many shades of pink covering this plant. Flowers are single, with bright yellow stamens at the center. It looks good on a pergola, arbor, or even growing into a tree. Hundreds of small red hips follow the flowers, so it is attractive even when not in bloom. This plant will sucker and can make an enormous shrub; pull suckers out at the base to keep the growth in check. This is a nice, lime-tolerant native rose.

They possess two pairs of wings covered with microscopic, overlapping scales having distinctive colors and patterns. The body and legs are covered with scales, or with long, hairlike bristles. The adult lepidopteran lacks mandibles (found in most other insects); it feeds on liquids, mostly  nectar , by means of a long proboscis, which is coiled in a  spiral  under the head when not in use. The proboscis is extended by  blood pressure  and coiled by muscular action. In some instances, the adult moth does not feed and lacks the proboscis. The head of the adult insect bears a pair of large compound eyes with many facets, and usually also a pair of simple eyes or ocelli. The antennae are long and many-segmented. The lepidopteran life cycle has four stages: the egg; the larva (called caterpillar), which molts several times as it feeds and grows; the pupa, which is a non-feeding, quiescent stage; and the adult (or imago).   The larva is usually the most conspicuous stage in the life cycle. It feeds voraciously, usually on leaves, but in various cases by boring in stems, or fruit, or stored grain, or by chewing on fur, wool, or other material. Unlike the adult, the larva has strong mandibles and other mouth parts for cutting and chewing its food. The larva bears several pairs of simple eyes, but no compound eyes. Each of its three thoracic segments bears a pair of typical many-jointed walking legs, which become the legs of the adult. In addition, several of its ten abdominal segments bear a pair of soft, unsegmented, ""prolegs"" with hooklike processes, which help in crawling and grasping. The larva of any given  species  undergoes a specific number of molts before transforming into pupa. The larval skin may be naked, or covered with long hairs, bristles, or spines. Also, many larvae have characteristic colored stripes or other distinctive patterns. The larval stage is frequently highly destructive to  crops , fruit and shade trees, stored grain and flour, and other products.   Despite the fact that moths comprise the vast majority of the order Lepidoptera, adult moths are not as commonly seen as butterflies. This is because, while butterflies are active during the day, most moths are nocturnal, and spend the daylight hours resting on  tree bark , among leaves, and in secluded areas. Many of them have wing colors and patterns which help to camouflage them in their natural surroundings. Easily recognizable differences between adult butterflies and moths make it easy to distinguish them from one another. For example, butterfly antennae are clubshaped at their tips, while moth antennae taper to a point and frequently are feathery. A moth's body is short and stout and much more hairy than the relatively slender body of the butterfly. A resting butterfly has its wings folded together over its back, while the wings of a moth at rest are spread out. Although some moths are brightly colored, the majority are rather drab. The pupa of a moth lives either in a silk cocoon, or, if naked, hidden under debris or  rocks . In most butterflies, the pupa, called chrysalis, is naked and exposed. In flight, both moths and butterflies have the forewing and hind wing of each side coupled by a hooklike device. In size, as measured by the wing span, moths range from less than 0.8 in (25 mm) to over 12 in (30 cm). In a number of moth species, males and females differ in size,  color , characteristics of the antennae and of the mouth parts, and other features.   Of the more than 50 families of moths, the following are particularly noteworthy. The family Tineidae includes the clothes moths, whose larvae feed on woolens, furs, and other  textiles . Three major agricultural  pests  in the United States, the ""Angoumois grain moth"" (which destroys stored grain, especially corn), the  potato tuber  worm, and the pink bollworm (which damages the blossoms as well as the seed pods of the  cotton plant ) belong to the family Gelechiidae. Many of the common moths attracted to  light  at night are members of the family Tortricidae. The  spruce  budworm, which is a serious pest of pulpwood in  North America , also is included in this family. Pyralidae is a large family, with over 1,100       A cecropia moth larva ( Hyalophora cecropia ) in Royal Oak, Michigan.   Photograph by Robert J. Huffman. Field Mark Publications.

The European corn borer (which bores into corn stems), and the sod webworm (a pest of turf  grasses ) are among the most destructive members of this family. Also included here is the wax moth, whose larvae live in beehives and feed on beeswax. In some species in this family, adult moths have a pair of ""tympanic membranes"" capable of detecting the ultrasonic squeaks of  bats . One member of this family, the South American  cactus  moth  Cactoblastis cactorum , has been used successfully in biological control of the prickly pear cactus in  Australia . The cactus itself, soon after its introduction into Australia from the Americas, reproduced prolifically and became a major pest on millions of acres of agricultural land. Introduction into Australia of the South American cactus moth, whose larvae feed exclusively on the prickly pear, has almost completely eliminated the host plant. Hawk moths and sphinx moths (family Sphingidae) are large, with a proboscis that is longer than the body when uncoiled. They are strong fliers. The larvae of the sphinx moth, called hornworms, are pests of tomato and tobacco plants. Another large family, with approximately 1,200 North American species, is Geometridae. The larvae of geometrid moths are the familiar inchworms, which move by a ""looping"" movement, rather than by crawling, since they lack the prolegs on all but two abdominal segments. Inchworms feed on leaves of fruit and shade trees and on vegetable plants, and can be highly destructive. Moths in the family Saturniidae are among the largest and most colorful, with wing spans up to 12 in (30 cm), and large ""eyespots"" or other markings on the wings. The family Lasciocampidae includes the ""tent caterpillar"" moths. Their larvae, which hatch from eggs in early spring, construct silken communal ""tents"" on branches of the crab apple and certain other trees. Their feeding activity almost totally defoliates the host tree. One of the most beneficial and interesting moths is the commercial silkworm moth,  Bombyx mori , in the family Bombycidae. This moth, native to China, has been bred in captivity for thousands of years, and is the only example of an insect that has been completely ""domesticated,"" as it no longer exists in the wild. The larvae of the silkworm moth are ""fed"" mulberry leaves. The long domestication has led to the degeneration of the larva's prolegs, and hence to its inability to climb trees. The source of commercial silk is the cocoon of the pupa. In order to obtain the silk, the pupae have to be destroyed by immersion in hot  water , since allowing the adult moth to emerge from the cocoon would break the long, continuous silk thread. Noctuidae is a very large family, with over 3,000 North American species. Larvae of noctuid moths include such serious pests as cutworm and corn earworm. Cutworms are especially destructive of vegetable seedlings which they cut off just above the ground with their powerful mandibles. Tussock moths and gypsy moths belong to the family Lymantriidae. Tussock moth larvae cause extensive defoliation of Douglas fir  forests  in the Pacific Northwest, while the larvae of gypsy moths play a similar role in the destruction of deciduous trees in the northeastern United States.   Many adult moths are instrumental in pollinating flowers in the course of their feeding. Female moths produce and release into the environment a hormone which attracts males for mating. (Such  hormones , which exert their action outside the body of the  organism  are called ""pheromones."") Many  pheromones  have been chemically analyzed, and a few of them are now produced in the laboratory. Such products are increasingly used as bait which is placed in traps to attract and kill harmful insects, and thus to control their populations. A number of moth species are known to undertake seasonal migrations over long distances.                  Books   Borror, Donald J., and Richard E. White.

But the pesticide used to                        slow their spread, Bt, also kills the caterpillars of many                        butterfly species. Is it worth the risk?                                             Gypsy Moths & Bt:                           A Double Scourge                                                 By Arthur                          Pearson                         There is a crater on the moon named                          for Ettiene Leopold Trouvelot. Were he alive today, many                          people would like to send him there.                         In the late 1860s, French-born Trouvelot                          imported gypsy moth egg masses to his suburban Boston                          home, seeking to develop a disease-resistant silkworm                          and establish a commercial silk industry. With over a                          million caterpillars in cultivation, the escape of several                          gypsy moths was inevitable. The amateur lepidopterist                          eventually shifted his attention to astronomy and became                          famous for his detailed illustrations of the Sun and Venus.                          He was given a faculty position in astronomy at Harvard                          University before returning to France in 1882 — the                          same year the first gypsy moth outbreak occurred on the                          street where he lived in Medford, Massachusetts.                         Now established throughout the Northeast                          — from Ontario, Canada, to North Carolina, and well                          into several midwestern states — gypsy moths defoliate                          upwards of two million acres of hardwood forests every                          year. Gypsy moth larvae (caterpillars) cause the damage,                          not the adult moths. The caterpillars are polyphagous,                          which means they eat almost anything. They feast on three                          hundred different species of trees and shrubs, although                          their hardwood of choice is any kind of oak tree.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The mountain in the center of this photo has                                been nearly entirely defoliated by gypsy moths.                                Chicago Wilderness has not had a major outbreak,                                yet.  Photo by Tim Tigner, Virginia Dept.                                of Forestry, forestryimages.org.                                                                                                                                     During the 1980s, severe outbreaks                          in the Northeast resulted in vast tracts of defoliation,                          particularly in oak-dominated forests. Chris Bactel, Director                          of Collections and Grounds at the Morton Arboretum, recalls                          driving for fifty miles through a forested area near Johnstown,                          Pennsylvania, in 1986 and seeing not a single leaf except                          those on black walnut and tulip trees, two of the few                          species distasteful to gypsy moth caterpillars.                         The gypsy moth caterpillar's preference                          for oak trees could make it an especially unwelcome presence                          in northeastern Illinois. The Chicago Wilderness region's                          forests, including its globally rare oak savannas, already                          are suffering artificial succession caused by unchecked                          deer populations and the absence of fire. Invasive species                          such as buckthorn and green ash are choking out the oaks,                          and with them scores of other oak woodland-dependent plant                          and animal species. A major gypsy moth outbreak could                          further damage the region's woodlands, to say nothing                          of recreation areas and neighborhood streetscapes.                         Dr. F. William Ravlin, assistant director                          of the Ohio Agricultural, Research, and Development Center                          at Ohio State University, has studied gypsy moths for                          twenty years. He relates that in the Northeast, ""the                          composition of forests has changed as a result of the                          gypsy moth. In some cases the changes are ones that would                          have occurred naturally and the process is simply sped                          up. In other cases, natural succession is sort of 'reset'                          and a site may essentially begin all over again, with                          open areas succeeding to shrubs and on to small trees,                          etcetera."" Dr. Ravlin cautions that definitive statements                          about the effect of gypsy moths are difficult to make                          because of the number of factors involved and the differences                          between regions, yet indications are that tree species                          less susceptible to gypsy moths may eventually come to                          dominate wooded areas.                         If this were to hold true in Illinois,                          a gypsy moth outbreak could accelerate the loss of oak                          savannas. However, a number of Chicago Wilderness conservationists                          have been considering a different hypothesis. A paper                          published in the March 1997  Journal of Arboriculture                           estimates that in an outbreak situation, less than one-tenth                          of one percent of the total number of the Chicago region's                          trees would actually die due to gypsy moth defoliation.                          With such limited mortality, there is hope that defoliation                          will do little lasting harm to the region's forests. On                          the contrary, periodic gypsy moth outbreaks might even                          benefit the long-term health of the oak woodlands.                         Oak woodlands are disturbance-driven                          communities. In pre-settlement times, fire periodically                          swept through them, which allowed the rich diversity of                          plants and animals that depended on the open canopy structure                          to thrive. Since the suppression of fire, the region's                          oak woodlands have become overgrown and dark. Periodic                          gypsy moth defoliation, although temporarily unsightly,                          would allow extra light to reach the forest floor, mimicking                          some of the benefits of historical fires.                         But what actually will happen in Illinois                          has yet to be seen. Although gypsy moths have been present                          in the state at least since 1973, they have yet to wreak                          any major havoc. Part of the reason is that their reported                          occurrence in 46 of Illinois' 102 counties mostly has                          been isolated and minor, probably the result of ""hitchhikers.""                          Gypsy moths naturally expand their range very slowly because                          the adult female moths cannot fly. Geographic expansion                          is largely dependent upon the caterpillars, which, in                          search of additional food sources, launch themselves to                          the wind on silken threads — a process known as ""ballooning.""                          However, female moths, as if to make up for being earthbound,                          lay their egg masses on just about anything, including                          cars, trucks and RVs. This explains why isolated gypsy                          moth outbreaks have occurred in such far-flung destinations                          as Arkansas, California, Oregon, Utah, and Washington.                         The non-aided spread of gypsy moths                          into Illinois, however, was inevitable. As they ballooned                          their way out of Michigan's Upper Peninsula and became                          established in southeast Wisconsin by the early 1980s,                          their populations began to spike in northeastern Illinois.                          Still, the other reason significant gypsy moth damage                          has yet to occur is because the Illinois Department of                          Agriculture responded to gypsy moth ""hot spots""                          by spraying Btk.                         Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki,                           commonly known as Btk, is the cornerstone application                          in the National Gypsy Moth ""Slow the Spread""                          campaign. Conceding that the gypsy moth is all but impossible                          to eradicate, the campaign is a unified management strategy                          to slow gypsy moth expansion by nearly two-thirds each                          year. Funded by the federal government and implemented                          by designated state agencies, the campaign extends along                          the entire gypsy moth ""frontier"" — a transition                          zone between infested and non-infested areas that runs                          for 1,200 miles from North Carolina through northeastern                          Illinois, and into Michigan's Upper Peninsula.                         Btk is a naturally occurring bacterium.                          It contains a toxic protein that disrupts a caterpillar's                          digestive system. Harmless to humans, birds, mammals,                          and anything but leaf-eating caterpillars, Btk is one                          of hundreds of varieties of Bt, some of which are available                          through organic gardening suppliers to protect backyard                          vegetable gardens from destructive caterpillars. On a                          much larger scale, ""Bt corn"" — into which                          the toxic Bt gene has been spliced to protect commercial                          crops against the corn earworm — continues to cause                          heated debate over its impact on non-target lepidoptera                          such as the monarch butterfly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Gypsy moths are a temporary                                threat to trees — but Btk is a permanent threat                                to many rare native butterflies. The pipevine swallowtail                                (above) is found in this region only at 'Waterfall                                Glen, which was sprayed in May.

A recent study published by the Illinois Natural History                          Survey indicates that there may be one hundred different                          species of lepidoptera in northeastern Illinois whose                          larval stages coincide with that of the gypsy moth. Of                          these hundred different species, seventeen are considered                          conservative, which means that they require very specific,                          high quality natural areas. Ron Panzer, conservation biologist                          at Northeastern Illinois University and one of the state's                          leading experts on lepidoptera, noting the stated limitations                          of the study, estimates that there may in fact be as many                          as seventy conservative species in northeastern Illinois                          that could be impacted by Btk spraying.                         Stan Smith, Manager for Nursery and                          Quarantine Programs for the Illinois Department of Agriculture,                          acknowledges that any caterpillar that ingests Btk during                          the three to five days the treatment is effective in the                          field will die. However, available studies, though far                          from definitive, are less absolute. Lab test results on                          a limited number of species, published in 1998 in Environmental                          Entomology, revealed that most caterpillars in their early                          instars (stages of development) die, but that caterpillars                          in later instars are less susceptible.                         As for long-term effects of Btk spraying                          on populations of lepidoptera, there are again no definitive                          studies. However, based on his research at Illinois Beach                          State Park and elsewhere in the state, Dr. Panzer estimates                          that 80 percent of all insects on any one site are fairly                          common and widespread; and that four out of every five                          species, if temporarily exterminated from a site, probably                          would return and repopulate. But his concern, shared by                          many conservationists, is for that one in five species                          that probably won't return. ""99.9 percent of the                          Illinois landscape has been altered. What tiny percent                          of a percent remains in a quality natural state is exceptionally                          fragmented. Two-thirds of all conservative lepidoptera                          species are found on fewer than eight sites statewide.                          If we eliminate a conservative species from even one site,""                          Panzer says, ""how could it possibly return? It is                          likely gone from that site forever.""                         Doug Taron, Curator of Biology at                          the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum, raises as an example                          the pipevine swallowtail, whose host plant is the regionally                          rare Dutchman's pipe. In the collar counties, there is                          only one permanent colony of this butterfly, whose underwing                          is emblazoned with a ""c"" of seven golden suns                          upon a wash of metallic sky blue. The colony is located                          at Waterfall Glen Forest Preserve in DuPage County, which                          was sprayed with Btk in May. The potential loss of this                          limited species of butterfly is particularly disturbing                          to Taron and others concerned about biodiversity given                          the fact that the purpose of Btk spraying is not to eliminate                          gypsy moths.                          ""If all we can do is slow their                          spread, why not do it in a more benign way?"" he asked.                         More benign ways do exist in the form                          of natural pathogens. Nucleopolyhedrosis virus (NPV) frequently                          results in the total collapse of gypsy moth outbreaks.                          Entomophaga maimaiga (Em) is a fungus that is highly effective                          in wet conditions. However, both pathogens usually move                          into an area only after a major outbreak, and attempts                          to introduce them preemptively remain problematic. Gypcheck,                          a U.S. EPA-approved formulation of NPV, currently is difficult                          to produce, and therefore, according to the USDA, cost-prohibitive                          to manufacture in sufficient quantities. The only known                          way to import Em spores is to collect spore-containing                          soils or a sufficient number of infected gypsy moth caterpillar                          cadavers and spread them around trees in infested areas.                         One alternative treatment that has                          proved both practical and effective against low-level                          populations is the spraying of pheromone flakes, which                          inundates an area with the scent that female gypsy moths                          emit to attract a mate. With so much scent in the air,                          the males become confused and have difficulty locating                          a mate. Sensitive to the concerns about Btk, Stan Smith                          reports that of the roughly twenty-six thousand acres                          to be treated this year, 79 percent will be sprayed with                          pheromone flakes, with Btk being reserved for those pockets                          of high gypsy moth concentrations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Hairy gypsy moth caterpillars                                munch on a leaf. At right, gypsy moths lay masses                                of eggs on tree bark.   Caterpillar photo,                                USDA, forestryimages.org; moth photo by Ed Reschke.                                                                                                                                     But for most conservationists, even                          limited Btk use is too much if habitats of rare lepidoptera                          are not avoided. Panzer warns, ""It's the equivalent                          of risking 20 percent of our rarest bird species.""                          Dan Griffin, director of operations for the Forest Preserve                          District of DuPage County, worries about the cumulative                          effect of spraying for different pests. ""Say the                          mosquito abatement district sprays a wetland and kills                          all its mosquitoes to eliminate the one species of mosquito                          that carries the West Nile virus; then the nearby woodland                          is sprayed with Bt, and all the caterpillars are killed                          to slow the gypsy moth. What effect does that have on                          the entire food chain?""                         Unfortunately, no one can provide                          a definitive answer, and perhaps that is the real problem.                          Gypsy moths have been in the United States for nearly                          a century and a half, and in northeastern Illinois for                          thirty years, and still there is insufficient information                          regarding their impact and the effects of spraying with                          Btk. In the absence of definitive information, management                          decisions often have more to do with aesthetics and economics                          than ecology. Federal dollars are now available for newly                          invaded lands to keep unsightly defoliation from occurring,                          so they are being used.                         A number of Chicago Wilderness organizations                          will be studying the impact of Btk on local ecosystems.                          A new science task force considering alternative treatments                          will draw on invaluable data collected by the Butterfly                          Monitoring Network, a group of citizen scientists who                          have monitored local butterfly populations over the past                          fifteen years. Their data on local butterflies constitutes                          the only baseline information on many natural areas that                          were sprayed. These records will help biologists determine                          whether Btk has lasting impacts on the survival of rare                          lepidoptera. Chicago WILDERNESS will report on this data,                          and its implications for the future of the gypsy moth                          program, in future issues.                         But major outbreak or no major outbreak,                          gypsy moths will undoubtedly become a permanent part of                          the Chicago Wilderness region, and the gypsy moth ""frontier""                          will move on. So, too, will federal funding, leaving municipalities                          and counties to bear the cost of continued gypsy moth                          management. And given the inevitability of the gypsy moth                          infestation, do we truly want to risk wiping out many                          populations of rare butterflies and moths — and whatever                          specialized genes these populations may contain?

Idaho had just been admitted to the union in July.  As a new state, Idaho was in need of an official state seal.  Concurrent  Resolution No. 1, of the First Idaho Legislature, directed that a committee be formed to sponsor a design contest for  the seal and that a prize of $100.00 be awarded for the best design.  The First Legislature also agreed to identify  Syringa as the official state flower.    That summer, Emma Sarah Etine Edwards arrived in Boise to visit relatives.  A talented artist, Emma had  spent the previous year at art school in New York and was on her way home to California when she stopped in Idaho.  Emma fell in love with Boise and decided to stay, offering art instruction to the residents of the city.  Her talents  were substantial and she was invited to enter the state seal design contest.    Incorporated in her winning design of  The Great Seal of the State of Idaho   was the Syringa. In her design description, Emma notes the presence of the state flower.       ""The state flower, the wild Syringa or Mock Orange, grows at the woman's feet, while the ripened wheat grows as high as her shoulder.""      In 1893, a committee of Boise women, known as the Columbian Committee, selected Syringa to represent Idaho  at the World's Exposition in Chicago.    Though it was agreed to and commonly accepted that the Syringa was the state flower of Idaho, it was not  officially adopted until 1931.      AN ACT, DESIGNATING THE STATE FLOWER.    Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho:    Section 1.  That the Syringa (Philadelphus lewisii) is hereby desigated and declared to be the state flower of the State of Idaho.

During outbreaks they have been known to fly to ships in port and lay their eggs on the ships. Four to six weeks later, embryos develop into larvae.   The egg is the overwintering stage. After an acclimation stage, eggs can withstand freezing temperatures. The longer they are chilled in winter, the less heating is required for their hatch in spring.   Egg masses are buff colored when first laid but may bleach out over the winter months when exposed to direct sunlight and weathering. As the female lays them, she covers them with hair-like setae from her abdomen. Many individuals find these hairs irritating, and they may offer the eggs some protection. Egg masses contain from a couple of hundred to about 1200 eggs.     [ edit ]   Larvae of the gypsy moth   The hatching of gypsy moth eggs coincides with budding of most hardwood trees. Larvae ( caterpillars ) emerge from egg masses from early spring through mid-May.   Gypsy moths are dispersed in two ways. Natural dispersal occurs when newly hatched larvae hanging from host trees on silken threads are carried by the wind for a distance of up to about 1 mile, although most go less than 50 meters. Eggs can be carried for longer distances. Artificial dispersal occurs when people transport gypsy moth eggs thousands of miles from infested areas on cars and recreational vehicles, firewood, household goods, and other personal possessions. Females are flightless in most varieties, so these are the only means of spreading.          Gypsy moth caterpillar       Larvae develop into adults by going through a series of progressive  moults  through which they increase in size.  Instars  are the stages between each molt. Male larvae normally go through five instars (and females, six) before entering the pupal stage. Newly hatched larvae are black with long hair-like setae. Older larvae have five pairs of raised blue spots and six pairs of raised brick-red spots along their backs, and a sprinkling of setae.   During the first three instars, larvae remain in the top branches or crowns of host trees. The first stage or instar chews small holes in the leaves. The second and third instars feed from the outer edge of the leaf toward the center.   When population numbers are sparse, the movement of the larvae up and down the tree coincides with light intensity. Larvae in the fourth instar feed in the top branches or crown at night. When the sun comes up, larvae crawl down the trunk of the tree to rest during daylight hours. Larvae hide under flaps of bark, in crevices, or under branches - any place that provides protection. When larvae hide underneath leaf litter, mice, shrews, and  Calosoma  beetles can prey on them. At dusk, when the sun sets, larvae climb back up to the top branches of the host tree to feed. When population numbers are dense, however, larvae feed continuously day and night until the foliage of the host tree is stripped. Then they crawl in search of new sources of food.     [ edit ]   Pupae of the gypsy moth   The larvae reach maturity between mid-June and early July. They enter the pupal stage. This is the stage during which larvae change into adults or moths. Pupation lasts from 7 to 14 days. When the population is spread out and running low, pupation can take place under flaps of bark, in crevices, under branches, on the ground, and in other places where larvae rested. During periods when population numbers are dense, pupation is not restricted to locations where larvae rested. Pupation will take place in sheltered and non-sheltered locations, even exposed on the trunks of trees or on foliage of nonhost trees. Usually the caterpillars create flimsy cocoons made of silk strands holding the leaf together, while others do not cover their pupae in cocoons, but rather hang from a twig or tree bark, like butterfly pupae do.     [ edit ]   Adults of the gypsy moth          Adult white female gypsy moth       The brown male gypsy moth emerges first, flying in rapid zigzag patterns searching for females. The male gypsy moths are active throughout night and  even daytime as well , unlike most moths, which are only  nocturnal . When heavy, black-and-white egg-laden females emerge, they emit a chemical substance called a  pheromone  that attracts the males. After mating, the female lays her eggs in July and August close to the spot where she pupated. Then, both adult gypsy moths die. The European and most Russian forms of the gypsy moth have flightless females. Although they have large wings, the musculature is not developed. However, the Japanese gypsy moth females do fly and are attracted to lights.   Gypsy moths (at least of the introduced American population) fly all day and night, with the possible exception of the late morning. They are most active soon after dusk and in the latter hours of the night (Fullard & Napoleone 2001).     [ edit ]   North American Introduction of the gypsy moth          Older gypsy moth caterpillar in frontal view              Older gypsy moth caterpillar       The gypsy moth was introduced into the United States in 1868 by a French scientist,  Leopold Trouvelot , living in Medford, Massachusetts. The native silk spinning caterpillars were proving to be susceptible to disease. So Trouvelot brought over gypsy moth eggs to try to make a caterpillar hybrid, that could resist diseases. When some of the moths escaped from his lab, they found suitable habitat and started to multiply. Gypsy moth is now one of the most notorious pests of hardwood trees in the eastern United States.   The first outbreak there occurred in 1889. By 1987, the gypsy moth had established itself throughout the northeast USA and southern Quebec and Ontario. The insect has spread south into Virginia and West Virginia, and west into Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. Small, isolated infestations have also occurred sporadically in Utah, Oregon, Washington, California and British Columbia, but these have all been successfully eradicated.   Since 1980, the gypsy moth has defoliated over 1 million acres (4,000 km) of forest each year. In 1981, a record 12.9 million acres (52,200 km) were defoliated. This is an area larger than Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut combined. In wooded suburban areas, during periods of infestation when trees are visibly defoliated, gypsy moth larvae crawl up and down walls, across roads, over outdoor furniture, and even inside homes. During periods of feeding they leave behind a mixture of small pieces of leaves and frass, or excrement. During outbreaks, the sound of chewing and frass dropping is a continual annoyance. This phenomenon sounds eerily like a light to moderate rain. Gypsy moth populations usually remain at very low levels, but occasionally increase to very high levels which can result in partial to total defoliation of host trees for 13 years.     [ edit ]   Hosts of the gypsy moth   Gypsy moth larvae generally prefer  oaks , but may feed on several hundred different species of trees and shrubs, both hardwood and conifer. In the East the gypsy moth prefers oaks,  aspen ,  apples ,  sweetgum ,  speckled alder ,  basswood ,  gray  and  paper birch ,  poplars ,  willows , and  hawthorns , although other species are also affected. The list of hosts will undoubtedly expand as the insect spreads south and west. The gypsy moth avoids  ash trees ,  tulip-tree ,  American sycamore ,  butternut ,  black walnut ,  catalpa ,  flowering dogwood ,  balsam fir ,  cedar ,  American holly , and shrubs such as  mountain laurel  and  rhododendrons , but will feed on these in late instars when densities are extremely high. Older larvae feed on several species of hardwood that younger larvae avoid, including  cottonwood ,  hemlock ,  Atlantic white cypress , and the  pines  and  spruces  native to the East.     [ edit ]   Effects of defoliation on trees          A tree stripped by gypsy moth larvae              Aerial photo showing gypsy moth defoliation of  hardwood  trees along the  Allegheny Front  near  Snow Shoe, Pennsylvania  in July of 2007. The light green patches on hilltops are trees that had begun refoliating by the time this picture was taken.       The effects of defoliation depend primarily on the amount of foliage that is removed, the condition of the tree at the time it is defoliated, the number of consecutive defoliations, available soil moisture, and the species of host. If less than 50 percent of their crown is defoliated, most hardwoods will experience only a slight reduction (or loss) in radial growth. If more than 50 percent of their crown is defoliated, most hardwoods will refoliate or produce a second flush of foliage by midsummer. Healthy trees can usually withstand one or two consecutive defoliations of greater than 50 percent. Trees that have been weakened by previous defoliation or been subjected to other stresses such as droughts are frequently killed after a single defoliation of more than 50 percent. Trees use energy reserves during refoliation and are eventually weakened. Weakened trees exhibit symptoms such as dying back of twigs and branches in the upper crown and sprouting of old buds on the trunk and larger branches. Weakened trees experience radial growth reduction of approximately 30 to 50 percent. Trees weakened by consecutive defoliations are also vulnerable to attack by disease organisms and other insects. For example, the Armillaria fungus attacks the roots, and the two-lined chestnut borer attacks the trunk and branches. Affected trees will eventually die 2 or 3 years after they are attacked. Although not preferred by the larvae, pines and hemlocks are subject to heavy defoliation during gypsy moth outbreaks and are more likely to be killed than hardwoods. A single, complete defoliation can kill approximately 50 percent of the pines and 90 percent of the mature hemlocks. This is because conifers do not store energy in their roots; an exception is larch.     [ edit ]   Factors that affect gypsy moth populations   Natural enemies play an important role during periods when gypsy moth populations are sparse. Natural enemies include parasitic and predatory insects such as  wasps ,  flies ,  ground beetles , and  ants ; many species of  spider ; several species of birds such as  chickadees ,  blue jays ,  nuthatches ,  towhees , and  robins ; and approximately 15 species of common woodland mammals, such as the  white-footed mouse ,  shrews ,  chipmunks ,  squirrels , and  raccoons . Predation by small mammals (mice and shrews) is the largest source of mortality in low density gypsy moth populations and this mortality is apparently critical in preventing outbreaks.  Calosoma  (ground beetles of European origin),  cuckoos , and flocking birds, such as  starling ,  grackles , and  red-winged blackbirds , are attracted to infested areas in years when gypsy moth populations are dense. Diseases caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses contribute to the decline of gypsy moth populations, especially during periods when gypsy moth populations are dense and are stressed by lack of preferred foliage. Wilt disease caused by a particular  nucleopolyhedrosis virus  (LdNPV) that is specific to the gypsy moth is the most devastating of its natural diseases. NPV causes a dramatic collapse of outbreak populations by killing both the larvae and pupae. Larvae infected with wilt disease are shiny and hang limply in an inverted ""V"" position. Infection with NPV is the most common source of mortality in high density populations and NPV epizootics usually cause the collapse of populations. Since the 1980s, the fungus  Entomophaga maimaiga  has also had a large impact on gypsy moth populations in North America. Weather affects the survival and development of gypsy moth life stages regardless of population density. For example, temperatures of -20F, (-29C.) lasting from 48 to 72 hours can kill exposed eggs; alternate periods of freezing and thawing in late winter and early spring may prevent the over wintering eggs from hatching; and cold, rainy weather inhibits dispersal and feeding of the newly hatched larvae and slows their growth.     [ edit ]   Managing the gypsy moth   A number of tactics have the potential to minimize damage from gypsy moth infestations and to contain or maintain gypsy moth populations at levels considered tolerable. These tactics include monitoring gypsy moth populations, maintaining the health and vigor of trees, discouraging gypsy moth survival, and treating with insecticides to kill larvae and protect tree foliage. The tactic or combination of tactics used will depend on the condition of the site and of the tree or stand and the level of the gypsy moth population. Tactics suggested for homeowners are probably too costly and too labor intensive for managers to use in forest stands. The gypsy moth currently occupies less than 1/3 of its potential range in N. America and considerable resources are directed at minimizing the expansion of its range into these areas. Every year, over 100,000 pheromone traps are placed in uninfested portions of the US in order to detect new infestations that occasionally arise when people inadvertently transport life stages into uninfested areas (e.g., egg masses on recreational vehicles). When captures are positive for several consecutive years, this indicates that a population is establishing and these populations are eradicated, usually via the application of the bacterial pesticide,  Bacillus thuringiensis  ('Bt').     [ edit ]   Maintaining and enhancing the health of trees     Enhance growth conditions for isolated trees by encircling them with mulch or ground cover plants that do not compete for moisture and nutrients the way dense grass layers do.   Water shade and ornamental trees in periods of drought to maximize recovery during refoliation.   Fertilize shade trees.   Avoid stressing trees. For example, construction projects tend to compact soil and prevent moisture from penetrating to small feeder roots.   Avoid applying lime or weed killers around trees. These chemicals can seriously damage shallow tree roots.   Thin woodlot trees and groups of shade trees between outbreaks to reduce competition.       [ edit ]   Recent Appearances   California agriculture officials have quarantined a rural 5-square-mile section of Ventura County near Ojai to prevent spread of a newly found gypsy moth colony (see  http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/state/20081030-0527-ca-socal-mothquarantine.html ).     [ edit ]   Natural gypsy moth control   Gypsy moth larvae have several predators/parasites which can help decrease their population. Lack of predation is one reason they can go from a normal part of the ecosystem to an actual threat to trees. Among their predators are:     deer mice  -- are considered the most important predator of low-density gypsy moth populations and their abundance may be critical in deteriming whether populations go into an outbreak mode. Their abundance is strongly affected by the amount of mast (e.g., acorns) in the previous year.   tachinid flies  -- parasitize gypsy moth populations. While they may become quite abundant during a gypsy moth outbreak, they apparently have little effect on the population dynamics.   braconid wasps  -- also parasitize gypsy moths but play a minor role in their dynamics.     There is not any evidence that releasing or enhancing gypsy moth predators or parasites can reduce gypsy moth populations. Manual removal of gypsy moths may be a viable method for reducing damage on small, open-grown trees and shrubs.     [ edit ]   The use of pesticides against the gypsy moth   The decision to use pesticides is influenced by a number of factors:     The number of visible egg masses.   The percentage of preferred hosts in a mixed stand of trees (50 percent or more of oak).   Whether trees already have dead or dying branches, especially near the top branches or crown.   Whether the property is located adjacent to wooded areas heavily infested with gypsy moths.     During periods when numbers of gypsy moth larvae are dense, pesticides may be the most effective method of reducing the number of larvae and protecting the foliage of host trees. Application of pesticides should be done by a certified applicator, because special equipment is required. Large areas, such as wooded residential areas and forests, should be treated by aircraft.   Available pesticides fall into two broad groups: microbial or biological and chemical (table 1).   Microbial and biological pesticides contain living organisms that must be consumed by the pest. Microbials include bacteria, viruses, and other naturally occurring organisms; biologicals include manmade synthetics of naturally occurring organisms. These pesticides should be applied before the larvae reach the third stage or instar of development. As they mature, larvae become more resistant to microbial pesticides and are, therefore, more difficult to kill.   Low dose pheromone systems are being employed in some areas (Jersey, Channel Islands, UK) to flood areas with synthetic pheromone and effectively 'blind' males so they are unable to locate females.   Nucleopolyhedrosis  virus (NPV), a naturally occurring organism, has been developed as a microbial pesticide. It is presently registered under the name "" Gypchek "" and is available for use in  USDA  Forest Service sponsored suppression programs. NPV and Gypcheck are specific to the gypsy moth.   Bacillus thuringiensis  (Bt) is microbial and biological. It is the most commonly used  pesticide . In addition to being used against the gypsy moth, Bt is used against a number of other pests, including the  western spruce budworm  and other  Choristoneura , and  tent caterpillar . When Bt is taken internally, the insect becomes paralyzed, stops feeding, and dies of starvation or disease.   Chemical pesticides are contact poisons in addition to being stomach poisons. The timing of the chemical application is less critical to the successful population reduction of the pest than the timing of the application of the microbials and biologicals. Chemical pesticides can affect non-target organisms and may be hazardous to human health.   Table 1  -  Microbial and chemical pesticides commonly used for gypsy moth control       Active ingredient   Representative trade names   Remarks       Bacillus thuringiensis   Foray   Registered for aerial and ground application.

Carbaryl   Sevin   Registered for aerial and ground application. Available under a variety of trade names. Toxic to bees and gypsy moth parasites. At one time, the most widely used chemical in gypsy moth control programs.       Diflubenzuron   Dimilin   A restricted-use pesticide that can be applied only by certified applicators.       The most commonly used chemical pesticides currently registered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for use against the gypsy moth contain carbaryl, diflubenzuron, or acephate.  Malathion , methoxychlor, phosmet, trichlorfon, and synthetic pyrethroids ( permethrin ) have also been registered by EPA for control of gypsy moth, but are used infrequently.   Several studies done by  Peter G. Kevan  and associates of the University of Guelph, between 1975 and 1995 in eastern  Canada  have shown serious reduction in  blueberry  and other crop  pollination  due to  forest  aerial applications of  insecticides  that killed  non-target  wild  bees .   Diflubenzuron represents a new class of pesticides called insect growth regulators. It kills gypsy moth larvae by interfering with the normal molting process. Diflubenzuron has no effect on adult insects. Aquatic crustaceans and other immature insects that go through a series of molting stages are often sensitive to this pesticide.   Another very effective way to remove these pests is by fire. In most southern states, people use gasoline and fire to kill the pupae stage of the creature.     [ edit ]   Silvicultural guidelines for forest stands and woodlots   Several interrelated factors determine the vulnerability of forest stands and woodlots to gypsy moth defoliation. An awareness of these factors will enable land managers and woodlot owners to prescribe silvicultural actions that will minimize the impact caused by gypsy moth defoliation. Three of these factors include the abundance of favored food species (mainly oaks), site and stand factors, and tree conditions.   Stands of trees that are predominantly oak and grow on poor, dry sites (such as sand flats or rock ridges) are frequently stressed and often incur repeated, severe defoliations. Trees growing under these conditions frequently possess an abundance of structural features such as holes, wounds, and deep bark fissures that provide shelter and habitats for gypsy moth larvae and aid their survival.   Stands of trees that are predominantly oak but grow on protected slopes or on sites with adequate moisture and organic matter are more resistant to defoliation by the gypsy moth.   Slow-growing trees on poor sites frequently survive a single, severe defoliation better than fast-growing trees typically found on well-stocked better sites.   More trees are killed in stands that contain mainly oak species than in oak-pine or mixed hardwood stands. Subdominant trees are killed more rapidly and more often than dominant trees.     [ edit ]   Silvicultural treatmentwhat and when?   Appropriate silvicultural treatment will be determined by an anticipated occurrence of gypsy moth defoliation, by characteristics of the stand, and by the economic maturity of the stand. Foresters refer to treatments discussed here as ""thinnings."" Thinnings are cuttings made in forest stands to remove surplus trees (usually dominant and subdominant size classes) in order to stimulate the growth of trees that remain.   Predefollation treatments: When gypsy moth defoliation is anticipated, but not within the next 5 years, predefoliation thinning to selectively remove preferred-host trees can reduce the severity of defoliation, increase the vigor of residual trees, and encourage seed production and stump sprouting. Thinnings should not be conducted in fully stocked stands that will reach maturity within the next 6 to 15 years. Thinning results in a short-term ""shock effect"" to residual trees. This shock effect, coupled with defoliation-caused stress, renders trees vulnerable to attack by disease organisms such as Armillaria.   In fully stocked stands that will reach maturity within the next 16 or more years, two kinds of thinning can be applied. The method of thinning should depend on the proportion of preferred host species present.   If more than 50 percent of the basal area in a stand is preferred host species (mainly oaks), presalvage thinning should be applied. Presalvage thinning is designed to remove the trees most likely to die (trees with poor crown condition) from stress caused by gypsy moth defoliation.   If less than 50 percent of the basal area in a stand is in preferred host species, sanitation thinning can be applied to reduce further the number of preferred host trees. This will result in fewer refuges for gypsy moth larvae and in improved habitats for the natural enemies of the gypsy moth.   Treatment during outbreaks: If defoliation is current or is expected within the next 5 years, thinnings should be delayed because of potential ""shock effect."" High-value stands can be protected by applying pesticides. In low-value stands or those that are at low risk (less than 50 percent basal area in preferred host species), protective treatments are optional.   Post-outbreak treatments: After a defoliation episode, the land manager or woodlot owner should pursue efficient salvage of dead trees, but should delay decisions about additional salvage, regeneration, or other treatments for up to 3 years. At the end of 3 years, most defoliation-caused mortality will be complete and the need for treatments can be assessed on the basis of damage level, current stocking conditions, and stand maturity.

By  Marie Iannotti , About.com    See More About: raised beds garden tools garden styles garden design                 Raised bed gardening refers to gardening in soil that has been mounded or contained higher than the surrounding soil.  Raised bed gardening is an old gardening practice, but it’s currently growing in popularity again because it offers several advantages to simply growing your plants in level ground.    You Control the Soil    Obviously this will be good for your plants, since you can bring in the best garden soil.  Never walking on the soil means it will forever be light and aerated, not compacted.  It’s also good for the gardener because there is no tilling necessary!  And even if your local soil is the worst clay or rock, your raised garden bed will won’t need to be amended and worked every year.    More Vegetables and/or Flowers    You can squeeze more into a raised bed because you don’t need to leave room for paths.  You never walk in the beds, you just lean into them.  Keep this in mind when you’re building a raised bed and don’t make it any wide than you can reach.    Good Drainage    Ever hear the expression ‘well drained soil’?  Of course you have.  Because raised beds are elevated, the soil drains more rapidly than garden soil.  You can work in the spring, when your yard is still mud and rainy days won’t be lost days in the garden.  Of course this also means they can dry out faster, but raised beds are also easier to water than open gardens.   The smaller area is perfect for installing drip irrigation.  Even if you use a garden hose, you’ll be wasting less water and taking less time than watering traditional garden beds.    Critter Control    It’s much, much easier to keep burrowing animals out of a raised bed.  Just line the bottom of the raised bed with hardware cloth or chicken fencing.  Repellents can usually be sprayed just around the perimeter.   You can even cover the whole bed with bird netting.    Easy on the Back    Every inch the bed is raised is one less inch you’ll need to bend.  In fact, physically challenged gardeners and wheelchair gardeners can keep on gardening when beds are raised to a reachable height.  I can see raised beds getting higher as we get older.  Here’s a nice height  raised bed design  you can build yourself.    Building a Raised Bed    Raised beds are easy enough to construct.  The simplest raised beds are just four boards joined together in a square.  Cedar, redwood, the new pressure treated woods and even newer synthetic boards all weather well for several years.  You can even get resourceful and build your bed out of bales of hay, cinder blocks or whatever’s handy.  Or you can  buy a kit  that comes with everything you need to nail or pop your bed together.

I have had a hummingbird vine for roughly five years, and it has yet to flower. It vines all over my front porch. I trim it down, thinking it will flower. I have called the company I got it from, and they tell me nothing. I have been thinking of cutting it down and digging it up, but I want this vine to flower. Anything you can tell me will be greatly appreciated.         A. Hummingbird vine, aka trumpet creeper, or more specifically, Campsis radicans, is a vigorous, clinging vine that often grows well beyond where it is welcome, going to seed after flowering and spreading vegetatively as well. I get this question about lack of flowering every year, despite the fact that there are many trumpet creeper vines flourishing around the state with no care whatsoever! But it is not unusual for it to take five or more years to become mature enough to flower. Even then, you must be ruthless about cutting it back in late winter to keep it in bounds, removing no less than half of its size and, perhaps, even as severe as just a few remaining buds on the main trunk. Other than immaturity, other causes for lack of bloom could include overfertilizing with nitrogen and excessive shade.          Q. We planted two Blue Princess Holly bushes in the spring. When purchased, they were beautiful and full of berries. We planted them in shade -- they get shade all day. They have not grown and all the berries are gone. There are no berries for the fall. What went wrong? We did give them Miracle Grow and watered them when needed. I want to move them, but they would get sun all day in the only place we could move them to. I have noticed others planted in full sun that look great and have grown immensely. Please give us advice.          A. These princesses wouldn't be likely to put on very much top growth or new berries in the situation you've described. First, hollies can take light shade but are not likely to grow or flower well in full shade. Most hollies will do fine in full sun, especially if you can water as needed during their first year of establishment. Second, a princess needs a prince! Since hollies bear separate male and female flowers on separate plants, you'll need one male plant for the females to bear fruits. Plan on adding a ‘Blue Prince' to your collection.          Q. My daughter would like Calla Lilies for her wedding next April. Is it possible to plant the bulbs in flowerpots and force them to bloom early? If you can give me any ideas on how and when to do this I would greatly appreciate it.          A. Calla lily generally flowers in about 90 days after planting, given ideal growing conditions. Start hunting for your planting stock now, so you'll be able to get them started in time this winter. Plant them in well-drained, soilless potting mix, either one plant per 5-inch pot, or three plants per 8-inch pot, and place in medium light intensity near a sunny window but preferably not too much direct sun. They are best started in cool temperatures, about 60-65 F. Once they sprout, gradually increase the daytime temperatures to about 65-70 F, keeping them 5-10 degrees cooler at night.          Callas don't last long as cut flowers. To be sure you have something in bloom for the wedding, you'll want to start several plants a week or two apart. And, you might want to identify a source of cut flowers as a backup plan!          Q. I read your recent reply regarding hydrangeas and confirm that Endless Summer is no different than the others. This is the first full year I have had one, and it didn't flower or grow much either. How can my area in Wheatfield, Ind., be so different than northern Illinois? I don't get it. Even a cover of leaves all the way to the top didn't help matters. It is a lovely shrub of large green leaves, I have to admit. But it's still not fair.          A. Didn't someone once say that ALL is fair in love and gardening? I can empathize; here it is the end of summer and still not even one bloom on my ‘Endless Summer,"" no flower buds in sight. While it's still just a guess, I have to blame this on a combination of the really hard freeze in April, followed by extremely dry conditions of late spring and much of summer. Some say that it can take 3-5 years for ""Endless Summer"" to get established and flower reliably. It did flower just fine for me the last two years, so I remain hopeful that it will make a comeback next season!                                                   Back          to Columns                                                     Writer:                B.

The gypsy moth,  Lymantria dispar , is one of North America's most devastating forest pests.  The species originally evolved in    Europe and Asia  and has existed there for thousands of years. In either 1868 or 1869, the gypsy moth was accidentally introduced near Boston, MA by   E. Leopold Trouvelot . About 10 years after this introduction, the first outbreaks began in Trouvelot's neighborhood and in 1890 the State and Federal Government began their attempts to eradicate the gypsy moth.  These attempts ultimately failed and since that time, the range of gypsy moth has continued to    spread .  Every year,   isolated populations  are discovered beyond the contiguous range of the gypsy moth but these populations are   eradicated  or they disappear without intervention. It is inevitable that gypsy moth will   continue to expand its range in the future .   The gypsy moth is known to feed on on the foliage of hundreds of species of plants in North America but its most common hosts are oaks and aspen.  Gypsy moth hosts are   located through most of the coterminous US  but the highest concentrations of host trees are in the southern Appalachian Mtns., the Ozark Mtns., and in the northern Lake States.   Gypsy moth populations are typically eruptive in North America; in any forest stand densities may fluctuate from near 1 egg mass per ha to over 1,000 per ha. When densities reach very high levels, trees may become completely  defoliated.  Several successive years of   defoliation  , along with contributions by other biotic and abiotic stress factors, may ultimately result in   tree mortality .  In most northeastern forests, less than 20% of the trees in a forest will die but occasionally  tree mortality may be very heavy.     Forest Effects     Despite over 100 years of presence in North America, researchers are still at a loss to explain and predict  the extent of the changes in forest vegetation likely to take place through gypsy moth disturbance.  A major  concern is the potential loss of economically critical and ecologically dominant oak species (Quercus, spp.).  Most studies of  forest compositional changes with gypsy moth defoliation indicate that less susceptible  species will dominate the forest, so in effect, forests may have fewer gypsy moth problems in the future.   Natural Enemies     A variety of   natural agents  are known to kill gypsy moths in nature. These agents include over 20 insect parasitoids and predators that were introduced over the last 100 years from Asia and Europe.    Small mammals  are perhaps the most important gypsy moth predator, especially at low population densities.  Birds are also known to prey on gypsy moths but at least in North America this does not substantially affect populations.  A nucleopolyhedrosis   virus  usually causes the collapse of outbreak populations and recently an entomopathogenic   fungus  species has caused considerable mortality of populations in North America.      Management:     Over the last 20 years, several millions of acres of forest land have been aerially sprayed with pesticides in order to   suppress  outbreak gypsy moth populations. Though some areas are treated by private companies under contract with land owners, most areas are sprayed under joint programs of state governments and the USDA Forest Service.  Your local   extension service  can provide more detailed information about programs in your area.   The USDA, State and local governments also jointly participate in programs to locate and    eradicate  new gypsy moth populations in currently   uninfested areas .  Most of these projects focus on populations of European origin, but recently several    Asian  populations have been discovered and eradicated in the US and Canada.   In 1992, the USDA Forest Service began a pilot program to test the feasibility of slowing the spread (STS) of the gypsy moth in North America.    STS pilot programs  currently exist in North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, and Michigan.     Research:    The gypsy moth has been intensively studied over the last 100 years in North America.  Currently there are numerous groups around the country investigating various aspects of the biology, ecology, and management of the gypsy moth.  This work is funded by the USDA Forest Service, the USDA Agricultural Research Service, the USDA Cooperative State Research Service, the USDA Animal and Plant Health and Inspection Service, and numerous state and private Universities.
