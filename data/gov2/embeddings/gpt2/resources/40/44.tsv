GX049-45-11141524	"LITTLE BIGHORN BATTLEFIELD   National Monument                                 The Annihilation of Custer      No man can know with certainty how Custer's battalion, met its fate, for no member of it survived. From the confused and contradictory accounts of the Indian participants and from the placement of the bodies on the battlefield, the movements of the contending forces can be roughly reconstructed. But the details of the action, together with Custer's intentions and the factors which shaped them, must ever remain a mystery.    Major Reno had expected Custer to follow him into battle. Why Custer instead turned north from Reno's trail may only be surmised. He may not have intended to provide support in the way Reno expected, or he may have intended to but changed his mind when Adjutant Cooke brought word that the Indians were advancing to meet Reno. It may only be surmised, too, what Custer hoped to accomplish by his northward march. Did he plan to fall on the enemy's rear as Reno engaged the front? Or was he still obsessed with the fear that the Sioux would escape and took this means to block their route? Or did he entertain both thoughts? It should be borne in mind that, although warned by his scouts of unexpectedly large numbers of Indians in his front, Custer had not yet seen any part of the great village and knew with certainty no more of its size and location than suggested by the dust clouds toward which he now turned.    Shortly after taking the new direction of march, Custer sent Sgt. Daniel Kanipe back on the trail to find Captain McDougall and tell him to hasten forward with the ammunition mules. After a gallop of a mile or so, the battalion paused while Custer rode to the crest of the bluff. Tepees carpeted the valley below—it was his first view of the Indian village—and Reno was probably just going into action. Resuming the march, the column started down a long ravine emptying into Medicine Tail Coulee. During the descent, Custer summoned his orderly, Giovanni Martini, and sent him with another message for Benteen. Adjutant Cooke scrawled it on a page torn from his memorandum book: ""Benteen. Come on. Big Village. Be Quick. Bring packs.W.W. Cooke. P.S. Bring pacs.""    As Martini galloped back up the trail, he saw the battalion turn toward the river. Martini's glimpse is history's last view of Custer and his 215 cavalrymen in life. Whether part or all of them reached the river at the mouth of Medicine Tail Coulee is not known. If Custer intended to cross the river, here was a likely place one in fact that would have placed him right in the center of the Indian camp.    But hordes of Sioux warriors under Chief Gall poured across the stream at this ford and, either near the mouth of Medicine Tail Coulee or farther back on the slope dividing it from Deep Coulee, collided with the troops. Deflected to the right, the battalion fought successive rearguard actions toward a long ridge to the north. More warriors forded the river behind Gall. Others crossed still farther down. And Crazy Horse started down the valley with another large force, crossed the river, and swept round in a great arc that brought him ultimately to the battle ridge from the north.        Custer's Last Battle.  (click on image for an enlargement in a new window)    Caught in rough terrain unsuited to mounted action and surrounded by overwhelming numbers of Sioux and Cheyenne warriors, the battalion swiftly disintegrated. The companies seem to have made individual stands, fighting on foot against the waves of Indians that rolled in from every direction. L Company, commanded by Custer's brother-in-law, Lt. James Calhoun, spread over the south end of the battle ridge. Capt. Myles Keogh and Company I were overrun on the east slope of the ridge. On the west, near the river, C and E Companies, under Capt. Thomas W. Custer and Lt. A. E. Smith, slipped into a deep ravine and were crushed. Company F, Capt. George W. Yates, straddled the center of the ridge, And at the north end, where Crazy Horse cut off further retreat, a knot of about 50 men gathered around Custer and his red and blue personal pennant, shot their horses for breastworks, and made their ""last stand.""    The fight probably opened shortly after 4 p.m., just as Reno reached the refuge of the bluffs. Probably by 5 p.m. not a man of Custer's battalion remained alive. (Today white marble headstones dot the battle ridge and its slopes. They show where the cavalrymen fell under the irresistible onslaught of the Sioux and Cheyenne warriors. How must be left largely to the imagination.)

Yosemite Planning Page          Chapter I: Purpose and Need    Introduction    History of Cascades Diversion Dam    Cascades Diversion Dam (dam) is located on the main stem of the Merced Wild and  Scenic   River  in  Yosemite   National   Park  at an elevation of 3,800 feet near the intersection of  El Portal Road  and  Big Oak Flat Road  (figure I-1). Cascades Diversion Dam was constructed in 1917 to divert the flow of the main stem of the  Merced River  into a hydroelectric generating facility. The dam itself consists of “cribs” formed by logs or square timbers spiked together. These cribs were then filled with boulders and rocks and were anchored by concrete facing roughly 18 feet below the crest of the dam. The cribs were sheathed with rough-hewn redwood boards, which are visible during periods of low water. The dam spans 184 feet across, with a crest height of about 17 feet, flanked by 30-foot-high concrete abutments. While in operation, the hydroelectric generating facility provided a maximum output of 2,000 kilowatts [1]  of electricity. The hydroelectric facility was taken off line in 1985 and 1986 because it was deteriorated and outdated. Turbines and other equipment were removed from the powerhouse, and the majority of the penstock was removed.     Some elements of the former hydroelectric generating facility still remain, including abutments that flank the dam, an intake structure, a screenhouse, 300 feet of concrete penstock (which historically conveyed water from the dam to the powerhouse), the powerhouse, and the transmission lines. Today the powerhouse is used as a transfer facility from Pacific Gas and Electric Company transmission lines to National Park Service transmission lines. The dam, abutments, intake structure, and screenhouse remain as they were when decommissioned in 1986.    As part of the decommissioning of the hydroelectric facility, the National Park Service determined that Cascades Diversion Dam and ancillary facilities would be removed. Dam removal was to occur in 1999 but was halted until an approved comprehensive management plan for the Merced Wild and  Scenic    River  was completed. A record of decision on the  Merced Wild and Scenic River Comprehensive Management Plan  and its  Final Environmental Impact Statement  was signed in August 2000 and later revised in November 2000.    Cascades Diversion Dam and intake structure with screens were determined to be eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 (NPS 1982). The National Park Service has completed all cultural resource compliance procedures required under the National Historic Preservation Act for removal of the dam and associated features (NPS 1987b). Refer to Chapter VI, Consultation and Coordination, for a history of environmental compliance related to Cascades Diversion Dam.               FIGURE I-1 – PROJECT LOCATION              Purpose Of and Need For the Project    Purpose Of the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project    The purpose of the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project is to remove an unnatural obstruction on the  Merced River  and to restore the river’s natural free-flowing condition. This removal project is consistent with the Wild and Scenic River guidance provided in the  Merced Wild and Scenic River Comprehensive Management Plan  (Merced River Plan) (NPS 2001a) and will meet the direction of the  Yosemite Valley Plan  (NPS 2000a), which calls for the dam’s removal.    Need For the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project    Cascades Diversion Dam is classified as a high-hazard structure (USBR 1997). It is in unsatisfactory condition due to flood damage sustained in 1997 and to continuing deterioration associated with age. In addition, the dam no longer serves a useful purpose – water is not diverted from the site to generate electricity or for other uses, and the impoundment does not regulate high water. Removal of the existing dam structure is necessary to prevent possible uncontrolled and sudden failure, which could result in a release of impounded water and the deposition of concrete and timber debris, grouted rockfill, and impounded sediment along the downstream channel. Such an occurrence could pose a considerable threat to valued resources (such as aquatic life, scenic vistas, and recreational opportunities), infrastructure ( El Portal   Road , wastewater, telephone, and electrical lines), and human life.    In addition, the National Park Service is entrusted with conserving and restoring park values. This responsibility includes protecting the biological and physical processes that created the park, along with scenic features, natural landscapes, and native plants and wildlife. The removal of the dam would work toward fulfilling this mandate by restoring this segment of the  Merced  River .    Planning Context    Relationship to  Yosemite   National   Park  Plans    Planning in  Yosemite    National Park  takes two different forms: general management planning and implementation planning. General management plans are required for national parks by the National Park and Recreation Act of 1978.    The purpose of a general management plan is to set a “clearly defined direction for resource preservation and visitor use” (NPS 1998) and provide general directions and policies to guide planning and management in the park. The  General Management Plan  is the overall planning document for  Yosemite    National Park .    The Merced River Plan is a general management plan that guides management of the Merced Wild and Scenic Corridor. In designating the Merced River as a Wild and Scenic River, Congress authorized the National Park Service to prepare a management plan for the river by making appropriate revisions to the park’s  General Management Plan  (16 United States Code 1274[a][62]). The Merced River Plan, which amended the  General Management Plan  in certain respects, provides a framework for decision-making on future management actions within the Merced Wild and  Scenic    River  corridor. The Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project complies with conditions outlined in the Merced River Plan.    Implementation plans, which tier off of the  General Management Plan  and Merced River Plan, focus on “how to implement an activity or project needed to achieve a long-term goal” (NPS 1998). Implementation plans may direct specific projects as well as ongoing management activities or programs, and provide a more extensive level of detail and analysis. The  Yosemite Valley Plan  is an implementation plan that presents a comprehensive management plan for Yosemite Valley. The  Yosemite Valley Plan  guides protection of natural and cultural resources, opportunities for high-quality resource-based visitor experience, reduction of traffic congestion, and effective park operations. The Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project would implement an action called for in the  Yosemite Valley Plan .     Regulations and Policies    The Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental Assessment is written within a complex set of regulations, policies, and approved plans. The project must not only comply with requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, but it must do so within the parameters of other legislation (see Appendix A, Regulations and Policies) that govern land use within  Yosemite   National   Park .    National Park Service Organic Act    In 1916, the Organic Act established the National Park Service in order to “promote and regulate the use of parks…” and defined the purpose of the national parks as “to conserve the scenery and natural and historic objects and wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.” This legislation provides overall guidance for the management of  Yosemite   National   Park .     The Prohibition on Impairment of Park Resources and Values    The Organic Act establishes the management responsibilities of the National Park Service. While Congress has given the National Park Service the management discretion to allow certain impacts within parks, that discretion is limited by the statutory requirement that park resources and values be left unimpaired, unless a particular law directly and specifically provides otherwise. This cornerstone of the Organic Act establishes the primary responsibility of the National Park Service. It ensures that park resources and values will continue to exist in a condition that allows the American people to have present and future opportunities to enjoy them. National Park Service  Management Policies 2001  provides additional guidance on impairment of park resources and values.    Management Goals    Management goals identify long-range direction for  Yosemite    National Park . Any proposed project must carefully balance multiple goals, especially in a park as large and complex as  Yosemite   National   Park . This section presents the goals set forth in  Yosemite ’s  General Management Plan , the Merced River Plan, and  Yosemite Valley Plan .     General Management Plan Goals    The  General Management Plan  for  Yosemite    National Park  sets forth five broad goals for management of the park as a whole. These goals include:              Reclaim priceless natural beauty           Allow natural processes to prevail            Promote visitor understanding and enjoyment            Markedly reduce traffic congestion           Reduce crowding      Merced River  Plan Goals    While the Merced River Plan adopts the five broad goals from the  General Management Plan , it also outlines an additional set of goals for management of the Merced Wild and  Scenic    River . The main stem and South Fork of the  Merced River  were designated by Congress in 1987 for protection under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. The National Park Service developed the five goals of the Merced River Plan to further the policy established by the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, namely to preserve designated rivers in their free-flowing condition, and protect and enhance the river’s Outstandingly Remarkable Values. The Merced River Plan goals include:              Protect and enhance river-related natural resources           Protect and restore natural hydrological and geomorphic processes           Protect and enhance river-related cultural resources           Provide diverse river-related recreational and educational experiences           Provide appropriate land uses      The Merced River Plan applies seven management elements to prescribe desired future conditions,  typical visitor activities and experiences, and park facilities and management activities allowed in the river corridor. The management elements as they relate to Cascades Diversion Dam are discussed in Chapter V, Merced Wild and  Scenic    River . The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act Section 7  determination is included in Appendix B, Merced Wild and Scenic River Section 7 Determination.    Yosemite Valley  Plan Goals    The  Yosemite Valley Plan  carries forward the goals of the  General Management Plan . In addition, the  Yosemite Valley Plan  identifies four specific purposes of the plan. These include:              Restore, protect, and enhance the resources of  Yosemite  Valley           Provide opportunities for high-quality, resource-based visitor experiences           Reduce traffic congestion           Provide effective park operations, including employee housing, to meet the mission of the National Park Service      The  Yosemite Valley Plan  also identifies criteria for accomplishing the broad goals of the  General Management Plan  in  Yosemite  Valley  and the specific purposes of the  Yosemite Valley Plan . The criteria include:              Protect and enhance natural and cultural resources           Enhance visitor experience           Provide effective operations           Provide appropriate land uses      Issues and Concerns    The following issues were raised during the public scoping process conducted for this project (see Chapter VI, Consultation and Coordination) and by National Park Service staff. These issues are addressed in the analysis presented in Chapter IV, Environmental Consequences. Chapter II, Alternatives includes a description of issues and concerns that are addressed in other park plans as well as those that are beyond the scope of this project.    Natural Resources    Geomorphology/Hydrology    Cascades Diversion Dam has affected the natural flow, sediment deposition, and natural processes of the  Merced River  for over 80 years, altering the shape and nature of the river. The dam, in concert with other facilities, has disrupted the natural river processes and the functional relationship between the river and upland communities. These issues are addressed in the natural resources analyses presented in Chapter IV, Environmental Consequences.    Sedimentation, both during removal and over the long term after dam removal, has the potential to affect (either beneficially or negatively) downstream resources, including riparian habitats, fish and wildlife, swimming holes, beaches, and sandbars. Chapter II, Alternatives, and the natural resources analyses presented in Chapter IV, Environmental Consequences, address the question of whether to completely remove sediments behind the dam or to let natural river processes prevail. Public comment indicated that the type and percentages of sediment impounded by the dam should be discussed and potential disposal sites disclosed. These issues are addressed in Chapter II, Alternatives and in the natural resources analyses presented in Chapter IV, Environmental Consequences.    Concerns were raised that dam removal would have the potential to increase turbidity and decrease water quality of the  Merced  River , and that the project should include best management practices to avoid or minimize such effects. This issue is addressed in Chapter II, Alternatives and in the natural resources analysis presented in Chapter IV, Environmental Consequences.    Fish, Wildlife, and Plant Habitat    The  Merced River  corridor supports diverse aquatic and riparian habitats for plant and wildlife species. Natural habitats at the dam site have been altered by facilities and decades of human use. Concerns were expressed that dam removal should be designed to improve the environment and  to avoid long-term adverse effects to the  Merced River . Concern was also raised that uncontrolled  dam failure could affect riparian habitat. These issues are addressed in Chapter II, Alternatives, and in the natural resources analyses presented in Chapter IV, Environmental Consequences.    The upstream impoundment created by the dam may contain species specialized to this slow-moving water environment. Dam removal would alter the existing local ecosystem, returning the area to a more natural state. Concerns were raised that species adapted to the impoundment could be adversely affected by the proposed action. This issue is addressed in the natural resources analyses presented in Chapter IV, Environmental Consequences.    Air Quality    Yosemite   National   Park  is a Class 1 airshed (under the Clean Air Act) and therefore must maintain the highest standard of air quality. Dam-removal-related vehicle trips may temporarily affect local air quality. This issue is addressed in the air quality analysis presented in Chapter IV, Environmental Consequences.    Cultural Resources    Archeological Sites    As home to American Indians for thousands of years, the  Merced  River  corridor is rich with archeological sites, both historic and prehistoric. Prehistoric sites are important for their research value and as a tangible link to the heritage of culturally associated American Indian people. Historic sites can provide information important to understanding past land use and management. Over the years, some of these sites have been eroded by river meandering or covered by river sediments. Facilities along the riverbanks have affected many of these sites. Some historic archeological sites, such as dumps, have been exposed; while these sites have scientific and interpretive value, they also pose environmental and public health hazards. This issue is addressed in the cultural resources analyses presented in Chapter IV, Environmental Consequences.    Ethnographic Resources    Yosemite   National   Park  is part of a living tradition for local American Indian groups. Many places along the river corridor are important for traditional cultural uses and practices, including the gathering of plant materials for food, basketry, and other uses, and the conduct of traditional ceremonies. Many of these places and access to them have been affected by visitor use and park development. Ethnographic resources are addressed in Chapter III, Affected Environment.    Historic Structures and Cultural Landscapes    Historically significant structures and landscapes exist throughout the  Merced River  corridor. Cascades Diversion Dam is a historic structure, but one that restricts the free-flowing condition of the  Merced River . Historic structures and cultural landscapes are addressed in Chapter III, Affected Environment.    Social Resources    Transportation    Cascades Diversion Dam is situated at one of the busiest intersections in the park, at  El Portal Road  and  Big Oak Flat Road . Roadside parking provides informal recreational access to areas used for such activities as sightseeing, photography, and fishing. Measures may be necessary to manage transportation and access during dam removal. Concern was also raised that uncontrolled dam failure could affect  El   Portal Road . These issues are addressed in the transportation analysis presented in Chapter IV, Environmental Consequences.    Scenic Resources    The  Merced River  offers beautiful views of the river itself and of the surrounding landscape. Although unnatural, the dam provides an interesting view of the calm impoundment upstream and the downstream rushing cascades of the gorge. This issue is addressed in the scenic resources analysis presented in Chapter IV, Environmental Consequences.    Recreation    Sightseeing, photography, and nature study are among the recreational activities available within the area of Cascades Diversion Dam. These activities may be temporarily affected during dam removal. Concern was also raised that uncontrolled dam failure could affect downstream recreational uses. These issues are addressed in the recreation analysis presented in Chapter IV, Environmental Consequences.    Other Issues: Planning Processes and Management    Plans and Policies    The Merced River Plan (NPS 2001a) identifies management zoning and management elements specific to the corridor of the  Merced  River . Implementation of the proposed action must conform with adopted goals and elements. This issue is addressed in Chapter V, Merced Wild and  Scenic   River .    Conflicts Between Protection of Natural Landscapes and Cultural Landscapes    The protection of one type of resource can sometimes involve actions that may be detrimental to other resources. For example, removal of Cascades Diversion Dam would affect the historic landscape of  Yosemite  Valley ’s hydroelectric generating facility, but would restore the free-flowing condition of the  Merced River .     Relationship between the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project and the El Portal Road Improvement Project – Cascades Diversion Dam to  Pohono    Bridge    There has been considerable public interest in the possible future realignment of  El Portal Road  between the  El Portal Road/Big Oak Flat Road  intersection and  Pohono   Bridge . The National Park Service intends to remove Cascades Diversion Dam, let natural processes prevail through this reach of the  Merced River , and allow the river to stabilize prior to planning, designing, or implementing any proposed future improvement to this segment of  El   Portal Road . Potential future designs would comply with the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, as well as other legislation and park planning documents and would be subject to public input and review. Although the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project is completely distinct from this proposed future action, the road improvement project is included in the cumulative impact analysis in this document (see Appendix E, Projects Included in the Cumulative Impact Analysis).    Organization of the Cascades  Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental Assessment    The preferred and alternative plans for removal of Cascades Diversion Dam and the evaluation of potential impacts of these alternatives are integrated in this document and will be referred to collectively as the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental Assessment. The contents of this document are as follows:              Chapter I, Purpose and Need – The first chapter includes a discussion of the project’s purpose and need, planning context, relationship to management goals and objectives, and the scope of this environmental assessment.

Courtesy of Lowell National Historical Park.                               48          The Lowell National Historical Park, on the banks of the Merrimack River in Massachusetts, is one of many sites in the United States where the Industrial Revolution produced a new way of life for American women.  In the 1820s, the Boston Association harnessed the power of the Merrimack river and built a series of mills and canals.  By 1850, there were almost six miles of canals, 40 mill buildings, 320,000 spindles, and more than 10,000 workers.  During that period the farmers of the newly settled west surpassed the New England farmers in productivity and the Boston Association tapped into that willing workforce.  ""Mill Girls,"" 18 to 35-year old women from rural farm families, were recruited and brought to Lowell to run spinning machines, looms, and dressers. The girls signed yearly contracts, lived in corporation owned and operated boardinghouses, such as the 1830s Boott corporation boardinghouse block.  These young unmarried women worked 16-hour days, 6 days a week, with mandatory church services on Sunday and were paid once a month, earning $12 to $14 dollars.  After paying $5 for room and board, the women had a disposable income of their own.  The ""Mill Girls"" also formed an early labor organization-Lowell Female Labor Reform Association (LFLRA), and with mill worker Sarah Bagley petitioned the state legislature for a 10-hour workday.  Most of the young women stayed for an average of three years, eventually leaving for marriage, a move west, or a job with better conditions.  The era of the ""Mill Girls"" slowly came to an end in the mid-19th century with the influx of Polish, Irish and other immigrants willing to work for lower wages. Today, the Lowell National Historical Park uses the backdrop of historic mills and factories to interpret the early history of the women and men who worked and lived during America's Industrial Revolution.             The Visitor Center is open year round 9am until 5pm. The Boott Cotton            Mills Museum and Working People Exhibit hours vary by season.

Mr. Pitcairn, state how many years you have been superintendent of the Western Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad.  A.  For nearly 25 years since the last time I came on.   I had charge of the region one or two years before; I have been on the mountain division since 1853.    Q.  State if you please, at what time, as near as you can tell, you became acquainted with the location of what is known as the South Fork dam?  A.  I remember the South Fork dam since 1853, but became interested in it while temporarily in charge of the Pittsburgh Division, in 1862 when it broke.    Q.  You recollect the year the dam broke?  A.  I think it was in 1862.    Q.  Was the dam or reservoir owned at that time by the Pennsylvania Railroad?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  It was known as the Conemaugh feeder of the canal?  A.  I believe so.    Q.  What effect had the water, if any, in 1862 when it broke, on they [sic] valley of the Conemaugh from South Fork dam to Johnstown?  A.  It  damaged the abutments of the South Fork bridge, and I think somewhat damaged No. 6 bridge, and I think somewhat damaged No. 6 bridge, and washed our tracks away slightly; very little damage altogether? [sic]    Q.  Do you recollect what was the swell of the water in height from the dam when it broke?  A.  I couldn't say personally.  The water was very high at South Fork, but dispersed itself.    Q.  Well, comparing that with the flood of water that came from it the last time, was the last flood a much greater volume of water than the other?  A.  I should judge that the flood in the North Fork was higher then the dam breaking in 1862.    Q.  Did the Pennsylvania Railroad Company ever rebuild that dam?  A.  No, sir.    Q.  What became of the property after the dam broke?  A.  It was sold to John Reilly.  He took up the pipe, for the purpose of which he bought it, and sold the pipe.    Q.  What pipe do you allude to?  A.  The pipe that conveyed the water from the dam to Johnstown to the canal.    Q.  That pipe was owned by the state, and put in there?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  It was motal , was it?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  The purpose of that pipe being put there was to get the water out of the reservoir in summer season and fill the canal at Johnstown?  A.  Yes, sir, it was to fill the canal during dry weather    Q.  Do you know to whom Mr. Reilly sold the property?  A.  (H)e sold the property to Mr. Ruff and some other genleman [sic].    Q.  Do you recollect about what time the sale took place?  A.  It was about '78.    Q.  Go on and state now what you did in relation to keeping up your knowledge of the dam; whether you visited it, and if so, the purpose of your visit.  A.  The first information that I had on the matter was on the commencement of the rebuilding of the dam; when it was about nearing completion, there were rumors that the dam leaked.  I called the attention of Mr. Ruff to the subject, visited there a\ [sic] number of times, sent the supervisor and his assistant up there a number of times, went there with the supervisor and assistant, and with Mr. Ruff thoroughly went over the work, and the only point that we were afraid of, was the leaks at the bottom of the dam increasing.     Q.  At this point, let me  ask you if Col. Ruff was a civil engineer and contractor?  A.  He was a contractor; he was not an engineer but from his own evidence, he was better than any engineer.    Q.  Well, he was familiar with construction work, was he?  A.  He had done a great deal of construction work in his time.    Q.  What was the character of it?  Embankment work, railroad work, etc?  Was he reputed to be an expert in his business, and faithful in his duties?  A.  (H)e was a man who had a good reputation as a contractor, as (b)eing good safe work, a thoroughly competent man, and one who enjoyed the confidence of railroad men generally.   Mr. Ruff at that interview, promised to make everything safe, increase the strength of the breast, use horse manure and all the material suggested to him to stop the leaks, and expressed it as his opinion that the leaks did not come from the breast of the dam, but from springs on the west side,  I instructed the supervisor----    Q.  At what point?  A.  Of the division between Altoona and Conemaugh, to see that Mr. Ruff did the work as he promised, to send his assistant up there at least once a week, and to report when it was done He [sic] reported that the work had been done, when I sent the Supervisor to inspect the work, and he reported that it was safe and all right. My engineer, Mr. Holliday, also inspected the work.    Q.  Where is Mr. Holliday now  ?  A.  He is Superintendent of the Lewistown division.    Q.  Do you recollect what rear that was?  A.  That was somewhere about 1881 or 1882.    Q.  Did Mr. Holliday make a report to you in writing, or verbally?  A.  My memory is that Mr. Holliday made it in writing, and I sent this report with other papers to Mr. Ruff.    Q.  Have you a copy of it now in your office?  A.  I have not been able to find it\. [sic]  About that time, Mr. Morrell, General Manager of the Cambria Iron Company, who was with me in sympathy opposed to the rebuilding of the South Fork dam, became a member of the South Fork Club, and as he was a resident of Johnstown, with most of his wealth in that city, and an owner of the Cambria Iron Company, I was thoroughly convinced then that the dam was perfectly safe in every particular, but took the precaution to notify the Agent at South Fork, and also Mr. Wilson, the Superintendent of the Argyle Coal Company, in whose coolness and judgment I had great confidence, to keep a lookout, at the same time, directing the supervisor not to forego any care and precaution in watching the dam.  These parties were so vigilant that they made quite a number of reports to me, which upon investigation were found to be untrue, about the safety of the dam, as for example, the dam was reported unsafe, and when we sent our men there, it was a bridge west of the dam; so that we were continually getting more or less rumors which were always proved to be untrue.    Q.  Do you recollect the persons whom you sent up on different occasions to make examinations of the dam after receiving these reports from Mr. Wilson and others?  A.  Supervisor Fred. Ehrenfeld was the supervisor of that section and the orders were directed to him.  Of course, we understood that he would send his Assistant, the Assistant Supervisors on our division being educated engineers.    Q.  Did they report to you?  A.  They generally reported to me that the dam was all right; that everything was safe.    Q.  Had you at any time after making a personal examination of the dam, and after your interview with col Ruff, any suspicion that the dam could be swept away by an ordinary flood, and do the damage that it did do in May last?  A.  I was thoroughly convince that the dam would ne ver [sic] break from high water, and I considered that the breast of the dam would be strong enough to hold any water.  I have been a good deal over the country back of it until it reached the southern declivity, and I could not imagine where water would come from that could break the dam.  My only fear when the dam was rebuilt was on account of leaks.    Q.  If the dam was to give way at all, from what you saw, it would be because there  were leaks away below the breast of the dam, that might undermine the embankment?  A.  That was my idea; that it would increase the leaks.     Q.  But you never had any fear that the dam would be broken by water running over the top of it?  A.  We never had such damage at those points.  At Lilly where the Little Conemaugh commences, we have a very low bridge, or rather stringers over a small stream, and have had a little trouble with water overflowing there, but never had to the slightest degree such a water as I saw the evidence of, and was reported to be at this time.    Q.  How long have you known Mr. Walkinshaw, the Yard Master at Conemaugh?  A.  Over 25 years, I think.     Q.  Has he been at that point that length of time?  A.  No, he was a freight brakeman, and freight conductor; came up in the tri n [sic] service; but he has been at Conemaugh quite a number of years.    Q.  Do you consider him as a trusty, careful man with any duty given him to perform?  A.  I consider Mr. Walkinshaw a man who could be more trusted than any of our yard masers in looking after the company's interests in a case like this, although he has the consumption and is not very efficient as a yard master, and has not been very able to stand the physical strain.    Q.  I mean his capacity mentally to comprehend and make disposition of trains.  A.  I consider him one of our best men in that regard, and in using good sound judgment.    Q.  You have learned, have you, of the disposition he made of the Mail Train and the two Day Expresses on arrival at Conemaugh?  A.  I have learned where they were placed, and had evidence on the ground of where they were placed.    Q.  Have you learned also, Mr. Pitairn, that the water had washed the tracks out to a considerable extent immediately west of Conemaugh?  A.  Immediately w est [sic] and immediately east.    Q.  That was after the trains we have mentioned had arrived at Conemaugh?  A.  It was washing the tracks west of Conemaugh slightly before the trains arrived, and the Mail train  and the two Day Expresses were stopped at Conemaugh on account of a slide and obstructions immediately east of Conemaugh.     Q.  With that condition of things, and even with the water running over the dam, would it, in yourjudgement, [sic] have been a prudent or imprudent act for Mr.  Walkinshaw to have allowed those two Day Expresses and the Mail to have proceeded east, considering that they  were in a place of safety at Conemaugh?    A.  The passenger trains being at Conemaugh, it would almost have been criminal for the Yard Master at Conemaugh either to attempt to send them east or send them west, if he apprehended that the South Fork dam would give way.    Q.  And even with all the information which he may have had, and which you have learned that he did have as to the water running over the dam, even then, in your judgment, it would have been criminal in him to have ordered the trains east or west?  A.  Either east or west; and from the location and bend of the river at Conemaugh, there was no track, nor any spot on the track more safe than where he put those trains.    Q.  Mr. Pitcairn, I wish you would state whether you made calculation, as requested by me, of the distance of Conemaugh from the South Fork dam by the course of the Conemaugh itself.  A.  I made a calculation, and raking (?) three miles from South Fork station to South Fork dam, and it is 6.9 miles from SouthFork [sic] station to Conemaugh by rail, the railroad running parlllel [sic] with the river, and the river taking two bends of I should judge a mile around at Mineral Point, and the same at No.6 [sic] bridge east of Conemaugh, making eleven miles and nine tenths in all.    Q.  So that those three trains at Conemaugh were practically about twelve miles from the South Fork dam?  A.  Just about twleve [sic] miles by the Conemaugh river and the South Fork.    Q.  And by yourknowledge [sic] of the winding of the stream and the valleys it passes through, and the volume of water that might be in the dam when it was full, would you, from all you know of it, have had any apprehension that if the dam broke, it would bring such a deluge of water to Conemaugh that it did?  A.  The breaking of the South Fork dam was a perfect revelation to me, and with the many wide places in the valley, and turns to stop the water, that it did the damage that we s w, [sic] and I can only understand it from the theory that there were two or three breaks by the water backing up.    Q.  by the water being backed and arrested two or three times in its course?  A.  Yes, sir, and increasing its velocity by the obstruction.    Q.  Have you read the statement Mr. Trump has given here on that subject?  A.  Yes, sir.     Q.  State, sir, whether you coincide with him or not in the vi ew [sic] he takes.  A.  That is the only theory  I can explain it on.    Q.  Is there any other theory reasonable in itself that can be given as an explanation of that tremendous flood?  A.  I can't imagine any.    Q.  How many years have you known Mr. Dougherty, the Agent at South Fork?  A.  Well, I guess about 26 years.    Q.  Has he been at that point that many years?  A.  No, sir.  He was one of our oldest and best freight conductors, and considered by us a first class railroad man, but when we adopted the color blind test, he was found to be color blind, and we have since endeavored to take care/of [sic] him, but his education being all in the train\   [sic] service, and as we could not use him as a yard master, or anything connected ---  the trains, I appointed him Agent at South Fork, intending to give him a better agency when the opportunity occurred.  I think he has been at South Fork about two years.    Q.  Is he a careful, competent, sober man, and does he enjoy a good reputation as a railroad man?  A.  He is thoroughly sober, very respectable, of first class moral character, and considered by all a man of judgement above the rodinary [sic].     Q.  Have you/read [sic] the statement htat [sic] he has given in reference to this disaster, which we took here at the office?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  After reading it carefully , is there anything you see that man could have done other than he did do to get timely notice to you, and to the people at Conemaugh and Johnstown as to the condition of that dam?  A.  I think he did more than could be expected under the circumstances.    Q.  Mr. Pitcairn, how is the telegraph service of the Pennsylvania Railroad organized on the west ern [sic] division?  Has it ha [sic] head to it? [sic]  A.  The telegraph service is organized with the Division Operator in charge.    Q.  And who is your division operator?  A.  G. (?) H. Sheaffer.    Q.  You know Mr. Wilson, who is the Superintendent of the Argyle Coal Works at South Fork?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  How long have you known him?  A.  I never can count the years; a long time; quite a number of years.    Q.  I wish you would state whether you ever gave Mr. Wilson, or Mr. Dougherty, the Agent at South Fork, instructions to look after the safety of the South Fork dam, and report to you.  A.  Mr. Wilson accompanied me on a trip back of the South Fork dam on the line of a proposed railroad  to reach the Ashtola Lumber Company, and some large coal tracts, and there is where I got my impression that the South Fork dam would never break by a flood of water.  we stopped at the South Fork dam at that time to see low we could get around ------ it with the railroad, and we  talked over the South Fork dam matter, and I made a special request that he watch it carefully and repot [sic] I talked with him in reference to its safety, and in regard to keeping a close watch on it.    Q.  Mr. Pitcairn, is Mr. Wilson a man of shrewdness as a  business man, an intelligent man, and above the average of man?  A.  Mr. Wilson is a man well up in years, calm, collected, methodical, and away above the average not only in intelligence but as a business man, and more or less a leader in that section of the country.    Q.  Have you read the statement that Mr. Wilson has given us as to what took place on Friday when the dam broke?  A.  I have read his statement.    Q.  From your perusal of it, do you think Mr. Wilson did all he could do to protect the lives and property of people at Conemaugh   and other points along the river to Johnstown?  A.  I think he did all he could do, and more than was expected of a man in his position.    Q.  He was not an officer, nor in any way connected with the Penna. Railroad Company as an employe? [sic]  A.  He was not in any way  connected with the Pennsylvania railroad company, but his coal company delivers coal to the eng--gines [sic]; but he has always manifested a sympathy with the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, and helped them in every way possible, and we consider him one of our friends in that section of the country.    Q.  The men who were in charge of the Mail Train and  the two Day Expresses, I wish you would state whether those conductors were men of experience, sober, tried men, and trustworthy in the discharge of their as conductors?  A.  They were all considered our best men, efficient men, and all sober men.     Q.  State whether they have been trained as conductors in the service of the Penna. Railroad Company.  A.  They have all served  as apprentices, and been brought up in the passenger department from the bottom.    Q.  The engineers of those trains, were they men whom you felt you could trust with the lives -- of people, and such trains as they had charge of?  A.  The enginemen were among out best men, and we have the rputation [sic] and consdier [sic] our passenger train enginemen the very best in the country.    Q.  In relation to the conductor and enginemen of the Limited that passed Conemaugh that morning and went to South Fork, ad [sic] got over the bridge before the flood came, were they men of experience, and tried, and sober men in the discharge of their duties?  A.  They weremen [sic] of experience and first class men.    Q.  The division foreman who had charge of the watching and the repairing of the track east and west of Conemaugh, were they tried and reliable men whom you could trust, and had trusted?  A.  They were some of our men on that portion of the track who were thoroughly so, as is natural on such a difficult portion of the road.    Q.  Now, you can state as a fact whether commencing at Conemaugh and to the top of the mountain very extraordinary precaut ion [sic] had been taken for years before and down until the time of the flood to insure the safety of that mounti n [sic] tract.  A.  Every precaution had been taken.    Q.  How many years is it since you commenced erecting on your division these telegraph towers to inaugurate that system you have now of running trains and controlling the movement of trains by telegraph through these towers?  A.  Since about 1872.    Q.  Have you foundd [sic] that an efficient way of managing your trains   A.  We find  that it is the safest way that has yet been tried, and about the only was we could move our traffic.    Q.  Who is it, and at what point on the road is he located, that directs the movement of trains, where they are to be stopped and when run past these places.  A.  The block station operators give the clear track when they have a clear block.  The train despatchers, located at Union Station, Pittsburgh, would direct them to be stopped for any unusual purpose.    Q.  He is practically at the head then of the movement of trains on the western division?  A.  The Train Despatchers at Union Station, Pittsburgh, have practically the direct control of all the block stations and movements of trains on the division, under my name.    Q.  And is there such an arrangement here at Union Depot, Pittsburgh, that the despatfher [sic] or despatchers know the location of every freight and passenger train on the division?  A.  They know of the passage of every train, freight, passenger, and extra, at every block station on the division.    Q.  Mr. Pitcairn, you can st ate [sic] now from your observation what destruction the flood caused the Pennsylvania Railroad Company commencing at South Fork and coming down to Johnstown.  A.  The destruction from South Fork to Johnstown stone bridge was about as complete as could be imagined.  there were several short pieces of track favorably located that were left more or less in tact, but no one who did not personally see the devastation at the outstart  could conceive of such devastation.    Q.   Mr. Pitairn, from your observation, what was the destruction wrought by the flood at Conemaugh?  A.  Most thorough.    Q.  From your observation at  Conemaugh after the flood, you can state whether the water,after [sic] it broke over at thatpoint, [sic] carried the passenger station away.  A.  The flood carried the passenger station away.  The Day Expresses and the Mail Train being west of the passenger station  alongside of a street; the cars were left on the track with the exception of two cars that were washed away, and that was the only spot around there that was left in any kind of order to the south side of the street, where there was a row of houses that were all taken away with the passenger station and with loss of life, so that with the way the volume of water swept over Conemaugh station, and the track these three passenger trains passed, down an embankment of five or six feet into the street of Conemaugh and flooded the town, and the fact that the trains and passenger cars remained where they were, while all the balance of the tracks with the dwellings and property in Conemaugh on the south sid [sic] with the engine house, and with sufficient force to carry the engines out of the house a great distance, shows conclusively that whether by foresight or otherwise, Mr. Walkinshaw put the passenger trains on the safest portion of the line between Johnstown station and east of Conemaugh.    Q.  Were there lives lost that you know of in Conemaugh by the rush of water there?  A.  On the north side of the street and south (of) the railroad and the tracks where the passenger trains were put, there were lives lost, but I am only personally cognizant of the carrying away of the house of Engineer McHugh with his family his wife and two or three children being lost, two of his daughters, the only survivors, being caught by the men at the woolen mill west of Conemaugh and saved.    Q.  Where was the round house containing the locomotives situated with reference to these passenger trains?  A.  The round house was on the north side of where these passenger trains were located, and a little east, or about opposite the passenger station.    Q.  What effect had the flood upon the round house, and on the engines?  What number of engines were in there as near as you can tell?  A.  There were over 26 engines, and about all that I could see of the remains of the round house or anything near it, w as [sic] part of the large heavy stone at the center of the turn-table, in fact, that was the only means by which we could locate the round house, after the trouble.    Q.  What became of these engines?  A.  They were carried down three or four hundred feet and over.    Q.  State whether after the trains w ere [sic] put upon the sidings at Conemaugh by Mr. Walkinshaw  , it would have been more safe to have taken those passengers out, in your judgment, and put them in the passenger station, or was it better to let them remain in the cars, considering it was raining very hard and the river rising rapidly?  A.  If the passengers had been put in the station house, or any of the company property, it would have been likel y [sic] that they would all have been lost, unless they had run, as they did from the passenger cars.  Conemaugh is a small village and there are no hotels there, and in my judgment, Mr. Walkinshaw or anybody else would have been highly culpable for ordering these passengers  --------  among whom w ere [sic] women and children out to the hills in this drenching rain, and there was no time for Mr. Walkinshaw or anybody else to arrange with the occupants of private houses to  take them in, and in my judgement, he did the best he could, and if the passengers had remained in the cars, which it is not reasonable to expect with the confusion that existed when the flood was soon to be coming,  they would have been safe.  The Passengers, as I am informed, and know from the evidence, w ere [sic] as thoroughly posted as  any of the crew or Mr. Walkinshaw, and were personally observant of the height of the flood  and of the surrounding circumstances.  The fact that the conductors of the Day Expresses knew, or that Mr. Walkinshaw  knew, and were quienly [sic] in the passenger car  trying to dry their clothing is sufficient evidence that they apprehended no  danger, nor had any reason to.    Q.  Mr. Pitcairn, what time did you leave Pittsburgh  to go up to look after the destruction that the flood had wrought?  A.  May the 30th being a holiday, I went home about two o'clock and was at my telegraph instrument in my house  until about 11  o'clock, making frequent inquiries in regard to the rain.  On Friday morning, I came to the office on the early train and the Chief Train Despatcher was waiting for me with the reports reports [sic] of the extraordinary flood of water at Lilly.  The reports of this trouble with water at Lilly station kept growing more grave.  The supervisor reported that the dump east of Plane No. 3 was being washed away, and the water rushing down on the south side on the Lilly Branch, where --- there [sic] is no stream, and forcing its way over into Bens Creek, and through the dump which is parallel with the Little Conemaugh; so that Mr. Trump and I consulted about the matter and decided it wise that he sould [sic] get an engine and a passenger car, our Master Carpenter, Assistant Engineer, Chief Operator and as many telegraph line repairmen as we could get(for  [sic] at that time, the report was that the telegraph poles were being washed away), and all the force we could gather up and go to the place of the trouble.  I arranged to take the Pay Car and go on No 18 at 1 o'clock and go to Lilly where we could feed and sleep the men if kept out all of Friday night.  I left Pittsburgh on No. 18, and when I got to Bolivar noticed the Conemaugh river.  I received telegrams at different points that the trouble with the water was getting more serious, and in fact, though I cannot find any message, yet I understood that morning before I started that the people at Johnstown were warned out by Mr. Unger.  I could hardly see how Mr. Unger could warn them out, as he had no telegraph line; and in fact paid but little attention to any reports about the South Fork dam, as  they had bee n [sic] made perhaps nearly every year; in fact, one year the report was that the water was going over the breast of the dam, but whether it was so or not, I cannot remember positively.  That, however, made but little impression upon my mind from the fact that my thoughts were centered on the Lilly trouble, and when I reached Bolivar, and saw the immense body of water, very much higher than I had ever known during my connection with the Pennsylvania Railroad, I attributed it to the North Fork of the Conemaugh river, and as I proceeded and saw the water rising, and at Lockport up to the north track, which I never heard of or saw before, I thought the Stony Creek had assisted in the great rise of water.  At the east end of Sang Hollow middle track about four miles from Johnstown, we were stopped at the block; I went up to the tower to see if we could get any word from Johnstown of what the trouble w as, [sic] and we found that we could not get anybody east, and the operator could not allow us to proceed  from the fact that he had not a clear block.  I was about making up my mind to proceed cautiously, running c arefully, to find the trouble, when in looking east, I saw some debris.  The water before this had been muddy, but very little drift.  The debris attracted my attention from its singular appearance, being broken up wood entirely, and in very small pieces.  In a short time, the telegraph poles commenced to break down, and threatened to take the tower down with it.  The next matter that attracted my attention was a man coming down on some of the debris.  The water must then have been going about 15  miles per hour or over.  Then I say some men and rushed out to see what we could do to save them, but found that nothing could be done.  I then returned to the telegraph office to see what word I could get, when the people came down by the scores; the water rising very rapidly, and men women and children on the drift, and we perfectly helpless.  About that time, I was driven out of the tower; after doing What I could to save people and only succeeding in saving seven out of the hundred and over that had passed us.  We asked them where they came from and they said from Morrellville and Cambria City, and then I was convinced that the trouble was with the Stony Creek water, as we could find no one from the east side of Johnstown.  I then decided to back two freight trains which were there, the water rising and coming up to the track, and went back to the  block station at the west end of Sang Hollow middle siding, when I mad my judgement that it would be running the freight trains into a risk  by backing them, and I decided to wait at the west Sang Hollow block, and watch the progress of the water, and I staid there until we were driven out to that tower by the telegraph poles being broken down, and I went down and staid on the track prepared to get the passengers and run for the hillside.  I then discovered by watching close that the water was on a stand still, and it gradually receded, and I decided to hold the freight trains on Sang Hollow  middle siding, and take all the passengers back to Pittsburgh, giving them the option to stop off at New Florence if they desired to and they could get accommodations there, and take the balance back to Pittsburgh.  It took us some time  to get back to New Florence  on account of the water being on the track.  On reaching New Florence, I went to the block station, wrote a message directed to the editors of all the morning papers, requesting them to call a public meeting of all the citizens of Pittsburgh, from the fact that I had seen enough people go down the river to know that there would be terrible distress.  I kept this message until about 10 or 11 o'clock, when I got word from my supervisor, Mr. W. (H?). Hays, whom I knew was at Johnstown bridge with his work train, notifying me that Johnstown was swept away.  I then sent the message to the Pittsburgh papers, and an order to collect all the men from the western lines, and material to repair the damage, and started for Pittsburgh, being detained at Lockport and different points by little slides and the water over the tracks at low places, reaching Pittsburgh somewhere about 6 o'clock in the morning.  The water when I was going east, at points where the valley was one, two, and three miles wide was thoroughly -- overflown, and that was before the South Fork water came down.    Q.  Where did you see that, Mr. Pitcairn?  A.  I saw that first at Lockport, west of New Florence, and then at Ninevah.  The water at Sang Hollow by what I can see was the South Fork dam flood, from the fact that observing the water at the time, it must have risen about six or eight feet in from  one half to one hour.    Q.  I understand then at these points mention, the flood extended  over the low ground or flats.  You can state in this connection whether the Conemaugh at New Florence  is not a considerable distance from the station, from a half to three quarters of a mile.  A.  The river at New Florence is perhaps from a half to three quarters of a mile off.  The station w as on a high elevation and wasn't touched by the water.  The water extended east and west of New Florence village over the valley.    Q.  The point I want to get from you is the fact that New Florence is about three quarters of a mile from the river where the township road crosses over by a bridge.    A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  Was that taken before or after the dam broke?  A.  I don't know, but the Bolivar bridge was taken before the dam broke.    Q.  Was that a railroad bridge?  A.  It was an iron township bridge.  It was taken before I got there.  I looked out for it and saw it was gone.  That is, what I understood about the matter, but it is very difficult to see the bridge from the passing train.    Q.  Isn't there a long stretch of  flat country from a few yards west of Florence to Lockport?  A.  From just west of Florence where the river is from a half to three quarters of a mile from the station, to Lockport, where the river is near, it is a wide, low valley, and the houses on the farms and  at the houses in the valley as near as I could  see, the was two or three feet above the foundation.     Q.  So that all that  valley was covered with water to the depth of three or four feet before the dam broke?  A.  Yes, sir.. [sic]    Q.  After you reached Pittsburgh, what measures did you take to place the Pennsylvania Railroad car service at the disposition of people who were disposed to relieve the Johnstown sufferers?  A.  On my arrival  at Pittsburgh on Saturday morning, I got into communication with the General Manager and President of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and reported all the facts that I knew, and the fact that I had called this public meeting; and I was notified by Mr. Pugh that my action was appreciated, and to attend the meeting, and if Pittsburgh people could be aroused to subscribe any ways liberally, to subscribe $5000.00 for the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, and put the whole equipment and men at their service  to secure and transport relief to the Conemaugh valley [sic] sufferers, which I did.  Finding however, that the Mayor had not called the meeting, I sent for some friends  to urge him to call it as soon as possible   The arrangement was to call it at 10 o'clock, but we didn't meet until about noon.  Seeing that the people did not appreciate the magnitude of the disaster, I made them a short address, which seemed to stir them up, and they stopped talking, and subscribed liberally, appointing their committee which met five minutes afterwards, and that afternoon , relief was on its way to Johnstown by trains furnished by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company free.    Q.  Now, Mr. Pitcairn, did you continue from day to day to give the suffering Johnstown people your attention and aid in every way you could, as an officer of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company in their distress?  A.  At the meeting, I suggested the name of Mr. James McCrea General Manager of the Pennsylvania Company, feeling that most of the work would have to be done by him, and knowing that I would be consistently occupied for many days thereafter.  The whole Pennsylvania Railroad was put at the disposal of the public to the detriment of their prompt repairing and re-establishing  their own lines.   In fact, the public had full possession of the Pennsylvania Railroad line w est [sic] of Johnstown, and the committee acted with myself in the relief of the people.

Where were you employed at the time of the Johnstown flood?  A.  I was employed at Mineral Point by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company.    Q.  What was your position?  A.  Division Foreman.    Q.  What was the extent of your division?  A.  The east end of the division was at the viaduct or just a little west of the viaduct, and the west of the division is where the Johnstown water  dam is.    Q.  What is the length of it?  A.  Two miles and a half.    Q.  What were your duties?  A.  My duty was, so far as I understand it, to see to the repairs of that two miles and a half of track, and if I understand right, was to see that the whole division was kept in good repair, and see that the men discharge their duties as laborers should.    Q.  You had a number of men under you?  A.  I had 11 men at that time.    Q.  I wish you would state what the character of the man was that preceded the breaking of the South Fork dam.  A.  My watchman told me that it rained hard, and very hard, the most part of Thursday night, and I was called out between four and five o'clock, I can't just give the exact time, but it was near five o'clock, on account of a land slide that we had, and it was raining very hard then; it apeard [sic] that an umbrella didn't amount to anything in that rain.  We worked at that slide, with some of the men, I suppose, until half past seven    Q.  Where was that slide?  A.  The slide was about---it [sic] wasn't quite a quarter of a mile east of Mineral Point station.    Q.  What was the extent of it?  A.  It wasn't very much of a slide, but it kept coming all the time, right ahead of the fast passenger trains.    Q.  How many tracks did it obstruct?  A.  Only one.    Q.  What did you do at that point?  A.  We shovelled the dirt off the track, and the water came over the bank there very fast, and we turned the water into a small culvert there, and turned it off.    Q.  Up to that time, had any of the track been washed out?  A.  No, sir, I don't think it had.  Then, I made a trip over my division, and I also had men stationed all along because it was raining very hard, and we were looking for land slides, and we watched very carefully.    Q.  Had you more than that one slide?  A.  No, sir, that was all I had on my division.  At I suppose about ten o'clock, I wouldn't say the exact hour, I was at the east end of my division, just at the viaduct, and just after noon, I couldn't say just what time it was, I made a trip to the west end of my division, although I had men stationed right along, but there had been no track washed out at that time.    Q.  How many years have you lived in that country?  A.  Six years.    Q.  Did you ever see a flood in the Conemaugh before?  A.  No, sir, not like that.    Q.  That isn't what I asked you.  Did you ever see any flood there before?  A.  Oh yes, I have seen floods there before that was high, but nothing like that.    Q.  Would you say that this was an extraordinary flood?  A.  Yes, sir, I would.  I think it became extraordinary after it began to break over, or come from the dam.  The water took a very sudden raise.  It must have raised three feet in an hour and a half.    Q.  At what point?  A.  At Mineral Point.  The fence around my lot reached right on the river bank, and I could tell just how much it was raising by the fence, as there,were [sic] six inch boards in the fence, and six inch cracks between the boards.  It was never p [sic] up to the fence at all before.    Q.  Where were  you when the flood came?  A.  I was at the slide, and I saw  the telegraph poles and wires give a jerk, and I knew something was wrong then, and I started for my house, running as hard as I could.  I have a wife and three children, and I wanted to get them out.    Q.  Did you g et them out?  A.  We staid in the house all the time; the water got up pretty close but didn't take it.

E. J. Unger     Q.  (Col.) Unger, I wish you would state whether you were up at the South Fork dam in the latter part of May, and I wish you would state about what time it commenced to rain, and what was the character of therein?  A.  I was there on Thursday evening; there w as [sic] no rain then, but it was cloudy, and thewater [sic] was very low, but on Firday [sic] morning, when I got up at six o'clock, the valley below me seemed to be all under water, and I couldn't understand what all that meant.    Q.  You slept in a house near the dam, did you?  A.  Yes, sir, 200 yards off.  I got my gum coat and gum boots on and went down, and found it was rising at the rate of about ten inches an hour in the dam, and was pretty well up then; within four or five feet of the top of thebreast [sic] of the dam.  I saw the way it was rising, it wouldn't be very long until it would get full.  I couldn't tell how much water was coming; I came to the conclusion that I would cut an extra waste way, and sent for the Italians and the tools and went right to work.    Q.  How many Italians had you up there?  A.  About 20, but I only put about 13 on this work; they were all I could use.  They were up there engaged in building a sewer.  I sent for them and soon got them to work.    Q.  Which side of the dam?  A.  The west side.  The face of the embankment there was solid ground, and I knew it couldn't wash that out right away.  The people there protested against it; they said ""If you cut that waste weir there, you will ruin the whole business""; and I said, ""It won't matter much; it will be ruined anyhow if I can't get rid of this water.""  I got that cut---    Q.  How deep a ditch was it and how wide?  A.  About six or eight feet wide; and I couldn't just say how deep it was; it got deeper you know when the water commenced to run through.  It left out a big volume of water.  About 8 o'clock our\ [sic] stage went down or half-past eight, and some of them looked at me and asked me how things were, and I told them ""Serious"", and I just staid right there from that time until a quarter past one, doing what I could to relieve the water, but the waste way was full up, and the little waste w% [sic] was also full, and it was running over the top of the embankment for nearly three hours.  I don't know exactly how deep, but it went over the top.  And about a quarter, as near as I can remember, of three, it went out.    Q.  Did it go out all at once, with a burst?  A.  No, sir, just little by little, until it got a headway, and when it got cut through, it just went like a flash.    Q.  How long  was it until the dam was emptied?  A.  Inside of an hour.  That man Parke, as near as I can remember, came up about 11 o'clock to see how we were getting along.    Q.  Who was Parke?  A.  He was our engineer on the water works.  And I told him to go down to South Fork and notify them that there was great danger.    Q.  What time did you send him?  A.  Between 11 and 12 o'clock.  I had my watch in (my) pocket, but didn't look at it.    Q.  He went down, didhe? [sic]  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  What  time did he get back?  A.  In the course of an hour.  He reported that he had notifies them.    Q.  Did he say who he had notified?  A.  He didn't mention any names?    Q.  Now, Mr. Unger, was there verything [sic] done that possibly could be done to prevent that dam going ou t? [sic]  A.  Yes, sir, there was.    Q.  Did you think that dam, except for this extraordinary flood, and three hours of water running over it, would have gone at all?  A.  It would not have.    Q.  How high did you ever see the water there before?  The biggest flood you\ever [sic] saw?  A.  Four feet of the top.    Q.  When the water got up, after it had run between two and three hours, could you give us an idea of the thickness of the volume of water that went over the dam?  A.  No, I couldn't.    Q.  Was it one, two, or three feet?  A.  I can't tell.  I didn't measure  it and didn't go near, because it was very dangerous to go in there.    Q.  Do you recollect the flood of last August that flooded Johnstown?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  How deep was the water in the dam then?  A.  It was up within four feet of the top.    Q.  Was there any evidence of insecurity about the dam then?  A.  Nothing at all; not in the slightest.    Q.  In all your observation of that dam, did you ever see anything to lead you or any other members of the club to the belief that there was anything unsafe?  A.  Nothing at all; it was considered very safe.  When the bonds were issued for the building of new water works, there was only a few got them, because they were picked right up so soon, and if they hadn't considered the dam safe, they wouldn't have taken them; and another thing, there was an investment of one hundred and fifty to one hundred and seventy-five  thousand dollars, and if the people considered the dam unsafe, they wouldn't have b een [sic] foolish enough to put their money in there.  The dam was tighter and less water went through than when it was first built.    Q.  How large was this waste weir to take the water off?  A.  75 feet wide.    Q.  On which  side was it?  A.  On the east side.    Q.  And how much lower was that weir than the breast of the dam ?  A.  About eight feet as near as I can tell.    Q.  So that there was ----- [sic] a passage way 75 feet wife [sic] and eight feet deep for a waste wier.  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  How high did the water ever get up with reference to that weir.  Did you  ever see it run out of that waste weir?  A.  Yes, sir, it did that time when it flooded Johnstown before, and it discharged all the water.    Q.  So that the time of this last flood, it filled that w aste [sic] weir up to eight feet of the top of the dam, and then for three hours it flowed over the top?  A.  Yes, sir, over the top  and this new  waste way besides, which did great execution as regards relieving the water.    Q.  Do you know whether the dam was ever repaired from time to time by anybody?  A.  It was.    Q.  By whom?  A.  The Club; and Mr. Pitcairn had men up there looking after it.    Q.  Do you know Mr. Ehrenfeld?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  Was he there?  A.  Yes, sir, he did some repairing; he had some men there to do some work below  the dam; of course, it pertained to the whole business;  and the engineer was there; I don't remember his name; I gave a dinner to the engineer when he was there.    Q.  What time did Col. Ruff die , do you recollect?  A.  I don't remember the time exactly.    Q.  Had he been around there considerably?  A.  Yes, sir, on the day of his death, there was a wagon load of fruit trees came up for his cottage at the lake.    Q.  Did he die suddenly?  A.  He did.    Q.  Col. Ruff was a contractor and engineer, I believe?  A.  I don't know in regard to his engineering qualities; he was a contractor.    Q.  What was the character of his work?  A.  It was considered good.    Q.  What kind, I mean.  A.  He built embankments, and did much work as that dam was; and/ [sic] he built part of the West Penn Railroad.    Q.  Who was it built the dam after it broke away?  Who had charge of the work?  A.  Col. Ruff, and Nathan McDowell.  He assisted Col. Ruff in building it.    Q.  So that you had the benefit of the experience of Col. Ruff as a contractor, and Nathan McDowell as an engineer.  A.  Yes, sir, Nathan was considered the engineer.    Q.  That was after the South Fork Club was organized?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  And who work was done and paid for by them?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  And the work was done and paid for by the      [sic]  And I on many occasions went around there to see about the leakage, and I found it was less as the dam got older.  When the dam was originally   built, they built it without stopping the water; they put in immense rocks, and the water went through those rocks; your see, as near as I can remember, the embankment was 250 or 300 yards at the bottom, so that they could put in an immense quantity of rocks there, and when they were ready to stop the water, they put hay and spruce boughs in front of it, and that stopped the water right away; I don't know how high it was then, but not very high, and then they went down there with carts, and clay was put in parts of it and ground in other parts; and the water was stopped by this hay and spruce boughs; that made it  tight; that w as [sic] away down at the bottom, and it had a big surface of ground at the bottom.  I don't know how many carts were engaged there, but there were 30 or 40 carts.  The breadth of the breast of the bottom  was  300 feet.    Q.  From one side of the valley to the other, what was the distance?  A.  Nearly 900 feet.      Return to the List of Witnesses"
GX127-09-15860973	Hagerman Fossil     Beds'      CRITTER CORNER       by Dr. Greg McDonald       Monument Paleontologist                 Camels: Not Just Deserts                 When someone mentions camels, what is the first image that comes to mind?     For most people, its a dry hot desert with tall sand dunes. This is not unreasonable when     we think of where the two types of modern camels live. The dromedary (single humped) is     found in the Middle East (including the Sahara Desert) and the Bactrian (double humped)     lives in the arid parts of Asia such as the Gobi Desert. Because of the close association     of modern camels with the desert, most people are not too surprised when they find out we     have fossil camels in southern Idaho. After all, with only 9 inches of precipitation a     year this area is classified as a desert, so why shouldn't a camel be able to survive     here. But the desert we see today didn't exist in southern Idaho 3 million years ago.  Camels     originated in North American about 50 million years ago and their presence in the Old     World is a recent event, geologically speaking. Most of their history is preserved in the     fossil record in North America. Based on this record we know that most camels didn't live     in deserts but were adapted to grasslands and parkland situations. Certainly the camels     that we find in Hagerman Fossil Beds weren't living in a desert The presence of many other     animals such as beaver, otter, muskrat, turtles, frogs and waterfowl indicate extensive     wetlands in the Hagerman area 2 to 3 million years ago when camels roamed here. In fact,     camels probably didn't adapt to desert conditions until after they dispersed into Asia and     the Middle East.        Past evidence for camels and their close relatives, lames, at Hagerman has been scanty.     The few bits and pieces, such as isolated teeth and toe bones didn't tell us much about     these animals except that they were here. However, our knowledge of camels at Hagerman     Fossil Beds took a giant step forward recently with the discovery of a complete skull of     the extinct genus  Camelops , whose name when translated, literally means camel face.      Camelops is known from a number of other places in Idaho, such as American Falls     Reservoir. It is also known from many other localities in the western United States,     including the well known La Brea Tar Pits in California. All of these other sites are from     the younger Pleistocene epoch (known more popularly as the Ice Age). Our newly discovered     skull is certainly a different species from the Ice Age  Camelops . We are not yet     sure which species of  Camelops we have, because specimens preserved from older rocks     are few and far between. This complete skull from the Monument will greatly enhance our     understanding of the early history of  Camelops .        This skull is exciting for another important and totally unexpected reason. It came     from a layer that wasn't supposed to have any bones in it! All previous discoveries of     fossils in the Monument were made in the Glenns Ferry Formation, which is mostly composed     of fine sands, silts and clays. Sitting on top of the Glenns Ferry Formation is a thick     layer of coarse gravel known as the Tuana Gravels. Bones are rarely preserved in coarse     gravels because the tumbling action of the gravel in fast moving water tends to break bone     into small pieces. As it turns out, on top of the gravels is another layer of fine river     channel sands, just right for preserving bone, and it was in this layer that the skull of  Camelops      was found. We don't know for sure the age of our new discovery but because of its     position above the Glenns Ferry Formation we can be sure that it is younger than all the     typical fossils found at the Monument. Perhaps it is as young as 2 million years or maybe     younger. Although our skull of  Camelops  will provide much new information, more     importantly it shows that even after 65 years of research, there is still much more to be     learned about the Monument's fossils and geology.

H. Watt      Q.  Where were you employed at the time of the Johnstown flood?  A.  I was ticket agent at Johnstown.    Q.  How long had you been there?  A.  Since the 11th of March 1889.    Q.  Did you at any time Friday received any warning in relation to the South Fork dam being unsafe?  A.  Well, they did at the station, but I was at home.  I left the station about 8.45 on Friday morning, and had gone home over in town, and didn't get back to the station until Saturday evening.    Q.  You don't know anything about any messages then?  A.  Yes, I do.  I saw a message after I got back, but as to what it was, I don't positively remember.  I knew it was something in relation to the South Fork reservoir being liable to burst at any moment, and to try to warn the people of Johnstown, signed by R. P. , and also a message from the operator at South Fork, but I wasn't there at the time, and I didn't pay a great deal of attention to them afterwards.    Q.  Where were you when the flood came?  A.  I was at home.  My house was on Lincoln Street.    Q.  Was you house flooded?  A.  Yes, sir, we staid on the roof until the worst got past, and then got  back into the attic and remained there until Saturday morning.  Saturday morning, we started out a little hole we cut in the roof, and climbed out through other houses and got up town and got a lunch.  We got down over the river by a boat over to the station, and got over there about four o'clock Saturday evening.    Q.  How high was the water before the dam broke?  A.  I suppose the water was  ten feet deep around our house when the flood broke.    Q.  With reference to the locality of your house and the station house, shove [sic] or   below in Johnstown?  A.  Our house stood a great deal lower than the station,directly [sic] opposite the station.    Q.  Had you a family?  A.  I had my wife and grandmother.    Q.  And there was ten feet of water in that house?  A.  Yes, sir.  Our house is just a new house, and the man that built it put it about six feet above the foundation, and we though the water never would touch it, but we had at least four feet of water on the lower floor before the dam broke.  I waded down stairs at 11 o'clock, and then the water got so high it was coming in over the tops of my gum boots, and it kept  on raising until half-past three, when I know at  the least  calculation, it was four feet deep.  The flood struck us at  4.07.       Return to the List of Witnesses

Where do you reside, sir?  A.  Conemaugh.    Q.  How long have you lived there?  A.  About 28 years.    Q.  Have you seen freshets or floods in the Conemaugh there?  A.  Yes, sir, never one as big as this one though.    Q.  Before the present flood which you have alluded to, when was there a flood prior to it that approached it to any degree?  A.  Oh, I can't recollect.    Q.  Wasn't there one in June two years ago?  A.  Yes, I think there was.    Q.  How much higher do you think this last flood was before the dam broke, then anyone you ev(e)r [sic] saw in the Conemaugh?  A.  Well, it must have been three or four feet higher.    Q.  You never saw such high water as that?  A.  Yes, sir; I know  it never  came around my house before, or near it.    Q.  Where is your house with reference to the station house?  A.  My house is right at the bridge that went across in the yard; we were right in the flat there on the Franklin side of the river, opposite from the station.    Q.  What was you employed in on that day of the flood?  A.  I have been running on that road for a long time; since '55 (?); I was coupled on ahead of the first section of No. 8  to help her up the hill.    Q.  What was your position?  A.  Engineer.    Q.  What was the number of your engine?  A.  437.    Q.  What, if anything, do you know about any warning or telegram being received as to the condition of the South Fork dam?  A.  I don't know anything at all, for my part.  I was on the engine all day  from the time the first section of Day express came up until the water came.  We were laying down below the crossing or bridge, and they pulled the train up on the back track up to the station.  I went over to Capstick, the Round House Foreman, to get some one to watch my engine until I went over to get my wife out.  We got Tom. Sheridan to come out and take the engine until I got my wife on the hill.  Just after I went over, the flood fell a little.  We had taken up the carpet on the parlor floor and got the furniture upstairs, and I went out to see where the water was and where we would go.  My wife is a cripple, and we had to carry her out.  She was walking on crutches.  Well, I went to the river, and just as I got to the river, I heard an engine whistling up above the round house, and I thought there might be some danger.  I ran to my house and told my wife to get out as quick as she could; I said ""Get on my back, and I'll carry you"", and just then Joe Schry, an engineer, came along, and grabbed her and ran out on the street with her, and we got a chair and put her in it, and carried her away as quick as we could.  We just got over the old Portage Railroad when the houses were all going.    Q.  You know Mr. Walkinshaw very well, don't you?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  Considering the ehight [sic] of the water, and the way the track was torn up west of Conemaugh, and obstructed and torn up east of it , do you think he could have put those trains in any safer place than he did?  A.  I don't think he could; I don't know what his orders were.     Q.  Suppose there were no orders?  A.  Well, he couldn't have put them in any better position than where he had them.  He moved all the trains to a place where he thought they would be safe.  I was there, and seen him doing that.    Q.  And you think as a prudent, careful man, he did all with those trains any man could do?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  Did you see the flood coming?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  What did it look like?  A.  It just looked like a great body of high water, as high as a house, 30 feet, full of timber, logs, trees, and everything.    Q.  What became of your train?  A.  The engine that we had, we had cut loose to let a passge [sic] into the station house; and it was washed down near the furnace, about a quarter of a mile, and the other engine was washed off the track, and the train staid there, because the coal scaffold was knocked down and made a big drift right above the trains.  The first and second No. 8's were laying together side by side, and No. 12 was laying over on the south side.  Second No. 8, I believe, took fire that night some way or another.    Q.  Now, except for this extraordinary burst of water from the dam breaking, don't you think those trains were in a perfectly safe place?  A.  I would think they were.  If I had been on the engien [sic] any other place or any other time---I [sic] wasn't on the engien [sic] at that time when it was coming,---if [sic] I had been on the engine, you couldn't have got me off it.  I wouldn't have ever dreamed of anything of that kind taking the engine away.    Q.  What did your engine weigh?  A.  50 tons, I think they count them; 114,000 pounds, I think.    Q.  It carried it a quarter of a mile?  A.  Oh yes.    Q.  How many engines we re [sic] there in the round house?  A.  Some say 33 and some say 23.  They were all scattered around; and there was no engine left on the track at all.    Q.  Did the water that swept over these trains pass over into the town of Conemaugh?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  And swept the  houses out?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  How many people were drowned living in Conemaugh?  A.  There was 18 drowned in Franklin Borough and I think they counted eight in East Conemaugh, besides the passengers; there were some of them lost.    Q.  Do you remember of the dam brea king [sic] in 1862?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  Where wre [sic]  you living when the dam broke in 1862?  A.  Just where I do now.    Q.  What effect had the breaking of the dam on the yard at Conemaugh?  Had it any effect at all?  How much of a swell did it make?  A.  Oh it made the  water pretty high; just a regular high water.    Q.  Was it out of its banks?  A.  It was bank full, but it didn't do any damage at all.    Q.  You recollect the fact that the dam did break in 1862?  A.  Yes, sir, I  recollect it well; I was working for the Company then the same as I am now.    Q.  What time of the year did the dam break?  A.  Well, now, I could hardly tell that.    Q.  Was it in the Spring, Fall, or Summer?  A.  It appears to me it was in the Fall, but I wouldn't be certain about that.    Q.  So far  as you know, did the water from the dam breaking do any damage above Conemaugh and about South Fork?  A.  Not that I know of, no, sir.    Q.  Didn't it take any bridges away or anything of that kind?  A.  No, sir.     Return to the List of Witnesses"

What time did you get to Johnstown?  A.  I think order (?) time is 8.29 there, and I think we were about on time.    Q.  What was the condition of the flood when you reached Johnstown?  A.  The water was running high then.    Q.  How was it as to the houses down along Morrellville?  A.  It was up on the floor then .  I noticed they had a train load of stone on the Cambria Bridge.  The Sheridan bridge was gone already.    Q.  How long did you remain at Johnstown?  A.  Not long; only a few minutes.    Q.  Where did you stop next?  A.  Conemaugh.    Q.  How long did you stay there?  A.  We didn't leave there.    Q.  For what reason?  A.  We understood there was   trouble east.  They backed us in there at Conemaugh.    Q.  On what track?  A.  On the river siding on the south side.    Q.  did you stay there?  A.  We staid there, and the first section of Day Express  backed in against us, and they seen the track wasn't safe, and they took them out, and put the Day Express on the station siding.    Q.  During the time you were there, were you down at the telegraph office?  A.  I was down once when the bridge went away.    Q.  What, if anything, did you hear at Conemaugh, about the South Fork dam breaking?  A.  A man ran by, and he says ""Be prepared to run, as the dam is going to break"", just as he ran past.    Q.  What time of day do you suppose that was?  A.  About three o'clock.    Q.  Who was the conductor of your train?  A.  Mr. Warthen.    Q.  Do you know how many passengers you had on your  train?  A.  I don't know; not very many.  We had the ""Night Off"" Company; they got on at Johnstown; and a couple others.    Q.  They all got out?  A.  Yes, sir.  When I heard the engine whistle, or  a little after, I went back and looked in the car, and in the smoker, and didn't see anybody there.    Q.  If the flood hadn't come, do you think any damage would have happened?  A.  No, sir.    Q.  It was the breaking of the dam that did the damage?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  What cars were swept out of your train?  A.  None.  The current took them down 50 or 60 feet, and the telegraph tower came out and fell on top of the engine, and held the train together.    Q.  Was any of the baggage of the opera troupe lost?  A.  No, sir.    Q.  How long have you been on the road?  A.  I have been running as baggage master for over five years.    Q.  You have seen floods in the Conemaugh before?  A.  Oh yes.    Q.  Did you ever see a flood like that?  A.  No, sir, I never saw the water as high.    Q.  It was an extraordinary one?  A.   Yes, sir.    Q.  That bridge went away at Conemaugh before the dam broke?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  What  time did it go out?  A.  I should judge about 2 o'clock; I wouldn't be positive.    Q.  You are sure it went out before the dam broke?  A.  Oh yes; the baggage master of No. 8 hollowed to me, ""There goes the bridge"".    Q.  What bridge was that?  A.  The foot bridge; the iron bridge.    Q.  Where were the two Day Expresses lying?  A.  On the station siding, and the one next to it.    Q.  How much further were they away from the river than you were?  A.  Really I hardly know; they must have been six or eight tracks further up.    Q.  Did you consider them in a safe place under the circumstances?  A.  Well, yes, they were on high ground; higher than our train was.        Return to the List of Witnesses"
GX032-22-7756158	"The Merrimack River   Lowell National  Historical Park          National Park Service          U.S. Department of the Interior         PDF          of Park Brochure           Rivers powered New England’s early industrial cities.  The Merrimack was one of the most important waterpower sources. It gave rise to  Lowell's great textile mills. Yet for many along the Merrimack, the river provided  more than just waterpower.                    The Early Merrimack:  the Pennacook Confederacy    Pennacook Indians were this area's first recorded inhabitants.  Each spring, tribes met at the Pawtucket Falls on the banks of the Merrimack to  fish during the day and conduct business at night. Marriages and trade agreements  between tribes strengthened the confederacy. At the close of the fish runs, tribes  moved upriver to plant and harvest crops. In the 17th century, smallpox, war,  and English settlement devastated the Pennacooks. Many died, while others moved  north to Canada. By 1725, land once home to the Pennacooks was absorbed by the  town of Chelmsford. A way of life was gone forever.   The Dawn of Industry   The colonists and their descendants used the river for  fishing and for transportation. Merchants from Newburyport built the Pawtucket  Canal (1796) to bring timber products around the Pawtucket Falls. Boston traders  built the Middlesex Canal (1803) to ship goods to and from Boston.    In  1814, a group of Boston merchants financed the country's first ""integrated,""  water-powered textile mill. Located on the Charles River in Waltham, this mill  housed all the machinery needed to turn raw cotton into finished cloth. In 1823,  wishing to expand production, the Boston group began textile operations in East  Chelmsford, using the 32-foot Pawtucket Falls. They founded ten textile companies  in the town they renamed Lowell. For the next 30 years, the city led the nation  in cotton textile production.   Harnessing the River   The giant textile companies viewed water only as an element  of production. The amount of water reaching a mill was artificially controlled  to maximize output.   Engineers controlled the water in the canals by building small, covered dams with  gates that could be raised or lowered to release more or less water.    Large dams on the river itself were another part of the system. Dams helped mill  owners obtain a steady water supply by holding back water overnight. Lowell’s  dam, built just above the falls, turned the river into an 18-mile-long mill pond.  Other dams were built in Lawrence, Manchester, and elsewhere along the Merrimack.   Control  of the Merrimack’s sources in New Hampshire was also crucial to the water  delivery system. The Lowell and Lawrence mills joined forces in the 1840s to buy  rights to the waters of Lake Winnipesaukee, Newfound Lake, and Squam Lake.    Environmental Costs   The growth of Lowell and other industrial cities on the  Merrimack dramatically changed the river's ecosystem. One of the most noted changes  was the disappearance of fish.   Salmon, shad  and Alewives were formerly abundant here . . . until the dam, . . . and the factories  at Lowell, put an end to their migrations hitherward. . . . Perchance, after a  few thousands of years, if the fishes will be patient, and pass their summers  elsewhere . . . nature will have levelled . . . the Lowell factories, and the  Grass-ground River [will] run clear again.   Henry  David Thoreau, A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, 1849.   In addition  to building dams, textile makers dumped wastes into the river. The canals of Lowell  were especially loaded with trash and dyes, making the water unfit for drinking.    Population growth also contributed to the pollution of the water supply. By the  1870s, human waste and run-off had contaminated Lowell’s wells, so the city  began using filtered river water. Meanwhile, city sewage systems dumped wastes  directly into the Merrimack. In the 1920s, 12 million gallons of Lowell sewage  entered the river each day. Sometimes diseases traveled downstream from one river  city to   another.     Corrective Actions    Since the 1970s, the river's health has been improving,  in part due to activism and legislation. The Clean Water Act of 1972 mandated  waste treatment plants and regulation of toxic discharges. Progress has sometimes  been slow: Manchester, New Hampshire, stopped regularly dumping raw sewage only  in 1992.     The Anadromous Fish Conser-vation Act of 1965 led to a joint state-federal effort  to restore migratory Merrimack fish such as salmon and shad. Salmon are taken  from Lawrence to Nashua to spawn in a hatchery and are later released back into  the river. Both wild and domestic salmon are stocked at various life-cycle stages.  The goal is to get 3,000 salmon beyond Manchester. (The historic salmon population  was 30,000). Shad are brought from Lawrence and released above Lowell to continue  their journey. Fish ladders and elevators facilitate the migration of these fish.  Other Merrimack fish include alewives, herring, and eels.    A Vital Resource     The Merrimack still supplies power via six hydroelectric  dams on the river and almost 100 small power projects. Hydropower is generated  in Lowell by a plant on the Northern Canal and by turbines in former mills.   The  Merrimack is also the second largest surface drinking water source in New England.  It serves a total of 300,000 people through four water treatment plants.   The Future of the Merrimack   The river is still afflicted with pollution problems.  Salt, grease, trash, and pesticides run off into the river from cities and suburbs  alike.      Activist groups allege that poor monitoring allows violation  of toxics regulations. Recovering fish species must still be stocked. Aging treatment  plants need updating. Riverside vegetation buffers are often lacking. And, as  in many other waterways, mercury is found in the Merrimack.     The most stubborn problem now is Combined Sewage Overflows (CSOs). Normally, sewage  treatment plants treat both runoff and sewage. However, heavy rains can cause  such an excess of water that some waste goes into the river untreated, periodically  lowering water quality.    Despite  such problems, the river is fine for boating. Also, Lowell reopened its river  beach in 1996, providing the state's only official river swimming east of Worcester.  River fish are often suitable for eating, within state guidelines.    THINGS TO DO   Waterpower:  See a turn-of-the-century turbine that powered looms at the Suffolk Mill. Ask  a ranger about tour offerings. Or, walk to the Lower Locks area and view a reconstructed  gatehouse and the original lock chambers, dam, and sluiceway.   River access:  Visit the newly opened Riverwalk. It follows the bank of the Merrimack from Boott  Mills to LeLacheur Park, passing the Tsongas Arena and other sites along the way.         Some          driving and/or walking is necessary to reach other parts of the river.

H. Hare    Q.  What train were you employed on?  A.  I was flagging first No. 8    Q.  How long had you been running on the road?  A.  I have been on the road in the passenger department for five years.    Q.  Now, what was the condition of things when you arrived at Johnstown, as to the height of the water, etc?  Q.  [sic] When we arrived at Johnstown, the water was up to the first story in those houses along the bridge, and about half the people were up on the bridge watching the flood at the time.  They were all the way from the station down to the stone bridge.    Q.  Did you ever seee [sic] as high a flood as that?  A.  No, sir, I never did.    Q.  Who was your conductor?  A.  S. E. Bell    Q.  And who were the brakemen on your train?  A.  Sam. Miller, and Frank Galbraith.    Q.  How long did you remain at Johnstown?  A.  Fifteen minutes, I think.    Q.  And where was the next stop made?  A.  At Conemaugh; we arrived there at 10.40.    Q.  And what took place when you got to Conemaugh? ( A.)  We backed in on the south freight siding; we only backed partway in, and we discovered that the track was half-washed out, and we pulled out again, and backed across to the second north siding west of the road crossing, and laid there as near as I can remember until about two o'clock, when pe [sic] pulled up on the second siding from the station, with our engines laying on the other side of the station.  Then we cut our helper off to clear the station crossing of somecars [sic] that were standing there.  After that, we put the hand brakes on the train, as we didn't know how long we were going to stay there, and made everything as safe as possible.  Second No. 8 then pulled up on the outside of us, next to Conemaugh town, and there was a limestone train laying on the other side of us.  We were laying between the limestone train and second Day Express.  We laid there until about 3.50 (3.48 or 3.50) when I heard an engine coming down the road, whistling as it came.  After that , the water followed?    A. [sic] Were you on your train?  A.  I was with my train all the time while we were there, except that I  went out to the river shore with the passengers, but I was never at any time further than a hundred yards from the hind end of my train.    Q.  At the time you heard the alarm whistle, had the water gotten over the bank?  A.  It was about level with the bank; it wasn't over it though.    Q.  How far was your train away from the river bank at that time?  A.  It was six track lengths away.    Q.  About what distance in yards?  A.  Between 30 and 40 yards, I would think; that was, at the rear end of the train.    Q.  Except for this great deluge of water that bore down there, was the train in a place of safety?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  Was the ground higher than the top of the river bank?  A.  No, sir, it was about on a level with it.    Q.  Had the river been rising very rapidly from the time you got there until you heard that alarm whistle?  A.  The river had been rising very fast until about noon, when it began to fall, and fell a few inches; then it raised [sic] again very rapidly, and took the township bridge away there acros s [sic] the river.  That was a wagon bridge right at Conemaugh station below the tower.  That was about 2.30, as near as I can remember.    Q.  Now, do you know how many people you had on your train?  A.  No,sir, [sic] I don't.  I know how many there were in the hind car; there were 26.    Q.  How many of them got out?  A.  22.    Q.  What became of the other four?  A.  The other four were drowned.    Q.  Had you time, or did you go to your train, after you heard that alarm whistle?  A.  I was on my train all the time.    Q.  What did you do?  A.  I went out on the platform, looked up, and saw what was the matter; I saw the wave coming, and saw it strike the bridge away up at the round house.    Q.  I thought you said the township bridge went about 2.20  A.  So it did; this was the railroad bridge.    Q.  You say you notified the passengers?  A.  ?  Yes sir, I went back and told them they had better go to the hills, and there were six men started.  I looked up on the other side, and the water was coming down around the curve I looked were we had to go, and then looked back in the car, and there were a lot of old ladies in there, and old gentleman and a couple young ladies, and I told them they had better stay where they were, as they couldn't make the hills, as they would have to cross second No. 8, go down over two high fences, across a deep ditch and go forty yards below the train towards Johnstown to get over those fences and ditch, and I told them to stay there.  Then I saw a lady going with a baby, and I helped her with the baby--    Q.  What became of her?  A.  I got her out on the hill; she was the last one to get out.  I passed on the way these two old ladies, a young man and a young lady, and a little after, I looked back and saw them go down, about thirty yards from the train.    Q.  How many passengers, if any, were there in the other cars?  A.  I couldn't say; I had been through the train a number of times to see if everything was all right, but I couldn't give the number of passengers in the train.     Q.  Did you see anything of the passengers in the car ahead of you?  A.  No, sir, I was at the rear end of the train.    Q.  Where was your conductor at this time that you gave this warning?  A.  I don't know; I believe he was on the Mail train; at least, that is where I understood him to say he was.    Q.  Did you see him come to the train, and give any warning:  A.  I did not.     Q.  If he had been there, could you have seen him?  A.  No, if he had been on the front part of the train, I couldn't have seen him.    Q.  You didn't see him then?  A.  No, sir.     Q.  How far was the hill that you reached, away from the train?  A.  I suppose it was 150 yards to a point of safety.    Q.  How long was the flood in passing by after you got out?  A.  About an hour and a half, I think; I wouldn't be positive.     Q.  Well, it was in that neighborhood?  A.  Yes, sir, about an hour and a half.    Q.  Then it commenced to fail very rapidly, did it?  A.  Yes, sir, it went down very fast.    Q.  And by night had it gotten in its banks again, or not?  A.  Yes, partly.  It had gone down so that we went down to the train, and got the passengers that had remained in the train and brought them ashore.  I found 15 of my passengers on my train.    Q.  That was after the flood had gone by?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  What car were they in?  A.  They were in P. & ?. C.   car 532.    Q.  Was that the last car on your train?  A.  Yes, sir.     Q.  Was it a passenger coach or a Pullman car?  A.  It was a passenger coach.    Q.  How do you account for them being saved?  A.  The water didn't wet the seats in the cars at all.  The windows were all down and    Q.  Was that the reason the water didn't come in?  A.  I think it was.  The first wave dashed over the tops of the cars.    Q.  Did you see them?  A.  Yes, sir, I saw the cars all the time.  The water about them was higher than the cars.    Q.  Did you see any of the cars take fire and burn up?  A.  When I went back, there was a car of li?e there which had floated against the sleeper of second No. 8, and was on fire.  The slack had set the car afire.  After I took our passengers out and took them to the hill, I went  back and worked with the rest of the crews until dark to get the fire out.  I left there, and put the Pullman cars in charge of Mr. Walkinshaw; he said he would send men to take charge of the cars, and watch that the fire didn't break out again;    Q.  Were the Pullman cars burnt?  A.  Yes, sir.    Q.  Was that before or after you quit work?  A.  After; it was the next morning about five o'clock.    Q.  Do you know how that occurred?  A.  No, sir; I wasn't on the train at that time.  Mr. Walkinshaw had taken charge of the train; and we went over to the church and staid [sic] there until about 11 o'clock, when a gentleman came there, and told as he could get us a bed, and we staid with him until the next morning after we got our breakfast, about 7 o'clock.    Q.  Do you know the man's name?  A.  I do not; he is the man who has the Post Office there, whoever time is.      Q.  What time did you leave Conemaugh?  A.  We left there the next morning about 9 o'clock with Mr. Trump and party, and walked to Johnstown.    Q.  Did you hear anything about the dam breaking while you were laying there at Conemaugh?  A.  Mr. Bell told me when he moved the train up that last time that it was thought the South Fork dam was  going to give  way.  That was the only official notice I had of it.    Q.  What time was that?  A.  That was about 2 O'clock.    Q.  What change did you make in the train there?  A.  We moved the train from west of the road crossing up to the station.     Q.  How much further about from the river?  A.  Well, I guess three tracks further away.    Q.  Now, did you communicate that to the passengers?  A.  I did, yes, sir.  I talked to the passengers at the time in all the cars, and about 20 minutes to three, it commenced to rain very hard, and a great many of the passengers who had left the train, came back again, and some said if it hadn't bursted [sic] yet, there wasn't much danger of it bursting for another hour.  A great many ralked [sic] that way.  Everybody appeared to be in a good humor, and shortly  after forgot all about it.    Q.  Did you have any idea that there was danger?  A.  I certainly did.    Q.  Had you any conversation with the operator?  A.  No, sir.     Q.  So that you did not get any direct information as to the condition of the South Fork dam?  A.  No, sir, I didn't.    Q.  The only information you got was from Mr. Bell, was it?  A.  That was the only information I got.    Q.  Why then did you think there was danger?  A.  The only thing that made me think there was danger was the moving of the train.  I can't say I thought there was any immediate danger, but when it commenced to rain so hard, I thought there was danger.    Q.  Did you think there would be any danger to the train when the dam did break?  A.  No, sir, I would have staid [sic] in the train myself if it hadn't been for the lady coming with the baby at the last minute.    Q.  Did you think there was any danger to the train after the dam did break?  A.  No, sir, I wouldn't have left the train if it hadn't been for the lady with the baby, and I knew she couldn't make the hill by herself.  I was standing there, and I told people that they had better not try it.  There were a great many old people there that I knew couldn't make the hill.  That was just before the wave struck the train.    Q.  Did the water catch you?  A.  The water caught us just as we got to the hill.  It caught the lady up to about the knees.

The two day event includes various living history demonstrations          such as camp life, military drill and a re-enactment of the Federal assault          on the center of the Confederate line.          Camps will be open to the          public to tour until dark, and will feature re-enactors going about the          daily business of cooking, cleaning, and tending to things military. Walking          tours are given each day. Visitors are encouraged to enter the camps and          interact with the re-enactors. Don’t ask them about twentieth century          gadgets or issues, because for these two days they have assumed the lives          of nineteenth century soldiers, whose president is Abraham Lincoln.         This re-enactment is hosted          by Company A of the 36th Virginia Infantry, West Virginia’s oldest          and most authentic living history organization. The event attracts hundreds          of the country’s best Civil War re-enactors from several states and          has been called one of the finest small re-enactments in the eastern United          States.

The National Park Service is offering a new tour of Flood related sites this summer.  The route is currently unmarked and difficult to discern while travelling, so this guided tour provides a unique opportunity to see how the floodwaters travelled to Johnstown, without following complicated road directions.  Descriptions provided by the on board guide help you understand the events and feel the power and tragedy of the Flood.  The Park Service offers this van tour Thursdays through Mondays until Saturday, August 10.  There are no tours on Tuesdays or Wednesdays.   Take this tour starting at noon at the Johnstown Flood National Memorial in St. Michael and stand on what remains of the South Fork Dam, which burst on May 31, 1889 despite valiant last minute efforts to fortify it.  The failed dam unleashed a raging torrent that destroyed the city of Johnstown and killed over two thousand people.  You will visit the Clubhouse of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club and glimpse the lives of the wealthy owners of the dam, who retreated there from Pittsburgh to beat the summer heat.  You will travel through all the local boroughs that the waters destroyed along the twenty-mile path of the Flood before arriving in Johnstown.  At the Heritage Discovery Center you will hear the stories of Johnstown's people through the eyes of immigrants.  You will pass through Grandview Cemetery where many of the victims where laid to rest, look back at the path of the Flood from the top of the Johnstown Incline, and ponder its destructive force.  The tour returns to the Flood Memorial at 4:30.  It is a good idea to eat lunch before the program begins.  Snacks and refreshments are available at the Discovery Center and the Incline.   The cost of the program is $8.50 for adults, $7.50 for seniors and $4 for children 6-16 years.  Children 5 and under are free.  The fee covers admission to the Flood Memorial and Heritage Discovery Center.

GX119-87-15372392	Testimony of Congressman John P.  Murtha    before  the         SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE RESOURCES COMMITTEE ON NATIONAL PARKS, RECREATION AND PUBLIC LANDS          On HR 1521, “Johnstown Flood National Memorial Boundary Adjustment Act of 2003” To provide for additional lands to be included within the boundary of the Johnstown Flood National Memorial in the State of Pennsylvania, and for other purposes.         Tuesday, June 23, 2003              Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the Committee for bringing this bill up for consideration so quickly in this Congress.         This bill will authorize the expansion of the Johnstown Flood National Memorial, a National Park Service site in South Fork, Pennsylvania.         Specifically, the bill will enable the National Park Service (NPS) to acquire adjacent properties and historically significant structures that are an integral part of the story of the Johnstown Flood.         The Great Johnstown Flood, which occurred on May 31, 1889, was the largest news story in the era next to the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.    It swept away an entire city, causing the loss of over 2,209 people.    Though members of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, which owned the earthen dam and was situated above it, worked feverishly during the storm to prevent the dam from bursting, their efforts were futile.            The Johnstown Flood Memorial was dedicated in 1964.    Today the park consists of 165 acres and receives over 126,000 visitors annually.    It preserves the remains of the old South Fork Dam which was breached in the flood, as well as portions of the former Conemaugh Lake bed.         This bill would authorize the purchase or acquisition by NPS, from willing sellers, an additional approximately 14 ½ acres.    This property holds certain related historic structures such as the “Moorhead Cottage” and the “Clubhouse.”    Both of these are  significant to the story of the Johnstown Flood as they represent the life and role of club members both before and after the flood.    The property offers a unique opportunity to use tangible resources to interpret the events that led to the Johnstown Flood, and the club members’ response to the Flood.           Should the Subcommittee move this bill forward, I would request that the bill and related map be amended to exclude the .25 acre parcel owned by Richard Martyak, as he is no longer a willing seller.         I appreciate the Committee’s consideration of this bill.    Thank you for your time.

May 1st was spent in a classroom setting. After introductions each Region and TSC gave an overview of the activities in their respective offices.     The Great Plains Region was not represented and they were missed. However, since TSC is within the GP Region boundaries they took the liberty of presenting those activities that they are aware of on behalf of the Region.     Ten technical papers were given. A list of papers and authors is appended to this review so that anyone wishing to contact authors for further information or discussion may do so. An attendance roster with phone numbers and email addresses is also attached.     The morning sessions centered around advances in computer technology in the ground water and drainage arena. After lunch Chuck Hennig, RSC Research Coordinator, gave a brief summary of Reclamation research activities and conducted a survey to get a sense of direction for future research needs as seen by the group.     This was followed by papers on plastic pipe drain issues, well drilling, and coupling of surface and ground water models.     The final presentation of the day was an introduction to the Elwha River Restoration Project. This laid the foundation for the field trip on May 2nd. There are numerous ground water components in the restoration project. Wells near the reservoirs may go dry as water table levels fall. Some wells within the flood plain may be subject to surface flooding after the dams are removed. A ground water collection system of some sort may replace Elwha Diversion Dam that supplies water to a local mill. Reclamation Ground Water and Drainage personnel have been addressing these issues.     The group toured the project with stops at Elwha Dam and Power Plant which was constructed from 1910 to 1912 and is still in operation. The power plant requires the operator to manually perform many tasks which is  different from the modern automated power plants of today.  The dam and power plant will be removed as part of the restoration project.     The next stop was at Glines Canyon Dam built in 1926 a few miles upstream from Elwha Dam and within the boundaries of Olympic National Park. Glines Canyon Dam will be breeched but the spillway structure will be preserved as an historic monument and tourist attraction. The tour of the dams was led by Rick Parker who operates the dams and power plant and will oversee their removal.     The third stop was at Elwha Diversion Dam where we observed drilling in preparation for aquifer tests to be used in decision making as to the type of replacement structure (i.e. infiltration gallery or Ranney collector) to supply municipal and industrial water during dam removal. .     The next stop was at the State Rearing Channel and City of Port Angeles Ranney Collector, where box lunches were provided. The final stop was on the Lower Elwha Reservation where we discussed ground water impacts to on-site septic systems from anticipated higher ground water levels after dam removal.     The TSC would like to thank Joe Spinazola and Kayti Didricksen for their super efforts in organizing and leading the workshop. WELL DONE!

GX032-22-14459043	Suffolk Mills Turbine Exhibit          Lowell National Historical  Park          National Park Service          U.S. Department of the Interior         PDF          of Park Brochure          The Suffolk  Mills survive today as a reminder of Lowell’s once-great cotton textile industry.  The Suffolk Mills Turbine Exhibit tells the story of how water provided power  for the mills. It also highlights the changes in waterpower technology and the  important work of Lowell’s nationally renowned engineers, whose turbine designs  are still used today.          Mills and Waterpower   Throughout much of the 19th century, American manufacturers  favored waterpower over steam to run machinery in their factories. Of the many  waterpower developments, the one on the Merrimack River at Lowell, Massachusetts,  proved highly important in industrializing America.           Investors in Lowell’s  mills selected the Merrimack site because of the abundant waterpower potential  at Pawtucket Falls, where, over the course of one mile, the river plunged 32 feet.  In 1822, workers began constructing a power canal system that became one of the  largest of its kind in the world. Soon after completing the canals and first mill  buildings in 1823, Lowell was the nation’s leading producer of textiles and  employed the largest number of factory workers in America.          Suffolk Mills   Incorporated in 1831, the Suffolk Manufacturing Company  constructed a cotton textile mill on the Western Canal. On the opposite side of  this waterway stood the Tremont Mills. Both mill complexes were completed in 1832.  About 40 years later the two companies merged and formed the Tremont and Suffolk  Manufacturing Company.          The appearance  of the Suffolk Mills changed radically over its 100 years of operation as older  buildings were replaced with newer ones. The most dramatic alterations occurred  during the Civil War when the North and South severed the cotton trade. Realizing  that they could gain greater profits by selling their raw cotton than by weaving  cloth, Lowell's mill owners emptied their cotton warehouses and closed their mills.            After the Suffolk  Manufacturing Company closed the factory, it tore down most of the original mill  buildings and constructed a more modern factory. It opened again soon after the  end of the Civil War. Today, the only surviving building of the original 1830s  construction is the countinghouse, which served as the mill agent’s office.          Belts and Pulleys   To provide power for the Suffolk Mills’ machinery,  water from the Western Canal flowed through an opening in the wall of the mill  and fell onto a large waterwheel mounted in the basement. The weight of the falling  water turned the wheel, converting the potential energy, or stored energy, of  falling water into kinetic energy, or moving energy.          To transfer power  from the waterwheel to the textile machines, the earliest mills used a network  of rotating gears and shafting. This method tended to be slow, noisy, and jarring,  with frequent breakdowns.           In 1828, Lowell  master mechanic Paul Moody devised a leather belt and pulley system. A drive pulley  or flywheel to transferred power from a main shaft to smaller line shafts, and  then to the machines. The use of belts and pulleys allowed for a smoother and  more efficient transfer of power with fewer breakdown periods. Soon, drive pulleys  and leather belting became standard in mills throughout the United States.          Turbines   In 1837 a young, British-born engineer, James Bicheno  Francis, became chief engineer of the company that owned and operated Lowell’s  waterpower system. Francis sought more precise methods of measuring water used  by the mills, but also undertook studies to find more efficient “hydraulic  motors” for harnessing waterpower. In the 1840s, he and Boston-based consulting  engineer Uriah Boyden began experimenting with a new kind of waterwheel, called  a turbine, that originated from the work of French engineers and Boyden.          The original waterwheels,  known as breastwheels, that powered Lowell’s mills rotated when water poured  onto them and filled their buckets. The weight of the falling water on the buckets  thus drove the wheels. By contrast, turbines rotated as the falling water was  conducted into them, striking the metal veins that spiraled around a central shaft.  Whereas breastwheels achieved efficiencies of at most 65%, the turbines tested  by Francis and Boyden reached an efficiency of 88%.          Francis continued  experimenting with turbines, refining the design of an inward-flow turbine developed  by an American named Samuel Howd in 1838. Francis' experiments on turbines led  to the mixed-flow reaction turbine, which became the American standard. The widely  used “Francis turbine” was named in his honor. To international acclaim,  Francis published his important work on hydraulic engineering in The Lowell Hydraulic  Experiments in 1855.          Beginning in 1853,  the Suffolk Manufacturing Company began installing turbines designed by Uriah  Boyden in the wheel pits of a new picker house. Although this picker house was  demolished and Suffolk Mills’ Building #6 was constructed, the company retained  the 1853 wheel pits. One of these wheel pits houses the turbine exhibit of Lowell  National Historical Park.          New Power Sources   By the 1850s, tall, brick smokestacks began appearing  alongside the mills in Lowell, signaling the arrival of steam power. The Suffolk  Mills installed its first steam engine by 1860, allowing the factory to expand  production without relying on waterpower. By 1875, Lowell’s mills used more  steam power than waterpower.          Newer, more efficient  Francis turbines built by the Victor-Standard Company replaced the four original  Boyden turbines in the Suffolk Mills. Installed in 1897, these turbines were half  the size of the Boyden turbines, but equally powerful. The smaller size of these  Francis turbines, which remain in place today, also permitted the installation  of two turbines in each wheel pit, thus increasing power generation.          By 1910,  Lowell’s textile mills began to use hydroelectricity. Ten years later, the  Suffolk Mills had installed several generators for this purpose. These generators  were connected to the high-speed Victor-Standard turbines, continuing the use  of waterpower into the 20th century. One of these generators is on display in  the basement of the Suffolk Mills.             The Tremont and Suffolk Manufacturing Company closed its  doors and sold the facility in 1926. The mill continued to operate under various  owners, ending its days in the textile industry as the Wannalancit Mill, which  closed in 1981.                 Today, one          restored turbine demonstrates how waterpower was harnessed and transferred          to machinery. When operating, the turbine uses a 13-foot drop of water          that flows through the penstock and into the turbine, causing it to rotate.          The rotational motion is transferred through shafts, gears, belts, and          pulleys to a power loom that represents the hundreds of looms that once          operated there. A park ranger demonstrates the operation of this power          loom during guided tours.

Explore the kitchen, dining  room, and bedrooms of a reconstructed corporation boardinghouse furnished in the  style of the 1850s. Listen to conversations of 19th-century women workers whose  experiences are brought to life by an audio program. Enter the social and cultural  worlds of Lowell’s diverse ethnic groups, dating from the first Irish laborers  in the 1820s to recent Southeast Asian emigres.         The  Working People Exhibit tells the human story of the Industrial Revolution by featuring  the experiences of Lowell’s working people. The exhibit is housed in the  Patrick J. Mogan Cultural Center, 40 French Street, in a reconstructed corporation  boardinghouse.          The Boardinghouses   Incorporated as a town in 1826, Lowell grew to contain  numerous water-powered factories, as well as boardinghouses for its workers. To  attract and meet the basic needs of a varied workforce, the textile corporations  built low-cost, communal living units. Early boardinghouses in Lowell and other  New England mill towns were two-and-a-half-story, whitewashed duplexes made of  wood. By the mid-1830s, three-and-a-half-story brick rowhouses, reflecting the  now more familiar Lowell boardinghouse design, became the norm. These dwellings  housed 20 to 40 people and contained a kitchen, a dining room and parlor, a keeper’s  quarters, and up to ten bedrooms. Row after row of boardinghouse blocks visually  distinguished Lowell from earlier New England mill towns.          The majority  of the residents in Lowell’s boardinghouses were single, female wage-earners  employed in the city’s textile mills. Known as “mill girls,” these  young women hailed largely from New England’s rural villages and farms. They  lived in closely supervised corporation-controlled boardinghouses. The textile  corporation managers sought control over their workers not only inside the mills,  but also within the community. Their paternalistic practices extended to the moral  guardianship and physical care of the young factory women.             Boardinghouse Life   Under this early form of corporate paternalism, the millworkers’  behavior came under the watchful eyes of the boardinghouse keepers. The corporations  required the keepers to report any unacceptable conduct to mill managers. Intemperance,  rowdiness, illicit relations with men, and “habitual absence from worship  on the Sabbath” were grounds for dismissal from the factory and removal from  the boardinghouse. The keepers were also responsible for purchasing or renting  everything needed to furnish a house and feed its occupants. Room and board costs,  which ranged from $1.25 to $1.50 per week during the 1830s and 1840s, were deducted  from wages. For this amount, workers received three meals a day, limited laundry  service, and a bed in a shared room.           Most mill workers  shared living space with relatives, friends from home villages, and strangers.  Their bedrooms provided little privacy.     Typically four to six people slept in a room and often  two women shared a double bed. Despite the overcrowded conditions, communal living  in the boardinghouses fostered close bonds between working women and helped new  hires adjust to factory toil and city life. Although boardinghouse keepers were  employed by the corporations, they functioned as small businessmen and women.          Transitions   The boardinghouses remained an important part of the Lowell  factory system through the late 19th and early 20th century. During these decades,  Lowell’s textile corporations expanded their mills and improved their housing,  adding such features as indoor plumbing, central heating and other amenities.  The mill workers who lived in the boardinghouses, however, were increasingly foreign-born  men and women. While the first workers in Lowell were of English, Scottish, and  Irish descent, later workers included French-Canadian, Greek, and Portuguese immigrants,  as well as immigrants from Poland and other Eastern European countries. They took  up the many unskilled jobs in the mills. Immigrant workers, often in family groups,  predominated as boardinghouse residents. By 1900, male boardinghouse residents  outnumbered female, a remarkable departure from Lowell’s first few decades  of industrial development.          End of an Era   Changing social values and competitive capitalism rendered  old forms of paternalism obsolete. When corporations found boardinghouse maintenance  too expensive, they began selling off the buildings, converting them to storage  facilities or demolishing them to make way for warehouses or other structures.  The Boott Mills’ corporation housing continued to be home to mill workers  and their families long after the Yankee “mill girls” ceased to be the  major part of the labor force.             The boardinghouse  system continued well into the 20th century, becoming mainly privately-run, family  tenement housing, before finally expiring along with Lowell’s textile industry.  Neglect and urban renewal resulted in the loss of almost all of Lowell’s  boardinghouses.                The Boott          Cotton Mills, incorporated in 1835, originally built eight rows of boardinghouses          directly across from its factory. Each row of dwellings contained four          boardinghouse units in the center and a tenement unit on each end. Unmarried          textile operatives lived in the boardinghouse units, while supervisors          and skilled workers lived with their families in the tenement sections.          Unlike the boardinghouse units, which resembled dormitories, the tenements          were more like apartments with individual kitchen facilities. Of brick          construction, the boardinghouse rows measured 150 feet long, 36 feet wide,          and were built in the early Georgian style. Their uniform appearance,          which was visually enhanced by the lines of tall chimneys, gable-roof          dormers, and symmetrically placed windows, expressed the Boott corporation’s          desire for orderliness and rigid discipline.

GX048-41-6103423	"Intro     Author     Subject     Volume     Volume/Title     NPS              Volume II - No. 5       May, 1939           UNIQUE ARCHEOLOGICAL MUSEUM COMPLETED   Alabama, CCC and Service Share in Erecting Structure at Ancient Mounds    By Herbert Evison,  Assistant Regional Director.    To the accompaniment of several brief oratorical flights, delivered under a benign Alabama sun, the Moundville museum, in Mound State Monument, constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps with materials provided chiefly by the CCC, was dedicated and thrown open to the public on the afternoon of May 16. The opening of its heavy bronze doors to a gathering which had just listened to the dedicatory speeches marked the culminating point in an effort which has extended over many years -- an undertaking whose success is attributable to many, but which centers chiefly in the person in Dr. Walter B. Jones, Director of the Alabama State Museum of Natural History, State Geologist and at present Commissioner of Conservation.    Of monolithic reinforced concrete construction, the new museum, designed to aid in the interpretation of one of the most remarkable archeological sites in America, backs upon and looks out from a group of a score of ancient mounds, the highest of which rise 65 feet above the plain, and across the valley of the Black Warrior River which forms the northern boundary of the Monument.         NEW MUSEUM OF ARCHEOLOGY, MOUND STATE MONUMENT, MOUNDVILLE, ALABAMA  The upper photograph shows the facade of the monolithic concrete structure and below are some of the 2,000 persons present at the dedication.    As previously reported in  The Review  [Vol. I, No. 5, pp. 7-8], the principal of the museum's unique features is that its two wings shelter groups of exposed burials which, from the standpoint of museum design and display, are happily placed. In the two groups lie what remains of no less than 37 skeletons with the pottery and other artifacts that were buried with them, all in exactly the position in which the excavators discovered them, on pedestals of the earth on which they lay, and with the surrounding soil excavated down to undisturbed ""hardpan.""    These burials  in situ  form the principal  raison d'être  for the museum structure. A good cemetery having been located, the entire area was excavated and all material except that lying within two 20' by 20' squares was removed. The material remaining was covered with temporary structures and the permanent museum constructed over and around the wooden shelters. Upon completion of the building these were removed. Surrounded on three sides by a parapet and walkway, and on the fourth by the wall separating the wings from the central section, each pit is lighted on all four sides by tubular lamps concealed beneath the cap of the parapet. The two groups of burials chosen are excellent for several reasons. They show the bodies lying in almost all the typical positions characteristic of the Moundville area; some were surrounded by a great variety of artifacts, others by none at all; in one place, four bodies were laid one on top of another.    The large center section of the building is devoted to the story of the Moundville dwellers as it has been revealed by the extensive excavations that have been carried on in the area. As was to be expected by anyone familiar with the archeological displays in the Alabama State Museum of Natural History at Tuscaloosa, 17 miles away, the displays in this central unit of the new museum set a high standard of effectiveness One is particularly impressed with the studious avoidance of ""overload.""       Due to the sensitive nature of this photo, this image of burial remains has been eliminated from the on-line edition of this document.                               At the top is a view of the exposed south burial pit as it appeared in August, 1936.  At the left center Mr. Fechner is giving to Dr. Jones the key to the museum doors.  Above is seen an aboriginal Moundville hunting and fishing display, and at the left is shown the ingenious mould described in the accompanying article.        James T. DeJarnette who, as Superintendent of the CCC camp which brought the museum to completion, has so valuably complemented the services of his archeologist brother David, representing the State Museum in the work, says of the new displays:       They are arranged in a logical sequence so designed as to give (1) the casual visitor something to remember, (2) the careful visitor a rather intimate knowledge of the Monument, and (3) the expert a few salient facts about the primitive Moundvillians which would require him some time to determine otherwise. Conservatism has been stressed in the wording of all descriptive label material. Color has been freely used in the make-up of labels to reduce the monotony of an apparently endless series of black and white descriptive matter.    The six wall cases on the front of the building are divided by the entrance into two groups of three cases each. One of these groups is devoted to physical features of the Monument. The other three cases depict a brief story of prehistoric mankind, his origins, migrations and physical characteristics.    The eight wall cases along the rear wall are arranged serially to illustrate the cultural traits of the early Moundvillians, treating the following cultural manifestations: Architecture and House Life, Ceremonial Complex, Costume and Dress, Agriculture, Fishing and Hunting, Tobacco and Smoking, and Economic and Artistic Complex.    Five table cases and a relief model of the Monument complete the displayed materials. The table cases are devoted to the everyday activities of the people. The relief model shows the mound group with various excavated areas indicated thereon. Space has been reserved at each end of the center room for two dioramas showing a reconstructed family group and a model village site. . .       The finished appearance of the exhibits viewed by visitors on the dedication day resulted from work days of 18 to 20 hours, during the three days preceding the ceremony, by a staff of State Museum personnel headed by David DeJarnette, and by James DeJarnette and members of his supervisory personnel. Every exhibit was in order, explained by neatly hand-lettered labels.    Features of the exterior of the building, both visible in the accompanying photographs, are the frieze extending around the entire periphery of the central section, and the decorative design above the door. (I was about to say ""the main entrance,"" but there is only a single entrance to the museum. The basement, in which the heating and ventilating apparatus is installed, is reached only by a separate outside entrance. The building has no windows.) Of this interesting type of CCC undertaking, Superintendent DeJarnette points out:       Ornamentation of the doorway and frieze was obtained with the use of plaster waste moulds constructed on the job. The ornamentation was enlarged exactly from designs found on artifacts by making a rubbing of the original design and projecting the image on a screen of detail paper to full scale.    The full size detail was then modeled in clay from which the plaster waste mould was struck. The frieze design consisted of a motif repeated 58 times around the periphery of the structure. One model was constructed, a waste mould struck and a reverse master mould was obtained from the waste mould. From the master mould enough waste moulds were constructed to form half the frieze. Careful stripping of the moulds from the concrete and the absence of undercuts in the design enabled us to re-use the entire set of 29 moulds. Private construction experts predicted this could not be done. . .                                 Mounds O, P and R and the temporary shelters protecting the two excavated burial pits are seen in the upper photograph.  At the left center is one of the exhibits in the museum.  The speaker at the right is Dr. Jones.  In the lower corner are some of the CCC enrollees who built the novel museum structure.              The manner in which the waste moulds were used in conjunction with masonite forming is shown in one of the photographs on page 4. Mr. DeJarnette says further:       All exterior walls of the museum are 9 inches thick with a 2-inch air space between the concrete and a 4-inch clay tile. Interior walls are 5/8-inch gypsum plaster, sand float finished. The floor is a concrete slab laid over a well tamped fill and supported by wall footings and concrete floor beams. The roof of the center room is 4-1/2-inch concrete slab; other rooms are of concrete joist and slab construction, formed with ribbed metal pan tile.    All exterior concrete was placed against oiled masonite-lined forms. Concrete in exposed roof slabs and interior beams and columns was placed against masonite-lined forms treated with two coats of shellac before oiling.    The building is heated with a forced air type furnace. Due to the lack of openings a mechanical ventilating system was indicated. This consists of an 18,000 C. F. M. blower fan discharging air from a basement opening into the main floor through six grilled vents connected to a 2-foot 6-inch by 7-foot 8-inch concrete duct running longitudinally under the building.    All lighting is artificial with inconspicuous rectangular opal glass ceiling fixtures for general illumination. . .       While he who moves slowly may read and get the story the museum is trying to tell, the plan of operation contemplates that virtually all visitation shall be guided. A small fee is to be charged to all who enter the Monument, and this will entitle them to view the mounds, the reconstructed prehistoric lakes and one or two small exposed burial groups located away from the museum. A slightly larger charge will be imposed on those who wish to enter and be guided through the museum.    The dedication ceremonies were brief, perhaps an hour long, with the principal address by Dr. George H. Denny, Chancellor of the University of Alabama, and short talks by Conrad L. Wirth, Supervisor of Recreation and Land Planning for the National Park Service, Dr. Halsey, Fourth Corps Area Educational Adviser, and the writer. Robert Fechner, Director of the Civilian Conservation Corps, made a short speech extolling the work of the enrollees, and presented the key to the bronze doors of the museum to Dr. Jones, who accepted them in characteristically jocular fashion. Some 2,000 persons were in attendance.    Much work remains to be done around the exterior of the structure and elsewhere in the 260-acre monument area. There are work and service roads to be eliminated, other roads to be built, with archeological investigation on the line of the road to precede its construction; completion of excavation, and filling from artesian wells of the prehistoric lakes; construction of a contact station, service residences and other service buildings; further erosion control work, and a variety of other jobs. But Dr. Jones is breathing more easily. He has the principal thing he was aiming at, and archeologists exploring the site 2,000 years from now are quite likely to find most of it still there. It was built to last.                    <<<   Previous     >   Contents   <     Next   >>>          http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/regional_review/vol2-5b.htm  Date: 04-Jul-2002"

The National Park Service is offering a tour of the Allegheny Portage Railroad and the 1889 Johnstown Flood.  Both tours will start on Sunday, June 15 and continue through Saturday, August 23.  Both tours start at 12 noon and end around 4:30p.m.  Transportation and tour guide are provided free of charge, however, there are admission fees at two of the sites for each tour.       The tour starting at Allegheny Portage Railroad National Historic Site will explore an exceptional story combining engineering, steam engines, and canal boats of the early and mid 1800's.   The tour will begin at the visitor center and includes stops at the newly opened Hollidaysburg Canal Basin Park, the famous Horseshoe Curve National Historic Landmark and the Gallitzin Tunnels.  The cost of admission to Allegheny Portage Railroad is $3.00 for adults.  Children age 16 and under are free.  The Horseshoe Curve admission is $3.00 for adults and $1.50 for children age 6-17.  This program is offered Wednesday through Sunday.   The tour of the Johnstown Flood begins at the visitor center of the Johnstown Flood National Memorial.  Participants will visit the remains of the South Fork Dam, which burst on May 31, 1889 despite valiant last minute efforts to fortify it.  The failed dam unleashed a raging torrent that destroyed the city of Johnstown and killed over two thousand people.  Participants will visit the Clubhouse of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club as well as travel through many of the local boroughs that the waters destroyed along the twenty-mile path of the Flood.  At the Johnstown Flood Museum, visitors will hear stories of the survivors of the Flood and visit Grandview Cemetery where many of the victims were laid to rest. Participants will also get an exceptional view of the path of the Flood from the top of the Johnstown Incline.   The price of admission to Johnstown Flood National Memorial is $3.00 for adults and children 16 and under are free at the National Park site.  The Johnstown Flood Museum fees are $4.00 per adult, $3.00 for each child age 6-17 and $3.50 for seniors age 62+.      This tour is offered Thursday through Monday.   Since each tour starts at 12:00 it is a good idea to eat lunch before the tour begins. However, snacks and refreshments are available at a couple of stops on each tour.These tours are a partnership between the National Park Service, The National Park Foundation and the Student Conservation Association, and are made possible through the generous support of the Ford Motor Company.

Its title  ""KENTUCKY: ENTERING THE GREAT         VALLEY""  symbolizes the entrance of settlers from the         Atlantic seacoast into the Ohio Valley, which was the entering         wedge for the occupation of the Mississippi Valley, the heart of         the continent.            In the 1770’s streams of settlers entered the valley by way         of the Ohio River, by way of the road which Daniel Boone, in the         employ of Judge Richard Henderson, cut from the mountain pass         into the heart of Kentucky, and from North Carolina to what is         now Tennessee.            The last mentioned was the first chronologically, but it was         Clark’s leadership in organizing the settlers at Harrodsburg, in         forming the county of Virginia, and in securing provision for         its defense by Virginia that insured the permanent occupation of         the country south of the Ohio River.

GX235-70-8901626	STATE ROCKS   Vermont's complex geology has led to the development of a diverse and economically healthy minerals industry which began in Vermont over 200 years ago.  Because three of Vermont's rocks are equally important to the state's economy, all three - granite, marble and slate - were formally recognized as State Rocks by Act No. 221 of 1992.  Granite is an igneous rock found along the entire length of the eastern part of the state.  It is mainly composed of feldspar, quartz and mica.  The granite from Barre is world-famous, and the Westmore-Morse Quarry in Barre is the world's largest monumental granite quarry.  Vermont granite is exported to many states and countries for use as building stone and is prominent in the Vermont State Capitol.  Marble, a metamorphic rock composed of the mineral calcite, can generally be found in southwestern Vermont.  The marble quarry in Danby is the world's largest underground quarry, covering twenty acres.  Vermont marble ranges in color from pure white to black.  It has been used in building Radio City Music Hall, the National Art Gallery, the Jefferson Memorial and the Vermont State Capitol.  Slate is a metamorphic rock found in southwestern Vermont.  It is formed by the compaction and heating of clay, silt or mud.  Vermont slate varies in color from red, green, black and purple.  Because it splits into thin slabs, slate is used for roofing shingles, sidewalks and floor tiles.     -------        from Office of the Secretary of State, Vermont Legislative Directory   and State Manual, Biennial Session, 1993-1994, p. 23.

Having developed                  the country's first working power loom, Lowell, with fellow Bostonians                  Patrick Tracy Jackson and Nathan Appleton, established the Boston                  Manufacturing Company along the Charles River in Waltham in 1814.

Capitalized at $400,000, the Waltham mill dwarfed its                  competition. The power loom and related machinery permitted the                  combination of all the steps in the production of cloth under                  a single roof. Instead of relying on traditional family labor,                  the company recruited young single women from the surrounding                  countryside. So great were the profits at Waltham that the Boston                  Associates soon looked for new sites, first at East Chelmsford                  (renamed Lowell), and then Chicopee, Manchester, and Lawrence.                  The ""Waltham-Lowell system"" succeeded beyond their expectations,                  giving the Boston Associates control of a fifth of America's cotton                  production by 1850.                 Their profits permitted this tight-knit group of families - Appletons,                  Cabots, Lowells, Lawrences, Jacksons - to build an economic, social,                  and political empire. They helped develop the Boston and Lowell                  Railroad and other railroad lines in New England. They owned controlling                  stock in a host of Boston financial institutions, allowing them                  to finance and insure ventures through their own companies. As                  their fortunes grew, the Boston Associates turned to -philanthropy-establishing                  hospitals and schools-and to politics, playing a prominent role                  in the Whig Party in Massachusetts.

As more jobs were created, few could see that the end of Lowell's prosperity was  near, or that by 1930 the city's once vital economy would grind to a virtual halt.   There were early signs, but one had to look  beyond the production numbers to see them. For several decades after the Civil  War, Lowell's textile production had increased steadily, but after 1890 total  employment slipped, declining from 17,000 in 1895 to less than 14,000 in 1918.  Technological advances made possible gains in output even while mills trimmed  their workforce.   Lowell mill owners knew as early as the 1890s  that their mills were aging, becoming increasingly noncompetitive. Yet mill management  chose not to modernize their Lowell operations. They either took their operations  elsewhere or used the profits from their Lowell mills to finance modern textile  plants in the South.   Southern community and business leaders eager  for development actively promoted industrialization by emphasizing the region's  advantages of abundant land, cheaper labor, energy sources, lower taxes, and transportation.  Promoters also promised New England investors company towns free of union influences  and restrictive laws concerning the health and safety of industrial workers. Lowell  and other New England mill towns experienced an early version of the capital flight  that plagued communities in the northeast and the Midwestern industrial heartland  in the 1970s and 1980s.   As early as World War 1, Lowell firms began  to fail or leave town. The Bigelow Carpet Company (formerly Lowell Manufacturing  Company, one of the first textile firms in the city) departed in 1914, and Middlesex  Mills ceased production in 1918. Other companies took over their plants, but these  closings were the first by firms that were part of Lowell's founding almost a  century earlier. Then in 1926 came a wave of closings. The Hamilton Company went  into receivership, followed by Suffolk, Tremont, and Massachusetts Mills. The  Appleton Company moved production to the South, and operations at the Saco-Lowell  Shop (formerly the Lowell Machine Shop) shifted north to Maine. By the mid-1930s,  of Lowell's first large mills, only the Merrimack, Lawrence, and Boott were still  in operation.   The Depression came early to Lowell and stayed.  By 1936 total textile employment had dropped to 8,000, only slightly more than  it had been a century earlier. Many mills stood empty; others housed a number  of small manufacturing firms. Entire mill complexes were demolished, or sections  lopped off, to reduce taxes. Parts of Lowell looked like a war ravaged city.   Families coped as best they could with unemployment  during the Depression. One Polish-born worker described how her family survived:  ""during the summer, dandelion greens were our diet; during the winter we  ate hard bread, sweetened with sugar if we were lucky. . . . On rare occasions  we would sell something we owned to buy a little meat."" Children quit school  and took what work they could find. Jobs were scarce, though, and employers often  took advantage and made increasing demands on those fortunate enough to be working.  Even those with jobs had no assurance of regular work. One former mill worker  recalled the Depression:      Many  days I walk into the mill, and [the boss] puts his hands up, ""No work today.  "" Home you go. They wouldn't tell you anything. You go back the next day,  the same thing. The whole week. Wouldn't even tell you if there was no work tomorrow.  They waited till you got there.      As the few remaining large mills increased  production in the late 1930s, workers responded to the escalating demands made  on them. The mills' ""stretch-out""-the practice of increasing the workload  for the same wage by assigning more machines to workers-recalled a similar demand  made on female workers in the 1840s. It had helped drive the Yankee women out  of the mills, and it was equally resented by workers a century later. They wanted  paid vacations, denied even to those who had been with the company for decades.  They asked for improved working conditions, which were hardly better than in the  mid-19th century. Yvonne Hoar, who worked in Lowell in the twenties and thirties,  recalled what it was like in the Merrimack Mills weave room:       It was  the noisiest room you could ever be in. There’s machines going and shuttles  going back and forth, and sometimes they'd fly off and they were pointed things  and if they ever hit you, boy, you'd know it ....   The whole place vibrates. When I come out of there at night I was shaking;  I was still in the mill ...  then they put me up in the finishing room.  .  . .  They were doubling up all the machines so it made that much more work ....   There we got 13 dollars a week. No matter who you are or where you were in  the mill, you got thirteen dollars a week.  ...  You really didn't need names,  because everyone got thirteen dollars a week. Wouldn't do you any good to complain   ...  they were so petrified for their jobs in them days, it was pitiful.      When a union was formed in 1938 to bargain  with the Merrimack Mills, women played a significant role in organizing the workers,  as their forerunners had a century earlier. After their demands for better wages  and working conditions were rejected, they went on strike. Confronted with strikebreakers  and called Communists, they had to live on meager strike funds. But far-off events  shifted the balance in their favor. War was approaching in Europe and the Federal  government was pressuring the mills for cloth. The owners capitulated after seven  weeks and the workers returned to the mills.   World War II quickened Lowell's economy.  The remaining textile mills in the city-Merrimack, Boott, Ames (the old Lawrence  Company), and several others-increased employment dramatically, while the departure  of  men  for military service brought more women into the labor force. The  workers could command better wages as other firms with military contracts-Remington,  General Electric, and U.S. Rubber-competed with the mills for Lowell workers.   The wartime demand for labor seemed to bring  an end to the depression in Lowell that had begun with the mill closings in 1926.  Wages shot upward. A typical starting figure of $13 a week in the mills in 1938  rose to $29 by 1943. Earnings in munitions factories were greater still, reaching  an average of $37 at Remington for a 48-hour week in 1943.   The boom proved only temporary for Lowell.  When the war ended in 1945, orders for munitions and textiles fell off, and the  city lapsed into its old economic doldrums. It was clear that the textile industry  would not lead Lowell back to prosperity. The city's fortunes were at their lowest  in the post-war years with the closing of the Boott and Merrimack mills in the  1950s. The latter's mills and boardinghouses soon fell victim to the urban renewal  programs of the 1960s, along with the tenement neighborhood of Little Canada.  Mill employment all but disappeared, and nothing had yet taken its place. The  remaining mill buildings seemed to be bleak reminders of an era of hard work and  meager reward. For many residents, remembering the past stirred up feelings of  anger and abandonment.   In the 1960s a group of Lowell citizens devised  a strategy to revitalize the community, transform the educational system, and  stimulate the local economy. Working with urban planners and historians, they  laid out a plan for redevelopment based on Lowell's architectural and cultural  heritage. Among their proposals was one for a historical park that would present  the city as a living museum.   Pragmatic alliances marked this movement  from the beginning. Political and business leaders offered support. In 1972 the  city council endorsed the idea. Out of this unprecedented cooperation emerged  Lowell Heritage State Park in 1974, Lowell National Historical Park in 1978, and  the Lowell Historic Preservation Commission. The latter was created in 1978 to  assist the park's development, stimulate historic preservation of Lowell's downtown  buildings and canals, and develop cultural programs related to the park's themes.  Here was a new kind of park, one that mustered the energies, funds, and talents  of many groups and government agencies and directed them toward common goals.   Other factors in the 1970s contributed to  Lowell's rebirth. The University of Lowell (now the University of Massachusetts  Lowell) emerged from the union of Lowell Technological Institute and Lowell State  College in 1975. Its mission included support for regional economic development.  The arrival in the mid-1970s of Wang Laboratories, then a leader in computers,  brought to the city an industry that many hoped would lead to another bright technological  future.   The late 1970s and the early 1980s were years  of prosperity in Massachusetts, with a soaring economy built around higher education,  high technology, and an attractive cultural ambience. In Lowell employment rose  as business expanded and over 100 old buildings were rehabilitated and put to  new uses. Visitors again came to Lowell, a model of historic preservation and  urban revival. But by the late 1980s the boom was over. The region's economy had  cooled, the computer industry was tightening its belt, and many companies were  closing their doors or relocating elsewhere. Wang found itself challenged by strong  competition, requiring it to cut most of its workforce and dramatically restructure  its operations.   Boom and bust, technological innovation and  obsolescence-these are old themes in Lowell. Many observers see nothing surprising  in the current cycle and believe a new mix of technology, improved education,  and cultural vitality has positioned the city well for transition into the coming  era of internationally interdependent economies.   The city's new pride recalls the spirit of  the milltown's boom days. After decades of decline, the population is rising.  The most recent immigrants-as essential to industry as their predecessors a century  before-come from Cambodia, Laos, Latin America, and other parts of the world.  A collection of public art lends interest to the urban scene. Visitors have a  multitude of choices: tours of the park, exhibits, festivals, concerts, demonstrations  of old skills, a chance to stroll along historic streets. In summer the Merrimack  is crowded with boats. The Canalway pedestrian path links the city's waterways  with its historic structures.      The citizens  of Lowell have made the past a vigorous presence. Historic buildings house new  enterprises. Old machinery finds use in new exhibits. Common threads run through  the experiences of Lowell's earlier generations of immigrants and those still  arriving. If there is any place to observe the beginnings and the development  of American industrialization, it is here in Lowell.

Massachusetts Governor                      Edward Everett wrote that the city's tremendous growth ""seems                      more the work of enchantment than the regular process of human                      agency."" John Greenleaf Whittier mirrored these sentiments.                      Lowell was ""a city springing up,"" he said, ""like                      the enchanted palaces of the Arabian Tales, as it were in                      a single night- stretching far and wide its chaos of brick                      masonry. . . . [The observer] feels himself ... thrust forward                      into a new century.""                       The                        city was an obligatory stop for Europeans touring the United                        States. To French political economist Michel Chevalier,                        sent to the United States in 1834 to study American industry,                        Lowell evoked memories of the Old World before the rise                        of its infamous industrial cities: ""This then is not                        Manchester . . . Lowell, with its steeple-crowned factories,                        resembles a Spanish town with its convents, but with this                        difference, that in Lowell, you meet no rags nor Madonnas,                        and that the nuns in Lowell, instead of working sacred hearts,                        spin and weave cotton."" The city was sometimes described                        as one of the wonders of the world. ""Niagara and Lowell                        are the two objects I will longest remember in my American                        journey,"" said a Scottish visitor, ""the one the                        glory of American scenery, the other of American industry.""                                                                                       The centers                        of New England textile production before Lowell were the                        Blackstone Valley in Rhode Island and Waltham, Massachusetts.                        Pawtucket, R.I., was the site of Slater's Mill, the first                        powered spinning mill.                                                                            Most visitors were impressed by the sheer scale of mid-19th century                  Lowell, something best appreciated from across the Merrimack River.                  Massive five- and six-story brick mills lined the river for nearly                  a mile, standing out dramatically amid the area's scattered farms.                  The city itself was only a backdrop; the textile mills dominated                  the Lowell scene.                 Next to the mills, it was the complex network of power canals                  that caught the eye of visitors to Lowell. By 1850 almost six                  miles of canals coursed through the city. Operating on two levels,                  they drove the waterwheels of 40 mill buildings, powering 320,000                  spindles and almost 10,000 looms and giving employment to more                  than 10,000 workers.                 Despite the European response to these marvels, we cannot easily                  contrast ""new world"" Lowell and ""old world""                  industrial cities. Though Lowell was in many ways new compared                  to English manufacturing centers, the mills were the product of                  technological and economic developments rooted in 18th-century                  Europe. The quickening influence of the English Industrial Revolution                  and the disruption of trade during the Napoleonic Wars helped                  push America into its own industrial age.                 The city's brick mills and canal network were, however, signs                  of a new human domination of nature in America. Urban Lowell contrasted                  starkly with the farms and villages in which the vast majority                  of Americans lived and worked in the early 19th century. Farming                  was largely a matter of accommodation to the natural world. Mill                  owners prospered by regimenting that world. They imposed a regularity                  on the workday radically different from the normal routine. Mills                  ran an average of 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, for more than                  300 days a year. Only when it suited them did the owners follow                  seasonal rhythms, operating the mills longer in summer but in                  winter extending the day with whale-oil lamps.                  Lowell's canals depended on water drawn from a river, but to                  use the Merrimack as efficiently as possible, the mill owners                  dammed it, even ponding water overnight for use the next day.                  Anticipating seasonal dry spells, they turned the river's watershed                  into a giant millpond. They were aggressive in purchasing water                  rights in New Hampshire, storing water in lakes in the spring                  and releasing it into the Merrimack in the summer and fall.                  Damming alone would not have created enough power to run the                  mills. Lowell's industrial life was sustained by naturally falling                  water. At Pawtucket Falls, just above the Merrimack's junction                  with the Concord, the river drops more than 30 feet in less than                  a mile-a continuous surge of kinetic energy from which the mills                  harnessed over 10,000 horsepower. Without the falls, there would                  have been no textile production, no Lowell.                 Pawtucket Falls had long been the focus of human activity in                  the area. If the tumbling water meant power to European settlers,                  to the nearby Pennacook Indians it was a source of food. Neighboring                  tribes regularly met at the falls in the spring to reap the bounty                  of the annual runs of salmon and sturgeon. While Indians planted                  crops near their villages, they did not ""possess"" the                  land or own it individually as the English did. They moved about                  with the seasons leaving themselves open to encroachment by settler                  who coveted their land. With the incorporation of Chelmsford in                  1655, a permanent English presence was established near the Pennacook                  villages. Conflict and displacement soon followed.                 When King Philip's War broke out along the New                  England frontier in 1675, most Pennacooks followed their sachem                  Wannalancit north into the New Hampshire woods to avoid hostilities.                  After their victory, the colonists forced the Indians still living                  in eastern Massachusetts to move to a few permanent villages,                  including Wamesit in what is now downtown Lowell. Even so, settlers                  continued to encroach upon Pennacook lands, and in 1686, Wannalancit                  formally sold his tribe's rights to land along the Merrimack and                  Concord Rivers. The remaining Pennacooks moved on to New Hampshire                  or Canada, and their former lands were absorbed into Chelmsford.                 Chelmsford grew steadily throughout the 18th century. At first,                  ample land and opportunity allowed most sons and daughters to                  marry and settle within the community. After 1725, however, when                  the last communal land was distributed, growing numbers of young                  people seeking farmland had to leave town. The press of population                  on resources encouraged the remaining villagers to look for work                  other than farming.                 The obvious alternatives, aside from going to sea, were industry                  and trade. But opportunities there were hardly better. England's                  mercantile policies generally limited her colonies to such local                  industries as sawmills and grist mills or crafts like harness                  making or coppersmithing. There were more people than jobs in                  these trades. Things were no better after independence. Although                  the restrictions were gone, American manufacturers found it difficult                  to compete with the cheap, well-made British goods flooding the                  market.                 It was shipbuilding and its need for timber that transformed                  this farm community at the end of the 18th century. As a neutral                  power during the Napoleonic wars, the United States dominated                  the Atlantic trade for a few years. The demand for new American                  ships spurred merchants and shipbuilders in Newburyport, a seaport                  north of Boston, to tap the inland forests for wood. The port                  was at the mouth of the Merrimack, and timber could be floated                  downriver. There was but one major obstacle, Pawtucket Falls at                  East Chelmsford, as the section of Chelmsford at the junction                  of the Merrimack and Concord Rivers was called.                 So it was in 1796 that Newburyport merchants built the Pawtucket                  Canal - 11/2 miles long with four sets of locks-to circumvent                  the falls. Eight years later, a much more ambitious project, the                  Middlesex Canal, opened a direct water route to the port of Boston.                  This canal began at Middlesex Village, just upstream from East                  Chelmsford. Horse-drawn barges moved cargo through a system of                  locks and aqueducts between the Merrimack and Mystic Rivers, a                  distance of 27 miles.                 After the opening of the Pawtucket and Middlesex canals, manufacturing                  took root in East Chelmsford. Sawmills and a glassworks were built                  near the canals. In 1801, one Moses Hale added picking and carding                  machines to his ""fulling"" mill (where woolen cloth underwent                  the final steps of shrinking and thickening). His new operations                  prepared raw wool for spinning and weaving by local farm families.                  Since his mill was already finishing the woven cloth, Hale's operation                  was well integrated into the surrounding economy.                 These domestic developments were reinforced by the frequent interruptions                  in trade caused by the Napoleonic Wars and the Embargo of 1807,                  which cut off American trade with Europe. Unable to import manufactured                  goods, Americans soon began to supply their own needs, cloth foremost.                  Moses Hale used this opportunity to expand his business, while                  two other locals-John Goulding and Jonathan Knowles -built a cotton                  mill on the Concord River.                 The boom in American manufacturing lasted until the end of the                  War of 1812, when the return of British textiles to the American                  market drove small manufacturers like Goulding and Knowles out                  of business. Others, though, saw prospects for profit. Thomas                  Hurd bought the old Goulding and Knowles mill in 1818, installed                  power looms, and converted it to woolen manufacture. Moses Hale                  and Oliver Whipple began to manufacture gunpowder, driving their                  machinery with water from a new canal fed by the Concord River.                 East Chelmsford's shift from agriculture to industry was typical                  of many New England towns. The transformation began several decades                  earlier, the nation's first permanent water-powered textile spinning                  factory was founded in 1790 along the banks of the Blackstone                  River in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. There the English immigrant                  Samuel Slater reproduced an Arkwright spinning frame, the first                  fully power-driven machine for spinning yarn. The partnership                  of Almy, Brown, and Slater pioneered in carding and spinning cotton                  by power machinery. Others followed their lead and by 1810 dozens                  of water-powered spinning mills dotted riverbanks in southern                  New England.                 The spinning mills were small rural affairs and employed few                  workers. Far more workers earned a living in their own homes by                  weaving machine-spun cotton yarn on handlooms. If they lived nearby,                  they picked up yarn at the mills and returned with woven cloth.                  Those farther away got their yarn from storekeepers who took it                  on consignment from the mills. This system of outwork helped stabilize                  the region's economy but was nevertheless an inefficient way of                  working. Farmers' wives and daughters took their time at weaving,                  fitting the new work into the routines of farm life. This system                  was too relaxed for mill owners, who had schedules to meet and                  orders to fill. Thomas Hurd's decision to install power looms                  in his mills on the Concord River was typical of the trend of                  manufacturers to bring all textile operations under their direct                  control.                 Late in 1821 new actors entered the East Chelmsford scene. The                  small group of men seen looking over the area became the principals                  in East Chelmsford's transformation from farm village to industrial                  city. In the next few years they would complete the revolution                  in American textile production begun by Samuel Slater. They had                  already taken a bold step in Waltham, on the Charles River to                  the south. Their achievements foreshadowed what would happen in                  Lowell on a grander scale, raising it from obscurity to prominence                  in the industrial history of the nation.

Zaborowski, 814-886-6140                                 National Park Service rangers will lead hikes to the Conemaugh  Viaduct, Saturday and Sunday, May 24 and 25.   The four-mile round trip route follows the path of the Great Flood of 1889, along the Little Conemaugh River from South Fork to the Conemaugh Viaduct.  The original viaduct temporarily blocked the flood before collapsing.  Rangers will share stories of the Flood along the way.            The hikes begin at 11:00am each day.   This program is limited to 40 participants.  Call the Flood Memorial at (814) 495-4643 to register and for directions to the starting point.  Rangers suggest participants wear sturdy shoes and bring water and a bag lunch.  The group will stop at the viaduct for a picnic lunch.  The hikes last approximately three hours.   The National Park Service cares for special places set aside by the American people so that all may experience our heritage.  Johnstown Flood Memorial commemorates the Johnstown Flood of May 31, 1889.  The park contains nearly 165 acres and preserves the remains of the South Fork Dam and portions of the former Lake Conemaugh.  It is located at 733 Lake Road, in St. Michael, Pennsylvania.

Travel the road that Andrew Carnegie, Henry Frick, and others travelled in the 1880s during their visits to the fabled mountain resort.  Take a stroll with a National Park Ranger along the former shoreline of Lake Conemaugh, following the old carriage road that led from the dam to the clubhouse.  Along the way, the ranger will reveal glimpses of life in those bygone days.  At the end of the road, you can visit the Club-house and view the film ""A Victorian Summer"", about life at the Fishing and Hunting Club.   The walk begins at the South Abutment of the South Fork Dam at 10:30 am, Saturday, August 31 and lasts two to two-and-a-half hours.  Rangers suggest you bring water and wear sturdy shoes.  The walk is mostly level, with a few slight inclines.    Johnstown Flood National Memorial commemorates the Johnstown Flood of 1889.  The park contains nearly 165 acres and preserves portions of the former Lake Conemaugh lakebed and the remains of the South Fork Dam.  The dam was owned by the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, whose members were the wealthy and elite of Pittsburgh.  It failed on of May 31, 1889, releasing a torrent that destroyed the city of Johnstown, 14 miles below and killed over 2000 people.

The project and its environmental                assessment, which evaluates the potential impacts of the project,                are integrated in this document and are referred to collectively                as the Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental Assessment.                The Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental Assessment                identifies and analyzes three alternatives: Alternative 1 –                the No Action Alternative; Alternative 2 – Complete Dam Removal                (the “preferred alternative”); and Alternative 3 – Partial                Dam Removal.                Alternative 1, theNo Action                Alternative, represents conditions and management practices as they                currently exist at Cascades Diversion Dam. It provides the basis                for comparison of each action alternative. The action alternatives                (Alternatives 2 and 3) are based on the Purpose Of and Need For                the Project and conform with the goals of Yosemite National Park’s                 General Management Plan  and goals and management elements                of the  Merced Wild and Scenic River Comprehensive Management                Plan  and the  Yosemite Valley Plan . The alternatives vary                in the ways they accomplish these goals.                Alternative 2 includes the complete                removal of the diversion dam and attendant structures, bank stabilization,                and site restoration. This alternative would remove all structural                features exposed to public view, including the river-left and river-right                dam abutments, the intake structure, and the screenhouse. Alternative                3 would partially remove the diversion dam and attendant structures                and would include bank stabilization and site restoration. Under                Alternative 3, the river-right dam abutment and the intake structure                would be retained as a river-viewing platform. All other structures                would be removed.

Non-native weeds are crowding out desirable native plants,              degrading the quality of wildlife habitat, encroaching on trails,              and increasing flood danger.              The              National Park Service wants to do something about it, but does not              have the funds. The Department of Agriculture is willing to help.                         Deputy Secretary of Agriculture Richard Rominger will announce the              availability of funds at a ceremony at the Johnstown Flood National              Memorial Wednesday October 25 at 11:00 a.m. The USDA's Animal and              Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is providing $100,000 to help              with equipment and staffing needed to eradicate these weeds. ""This              is an opportunity for the USDA to work cooperatively with the National              Park Service to control weeds in a critical area"" said Rominger.              The mission of the National Park Service is to preserve and maintain              the natural and cultural resources of the park and to interpret those              resources to the public and the scientific community. APHIS provides              leadership in ensuring the health and care of animals and plants,              improving agricultural productivity and competitiveness, and contributing              to the national economy and the public health. They protect American              agriculture against the introduction of foreign pests and diseases.              ""Completion of this project will advance the mission of both agencies,              and it makes sense to work together to eliminate this problem"" said              Park Manager Joanne Hanley.              One               of the most significant management problems the National Park Service              faces at the Flood Memorial is an invasive weed. Giant knotweed is              a nonnative plant that is rapidly invading riverbank in the historic              lakebed. It currently occupies almost half of the riverbank within              the park. Left untreated, officials expect that it would spread until              the entire riverbank within the park is lined with the large, dense              stands. They are extremely persistent and prevent native plants from              growing. These dense stands of knotweed degrade the quality of wildlife              habitat, and may promote flooding.              Johnstown Flood National Memorial contains the former Lake Conemaugh              lakebed and remains of the Southfork Dam that failed on May 31, 1889.              The resulting flood killed 2,209 people and was one of the worst disasters              in American history. The Memorial averages about 180,000 visitors              per year. It is located at 733 Lake Road, in St. Michael, Pennsylvania.

GX042-70-15851586	"Building America's  Industrial Revolution:    The Boott Cotton Mills of Lowell, Massachusetts                            (Lowell Museum Collection/Lowell Historical Society)     (Lowell National Historical Park)                      L  ike a medieval fortress or great cathedral, the structure dominates all that is around it. A great wall separates it from the Merrimack River. Within that rampart, thick, red brick walls, punctuated by windows of many shapes and sizes, rise from the ground, surrounding interior courtyard spaces that can be entered only by crossing a single bridge over the deep water of a canal. Brick or wood stair towers placed along the exterior of the walls provide the only means of entry to upper floors. A single bell tower dominates the central courtyard.     For more than 100 years the bell called people to this place on a daily basis, not to protect the city from invaders or to worship, but to work. The sounds from the complex were not those of battles or church choirs, but of machinery clanking and rumbling 10 to 14 hours a day. Rushing water ran water wheels and turbines, and bells constantly clanged to regulate life's daily activities. This was the Boott Cotton Mills complex at Lowell, Massachusetts. It was typical of what some call a ""cathedral of industry"" where people from all over the world toiled for the single purpose of mass-producing a consumer product: textiles.   The Boott Cotton Mills complex contains mills built from the mid-1830s to the early 20th century, reflecting the early use of waterpower, steam power, and finally electric power. Changes in technology and production capability influenced the development and appearance of the millyard over time. In essence, the Industrial Revolution's transformation of America from an agrarian-based society to an industrial society can be seen through the physical development of the Boott Cotton Mills from 1835 through the early 20th century. Today, the restored mill complex houses the Boott Cotton Mills Museum, a part of Lowell National Historical Park.

YOSEMITE          VALLEY          Under this alternative,          130 acres of developed land would be restored to natural conditions, thus          improving the scenic quality of Yosemite Valley. Proposed restoration          and development (in acres) within each scenic category are found in table          4-126. The primary improvements would be restoration along the Merced          River, primarily within the River Protection Overlay. This would result          in long-term, moderate, beneficial impacts.          A total of 68 acres          of new development would occur. The new development would be principally          in the Camp 6 and Curry Village areas, and would have a long-term, moderate,          adverse impact. In the west Valley, a traffic check station at El Capitan          crossover on Southside Drive would be constructed. This facility would          be constructed such that it would not obstruct scenic vistas and vantage          points.          This          alternative would result in a relatively small amount of restoration,          and a small net decrease in development. As a result, this alternative          would have an overall impact on scenic resources that is long-term, minor,          and beneficial.

Totals may differ due to rounding.                2. Of the total 163 acres of natural resource restoration in A,                B, and C Scenic areas, only 127 acres currently contain intrusions                to scenic views, i.e., developed facilities. Thus, 36 acres of restoration                are not included in this analysis of acreage of restored scenery.                Because these 36 acres have not been further analyzed to determine                their exact locations within A, B, and C Scenic categories, only                the total acreage figure reflects the reduction of these 36 acres                from the analysis. Also, the total acreage has been increased by                the three acres of restoration in areas not classified as either                A, B, and C Scenic in the 1980  General Management Plan .                3. Developed acres include areas that are redeveloped or that remain                unchanged.

All impacts would be long term in duration.

Camp 6 parking and campground check-in station could                  be visible.                                               Minor                                               Beneficial                                                                        Three Brothers                                               None                                               Negligible                                               Neutral                                                                OUT-OF-VALLEY         Under this alternative,          three out-of-Valley parking facilities (Henness Ridge, El Portal, and          Foresta) would be constructed, facilities at each entrance station would          be expanded, housing at Wawona would be increased, and housing and administrative          facilities in El Portal would be increased. The parking facility at Henness          Ridge would have only a long-term, minor, adverse impact, as it would          not be visible from the Wawona Road. The development of Foresta as an          out-of-Valley parking location would have a long-term, minor, and adverse          impact on the landscape when viewing from the Big Meadow overlook on the          Big Oak Flat Road, and various locations along the Big Oak Flat Road.          Increased housing in the Wawona area would have a long-term, minor, adverse          impact because it would be visible only from immediately adjacent areas.          The impact of placing relocated parking and administrative facilities          In El Portal would be minor, long-term, and adverse because actions would          be visible from Highway 140 as the visitor approaches Yosemite National          Park. The expansion of entrance station facilities would be mitigated          through design, and the impacts would be long-term, minor, and adverse          because they would cause imperceptible changes to views at each location.         CONCLUSION         This alternative          would have a long-term, minor, beneficial impact on the overall scenic          quality of Yosemite Valley. There would be a net decrease of 63 acres          in the development footprint within Yosemite Valley. The majority of the          areas to be restored are within the A Scenic category, but the majority          of the actions would not result in a substantial improvement of scenic          vistas and vantage points, as no large contiguous tract of highly valued          resources would be restored.         Yosemite Valley would          remain one of the world’s premier landscapes. The amount of intrusion          into the scenery of Yosemite Valley would be reduced and consolidated          in the east Valley.          Additionally, the          development of Foresta as an out-of-Valley parking location would have          a minor, adverse impact on the landscape when viewing from the Big Meadow          overlook on the Big Oak Flat Road, and a long-term, moderate, adverse          impact when viewing from within Foresta. No visual intrusions would occur          within the Tunnel View vantage point. Collectively, there would be long-term,          minor, and adverse impacts in all out-of-Valley locations; however, impacts          in these areas contribute directly to the improvement of the scenery within          the Valley.          CUMULATIVE          IMPACTS          Alternative 5, in          conjunction with the impacts of reasonably foreseeable areawide projects,          would result in a long-term, minor, beneficial, and cumulative impact,          primarily due to the restoration of A Scenic and B Scenic resources in          the Valley.         Cultural          Resources           ARCHEOLOGICAL          RESOURCES          Impacts to archeological          resources are permanent unless otherwise noted.         As described for          Alternative 2, every effort would be made to avoid archeological sites          through careful project design and subsequent site-specific environmental          compliance. If sites could not be avoided, all data recovery to retrieve          important information would be done in accordance with the Yosemite Programmatic          Agreement (see Vol. II, Appendix D).         Yosemite          Valley         Yosemite Lodge          and Vicinity         Impacts under this          alternative would be the same as for Alternative 2. With data recovery          excavations, the resultant impacts would be permanent, minor, and adverse,          as well as long-term, minor, and beneficial.         Yosemite Falls         Impacts under this          alternative would be the same as for Alternative 2. With data recovery          excavation, resultant adverse impacts would be minor or negligible. Beneficial          impacts would be minor.         Yosemite Village         Proposed undertakings          include redesigning the National Park Service maintenance area; rehabilitating          the Yosemite Village housing area; constructing a new fire station; removing          picnic areas; and constructing a day-visitor parking lot and a transit          facility. These actions would involve grading, trenching, and other earthmoving          activities that would potentially disturb portions of two prehistoric/historic          American Indian habitation sites. Site data potential ranges from low          to high. Data recovery to retrieve important information, conducted in          accordance with the Programmatic Agreement, would reduce the intensity          of adverse impacts from moderate to minor. As described for Alternatives          2, 3, and 4, the burial area in Yosemite Village currently paved and used          for materials staging would be restored to a natural condition, and protected          from future development. All work in the vicinity of the burial area would          be designed to avoid disturbing intact deposits, and would be monitored          by archeologists and representatives of culturally associated American          Indian people.         Surface conditions          on a portion of one site would be restored to natural conditions with          the implementation of this action. As such, long-term impacts associated          with the visitor use would be avoided or reduced. This would ultimately          result in a minor and beneficial impact.         The Ahwahnee         Impacts under this          alternative would be the same as under Alternatives 2, 3, and 4. With          archeological data recovery, the resultant impact would be minor and adverse.         Housekeeping Camp         Under this alternative,          removal of some of the units from Housekeeping Camp would involve grading          and trenching that would potentially disturb intact deposits at a prehistoric/historic          American Indian habitation site with moderate data potential. Careful          project design and data recovery to retrieve important information, conducted          in accordance with the Programmatic Agreement, would reduce the intensity          of adverse impacts from minor to negligible.         Campgrounds         As described for          Alternative 2, intact archeological deposits at ten sites would be potentially          disturbed by grading, trenching, and other earthmoving activities associated          with redeveloping Lower Pines and Upper Pines Campgrounds; constructing          a new amphitheater at the location of the concessioner stable parking          lot; constructing new walk-in, backpacker, and group campgrounds; and          removing the existing Backpacker and Group Campgrounds and restoring these          areas to natural conditions. These sites consist of prehistoric and historic          American Indian habitation sites and campsites, ranging in data potential          from low to high. Careful site design and data recovery to retrieve important          information, conducted in accordance with the Programmatic Agreement,          would reduce the intensity of adverse impacts from moderate to minor.         Surface conditions          at two of these sites and on a portion of a third would be restored to          natural conditions with the implementation of this action. As such, long-term          impacts associated with visitor use would be reduced, ultimately resulting          in minor, beneficial impacts to these resources.         Placement of campground          facilities within the immediate vicinity of known archeological resources          could result in long term, minor, adverse impacts associated with visitor          use, including artifact collection and accelerated soil loss. Given the          potential for these impacts, sites subject to these actions would be monitored          according to the Visitor Experience and Resource Protections Program as          outlined in Chapter 2. Through this monitoring program, threats and disturbances          would be noted. Every effort would be made to avoid or reduce adverse          impacts through changes in visitor access, relocation of facilities, or          archeological data recovery carried out according to the stipulations          of the Programmatic Agreement.          Curry Village         Impacts under this          alternative would be the same as for Alternatives 2, 3, and 4. With archeological          data recovery, resultant impacts would be negligible.          Merced River Restoration         Removing Sugar Pine          and Ahwahnee Bridges under this alternative would involve earthmoving          activities that would possibly disturb a prehistoric American Indian habitation          site with high data potential. If sites could not be avoided, data recovery,          carried out in accordance with the Programmatic Agreement, would retrieve          important information and reduce the intensity of adverse impacts from          moderate to minor.         Meadow Restoration         Depending on final          project design, realigning or reconstructing the roads and utilities through          Bridalveil, El Capitan, and Cook’s Meadows under this alternative          would involve grading and trenching that would potentially disturb portions          of up to four prehistoric American Indian sites (one with a historic-period          American Indian component) and three other historic sites. The data potential          of the prehistoric sites ranges from low to high, and the data potential          of the historic sites is unknown. Data recovery, carried out in accordance          with the Programmatic Agreement, would retrieve important information,          thereby reducing the intensity of adverse impacts from moderate to minor          or negligible.         Circulation Changes         As described for          Alternative 2, constructing a vehicle check station near El Capitan crossover          would involve grading that would disturb portions of a prehistoric and          historic American Indian habitation site with high data potential, including          historic-era deposits with unknown data potential. Through careful project          design and subsequent site-specific environmental compliance, every effort          would be made to avoid known archeological sites. Should this prove impossible,          data recovery, carried out in accordance with the Programmatic Agreement,          would retrieve important information prior to construction and would thereby          reduce the intensity of adverse impacts from moderate to minor.         Realigning a portion          of Southside Drive at its approach to Sentinel Bridge would involve grading          that would impact a portion of a prehistoric American Indian habitation          site and historic Euro-American village with moderate data potential.          Data recovery, carried out in accordance with stipulations of the Programmatic          Agreement, would reduce the intensity of adverse impacts from moderate          to minor.         Realigning the multi-use          paved trail between Yosemite Village and Mirror Lake, as described for          Alternatives 2, 3, and 4, would involve minor grading that would disturb          a portion of one prehistoric/historic American Indian site with high data          potential. Data recovery, carried out in accordance with the Programmatic          Agreement, would retrieve important information and reduce the intensity          of adverse impacts from moderate to minor.         Establishing a new          multi-use paved trail between the northern abutment of Sentinel Bridge          and Yosemite Village would involve minor grading that could impact an          archeological site exhibiting both prehistoric and historic components          with high data potential. The park would strive to avoid adverse impacts          by siting the trail in such a way as to avoid impacting the site. However,          if such impacts were unavoidable, data recovery, carried out in accordance          with the Programmatic Agreement, would retrieve important information          and reduce the intensity of adverse impacts from minor to negligible.                   Establishing a new          multi-use paved trail between the Ahwahnee and the existing bicycle path          to Mirror Lake would involve minor grading that could impact four archeological          sites. All four of these sites contain both prehistoric and historic components.          Three of the four have high data potential, while the fourth has moderate          data potential. The park would strive to locate the trail in such a way          as to avoid impacts on the site. However, if such impacts were unavoidable,          data recovery, carried out in accordance with the Programmatic Agreement,          would retrieve important information, and reduce the intensity of adverse          impacts from minor to negligible.          Placement of multi-use          paved trails within the immediate vicinity of known archeological resources          could result in long-term, minor, adverse impacts associated with visitor          use, including artifact collection and accelerated soil loss. Given the          potential for these impacts, sites subject to these actions would be monitored          according to the Visitor Experience and Resource Protection Program as          outlined in Chapter 2. Through this monitoring program, threats and disturbances          would be noted. Every effort would be made to avoid or reduce adverse          impacts through changes in visitor access, relocation of facilities, or          archeological data recovery carried out according to the stipulations          of the Programmatic Agreement.          General Valley          Actions         Impacts would be          the same as under Alternative 2, except no group picnicking facilities          would be provided at Sentinel Beach. With data recovery excavations, the          resultant impact would be negligible.         In addition, developing          Yellow Pine Campground for public use under this alternative would not          result in any impacts to archeological resources, because no archeological          resources are known in the area. Potential adverse impacts to known sites          in Yosemite Valley are shown in table 4-129.                                                                 Table                  4-129                  Known Sites in Yosemite Valley Potentially Adversely Impacted                  by Implementation of Alternative 5                                                                        Number                  of Sites with High Data Potential                                                 Number                  of Sites with Moderate Data Potential                                                 Number                  of Sites with Low Data Potential                                                 Number                  of Sites with Unknown Data Potential                                                                          11                                               12                                               5                                               4                                                                Out-of-Valley         El Portal         The following impact          analysis is based on general land-use planning actions for El Portal.          As described for the other action alternatives, the National Park Service          would undertake site-specific design studies and environmental review          to evaluate options for new housing and administrative facilities. These          studies would include, as necessary, additional resource surveys (i.e.,          archeological inventory and testing). The National Park Service would          initiate further consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer,          the culturally associated American Indian tribes, and the public, as provided          for in the Programmatic Agreement. A complete and detailed assessment          of impacts to archeological resources would be presented as part of that          review.         As described for          Alternatives 2, 3, and 4, several actions at Old El Portal and Village          Center (constructing a multi-use paved trail, employee housing, and support          facilities) would disturb or destroy portions of up to 14 prehistoric          and historic-era archeological sites (11 sites have moderate data potential,          one has low data potential, and two have unknown data potential). Through          careful project design and subsequent site-specific environmental compliance,          every effort would be made to avoid known archeological sites. If these          sites could not be avoided, data recovery, carried out in accordance with          the Programmatic Agreement, would retrieve important information prior          to construction, and thereby reduce the intensity of adverse impacts from          moderate to minor or negligible.         As described for          Alternatives 2, 3, and 4, day-visitor and employee parking would be located          in the Middle Road area and would involve major grading and earthmoving          activities. These actions would disturb major portions of two archeological          sites, one prehistoric American Indian habitation site that also contains          historic-era deposits with low data potential, and one historic-era site          with unknown data potential. Through careful project design and subsequent          site-specific environmental compliance, every effort would be made to          avoid known archeological sites. If these sites could not be avoided,          data recovery, carried out in accordance with the Programmatic Agreement,          would retrieve important information prior to construction, and thereby          reduce the intensity of adverse impacts from moderate to minor or negligible.         Under this alternative,          constructing National Park Service and concessioner administrative facilities,          as well as museum collection facilities at Railroad Flat, would involve          major grading, trenching, and excavation, which could disturb archeological          deposits at portions of one prehistoric/historic American Indian habitation          site with low data potential. Data recovery would retrieve important information          and reduce the intensity of adverse impacts from minor to negligible (similar          to Alternatives 2, 3, and 4).         Constructing housing          facilities at Hillside East and West would involve major grading, excavation,          and trenching that would destroy major portions of an intact prehistoric/historic          American Indian habitation site (with some Euro-American deposits) with          high data potential. A site-specific data recovery program, negotiated          between the National Park Service, the California State Historic Preservation          Officer, and local culturally associated American Indian tribes would          recover important information, thereby reducing the intensity of adverse          impacts from major to moderate.         Constructing single-family          homes and a day care center in Rancheria Flat would entail grading, trenching,          and excavation that would potentially disturb intact archeological deposits          at two archeological site with moderate data potential. Data recovery,          carried out in accordance with the Programmatic Agreement, would retrieve          important information and reduce the intensity of adverse impacts from          moderate to minor.         Constructing high-density          housing and support facilities at Hennessey’s Ranch would disturb          a prehistoric American Indian habitation site and part of a historic-era          ranch, both of which were heavily disturbed when the Trailer Village was          constructed. Data potential of this site is unknown. Data recovery, carried          out in accordance with the Programmatic Agreement, would retrieve important          information and reduce the intensity of any adverse impacts.          Removing an abandoned          wastewater treatment plant and restoring the area to natural conditions          (as described for Alternatives 2, 3, and 4) would be carefully designed          to avoid disturbance to intact areas of a prehistoric American Indian          habitation site and burial area. These actions would be monitored by archeologists          and representatives from culturally associated American Indian tribes,          in accordance with the Programmatic Agreement, and negligible impacts          to archeological resources would be expected.         Similar to Alternatives          2, 3, and 4, the Johnny Wilson Ranch (Riverside area), previously proposed          for high-density housing (NPS 1996a), would not be developed. Instead,          these archeological sites and burial area would continue to be relatively          inaccessible.         Foresta and McCauley          Ranch         As described for          Alternatives 2, 3, and 4, grading and trenching associated with construction          as replacement for 14 homes destroyed in the 1990 A-Rock Fire at Foresta          could possibly disturb intact resources, depending on location. Rehabilitation          of the Foresta Campground would also disturb archeological deposits at          a portion of an intact American Indian habitation site. Data recovery,          carried out in accordance with the Programmatic Agreement, would reduce          the intensity of any adverse impacts. Constructing a day-visitor parking          lot at Foresta would not impact any known archeological resources.         Constructing National          Park Service and concessioner stables, and National Park Service parkwide          trails operational facilities to McCauley Ranch would disturb archeological          deposits at a portion of a large prehistoric site and historic-era ranch          with unknown data potential. Improving access through Foresta to McCauley          Ranch and replacing Crane Creek Bridge would possibly disturb five intact          prehistoric sites and one historic dump site, all with unknown data potential.          If these sites could not be avoided, data recovery, carried out in accordance          with the Programmatic Agreement prior to construction, would reduce the          intensity of adverse impacts.         Other Out-of-Valley          Areas         Establishing day-visitor          parking at Henness Ridge under this alternative would disturb two intact          historic linear resources: a logging railroad grade, and a historic road.          Data recovery would reduce the intensity of adverse impacts from minor          to negligible.          As described for          Alternatives 2, 3, and 4, reconstructing El Portal Road between the intersection          of El Portal Road/Big Oak Flat Road and Pohono Bridge would involve widening          the road corridor, potentially removing or disturbing a portion of a large          prehistoric and historic-era American Indian habitation site with high          data potential. Data recovery would reduce the intensity of adverse impacts          from moderate to minor.         As described for          Alternatives 2, 3, and 4, removing residences at Cascades would involve          minor grading and trenching that could disturb intact deposits at one          prehistoric archeological site with unknown data potential. However, the          project would be carefully designed to avoid ground disturbance in intact          areas, and would be monitored by archeologists, as stipulated in the Programmatic          Agreement, to ensure site protection. By implementing these measures,          negligible impact to archeological resources would result.         Removing the Cascades          Diversion Dam would not impact any known archeological resources (the          same as under Alternatives 2, 3, and 4). Earthmoving and facility removal          would be monitored by an archeologist in the event historic archeological          features or artifacts associated with construction and use of the dam          were discovered during removal.         As described for          Alternatives 2, 3, and 4, since the location and design of visitor centers          associated with park entrance stations is unknown at this time, it is          not possible to predict the potential for impacts to archeological resources.          The park would conduct archeological inventories, site evaluations, and          data recovery as necessary, and further environmental review. In accordance          with the Programmatic Agreement, the National Park Service would first          seek to avoid impacts to any archeological resources, and would retrieve          important scientific information at sites that could not be avoided, thereby          reducing the intensity of any adverse impacts.         Archeological          Resources Conclusion         Proposed project          undertakings would have varied impacts on as many as 59 known archeological          sites, depending on the potential of the archeological sites to yield          significant information regarding prehistoric and historic lifeways, and          on the nature and design of proposed development. See Chapter 3, Cultural          Resources, for descriptions of low, moderate, and high data potential.         In all instances          where identified sites could not be avoided and would be disturbed, the          park would carry out data recovery excavations in accordance with the          Programmatic Agreement to retrieve important scientific information, thereby          reducing the intensity of adverse impacts. For some areas, information          regarding the nature and importance of archeological resources is unknown.          In these instances, the park would first inventory project areas, test/evaluate          the significance of identified sites, and carry out appropriate data recovery          excavations as necessary prior to construction disturbance.         Cumulative          Impacts         Cumulative impacts          would be the same as described under Alternative 2, except this alternative          would contribute to the loss of regional archeological resources as a          consequence of the disturbance or degradation of as many as 59 known archeological          sites. To mitigate adverse impacts, important information contained within          these sites would be recovered according to stipulations of the Programmatic          Agreement. Therefore, with appropriate mitigation, the cumulative adverse          impacts associated with implementation of this alternative, in conjunction          with other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future projects,          would be minor.         ETHNOGRAPHIC          RESOURCES          Yosemite          Valley         Yosemite Lodge          and Vicinity         Impacts under this          alternative would be the same as for Alternatives 2, 3, and 4. With mitigation,          the resultant adverse impacts would be negligible; and beneficial impacts          would be long-term and minor.         Lower Yosemite          Falls         Impacts under this          alternative would be the same as for Alternative 2, 3, and 4. With mitigation,          the resultant adverse impacts would be negligible; and beneficial impacts          would be permanent and minor.         Yosemite Village         As described for          Alternatives 2, 3, and 4, rehabilitating the historic district housing          area would improve habitat conditions for California black oak, a traditionally          gathered resource, resulting in a negligible impact. Constructing day-visitor          parking at Yosemite Village could disturb or destroy two small gathering          areas, contributing resources in the Valleywide ethnographic landscape,          depending on design. The National Park Service, in consultation with culturally          associated American Indian tribes and in keeping with the Programmatic          Agreement, would develop appropriate mitigation strategies for impacts          to ethnographic resources. Such strategies could include identifying and          assisting in providing access to alternative resource-gathering areas;          continuing to provide access to traditional use or spiritual areas; and          screening new development from traditional use areas, as well as careful          site design and data recovery.         Removing facilities          at the Church Bowl Picnic Area, as described for Alternative 2, would          remove non-historic facilities from a historic village site, resulting          in minor beneficial impacts to ethnographic resources. Removing some facilities          and redesigning the National Park Service Maintenance area would restore          a known burial area to natural conditions, resulting in minor, beneficial          impacts to ethnographic resources.         The Ahwahnee         Impacts under this          alternative would be the same as for Alternatives 2, 3, and 4. There would          be no impact to ethnographic resources.         Housekeeping         Impacts under this          alternative would be the same as for Alternatives 2, 3, and 4. There would          be negligible impact.         Campgrounds         Redesigning Lower          and North Pines Campgrounds would perpetuate development and visitor use          in traditional gathering areas. Constructing new Backpacker and Group          Campgrounds and a concessioner stable would bring new development to an          area figuring in oral traditions as home to spirits, a contributing element          of the Valleywide ethnographic landscape. Constructing a new walk-in campground          near Tenaya Creek, as in Alternatives 2, 3, and 4, would disturb or destroy          a portion of one traditional gathering area, also a contributing element          of the Valley-wide landscape. These actions would result in long-term,          moderate, adverse impacts. The National Park Service, in consultation          with culturally associated American Indian tribes, and in accordance with          the Programmatic Agreement, would develop appropriate mitigation strategies          for impacts to ethnographic resources. Such strategies could include identifying          and helping provide access to alternative resource gathering areas, continuing          to provide access to traditional use or spiritual areas, and screening          new development from traditional use areas to reduce the intensity of          adverse impacts from moderate to minor or negligible.         Curry Village         Impacts under this          alternative would be the same as for Alternatives 2, 3, and 4. Impacts          would be negligible.         Merced River Restoration         Removing Ahwahnee          and Sugar Pine Bridges, as well as the raised causeway between these bridges,          would have minor, beneficial impacts by partly restoring habitat in a          traditional gathering area, a contributing element of the ethnographic          landscape. This could allow for the recovery of traditionally used plants          and enhance their availability for procurement.         Meadow Restoration         Impacts under this          alternative would be the same as for Alternatives 2, 3, and 4. Impacts          would be long-term, minor, and beneficial.         Circulation Changes         Constructing a traffic          check station near El Capitan crossover would have minor, adverse impacts          on the ethnographic landscape by disturbing a portion of a historic village          area, as described for Alternative 2. Realigning Southside Drive south          of Sentinel Bridge would also disturb a portion of a historic village          area, as described for Alternatives 2, 3, and 4. These actions would result          in minor, adverse impacts to the Valleywide ethnographic landscape. The          National Park Service, in consultation with culturally associated American          Indian tribes and in accordance with the Programmatic Agreement, would          develop appropriate mitigation strategies for impacts to ethnographic          resources. Such strategies could include recovering important archeological          data, as well as using any other measures identified during consultation,          which would reduce the intensity of adverse impacts from minor to negligible.         Actions and related          impacts associated with construction of multi-use paved trails in eastern          Yosemite Valley would not impact any ethnographic resources.         General Valley          Actions         Removing parking          lots and constructing multi-use paved trails and some group picnic sites          at Sentinel, El Capitan and Cathedral Picnic Areas (the same as for Alternatives          2, 3, and 4) would concentrate visitor use near and possibly disturb part          of a traditional site for gathering, which is a contributing element of          the Valleywide ethnographic landscape. These actions would result in a          long-term, minor, adverse impact. Establishing a new picnic area in the          vicinity of El Capitan would add facilities and increase visitor use in          proximity to a historic village site, resulting in permanent, minor, adverse          impacts to the Valleywide ethnographic landscape. The National Park Service,          in consultation with culturally associated American Indian tribes and          in accordance with the Programmatic Agreement, would develop appropriate          mitigation strategies to reduce impacts to ethnographic resources. Such          strategies could include identifying and helping provide access to alternative          resource-gathering areas; continuing to provide access to traditional          use areas; careful site designing and screening; recovering important          archeological data; and using any other measures identified during consultation.          Mitigation would reduce the intensity of adverse impacts from minor to          negligible.         Developing Yellow          Pine Campground under this alternative for public group campsites would          increase development at a traditional use area, potentially resulting          in a long-term, minor, adverse impact. The National Park Service, in consultation          with culturally associated American Indian tribes and in accordance with          the Programmatic Agreement, would develop appropriate mitigation strategies          to reduce the intensity of impacts to ethnographic resources, from minor          to negligible. Such strategies could include identifying and helping provide          access to alternative resource-gathering areas.         Out-of-Valley         El Portal         As described for          Alternatives 2, 3, and 4, the following impact analysis is based on general          land-use planning actions for El Portal, and is based on incomplete information          about the location and significance of ethnographic properties. The National          Park Service would undertake site-specific design studies and environmental          review to evaluate options for new housing and administrative facilities          in El Portal. These studies would include, as necessary, additional resource          surveys (ethnographic resources inventory and evaluation). The National          Park Service would initiate further consultation with the State Historical          Preservation Office, culturally associated American Indian tribes, and          the public, as provided for in the Programmatic Agreement. A complete          and detailed assessment of impacts to ethnographic resources would be          presented as part of that review.         Constructing studio          apartments at Hillside West, apartments or studios at Hillside East, and          employee housing at Village Center would destroy a large portion of a          historic village area, resulting in a permanent, major, adverse impact.          The portions of this historic village site that are known to contain human          burials would be protected from development. As described in Alternative          2, mitigation would reduce the intensity of adverse impact to moderate.          Constructing single-family homes, apartments, and housing support facilities          at Rancheria Flat, Hennessey’s Ranch, and Old El Portal, as well          as administrative and museum collection facilities at Railroad Flat, would          disturb or destroy portions of at least three traditional gathering areas,          resulting in long-term, minor adverse impacts. With mitigation, the resultant          impacts would be negligible. Removing the abandoned wastewater treatment          facility would have beneficial impacts on a prehistoric village and burial          area by eliminating modern, intrusive development. To ensure protection          of intact deposits and burials, this removal would be designed and implemented          carefully, and the work would be monitored by an archeologist and representatives          from culturally associated American Indian tribes.         Other Out-of-Valley          Areas         The proposed undertakings          in Foresta, McCauley Ranch, Wawona, Henness Ridge, and park entrance stations          would have unknown impacts on ethnographic resources, since there is not          enough information about the location and significance of ethnographic          resources to assess the nature and intensity of impacts. All proposed          undertakings would be the subject of future site-specific environmental          compliance. The National Park Service, in consultation with culturally          associated American Indian tribes and in accordance with the Programmatic          Agreement, would develop appropriate mitigating strategies for impacts          to ethnographic resources.          As described for          Alternatives 2 and 3, the National Park Service consulted with the American          Indian Council of Mariposa County, Inc., during planning and preliminary          design for the reconstruction of El Portal Road. The proposed reconstruction          of the easternmost portion of the road, removal of the Cascades Diversion          Dam and screenhouse, and the removal of the four Cascades residences would          not impact any known ethnographic resources.         Ethnographic          Resources Conclusion         Proposed undertakings          would have varied adverse and beneficial impacts (from potentially major          to negligible), depending in part on the nature and design of proposed          development and the sensitivity of the different traditional use areas.          In Yosemite Valley, proposed actions would disturb or destroy parts of          up to eight traditional gathering areas; add or expand modern development          at eight historic village areas; and add development in at least one area          figuring in oral tradition. However, facility removal and ecological restoration          would benefit up to five traditional gathering areas by enhancing conditions          for plant resources; would remove modern development from three historic          village areas; and would re-establish American Indian traditional uses          at an individually significant historic village site. In general, actions          in Yosemite Valley would have minor, adverse impacts to the Valleywide          ethnographic landscape.          In El Portal, proposed          actions are designed to maximize administrative, park operations, and          residential development. The precise nature and intensity of adverse impacts          to ethnographic resources in El Portal, Wawona, Foresta, McCauley, and          other out-of-Valley areas is unknown. In El Portal, however, proposed          actions would most likely have permanent, moderate to major, adverse impacts          by destroying portions of historic villages and traditional gathering          areas, and by adding concentrated residential use in some areas that are          currently undeveloped. As in Yosemite Valley and other park areas, known          burial areas would be protected from disturbance, and modern facilities          in burial areas would be removed. The National Park Service would conduct          an ethnographic resources inventory and evaluation for El Portal, as well          as other out-of-Valley areas, and would continue consulting with culturally          associated American Indian tribes to seek ways to avoid, minimize, and          mitigate potential adverse impacts to ethnographic resources. These measures          could include setting aside some areas for traditional uses; designing          new development to avoid the most sensitive areas; screening development          from traditional use areas; and directing visitor and residential use          away from sensitive areas.         Cumulative          Impacts         Cumulative impacts          on ethnographic resources would be the same as those described for Alternatives          2, 3, and 4. Minor to moderate cumulative, adverse impacts would result          from implementing this alternative, in conjunction with past, present,          and reasonably foreseeable future undertakings.         CULTURAL          LANDSCAPE RESOURCES           (INCLUDING          INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT HISTORIC SITES AND STRUCTURES)         Yosemite          Valley         Natural Systems          and Features         Under Alternative          5, the general pattern of development throughout the Valley and the historic          relationship between the natural and built environment would be retained.          Portions of the natural landscape, which has influenced the physical development          in Yosemite Valley, would be rehabilitated and restored to natural conditions.          The major focus of this effort would be the long-term restoration of the          Merced River corridor and the rehabilitation of eight meadows that are          historically significant and contribute to the Valley-wide cultural landscape.          California black oak woodlands would be rehabilitated and restored to          natural conditions, and general environmental restoration would enhance          the historic vegetative mosaic of coniferous forest, oak woodlands, and          open meadows. These actions would collectively result in a long-term,          beneficial, impact to the cultural landscape of the Valley.          Historic Land          Use Patterns         Historic land use          patterns concentrating visitor services and administration in the east          Valley would continue. The National Register Historic Districts and properties          of Camp Curry, Yosemite Village, The Ahwahnee, and others would remain          and continue to function as they did historically. While camping would          remain in the Upper and Lower Pines Campgrounds and Camp 4 (Sunnyside          Campground), relocating other Valley campgrounds currently situated along          the Merced River would be a change in historic land use patterns, resulting          in a minor, adverse impact.         Historic Circulation          Systems         Proposed changes          to circulation systems throughout Yosemite Valley would result in alterations          to both Northside and Southside Drives, both contributing structures to          the proposed Yosemite Valley Cultural Landscape Historic District. The          proposed changes include the realignment of portions of Northside and          Southside Drives, and the conversion of portions of both Northside and          Southside Drives into a one-lane vehicle route and bicycle lane. A segment          of Northside Drive at Yosemite Lodge would be realigned, resulting in          a permanent, minor, adverse impact. The segment of Northside Drive between          the east end of Yosemite Valley and El Capitan crossover would be converted          to a one-lane vehicle route and bicycle lane. Since this would not change          the physical road structure there would be no impact. This would not result          in any physical changes to this segment of Northside Drive. The portion          of Southside Drive segment near the Yosemite Chapel would be realigned,          resulting in a permanent, minor, adverse impact. The portion of Southside          Drive between the east end of the Valley and El Capitan crossover would          be converted to a one-lane vehicle route and bicycle lane. However, this          would not result in any physical changes to this road segment, and there          would be no resultant impact. The minor, adverse impacts associated with          realigning portions of contributing roadways would be mitigated by documentation,          according to the Programmatic Agreement, reducing the intensity of adverse          impacts from minor to negligible.         Removing non-contributing          roads from Ahwahnee and Stoneman Meadows would have a minor, beneficial,          and permanent impact.         In general, changes          to physical features and addition of new structures and facilities within          the Valleywide cultural landscape would follow design guidelines consistent          with the  Secretary of Interior’s Standards and Guidelines for          Archeology and Historic Preservation  ( Secretary’s Standards ;          USDOI 1983). In this manner, the potential for impacts resulting from          addition of non-historic facilities would be reduced.         Historic Structures         Restoration of the          Merced River would result in the removal of Sugar Pine and Ahwahnee Bridges          , both listed in the National Register of Historic Places. This would          result in the loss of two individually significant historic structures,          resulting in a permanent, major, adverse impact. Although the physical          structures would be lost, these impacts would be mitigated through documentation          and salvage of historic materials, thus reducing the intensity of adverse          impacts from major to moderate. Documentation of Sugar Pine and Ahwahnee          Bridges has been completed, thus preserving a historical record of the          resources.         The individually          significant Superintendent’s House (Residence 1) and its associated          garage would be removed. As in Alternative 1, this would result in the          loss of the historic structure; therefore there would be no additional          adverse impact. However, this action would result in immediate, rather          than eventual, loss. The structures and their setting have already been          documented; thus, although the physical structures would be removed, a          historical record of this resource has been preserved. In addition, the          National Park Service would salvage historic materials as stipulated in          the Programmatic Agreement.          Other historic structures          that are not individually significant but contribute to the Valleywide          cultural landscape would be removed. These structures consist of the concessioner          stable and its associated structures, three pedestrian bridges at Lower          Yosemite Fall, and riprap, wing, and check dams along the Merced River          and its tributaries. In addition, four pedestrian bridges at Lower Yosemite          Fall would be rehabilitated or rebuilt. These actions would result in          the loss or change in contributing elements of the Valleywide landscape,          resulting in a permanent, moderate, adverse impact. Although the physical          structures would be lost or changed, these impacts would be mitigated          through documentation, thus reducing the intensity of adverse impacts          from moderate to minor.          Actions at Yosemite          Lodge and Housekeeping Camp would not result in the loss of any historic          structures or landscape resources, as there are no historic structures          or landscape resources in either of these developed areas.          Historic Districts          and Developed Areas         Yosemite Village:          The historic design and spatial organization of the Yosemite Village area          would be rehabilitated, resulting in the preservation of many historic          structures, and redevelopment of non-contributing areas within the district.          Many non-contributing structures would be removed or redesigned to be          more compatible with the historic character of Yosemite Village, based          on design guidelines developed in keeping with the  Secretary’s          Standards  (USDOI 1983). This would result in a permanent, moderate,          beneficial impact. Some existing land uses would change (e.g., removing          NPS stable and parkwide administration), but the types of land use historically          associated with the village, such as visitor services, education, museum,          and employee housing, would remain. In addition, the reestablishment of          historic viewsheds from within the village and the protection of the California          black oak woodland would enhance the historic character of the developed          area, resulting in a permanent, minor, beneficial impact.          Construction of day-visitor          parking, a transit center, and a fire station would introduce non-historic          facilities adjacent to the Yosemite Village Historic District, and would          require the removal of historic structures (Concessioner Headquarters          Building, Village Garage and associated apartment, and the Ahwahnee Row          houses and apartments) that contribute to the cultural landscape. These          actions would result in the loss of historic structures and introduction          of non-historic facilities, a permanent, moderate, adverse impact on the          cultural landscape and the adjacent Yosemite Village Historic District.          The loss of the historic structures would be mitigated by documentation,          and salvage of historic materials as stipulated in the Programmatic Agreement.          In this manner, a historical record would be preserved even though the          structures themselves would cease to exist. In cases where historic structures          would be lost, the National Park Service would first consider the possibility          of relocation and adaptive reuse in another location within the park.          In this manner, the intensity of adverse impacts would be reduced from          moderate to minor. The potential impacts associated with introducing non-historic          facilities would be reduced or avoided through the use of compatible design,          scale, massing, and material, and appropriate screening.          Actions at the National          Park Service maintenance area would result in the loss of the National          Park Service Operations Building (Fort Yosemite) and thirteen additional          historic structures that contribute to the cultural landscape. The loss          of these structures would result in a moderate, adverse impact to the          Valleywide landscape that would be mitigated through documentation and          salvage of historic materials, as stipulated in the Programmatic Agreement.          Thus, although the structures themselves would cease to exist, a historical          record would be preserved, reducing the intensity of adverse impacts from          moderate to minor.          In the Yosemite Village          Historic District, individually contributing structures would be retained          and some would be rehabilitated for adaptive reuse. The National Park          Service Administration Building would be rehabilitated for a new use as          a natural history museum. The Museum/Valley District Building would be          rehabilitated for use solely as a cultural history museum. Rehabilitation          of these structures would follow the  Secretary’s Standards  (USDOI          1983), and thus would have negligible impacts on the historic structures          and the district itself.          Curry Village and          the Camp Curry Historic District: Actions proposed for the Curry Village          developed area and the Camp Curry Historic District would result in the          loss of historic structures as well as construction of new facilities          within the historic district; collectively, these actions would result          in a permanent, major, adverse impact that would be reduced in intensity          as described below.         The historic Curry          Orchard, the Curry Orchard parking area, 277 historic guest tent cabins,          Tresidder Residence, Huff House, Cabin 90 A/B, and some historic comfort          stations would be removed, resulting in a permanent, major, adverse impact          to the historic district. The intensity of this impact would be reduced          by documentation of historic structures as described in the Programmatic          Agreement. In this manner, although the physical structures would be lost,          a historical record would be preserved. The resultant intensity of these          adverse impacts would therefore be moderate.         Other actions in          the Curry Village developed area would result in the rehabilitation and          adaptive reuse of several individual historic structures. These structures          consist of Mother Curry Bungalow, Stoneman Lodge, the 48 cabins-with-bath,          Cottage 819, the Lounge, and the Registration Building. Rehabilitation          would be accomplished in keeping with the  Secretary’s Standards           (USDOI 1983); thus, there would be negligible impact to historic structures.         Construction of 204          new cabins-with-bath would add non-historic facilities within the historic          district, resulting in a permanent, major, adverse impact. This impact          would be partly reduced through the use of compatible design materials,          thus potentially reducing the intensity of adverse impacts from major          to moderate. Construction of a campground check station and recreational          vehicle dump station would introduce non-historic facilities adjacent          to the historic district, potentially resulting in a moderate, adverse          impact. This impact would be reduced through use of compatible design          and appropriate screening, thus reducing the intensity of the impact from          moderate to minor.         The Ahwahnee: Removal          of the historic Ahwahnee tennis courts and restoration of the California          black oak woodland in this area would result in the loss of a contributing          element of The Ahwahnee National Register property; a minor adverse impact.          This would be partly mitigated by documentation as specified in the Programmatic          Agreement, thus reducing the intensity of impact from minor to negligible.          Redevelopment of the existing parking lot would result in a negligible          impact. Rehabilitation of the employee dormitory would be carried out          in keeping with the  Secretary’s Standards  (USDOI 1983), resulting          in a negligible impact.         Historic Sites         Actions at Camp 4          (Sunnyside Campground) would result in the loss of five contributing campsites,          the addition of five new campsites adjacent to the historic site, and          construction of employee housing facilities south of the historic site.          These actions will result in a permanent moderate adverse impact. These          impacts would be mitigated through documentation of resources to be removed,          design of the additional campsites to be compatible with the existing          historic site in terms of scale, massing, materials, and orientation,          and screening the housing from the historic site. These measures would          reduce the intensity of adverse impacts from moderate to minor.         Historic Orchards         The removal of Curry          Orchard would result in the loss of this resource, similar to Alternative          1, therefore there would be no additional adverse impact. However, this          action would result in this immediate (rather than eventual) loss. The          loss of this resource would be mitigated through initiation of a genetic          conservation program and documentation of the orchard; thus, a historical          record and representative plants would be preserved, although the orchards          would cease to exist. Maintaining Lamon and Hutchings Orchards would result          in a minor, beneficial impact on the Valleywide cultural landscape.         Out-of-Valley          Resources         El Portal         As described for          Alternatives 2, 3, and 4, the following impact analysis is based on general          land-use planning actions for El Portal area. The National Park Service          would undertake site-specific design studies and environmental review          to evaluate options for new housing and administrative facilities in El          Portal. The National Park Service would initiate further consultation          with the State Historical Preservation Office, culturally associated American          Indian tribes, and the public, as provided for in the Programmatic Agreement.          A complete and detailed assessment of impacts on historic properties would          be presented as part of that review.         As described for          Alternatives 2, 3, and 4, constructing single-family homes in Old El Portal          would not impact any historic resources, nor would constructing housing          and a day care center at Rancheria Flat in El Portal (the three historic          National Lead Company residences would be retained).         Similar to Alternatives          2, 3, and 4, the construction of apartments at Hillside East and West          would not impact any historic resources. Structures built adjacent to          El Portal Chapel (the old school) would be designed to be compatible with          the historical setting. Constructing high-density housing and support          facilities at Hennessey’s Ranch would not impact any historic structures.          Prior to design, the National Park Service would inventory and evaluate          the importance of potential cultural landscape features at this location,          remnants of Hennessey’s farming operation. If any significant resources          could not be avoided in site design, the National Park Service would undertake          further environmental review and impact mitigation prior to construction.                   The construction          of employee and day-visitor parking in the Village Center area, as well          as administrative and museum collection facilities at Railroad Flat and          a multi-use trail between Rancheria Flat and Village Center (through Hennessey          Ranch), would not impact any historic structures (the same as under Alternatives          2, 3, and 4).         Constructing apartments          and other community and commercial facilities at El Portal Village Center          could impact historic resources (such as the El Portal Market, the Railroad          residences, the old El Portal Store, and the El Portal Hotel). The precise          nature of impacts on historic resources is unknown, pending the siting          and design of the facilities. Every effort would be made to avoid or otherwise          mitigate adverse impacts, (e.g., through sensitive, compatible design          and the screening of modern development from historic structures). Should          avoidance of adverse impacts be impossible, documentation stipulated in          the Programmatic Agreement would reduce the intensity of the adverse impacts.                   As described for          Alternatives 2, 3, and 4, historic El Portal Hotel would be adaptively          rehabilitated or removed. Adaptive rehabilitation would be undertaken          in accordance with the  Secretary’s Standards  (USDOI 1983).          Because removal of the individually significant historic structure would          be a major, adverse impact, the National Park Service would follow stipulations          of the Programmatic Agreement to reduce the intensity of the adverse impact          from major to moderate.         Foresta and McCauley          Ranch         At Foresta, there          would be no impact to historic resources as a result of establishing day-visitor          parking and constructing single-family homes. Access improvements through          Foresta to McCauley Ranch, with possible replacement of the Crane Creek          Bridge, could (depending upon location and design) adversely affect potential          historic resources (i.e., the Foresta Road and Crane Creek Bridge) as          a result of loss or significant alternation. Constructing National Park          Service stables, as well as National Park Service wilderness utilities          and trails maintenance facilities at McCauley, would have unknown impacts          on historic resources. The National Park Service would conduct resource          inventory and evaluation studies, according to stipulations of the Programmatic          Agreement. The National Park Service would avoid adverse impacts to the          extent possible, and would mitigate any potential adverse impacts according          to stipulations in the Programmatic Agreement.          Merced River Gorge         Impacts under this          alternative would be the same as for Alternatives 2, 3, and 4. With mitigation,          the resultant impacts would be permanent, moderate, and adverse.         Other Areas         As described for          Alternatives 2, 3, and 4, the construction of new visitor centers at the          park entrance stations would have an unknown impact on historic resources.          The National Park Service would conduct inventory and evaluation studies,          according to stipulations of the Programmatic Agreement. The National          Park Service would avoid adverse impacts to the extent possible, and would          mitigate any potential adverse impacts according to the stipulations of          the Programmatic Agreement.         At Wawona, constructing          single-family homes would have no impacts on historic resources because          there are no historic structures, sites, or landscape resources in the          area proposed for housing construction.         Establishing day-visitor          parking at Henness Ridge would disturb two intact historic linear resources:          a logging railroad grade, and a historic road. The precise nature of impacts          on the historic resources is unknown, pending the siting and design of          the facilities, which would be the subject of future, tiered, site-specific          environmental compliance. Every effort would be made to avoid or otherwise          mitigate adverse impacts (through sensitive, compatible design). If avoidance          of adverse impacts was impossible, documentation stipulated in the Programmatic          Agreement would reduce the intensity of the adverse impacts.          Cultural          Landscape Resources Conclusion         Undertakings in Alternative          5 would have major to minor, beneficial and adverse impacts to the cultural          landscape and historic structural resources in Yosemite Valley. Adverse          impacts would result from the removal of historic structures, or from          the introduction of modern facilities and development either within or          adjacent to historic districts; however, new facilities would be designed          to be compatible with historic structures and districts.          Many of the actions          proposed in this alternative would result in an overall beneficial impact          to the large-scale natural systems that historically defined the Valley          floor, the Merced River Corridor, and the pattern of open meadows, California          black oak woodlands, and coniferous forests. Beneficial impacts would          also result from the rehabilitation of existing developed areas, particularly          through rehabilitation of the Yosemite Village Historic District. This          rehabilitation would incorporate adaptive use of historic structures,          removal of non-contributing structures, and new development based on design          guidelines to ensure compatibility with the historic district. In general,          adaptively using historic buildings would enhance their long-term preservation          and would be carried out in accordance with the  Secretary’s Standards           (USDOI 1983) .         There would be minor,          adverse impacts to the Valleywide historic land use patterns as a result          of changes such as relocating the river-related campgrounds from the Merced          River corridor to Upper and Lower Pines, and changes within the two historic          districts.         Changes proposed          to the historic circulation system (minor realignments and conversion          of one lane of part of Northside and Southside Drives to multi-use paved          trail) in the Valley would result in a minor, adverse impact to the cultural          landscape. However, the intensity of this impact would be reduced by the          use of design guidelines for compatible treatment based on the  Secretary’s          Standards  (USDOI 1983).         The loss of individually          significant historic structures and historic structures that contribute          to the significance of the Valleywide cultural landscape would result          in permanent, major, adverse impacts. Carrying out standard mitigation          measures (e.g., HABS/HAER documentation and salvage of historic materials)          under the Programmatic Agreement would reduce the intensity of adverse          impacts. In addition, in some cases where historic structures would be          removed, the National Park Service would first consider relocation and          adaptive reuse in another location within the park.          For some project          areas, the impacts on historic properties are unknown until further site-specific          historic resource studies have been undertaken, and project designs have          been more fully developed. In these instances, the park would carry out          any necessary inventories, and evaluations of National Register significance;          consultation with the State Historic Preservation Office and culturally          associated American Indian tribes and the public; and treatment/mitigation          as stipulated in the Programmatic Agreement prior to any construction          disturbance.         Cumulative          Impacts         Cumulative impacts          on historic resources would be the same as under Alternatives 2, 3, and          4. In Yosemite Valley and a regional context, implementation of this alternative          would result in minor, cumulative, adverse impacts in conjunction with          other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions.         MUSEUM          COLLECTION          Under this alternative,          the museum collection, research library, and archives would be moved to          a new facility in the El Portal area. This facility would be constructed          to meet applicable environmental and security control standards for museum          collection preservation. This action would benefit the collection by locating          them in one geographic area, making them easier to manage, in a facility          specifically designed for collection management and preservation. Access          to these materials (including ample study space) would be enhanced specifically          for researchers, rather than all park visitors, since this location would          be somewhat remote for general park visitors. Professional staff would          not be readily available to answer the questions of casual visitors, as          they are now available to do. There would be some potential for damage          and loss to the collection resulting from movement in and out of storage          to exhibit areas in Yosemite Valley. Overall, however, these measures          would have moderate to major, beneficial impacts on the collections and          public/staff use.          Museum          Collection Conclusion         Housing the museum,          archival, and library collections in a new, central, rehabilitated facility          would have moderate to major, beneficial impacts on the materials and          would significantly improve the park’s effectiveness in managing          and protecting these resources. Access to the materials would be enhanced          for researchers, with adequate space to carry out research. The park would          be able to achieve compliance with the protection and preservation guidelines          and standards prescribed by the National Park Service  Museum Handbook           (NPS 1990a) and  Director’s Order 28 — Cultural Resource Management           (NPS 1998l), as well as the  Draft Director’s Order 24 - Standards          for NPS Museum Collections Management  (NPS 1999e). While in transit          from storage to exhibit in Yosemite Valley, the objects would be exposed          to risk of damage.         Cumulative          Impacts         This alternative          would have minor, cumulative, beneficial effects on the museum collection          and archival materials in conjunction with other past, present, and reasonably          foreseeable future projects. Housing the resources in a central facility          with adequate environmental and security control systems would assist          their protection and long-term preservation. No adverse impacts to the          resources would be expected other than when the objects are in transit.          It is not reasonable to compare the Yosemite museum collection with that          of other repositories or sites, because of the extent and unique nature          of these collections. Facility upgrades and improved management of museum          collections and archives within the park would incrementally add to the          overall effectiveness of regional curation efforts.         SECTION          106 SUMMARY         As described for          Alternatives 2, 3, and 4, under regulations of the Advisory Council on          Historic Preservation (36 CFR 800.9), addressing the criteria of effect          and adverse effect, undertakings proposed under this alternative have          the potential to adversely affect significant historic properties. Ethnographic          resources would be disturbed or destroyed by construction occurring in          traditional plant-gathering areas, historic village sites, and/or places          holding special sacred and spiritual significance to American Indians.          Historic sites, structures, districts, and cultural landscape features          would also be adversely affected by undertakings entailing substantial          facility alteration or removal, or the introduction of modern non-contributing          development within or in proximity to historic districts and sensitive          landscape areas. To mitigate adverse effects, the park would carry out          HABS/HAER documentation; the salvage of historic materials; cooperative          agreement provisions for traditional plant gathering; or other suitable          mitigation in accordance with the Programmatic Agreement.         Many archeological          resources having varied potential to yield prehistoric and historic information          would be affected by ground-disturbing activities. To avoid adverse effects          to archeological resources, the park would carry out data recovery to          retrieve important information, in accordance with the Programmatic Agreement.         No adverse effects          to the park’s museum collections and archives would result from housing          materials in a central facility with adequate environmental and security          controls, other than while collections are in transit and are at risk.          The rehabilitation and adaptive use of historic buildings, restoration          of vegetation contributing to historic settings and the cultural landscape,          and the removal of non-contributing structures and landscape elements          would also have no adverse effect on historic properties. Rehabilitation          would be carried out in accordance with the  Secretary’s Standards           (USDOI 1983).         For project areas          lacking sufficient cultural resource data or design information to adequately          assess effects, the park would carry out inventories; evaluate identified          resources for National Register significance; and recommend avoidance          or appropriate treatment/standard mitigation measures prior to construction          disturbance.         Merced          Wild and Scenic River           This assessment is          based on the  Merced Wild and Scenic River Comprehensive Management          Plan/FEIS (Merced River Plan) , and the management elements of the           Merced River Plan . The applicable Merced Wild and Scenic River          segments are 2 (Yosemite Valley), 3A and 3B (Impoundment and Gorge), 4          (El Portal), and 7 (Wawona). See Vol. Ia, Chapter 3, Affected Environment,          for further discussion on the management elements of the  Merced River          Plan .         Alternatives have          been assessed within a river segment with regard to their: (1) impacts          on the Outstandingly Remarkable Values, the values for which the river          was designated by Congress; (2) compatibility with classifications; (3) compatibility          with the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act Section 7 determination process; (4) consistency          with the River Protection Overlay; and (5) consistency with management          zoning. The  Merced River Plan , which established the River Protection          Overlay, management zoning, Wild and Scenic Rivers Act Section 7 determination          process, and the Visitor Experience and Resource Protection framework          (within the wild and scenic river boundaries), is discussed as a cumulative          project.         Consistency of the           Final Yosemite Valley Plan/SEIS  alternatives with the wild and          scenic river boundaries are analyzed through the analysis of  Final          Yosemite Valley Plan/SEIS  consistency with the  Merced River Plan           management zoning.         YOSEMITE          VALLEY (SEGMENT 2)         Outstandingly          Remarkable Values Impacts         Outstandingly Remarkable          Values for this segment are scenic, geologic processes/conditions, recreation,          biological, cultural, and hydrologic processes. A description of the Outstandingly          Remarkable Values are found in Vol. II, Appendix B. Potential impacts          of this alternative are shown in table 4-130.         Actions to implement          the River Protection Overlay would have beneficial impacts on the scenic,          recreation, biological, cultural, and hydrologic processes Outstandingly          Remarkable Values. The River Protection Overlay prescription would be          an important parameter in implementing the actions listed in table 4-130.         The campground-related          actions would have both beneficial and adverse impacts on the Outstandingly          Remarkable Values. The campground-related actions would have an overall          beneficial effect on the scenic Outstandingly Remarkable Value due to          restoration of areas visible from the river. These actions would have          a beneficial impact on the recreational Outstandingly Remarkable Value          because camping opportunities would be retained. There would be a beneficial          impact on the hydrologic processes Outstandingly Remarkable Value because          of restoration of riparian areas, and because campsites would be removed          from close proximity to the river. New campsites within the 100-year floodplain          (e.g., Yellow Pines, North Pines, and Upper Pines Campgrounds) would be          located outside of the River Protection Overlay and would have minimal,          adverse impacts on the flood regime. There would be a beneficial impact          on the biological Outstandingly Remarkable Value because restoration of          river-related vegetation would occur within the River Protection Overlay,          but also an adverse impact because radiating impacts from the campgrounds          would degrade the quality of this habitat, and some river-related vegetation          outside the River Protection Overlay would continue to be displaced by          campsites.         The Housekeeping          Camp-related actions would have a long-term, beneficial effect on the          scenic Outstandingly Remarkable Value due to restoration of areas visible          from the river. Removal of Housekeeping Camp units could have an adverse          effect on cultural Outstandingly Remarkable Values due to potential disturbance          of river-related archeological resources. The actions at Housekeeping          Camp would have a beneficial impact on the biological and hydrologic processes          Outstandingly Remarkable Values because restoration of riparian areas          and because Housekeeping Camp lodging units would be removed from close          proximity to the river. These actions would not adversely impact the recreational          Outstandingly Remarkable Value because Housekeeping Camp lodging units          would be retained.

                NA = Not Applicable          Actions at Yosemite          Lodge have beneficial and adverse impacts on the Outstandingly Remarkable          Values. The removal of Yosemite Lodge units, and restoration of the former          cabins area and the area between Yosemite Lodge and the Merced River would          have a beneficial impact on the biological and hydrologic processes Outstandingly          Remarkable Values. The relocation of Northside Drive and construction          of parking would have a minor, adverse impact on the hydrologic processes          Outstandingly Remarkable Value because they would be placed in the 100-year          floodplain, and would alter the 100-year flood event. Also, an indirect          beneficial impact would occur because lodging units (which impede flood          flow more than roads and parking lots) can be constructed outside of the          boundary. As described in the Water Resources section of this chapter,          impacts to hydrologic processes would be minimal because flood flow in          this area is low velocity, and is not appreciably affected by parking          areas or roads. The construction of lodging units would result in minor,          adverse, radiating impacts on the meadow and riparian communities inside          the boundary.         At Curry Village,          cultural Outstandingly Remarkable Values could be adversely affected due          to potential disturbance of river-related archeological resources during          Curry Village redevelopment. There would be no impact on the hydrologic          processes Outstandingly Remarkable Value, because Curry Village is located          outside of the floodplain. There would be minor, adverse radiating impacts          on river-related vegetation due to trampling.         Reconstruction of          the El Portal Road between Pohono Bridge and Cascades Diversion Dam and          removal of Cascades Diversion Dam would have both beneficial and adverse          impacts on the Outstandingly Remarkable Values (see discussion of dam          removal in Segment 3A/3B). The existing road has localized, adverse impacts          on the biological Outstandingly Remarkable Value because it displaces          river-related vegetation, and to the hydrologic processes Outstandingly          Remarkable Value because riprap that supports the road is partially in          the river channel. However, since this road segment provides a critical          visitor access link, its reconstruction would also be beneficial to the          recreation Outstandingly Remarkable Value by maintaining access to Yosemite          Valley. [Note: These two actions span river Segments 2, 3A and 3B.]         Removal of bridges          would have both beneficial and adverse impacts on the Outstandingly Remarkable          Values. These actions would have beneficial impacts on the biological          Outstandingly Remarkable Value because the riverbank can be restored,          and substantial, beneficial impacts on the hydrologic processes Outstandingly          Remarkable Value because the free-flowing condition of the river would          be improved, and the river would have increased ability to meander. These          actions would have adverse impacts on the cultural Outstandingly Remarkable          Value because they result in the loss of important historic structures,          and change historic circulation patterns.         The continuation          of parking at Camp 6 would have both beneficial and adverse impacts on          the Outstandingly Remarkable Values. Removal of parking from close proximity          to the river would result in a beneficial impact on the scenic, biological,          and hydrologic processes Outstandingly Remarkable Values. Expansion of          parking in an area that is already disturbed would have adverse impacts          on the biological and hydrologic processes Outstandingly Remarkable Values.                   Actions at Yosemite          Village would have adverse effects on scenic Outstandingly Remarkable          Values because redevelopment activities would be visible from the river.          Hydrologic Outstandingly Remarkable Values would be adversely affected          due to redevelopment of a small area of Yosemite Village (not including          Camp 6) in the 100-year floodplain. There would be radiating impacts on          river-related vegetation due to density of visitor use in the area.          Development of a          traffic check station at Taft Toe would have adverse impacts on the Outstandingly          Remarkable Values. Construction of a traffic check station would have          an adverse effect on the cultural Outstandingly Remarkable Value, since          it would damage river-related archeological deposits and traditional gathering          areas.         There would continue          to be an absence of major development in west Yosemite Valley. Development          would be limited to existing roads and parking areas, trails, and a few          picnic areas. As a result, limited adverse effects on Outstandingly Remarkable          Values would occur in this area, including loss of vegetation and intrusion          of new facilities on scenic views, and potential disturbance of river-related          cultural resources.          Yosemite          Valley (Segment 2) Conclusion         For the actions of          this alternative, a long-term, minor, beneficial impact is described for          the Outstandingly Remarkable Values, largely due to the removal of facilities          that impede flood flow and inhibit the natural meandering of the river;          the restoration of substantial areas of high-value resources in the River          Protection Overlay and wild and scenic river corridor; the improvement          of the scenic interface of river, rock, meadow, and forest; and the maintenance          of the diversity of river-related recreational opportunities. The beneficial          impact of this alternative is somewhat offset by the adverse impact on          the cultural Outstandingly Remarkable Value resulting from the removal          of historic structures and potential disturbance of river-related archeological          resources.         Segment-wide, this          alternative would have a long-term, minor, beneficial impact on the scenic          Outstandingly Remarkable Value because of the removal of many facilities          visible from the river or riverbank, and improvement of the scenic interface          of river, rock, meadow and forest via restoration, campground removal,          and road removal/relocation. However, for facilities that are to remain          or be redeveloped, some adverse scenic impacts would continue, although          to a lesser degree than under the No Action Alternative.          Segment-wide, there          are no impacts to the geologic processes/conditions Outstandingly Remarkable          Value, because of the absence of actions affecting the U-shaped valley,          and moraines of Yosemite Valley. Impacts related to the meandering river          are discussed in the Water Resources section of this chapter.         Segment-wide, there          would be a long-term, moderate, beneficial impact on the recreation Outstandingly          Remarkable Value because the diversity of river-related recreational opportunities          would be maintained.         Segment-wide, there          would be a long-term, minor, beneficial impact on the biological Outstandingly          Remarkable Value because of the reduction of facilities in general, and          the restoration of riparian areas and meadows in particular. Although          construction of several new facilities (e.g., campsites, roads, multi-use          paths, and picnic areas) would pose some adverse, localized impacts on          the biological Outstandingly Remarkable Value, these impacts are outweighed          by the substantial restoration actions that would take place throughout          this segment.         Segment-wide, there          would be long-term, minor to moderate, adverse impact on the cultural          Outstandingly Remarkable Value because of the removal of river-related          historic structures, and potential disturbance of river-related archeological          resources. The historic structures that are being removed, particularly          bridges, adversely affect the hydrologic processes Outstandingly Remarkable          Value, and their removal would have major, beneficial impacts on the hydrologic          processes Outstandingly Remarkable Value, and contribute substantially          to the restoration of the free-flowing condition of the river.         Segment-wide, there          would be long-term, minor, beneficial impact on the hydrologic processes          Outstandingly Remarkable Value because of the removal of structures that          impede flood flow or inhibit the natural meandering of the river, and          the restoration of areas in the Merced River corridor. Removal of structures          would contribute substantially to the restoration of the free-flowing          condition of the river, and would further the policy established by Congress          in the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to preserve designated rivers in their          free-flowing condition. New facilities within the floodplain would have          minimal, adverse impacts on the flood regime.         The National Park          Service would exert its best efforts to design and reconstruct the El          Portal Road between Cascades Diversion Dam and Pohono Bridge with few,          if any, additional impacts on the free-flowing condition of the river.          If it proves infeasible to design and construct the road in a manner that          would avoid direct and adverse impacts to the values for which the river          was designated, the National Park Service would report to Congress in          accordance with Section 7 of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. In either          case, further site-specific environmental compliance, including compliance          with Section 7 of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, would be undertaken          for this project.         Cumulative          Impacts         Impacts to the Outstandingly          Remarkable Values would occur as a result of other past and reasonably          foreseeable future actions (see Vol. II, Appendix H for the list of cumulative          projects considered in this analysis).         Past Actions         The Merced Wild and          Scenic River Comprehensive Management Plan (NPS) established the River          Protection Overlay, management zoning, and the Visitor Experience and          Resource Protection framework inside the wild and scenic river boundaries.          The River Protection Overlay is implemented through this plan, and its          beneficial impacts on the Outstandingly Remarkable Values have been assessed          as part of the impacts of this alternative. This project also establishes          management zoning, which does not directly impact the Outstandingly Remarkable          Values. The Visitor Experience and Resource Protection process was designed          to protect resources and the visitor experience, and would have a beneficial          impact by focusing on protection of Outstandingly Remarkable Values. The          Visitor Experience and Resource Protection framework would have a long-term,          moderate, beneficial effect on Outstandingly Remarkable Values in this          segment.          In 1991, the U.S.          Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management developed a joint South          Fork and Merced Wild and Scenic River Implementation Plan (USFS and BLM)          for the segments of the main stem and South Fork of the Merced River that          are under their jurisdiction. The plan is a general management plan with          many prescriptive goals and few actions. The   South Fork and Merced          Wild and Scenic River Implementation Plan does not affect the Outstandingly          Remarkable Values of this segment.         Reasonably Foreseeable          Future Actions         The National Park          Service proposes to reconstruct the trail from Happy Isles to Vernal Falls          (NPS). This project would have a beneficial impact on the recreation Outstandingly          Remarkable Value due to the provision of an improved trail between Happy          Isles and Vernal Falls, which contributes to a spectrum of river-related          recreational activities. The net effect of this project would be a long-term,          minor, beneficial impact on Outstandingly Remarkable Values.         The Eagle Creek Ecological          Restoration project (NPS) would restore the confluence of Eagle Creek          with the Merced River, and remove rip-rap at the confluence and along          the creek. This project would have a long-term, moderate, beneficial impact          on the hydrologic processes and biological Outstandingly Remarkable Values.         The past and reasonably          foreseeable future projects would have a long-term, moderate, beneficial          effect on Outstandingly Remarkable Values due to the establishment of          the  Merced River Plan  Visitor Experience and Resource Protection          framework; improved river-related recreation opportunities from Happy          Isles to Vernal Falls; and restored riparian habitat and hydrologic processes          at the Eagle Creek and Merced River confluence.          For the actions of          this alternative, a long-term, minor, beneficial impact is described for          the Outstandingly Remarkable Values, largely due to the removal of facilities          that impede flood flow and inhibit the natural meandering of the river;          the restoration of substantial areas of highly valued resources in the          River Protection Overlay and wild and scenic river corridor; the improvement          of the scenic interface of river, rock, meadow, and forest; and the maintenance          of the diversity of river-related recreational opportunities. The cumulative          projects would have a long-term, moderate, beneficial effect on Outstandingly          Remarkable Values due to the establishment of the  Merced River Plan           Visitor Experience and Resource Protection framework; improved river-related          recreational opportunities from Happy Isles to Vernal Falls; and restored          riparian habitat and hydrologic processes at the Eagle Creek and Merced          River confluence. When the impacts of all of the past and reasonably foreseeable          future actions described above are considered in combination with the          expected impacts on the Outstandingly Remarkable Values from this alternative,          long-term, moderate, beneficial   effects on the Outstandingly Remarkable          Values of this segment would likely result.         Consistency          with the Merced River Plan         Similar to Alternative          2, the actions of this alternative in this segment of the Merced Wild          and Scenic River would comply with the  Merced River Plan  and be          consistent with its management elements. The collective actions would          be consistent with the classification of this segment because accessibility          by road or trail would be essentially unchanged and the amount of development          in the watershed and on the shorelines would not substantially change,          although development on the shorelines would be reduced through removal          of facilities in the River Protection Overlay. The individual actions          that are considered to be water resources projects, such as removal of          bridges, would be subject to the Section 7 determination process. The          River Protection Overlay would be implemented and individual actions would          be compatible with the River Protection Overlay prescription, with many          facilities being removed from the River Protection Overlay. The individual          actions would be consistent with the respective management zones established          in the  Merced River Plan . Some actions, such as the removal of          infrastructure from the former Rivers Campground, remove existing facilities          or uses that do not conform with the corresponding management zone prescriptions.                   IMPOUNDMENT          (SEGMENT 3A) AND          GORGE (SEGMENT 3B)         Outstandingly          Remarkable Values Impacts         Outstandingly Remarkable          Values identified for the recreational impoundment segment of the river          are geologic processes/conditions, and biological. Outstandingly Remarkable          Values identified for the scenic gorge segment of the river are scenic,          geologic processes/conditions, recreation, biological, cultural, and hydrologic          processes. A description of the Outstandingly Remarkable Values is found          in Vol. II, Appendix B.          The impacts of this          alternative on the Outstandingly Remarkable Values for this segment would          be the same as under Alternative 2 (see Alternative 2, table 4-40,          for more details).         Impoundment          (Segment 3A) and Gorge (Segment 3B) Conclusion         The impacts of this          alternative on the Outstandingly Remarkable Values for this segment would          be the same as under Alternative 2. This alternative would have a          long-term, moderate to major, beneficial impact on Outstandingly Remarkable          Values, largely because the removal of Cascades Diversion Dam and implementation          of the River Protection Overlay would substantially improve the free-flowing          condition of the river; enhance riparian habitat and rainbow trout movement;          and improve views of waterfalls and cliffs. This beneficial impact is          somewhat offset by adverse impacts on cultural Outstandingly Remarkable          Values associated with the increased risk of damage to historic engineering          projects resulting from Cascades Diversion Dam removal, and the removal          of Cascades Houses (see Alternative 2 for more details).         Cumulative          Impacts         Cumulative impacts          under this alternative would be the same as under A"

The four-mile round trip route follows the path the Great Flood took in 1889, along the Little Conemaugh River from South Fork to the Conemaugh Viaduct.  The original viaduct temporarily blocked the flood before collapsing.  Rangers will share stories of the Flood along the way.   The hikes begin at 11:00 am each day.  This program is limited to 40 participants.  Call the Flood Memorial at (814) 495-4643 to register and for directions to the starting point.  Rangers suggest participants wear sturdy shoes and bring water and a bag lunch.  The group will stop at the viaduct for a picnic lunch.  The hike lasts approximately three hours.     The National Park Serve cares for special places set aside by the American people so that all may experience our heritage.  Johnstown Flood National Memorial commemorates the Johnstown Flood of May 31, 1889.  The park contains nearly 165 acres and preserves the remains of the South Fork Dam and portions of the former Lake Conemaugh bed.  It is located at 733 Lake Road, in St. Michael, Pennsylvania.

The paintings will be enlarged to fill the walls            of a circular room, placing the viewer in the center of the meadow as            the opposing forces take their positions just prior to the battle.                      The first painting, ""A Charming Field for an Encounter"" was            unveiled May 24, 2002. This painting shows the British forces forming            for a pitched battle that never took place. Scroll down to see how this            painting took shape.           The companion piece shows the French and Indian forces beginning to            surround the meadow for a siege.

The National Park Service is offering a tour of the Allegheny Portage Railroad and the 1889 Johnstown Flood.  Both tours will start on Sunday, June 15 and continue through Saturday, August 23.  Both tours start at 12 noon and end around 4:30p.m.  Transportation and tour guide are provided free of charge, however, there are admission fees at two of the sites for each tour.       The tour starting at Allegheny Portage Railroad National Historic Site will explore an exceptional story combining engineering, steam engines, and canal boats of the early and mid 1800's.   The tour will begin at the visitor center and includes stops at the newly opened Hollidaysburg Canal Basin Park, the famous Horseshoe Curve National Historic Landmark and the Gallitzin Tunnels.  The cost of admission to Allegheny Portage Railroad is $3.00 for adults.  Children age 16 and under are free.  The Horseshoe Curve admission is $3.00 for adults and $1.50 for children age 6-17.  This program is offered Wednesday through Sunday.   The tour of the Johnstown Flood begins at the visitor center of the Johnstown Flood National Memorial.  Participants will visit the remains of the South Fork Dam, which burst on May 31, 1889 despite valiant last minute efforts to fortify it.  The failed dam unleashed a raging torrent that destroyed the city of Johnstown and killed over two thousand people.  Participants will visit the Clubhouse of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club as well as travel through many of the local boroughs that the waters destroyed along the twenty-mile path of the Flood.  At the Johnstown Flood Museum, visitors will hear stories of the survivors of the Flood and visit Grandview Cemetery where many of the victims were laid to rest. Participants will also get an exceptional view of the path of the Flood from the top of the Johnstown Incline.   The price of admission to Johnstown Flood National Memorial is $3.00 for adults and children 16 and under are free at the National Park site.  The Johnstown Flood Museum fees are $4.00 per adult, $3.00 for each child age 6-17 and $3.50 for seniors age 62+.      This tour is offered Thursday through Monday.   Since each tour starts at 12:00 it is a good idea to eat lunch before the tour begins.

GX229-14-16139404	Exhibits          Visitors      to Dickson Mounds Museum's more than 15,000 square feet of exhibits discover      many different ways of interpreting the past, including innovative displays      of artifacts, arts, and archaeology; exciting hands-on activities; and multi-media      presentations.                        T he    River Valley Gallery      explores the character of the Illinois River and traces the interaction    between the river and the people who lived along it from the end of the Ice    Age to the present day. The story is told through innovative displays and  Legacy ,    a large-screen video production that captures the panorama of the past and leads    one to a real-life view of the river valley today.         People    of the Valley     portrays a sequence of cultures -- from Ice-Age hunters to the tribal groups    that left Illinois in the 19th century -- through artifacts, murals, photographs,    and exciting hands-on exhibits.        Reflections      on Three Worlds       reveals the world of Mississippian people whose 800-year-old sites surround      the museum today. The exhibits depict the complex life and culture of these      people, trace in detail the evidence of archaeology, and lead to a spectacular      multimedia event that takes one through a kaleidoscope of sights, sounds,      symbols, music and voices of the three worlds of Mississippian belief.              Other      exhibits at Dickson Mounds include an interactive  Discovery      Center ;   a   Special      Exhibits Gallery ; the  Eveland      Village Site , where the remains of three early Mississippian      buildings are preserved for viewing on the museum grounds; and an exhibit      that tells the story of the museum itself,  History .            Those      wishing to schedule a tour or program at the museum will find details at  Group      Programs .

Cascades Diversion Dam is located in  Yosemite   National Park  on the Merced Wild and  Scenic   River  near the intersection of  El Portal Road  and  Big Oak Flat Road . As called for in the  Yosemite Valley Plan , the National Park Service proposes to remove the dam in order to restore the natural free-flowing condition of the  Merced River . Additionally, the structure sustained damage during the flood of 1997 and currently poses a threat of possible uncontrolled and sudden failure. The dam was constructed in 1917 as part of a hydroelectric generating facility that was taken off line in 1985, and no longer serves a useful purpose.          Public and agency participation has been a key element throughout this planning process. In the winter of 2001,  Yosemite National Park  held informal public scoping to solicit ideas and concerns from park visitors, staff, American Indian groups, scientists, park partner organizations, and government agencies. The planning team reviewed public comments and identified a range of issues and concerns. This information was used to develop the alternatives and analysis in this Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project Environmental Assessment.          There will be a 30-day comment period on the environmental assessment. If the environmental assessment and a Finding of No Significant Impact are approved, dam removal is expected to take place in fall 2003 in order for demolition of the structure to occur during the period of low water flows.          We appreciate your interest in this planning effort and welcome your participation. Comments must be submitted in writing by  March 24, 2003  and may be sent to:         Mail:          Superintendent,  Yosemite   National Park                        ATTN.: Cascades Diversion Dam Removal Project                         P.O.

GX061-69-16571174	"On May              31st, 1889, a dam burst upstream from Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Although              ample warnings were given, these were in general disregarded by the              people of Johnstown and other downstream towns. The result was over              2,000 people killed within a few minutes. The following is an account              of that terrible day:              "" Friday,              May 31st, 1889 . The day before had been a solemn holiday. In every              village veterans of the War for the Union had gathered; in every cemetery              flowers had been strewn upon the gravemounds of the heroic dead. Now              the people were resuming the every-day toil. The weather was rainy.              It had been wet for some days. Stony Creek and Conemaugh were turbid              and noisy. The little South Fork, which ran into the upper end of              the lake, was swollen into a raging torrent. The lake was higher than              usual; higher than ever. But the valley below lay in fancied security,              and all the varied activities of life pursued their wonted round.               ""Friday,              May 31st, 1889 . Record that awful date in characters of funereal              hue. It was a dark and stormy day, and amid the darkness and the storm              the angel of death spread his wings over the fated valley, unseen,              unknown. Midday comes. Disquieting rumors rush down the valley. There              is a roar of an approaching storm - approaching doom! The water swiftly              rises. A horseman thunders down the valley: ""To the hills, for God's              sake! To the hills, for your lives!"" They stare at him as at a madman,              and their hesitating feet linger in the valley of the shadow of death,              and the shadow swiftly darkens, and the everlasting hills veil their              faces with rain and mist before the scene that greets them. ""This              is what happened: - ""The heavy rainfall raised the lake until its              water began to pour over the top of the dam. The dam itself - wretchedly              built of mud and boulders - saturated through and through, began to              leak copiously here and there. Each watery sapper and miner burrowed              on, followers swiftly enlarging the murderous tunnels. The whole mass              became honeycombed. And still the rain poured down, and still the              South Fork and a hundred minor streams sent in their swelling floods,              until, with a roar like that of the opening gates of the Inferno belching              forth the legions of the damned, the wall gave way, and with the rush              of a famished tiger into a sheepfold, the whirlwind of water swept              down the valley on its errand of destruction -              ""And              like a horse unbroken,               When first he feels the rein,               The furious river struggled hard,              And tossed his tawny mane,               And burst the curb and bounded,               Rejoicing to be free,               And, whirling down in mad career,              Battlement and plank and pier, Rushed headlong to the sea!""              ""According              to the statements of people who lived in Johnstown and other towns              on the line of the river, ample time was given to the inhabitants              of Johnstown by the railroad officials and by other gentlemen of standing              and reputation. In hundreds of cases this warning was utterly disregarded,              and those who heeded it early in the day were looked upon as cowards,              and many jeers were uttered by lips that now are cold. The people              of Johnstown also had a special warning in the fact that the dam in              Stony Creek, just above the town, broke about noon, and thousands              of feet of lumber passed down the river. Yet they hesitated, and even              when the wall of water, almost forty feet high, was at their doors,              one man is said by a survivor to have told his family that the stream              would not rise very high.""

GX226-45-3280478	"Jump to Text         Federal Lands Alternative Transportation Systems Study   Field Reports     Johnstown Flood National Memorial     n    1.0 Summary    Figure 1. View of Lake Conemaugh Bed        The Johnstown Flood National Memorial (NM), located in southwestern Pennsylvania, commemorates the over 2,000 lives lost due to break in the old South Fork Dam on May 31, 1889.  The Park preserves the remains of the South Fork Dam and portions of the former Lake Conemaugh bed and provides educational and recreational opportunities for 178,413 annual visitors (1999).  Figure 1 shows a view of the Visitor Center from the far embankment of the Lake Conemaugh bed.  The average visit to the memorial is approximately two hours, which allows for sufficient parking turnover and little to no congestion, even during most peak season days.  The Park currently rents a bus and conducts tours during summer Sundays.  These tours circle the old lakebed and visit the South Fork Hunting and Fishing Club Historic District, where a number of buildings from the time of the flood still stand.  The Park would like to continue that service and possible expand these interpretive opportunities with the following services:      The Staple Bend Tunnel, the oldest railroad tunnel in the United States, has been purchased by the NPS and is being renovated.  It will be part of the Allegheny Portage NHS unit, which is 20 miles away, but is only seven miles from the Johnstown Flood NM.  Because Staple Bend is only accessible via a narrow, Winding County road and parking will be limited, a shuttle from the Johnstown Flood Visitor Center should be considered.   A shuttle service between the Visitor Center, St. Michael and/or downtown Johnstown would help visitors to understand the path of the flood and help the Park to interpret resources in both those locations.  It is likely that this would begin as a tour until a larger market for shuttle service was established.       n    2.0 Background Information  2.1 Location    The Johnstown Flood NM is located in southwestern Pennsylvania approximately 10 miles northeast of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, off U.S. Route 219 (see Figure 2).    2.2 Administration and Classification    The Johnstown Flood NM is part of a four-site administrative unit in southwestern Pennsylvania that also includes the Allegheny Portage National Historic Site (NHS), the Fort Necessity National Battlefield and the Friendship Hill NHS.    2.3 Physical Description    The 165 acres of the Park preserves the remains of the South Fork Dam and portions of the Lake Conemaugh bed.  The memorial site is bordered by U.S. Route 219 to the northwest and the Lake Conemaugh basin to the southeast.  The memorial site provides views of the basin form two abutments of the historical South Fork dam.  The parks major attractions include:      The Visitors Center with exhibits and a 35-minute film experience that recreates the Great Flood of 1889;   The Colonel Unger house overlooking Lake Conemaugh; and   Walking trails to the north and south abutment of the South Fork dam from picnic areas on the abutments.         2.4 Mission and Goals of the National Historic Site    The Johnstown Flood of 1889 resulted from the rupture of the old South Fork Dam maintained by the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club.  It was the deadliest flood in the Nations history.  The mission of the Park is to revere the memory of the 2,200 people who died in the flood through the education of the public.  The Park also provides a recreational experience for picnickers.    2.5 Visitation Levels and Visitor Profile    The number of visitors to the memorial in 1999 was 178,413.  This represented a decline from 189,497 in 1998.  Peak visitation of over 323,000 occurred during the 100 th  anniversary of the flood in 1989.  Between 1990 and 1998, visitation remained relatively stable with a low of 179,000 in 1994 and a high of 199,000 in 1990.  Most visitors to the Park are local residents who use the facilities for picnicking and hiking.  Visitor Center attendance in 1998 was 37,677, down from a 1992 high of over 57,000.  Peak visitation months are in the summer and fall foliage seasons.  An ideal day visit to the Park includes time at the Visitor Center to view the exhibits, see the Unger house, a 35-minute film and a 15-minute ranger presentation, an hour-long bus tour around the lake bed with an interpretive guide, a picnic lunch at one of the picnic sites, and a short hike on one of the lake bed trails.  A visit such as this may last approximately four hours.  Most visitors stay approximately one to two hours including viewing the film.  The Park offers special programs during the summer months including a slide presentation entitled ""Sailboats on the Mountain"" and a ranger presentation entitled ""Tales of the Great Flood.""  Most special programs are presented daily and a few, including the bus tour, are available on Sundays only.    n    3.0 Existing Conditions, Issues and Concerns  3.1 Transportation Conditions, Issues and Concerns    The Johnstown Flood Memorial has one entrance/exit to the Visitors Center area and two picnic areas on the Lake Conemaugh abutments.  Although parking is limited at both the Visitor Center and picnic areas, the length of visitor stay preempts the need for additional parking.  Parking lots are rarely crowded and there is little to no congestion.  The distance tot he nearest town facilities necessitates a car.  Figure 3 shows the visitor center parking lot on a summer day.    3.2 Community Development Conditions, Issues and Concerns    The nearest towns to the Johnstown Flood Memorial are small with few destination attractions for Park visitors.  There are no towns directly adjacent to the memorial.  The City of Johnstown has a museum that is not associated with the Park, and concentrates on the recovery.  It is frequently a secondary stop to the Johnstown Flood NM.      Figure 3. Visitor Center Parking Lot on a Summer Day          3.3 Natural or Cultural Resource Conditions, Issues and Concerns    The house of Colonel Unger, former President of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, is preserved as part of the national memorial.  Colonel Unger had noticed the high-water level of Lake Conemaugh on the morning of May 31, 1889 and sent John Parke, the clubs engineer to the nearest town to send a message to Johnstown.  Figure 4 shows the house of Colonel Unger overlooking Lake Conemaugh.  The lakebed and memorial are cultural resources for the region but does not experience damage due to the transportation activities related to the Park.    3.4 Recreation Conditions, Issues and Concerns    The recreation opportunities available include hiking and picnicking.  Neither of these activities is impeded by the traffic situation at the Park.      Figure 4. Colonel Unger House          n    4.0 Planning and Coordination  4.1 Unit Plans    The Park is active in offering special seasonal programming for local and regional visitors.    4.2 Public and Agency Coordination    The Park communicated with the Johnstown Flood Museum about special events, although primary coordination with the public occurs through the superintendents office at the Allegheny Portage NHS.    n    5.0 Assessment of Need  5.1 Magnitude of Need    Due to the low level of visitation, the specialized attraction of the Park, and due to the lack of parking and congestion difficulties, there is no immediate need for an Alternative Transportation System (ATS) at this time or in the foreseeable future.  However, there are future ATS opportunities associated with the opening of the Staple Bend Tunnel unit and the Parks desire for additional interpretation of the flood, its causes and its aftermath.    5.2 Feasible Alternatives    The opening of the Staple Bend Tunnel will create a need for improved transportation.  The Tunnel, while a unit of Allegheny Portage NHS, is located only about seven miles from Johnstown Flood NM, and is accessible via a narrow, winding County road.  Parking at the site will be very limited.  Johnstown Flood NM Visitor Center would be the logical point from which to run a shuttle service to Staple Bend.  The Park currently operates a tour around the old lakebed on summer Sundays.  An important part of this tour is the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club Historic District and the 1889 Clubhouse in the town of St. Michael.  The story of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club is an important piece in understanding the events that led to the flood, and its aftermath.  A shuttle between St. Michael and the Visitor Center would enable more visitors to experience these resources.  Park management has also noted that visitors could gain an improved understanding of the flood and its impacts via a full tour of the communities in the path of the flood between the dam and Johnstown.

The National Park Service proposes to remove the dam in order to restore          the natural free flowing condition of the Merced River. The dam was constructed          in 1917 as part of a hydroelectric generating facility that was taken          off line in 1985, and no longer serves a useful purpose. Additionally,          the structure is dilapidated and currently poses a threat of possible          uncontrolled and sudden failure.          The environmental assessment evaluates the potential impacts of the following          three alternatives that are identified and analyzed:                   Alternative 1 - No Action                     Alternative 2 - Complete Dam Removal (the ""preferred alternative"")                     Alternative 3 - Partial Dam Removal (retains the river right dam abutment            and intake structure)                 The Cascades Diversion Dam Removal EA will be available for public review          and comment from February 20th, 2003 to March 24th, 2003.

The Lewis and                Clark Expedition was all of this and more. However, it is astounding                that the expedition is so rarely talked about in terms of its scientific                achievements. It is as though the popular image of Lewis and Clark                has come to coincide with the image Spanish bureaucrats had in 1804.                The Spanish were skeptical that the expedition's announced ""scientific""                goals were anything but a smokescreen for a blatant march across                territory they claimed in the name of His Catholic Majesty. Today,                the Lewis and Clark Expedition should be celebrated for what it                was - and this includes the fact that it was one of the first systematic                scientific evaluations of a region ever conducted. Most scientists                understand this aspect of the story, but the general public is often                baffled by all that scientific jargon and those long, boring, copious                notes on plants, animals and geology cut out of most early published                versions of the journals. It is the fact that the findings of Lewis                and Clark went unpublished for so long that often keeps them from                being considered for their scientific work.                Also, President Thomas Jefferson's penchant                for secrecy and duplicity does not help  accentuate                the importance of this scientific work for the modern reader. He                soft-pedaled the scientific aspects of the expedition even as he                asked Congress for money. The purposes of the expedition were twofold,                Jefferson claimed, but only the first purpose was of any real consequence                - the diplomatic mission of contacting Indian nations, establishing                the United States as sovereign over the region and as a major player                in the fur trade. He made the second purpose, the scientific one,                seem like an inconsequential afterthought. Jefferson knew that diplomacy,                especially with the goal of increased commerce, could be sold to                Congress; scientific discovery and description could not. One seemed                practical, the other less so.                Yet, as Jefferson wrote letters of introduction                for his 29-year-old personal secretary, Meriwether Lewis, to the                most distinguished American scientists of the day, he played up                that second goal - to not only explore but also map and chronicle                everything of interest, as he put it, along ""the only line of easy                communication across the continent."" And Jefferson's own interest                in this type of expedition - a scientific one - should never be                discounted. Such a ""voyage of discovery"" had been a dream of his                father, Peter Jefferson, and Thomas had tried to mount such an expedition                four times with four different men prior to his Presidency. Jefferson                was himself an amateur scientist who must stand with the foremost                men of his time. Notes on the State of Virginia, his only book,                was one of the first examples of scientific geography, preceding                the work of Humboldt by 50 years, and drawing upon Bernhard Varenius'                Geographia generalis (1650). By 1803, Jefferson was probably the                most informed American on the totality of the geography of the West,                and had the largest library anywhere on this subject.                It is obvious that Jefferson played many                political games to launch the Lewis and Clark expedition, but we                should never discount the incredible scientific work the explorers                accomplished. They made the first systematic reports, based on scientific                measurement and observations, of the Missouri River - not only its                course, but its flora and fauna, depth and current, tributaries                and inhabitants. By my count they described for science 120 mammals,                birds, reptiles and fish, as well as at least 182 new plant species.                They made the first attempt at a systematic record of the meteorology                of the West, and less successfully attempted to determine the latitude                and longitude of significant geographical points. Their maps were                invaluable, their descriptions of the country's geology important.                These facts set them apart from contemporary expeditions, most notably                those of Zebulon Pike, which made no new scientific discoveries.                               There is a reason that such wonderful, Enlightenment-influenced                scientific work was possible  on                the Voyage of Discovery - and that reason was Meriwether Lewis.                If not for Lewis' incredible intelligence, background knowledge                of the rudimentary science of his day, powers of observation and                his ability to apply this knowledge in the field, the significance                of the Lewis and Clark Expedition would be greatly diminished. We                can say, without exaggeration, that when the Corps of Discovery                set out from the St. Louis area in the spring of 1804, they were                no more than a bodyguard for Meriwether Lewis' brain! It is true                that William Clark later learned from Lewis to observe and classify,                and that several of the men were caught up in the enthusiasm of                new discoveries as the journey wore on. But it was Lewis alone of                the expedition members who stood closest to being a man of science,                both during and after the expedition. If Lewis had fallen to his                death from the cliff near modern St. Albans, Missouri on May 23,                1804, the expedition would have been a failure, for one of its two                stated goals - scientific exploration - could not have been met.                               Where and when did Meriwether Lewis come                to possess the knowledge he needed to pull off such a feat? Some                of it came from past experience, and some from long association                with Thomas Jefferson, one of the great minds of the 18th century.                The rest came from crash courses he received just prior to his departure                for the West.                On February 27, 1803, President Jefferson                confided in a letter to Benjamin Smith Barton, a physician and naturalist                at the University of Pennsylvania, why he chose Lewis to head the                expedition, saying that It was impossible to find a character who                to a compleat science in botany, natural history, mineralogy & astronomy,                joined the firmness of constitution & character, prudence, habits                adopted to the woods, & a familiarity with the Indian manners &                character, requisite for this undertaking. . . . Altho' no regular                botanist he possesses a remarkable store of accurate observation                on all the subjects of the three kingdoms, & will therefore readily                single out whatever presents itself new to him in either.                Jefferson ended his letter by asking Barton                to train Lewis, and continued: ""I make no apology for this trouble,                because I know that the same wish to promote science which has induced                me to bring forward this proposition, will induce you to aid in                promoting it."" Jefferson wrote similar letters to the other prominent                American scientists of the day: Andrew Ellicott, Robert Patterson,                Caspar Wistar and Dr. Benjamin Rush. The deaths of Benjamin Franklin                and David Rittenhouse in the 1790s left these five men, along with                Jefferson, as the leaders of the American Philosophical Society                in Philadelphia, the primary scientific society in America at that                time.                With only the precedent of the voyages of                Britain's Captain James Cook, Lewis was instructed to compile scientific                data on every aspect of the terrain through which he would pass.                On April 19, 1803 Meriwether Lewis arrived in Lancaster, Pennsylvania                to learn to plot latitude and longitude from astronomer Andrew Ellicott.                Ellicott, a former Surveyor-General of the United States, had been                corresponding with Jefferson for some time about the projected expedition                to the Pacific, making recommendations about what surveying equipment                should be taken. He trained Lewis, regulated the expedition's chronometer                and oversaw the construction of a sextant and portable horizon.                He also developed a new type of artificial horizon for the sextant                especially for Lewis.                Lewis                next traveled to Philadelphia for further instruction in medicine                and the natural sciences, including comparative anatomy. Lewis met                with Dr. Benjamin Rush to learn about medicine. Dr. Rush was the                most eminent American physician of his day. A leading patriot during                the Revolution, Rush was a signer of the Declaration of Independence.                Rush not only gave Lewis a crash course in medicine, but also instructed                him about American Indian history. Rush was apparently impressed                with Lewis; he wrote Jefferson that ""Mr. Lewis appears eminently                qualified for it [his mission]."" It is not known why a physician                was not taken on the expedition. It might have been due to Jefferson's                prejudice against doctors, or perhaps because he felt Lewis qualified,                with instruction, to perform the necessary tasks. Lewis' mother,                Lucy Marks, was a well-known herb doctor in Virginia, and she had                taught her son much about her trade.                Lewis next went to study with Dr. Benjamin                Smith Barton, who also lived in Philadelphia. Barton, a professor                of botany at the University of Pennsylvania, instructed Lewis in                botany and zoology. Barton was the first professor of natural sciences                in the United States and wrote the first U.S. textbook on botany.                Dr. Barton was not in good health in 1803, although he suggested                to Lewis that he might be interested in going along with him at                least as far as the Illinois country. After the expedition Barton                volunteered to edit the scientific portions of the journals for                publication, but died before he could do so. It is not known whether                it was Barton or Jefferson who taught Lewis how to prepare and label                plant and animal specimens; either was capable of doing so. Lewis                took 10 or 12 natural science reference books with him all the way                to the Pacific Ocean and back, including Barton's botany textbook.                               Dr. Caspar Wistar rounded out Lewis' instruction                in the natural sciences. A native of Philadelphia, and like Rush                and Barton schooled in Edinburgh, Scotland, Wistar returned to the                United States to become one of its most eminent scientists. After                teaching chemistry and physiology at the College of Pennsylvania                for many years, he was given the chair of anatomy at the University                of Pennsylvania's medical school. His lectures were so interesting                that students reportedly flocked to see them whether they were pre-med                or not. Wistar published the first U.S. book on anatomy, and was                honored by the English-born botanist Thomas Nuttall, who named the                vine ""Wisteria"" after him. Wistar was a specialist at ""comparative                anatomy,"" and talked with Lewis about living animals, fossil animals,                and the possibilities of megalonyx (Jefferson's ground sloth, discovered                as a fossil) or mammoths still living to the west of the Mississippi.                Wistar drew up a list of questions for Lewis to answer as he passed                through the West involving the natural history of each region. Unfortunately,                this original list has never been found.                In addition to all of these activities,                Lewis most certainly visited the famous museum of Charles Willson                Peale, then located on the second floor of Independence Hall. The                museum included paintings of the bird and animal species of North                America. Many fine specimens of everything from preserved bird species,                toads and snakes, to a full fossil skeleton of a mammoth were on                display, not to mention a unique collection of Indian artifacts                from far and wide. Lewis could absorb much useful information in                this museum.                Lewis left Philadelphia on June 1 and traveled                to Washington, D.C. to meet with President Jefferson and make final                arrangements for his journey to the Pacific. These included writing                a long letter on June 19 to an old friend, William Clark, asking                him to recruit men in his area for the expedition and whether or                not he would like to join as co-leader.                Lewis left Washington on July 5, 1803, for                Harpers Ferry, where he picked up the over 3,500 pounds of supplies                and equipment he had amassed to take overland to the Pittsburgh                area. At Elizabeth, Pennsylvania, Lewis was held up for over a month                waiting for his 55-foot keelboat to be built. On August 31 the keelboat                was finally completed and Meriwether Lewis began his journey down                the Ohio. The water on the Ohio River was low, causing long portages                at various points and delays that must have been vexing to Lewis.                               Lewis began to record scientific observations                immediately, and long before venturing into uncharted country the                work of science and the investigation of the physical world was                started.  Lewis                reached Cincinnati, Ohio on September 28, 1803, where he talked                with Dr. William Goforth, a local physician who was excavating the                fossil remains of a mastodon at the Big Bone Lick in Kentucky. Lewis                traveled to Big Bone Lick himself, spending five days there and                sending a box of specimens back to President Jefferson, along with                an extremely detailed letter describing the finds of Goforth. The                letter weighed the pros and cons of whether the tusks found by Goforth                belonged to a mammoth or to another animal. The letter demonstrated                how well Lewis had learned the scant knowledge of the period regarding                fossil remains, and reveals a personal interest in the subject.                               On October 14, 1803, the keelboat arrived                in Clarksville, Indiana, where Lewis joined William Clark, his slave                York, and the so-called ""nine young men from Kentucky"" who formed                the backbone of the expedition's crew. The expedition got under                way once more on October 27, moving down the Ohio to Fort Massac,                Illinois, by November 11. Today this is  a                wonderful replica of the American fort as it looked when Lewis and                Clark visited in 1803. Lewis hired interpreter George Droulliard                and gained volunteers from the U.S. military at the fort, then moved                on to the vicinity of modern Cairo, Illinois. Here Lewis and Clark                worked on their first joint scientific research and description;                to study the geography of the confluence of the Mississippi and                Ohio rivers. Lewis and Clark measured and compared the speed of                the currents and the volume of the rivers, mapping the region and                noting its geology. They ended their surveys at Cairo on November                19, and proceeded up the Mississippi River, now working against                the current. On the 25th Lewis and Clark stopped to describe and                climb Tower Rock below Kaskaskia, Illinois, noting the type of rock                it was composed of, its height, and drawing maps showing its location.               During the winter in the St. Louis area,                Lewis and Clark were busy with training their crew, obtaining supplies                and finding out all they could about the territory ahead. But the                work of scientific inquiry continued, even in the heart of St. Louis,                as Lewis sat in the garden of Pierre Chouteau on March 26, 1804.                In the stone-walled enclosure, Chouteau had a specimen of the Osage                Orange tree growing. The tree's natural range then extended only                to about 300 miles to the West of St. Louis. Chouteau allowed Lewis                to take cuttings to send back to Jefferson. This is a good example                of Lewis' restless and far-ranging mind - even in the midst of a                domestic garden, he noticed an unusual tree and described it for                science. This was chronologically the very first of the over 300                plants and animals described by Lewis and Clark over the subsequent                2½ years.                As the Expedition left St. Louis, Lewis sent                back a description of the Osage orange along with specimens of local                minerals (salt, silver and lead), the fossils from Big Bone Lick,                the contents of a buffalo's stomach and a specimen of the Plains                horned toad collected by Charles Gratiot in western Missouri. Prior                to leaving St. Louis, the scientific Lewis and Clark Expedition                had already begun. As the expedition began to move up the Missouri,                it is interesting to note that Lewis focussed on the details - the                animals, the type of rocks, the trees and grasses - along the route.                How fast was the current? How high were the cliffs? Was that bird                different from one known in the East? On the other hand, it was                the sergeants and privates, in their journals, who chronicled some                of the beauties of the river, its moods, and the caving in of its                banks, giving us an overall impression of what the voyage up the                river was like in 1804.                Lewis                went on to describe some of the animals of the voyage, making notes                and polishing his observation skills on the plains gray wolf and                eastern wood rat - the first animal new to science encountered on                the voyage - In what is today Osage County, Missouri. By this time                the tone had been set and the tasks defined for this incredible                scientific mission. For, more than a mere stunt to see if the continent                could be crossed and conquered, more than a diplomatic mission to                Indian peoples, more than an instance of ""manifest destiny,"" the                Lewis and Clark Expedition was a scientific foray. Like Diderot                with his Encyclopedia, Jefferson charged Lewis with chronicling                ""the animals of the country generally, & especially those not known                in the U.S. the remains and accounts of any which may [be] deemed                rare or extinct . . . [observe] the face of the country, it's growth                and vegetable productions; especially those not of the U.S. . .                ."" He was told to make these observations ""with great pains & accuracy,                to be entered distinctly & intelligibly for others as well as yourself.""                It is this aspect of the expedition, fulfilled in every sense of                its injunction, which sets the Lewis and Clark Expedition apart                and plays a major role in its resonance 200 years later."
GX030-88-15296047	LITTLE BIGHORN BATTLEFIELD   National Monument                                      Reno Besieged      Captain Benteen's march had revealed no sign of Indians, and at length he had turned back to the trail made by Custer and Reno, reaching it just in advance of Captain McDougall and the slow-moving packtrain. Here Sergeant Kanipe galloped up with the message from Custer to hasten forward with the packs. Benteen sent him to McDougall. A little later Trumpeter Martini, his horse bleeding from a bullet wound, arrived with the penciled order from Cooke to bring the packs and be quick. The column pushed rapidly down Reno Creek, approaching the Little Bighorn in time to witness the last of Reno's men retreating from the valley. Some of the Crow scouts, whom Custer had released a short time before, directed Benteen to the bluffs on his right, where the remnant of Reno's battalion had gathered. A brief gallop united Benteen's troops with Reno's broken command on top of the bluffs. A short time later the packtrain and its escort labored into the defense lines that Benteen had swiftly formed.    The troops gathered on Reno Hill heard heavy and continuous firing from downstream. Two distinct volleys echoed over the hills. Certain that Custer was engaged, Capt. Thomas B. Weir urged Reno to ride to his support. The major refused, and without authority Weir went by himself, his company following under Lieutenant Edgerly. Later, the rest of the command strung out on Weir's trail. Topping the high pinnacle now known as Weir Point, Weir saw the Custer battlefield 3 miles in the distance, but smoke and dust obscured all details of the activity taking place there. Hundreds of warriors ascending the north slope of Weir Point halted the advance. After a brief skirmish, the soldiers fell back to Reno Hill. Mounting numbers of Sioux pressed from behind, swiftly surrounded the 350 or more troopers and packers, and at once brought them under a deadly fire that did not subside until twilight, 3 hours later.    Nightfall interrupted the siege, and most of the Indians returned to the village for a great war dance illuminated by leaping bonfires. On Reno Hill, the men spent the night digging shallow rifle pits and improvising breastworks from packs and dead animals. The defenses occupied a perimeter enclosing a shallow depression, in which Dr. H. R. Porter, a civilian under army contract, placed his hospital. Major Reno held the north rim with most of the companies. Benteen occupied the south side, an elliptical ridge, with H Company. On the west, the bluffs dropped steeply to the Little Bighorn. On the east a gradual slope fell away to Reno Creek.    With the first hint of dawn, a single rifle shot signaled the resumption of the siege. From all sides the Indians poured a constant stream of arrows and bullets into the defense perimeter. The soldiers responded whenever a target offered itself, but the warriors were adept at drawing fire without getting hit.    Throughout the hot morning the fight continued without letup. The Indians worked themselves ever closer around the lines, taking advantage of the irregular terrain and clumps of sagebrush to avoid exposure. At times they threatened to mass for an attack, especially on Benteen's exposed and thinly held position. The captain strode about in full view, refusing to take cover and disdaining the deadly fire directed at him. On one occasion he roused his men to their feet and led them in a charge that broke up a cluster of warriors preparing for an assault. On another he went to Reno and demanded a general counterattack. Led by the major, the troopers rose from their pits and surged forward to drive back the encircling Sioux and Cheyennes.    Thirst tormented the defenders, especially the wounded in Dr. Porter's hospital. The surgeon served notice that his charges must have water at any hazard. Four sharpshooters stood up to distract the enemy and provide covering fire while a volunteer party slipped down a ravine to the river, filled canteens and camp kettles, and hastened back to the hill. They got little water, but it was enough to afford some relief to the wounded. For this feat, 19 men later received the Congressional Medal of Honor.    Early in the afternoon the siege relaxed, and by late afternoon only an occasional shot reminded the defenders to stay under cover. In the valley, the Indians fired the dry prairie grass. A wall of thick smoke screened the village from view. About 7 p.m. an immense procession of horsemen, women and children on foot, travois, ponies, and dogs emerged from behind the smoke. Slowly it wound up the slope on the west side of the valley and made its way across the benchland to the southwest, toward the peaks of the Bighorn Mountains. Below, the valley appeared deserted save for scattered debris of the great Indian camp.

Chaco is remarkable          for its monumental public and ceremonial buildings and its distinctive          architecture. The Chacoan people combined pre-planned architectural designs,          astronomical alignments, geometry, landscaping, and engineering to create          an ancient urban center of spectacular public architecture. Chaco was          connected to over 150 communities throughout the region by engineered          roads and a shared vision of the world.

(Phoenix, AZ --October, 2001) -- Picacho Peak State Park will host its annual Civil War of the Southwest on March 9-10, 2002.  Visitors from around the country come to watch the re-enactments of the Civil War Battles of Val Verde and Glorieta Pass as well as the skirmish that took place at Picacho Pass.      More than 150 re-enactors from around the country will camp at Picacho Peak State  Park with authentic camping equipment.   Demonstrations of 1860's activities such as laundering, candle making, sewing, cooking and the fashions of the era will be ongoing.  The fascinating historic re-enactments, complete with soldiers in full-dress camping as they did in the 1860's is one of Arizona's most memorable historic events.       ""The boulder-strewn mountain becomes the amphitheatre for the battles below,"" says Rob Young, the manager at Picacho Peak State Park.    ""This is an experience parents should not let their children miss.  While every child studies the Civil War sometime in their schooling, there is no better way to teach it than get them right down here to meet the soldiers and see what had been happening during that era.  Understanding what life was really like as they watch them work around the camp is a much better learning experience.  These re-enactors are like having 150 history teachers tutoring your children.""      The entry fee is $5 per vehicle and the events start at 10:00 a.m. with artillery demonstrations, old time medical care demonstrations,and cavalry demonstrations.  The battles are fascinating to watch as re-enactors on both sides enthusiastically portraying the frustrations and successes on the battlefield.  Photographers are encouraged to come and capture this unique experience, either as professionals or amateurs.

This event will be a re-enactment of three different Civil War battles which were in Arizona and New Mexico. Since many people only know of the battles that were fought in the eastern states, this desert battle becomes another history lesson.    The clothing, camp lifestyle, food, and stories told by the soldiers in the southwest during the 1860s make this event even more intriguing.    More than 150 re-enactors from the Southwestern area will camp at Picacho Peak State Park and the activities will be enthusiastically portrayed by re-enactors from around the country on both days of this event.     Spectators are welcome to tour the recreated military camps which will include demonstrations such as laundering, candle making, sewing, cooking and the fashions of the era. This is a family oriented event and will have handicap access.                            |  What's       New  |  State       Parks  |  Partnerships        |  Grant       Programs  |  Off-Highway       Vehicle  |         |  Planning        |  State       Historic Preservation Office  |  Trails       Program  |  Gift       Shop  |         |  Employment        |  Comments  |  Site Map  |          Unless otherwise noted, all images on this website are copyright       Arizona State Parks."
