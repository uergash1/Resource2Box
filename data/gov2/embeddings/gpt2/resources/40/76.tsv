GX033-37-4678566	Testimony of   International Council of Cruise Lines   Before the   House Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation         October 7, 1999         Cynthia A. Colenda, President  International Council of Cruise Lines  1211 Connecticut Avenue, NW  Washington, D.C.  20036  Tel: 202-296-8463     INTRODUCTION  On behalf of the International Council of Cruise Lines (ICCL), we are pleased to appear before the Subcommittee to discuss industry progress on several areas of interest to the Subcommittee.   ICCL is a non-profit trade association that represents the interests of 17 of the largest cruise lines operating in international and domestic markets.  ICCL member cruise lines serve major ports in the United States and call on more than 300 ports around the world.  Last year, ICCL’s cruise vessel operators carried more than 5 million passengers on 95 vessels.  Our passenger vessels represent approximately 90% of the North American cruise capacity and over 50% of the worldwide passenger cruise capacity.  The ICCL membership also includes over 60 Associate Member companies a significant number of which are U.S. based companies that provide a wide variety of services and products to support the industry’s operations worldwide.  The Committee has requested that ICCL address five major issue areas in our testimony: the industry’s impact on national and state economies; the overall safety record of the industry; passenger vessel policies and practices in the environmental area; the ICCL guidelines on medical facilities that deal with the staffing, equipment, and procedures utilized onboard passenger vessels; and the ICCL policy statement regarding the reporting of onboard crime.   ECONOMIC IMPACT  The cruise industry and its nationwide network of U.S. business partners provide significant economic benefits and jobs throughout the country.  The total economic impact of the cruise lines, their passengers, and their U.S. suppliers reached $ll.6 billion in l997, according to a recently updated study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and Wharton Economic Forecasting Associates (WEFA).  These significant industry expenditures were responsible for generating over l76,000 jobs for U.S. citizens. The cruise industry has plans to build 47 new vessels over the next three years, as a result, industry expenditures are projected to reach $l8.3 billion by 2002.  These additional expenditures will provide expanded growth and business opportunities for U.S. industries and employees who provide services and support our industry operations worldwide.   Another industry study was also conducted this year by PwC that identified the state-by-state impact of cruise industry purchases.  The study concluded that the direct spending of the cruise industry and its passengers just on U.S. goods and services was $7 billion in l997 and extended to all 50 States.  Cruise industry operations depend on the vital support of many U.S. business and service sector suppliers. The top industries benefiting from the cruise industry are manufacturing; finance, insurance and real estate; and transportation, communications and utilities.  We have provided a more complete listing of cruise industry expenditures by state and by industry in the Appendices.  The cruise industry is proud of the economic partnerships we have developed with other U.S. industries across the country. While ICCL member vessels spend most of their time at sea, our member lines are responsible for stimulating business activity not only in U.S. coastal states but also in other regions of the country. Industry purchases range from California, Illinois and Texas, to Kansas, Minnesota and New York.  An example of direct cruise industry spending in ten selected States are outlined below:   Alaska      $363.3M   California     $738.9M   Illinois      $112.1M   Maryland       $66.9M   Minnesota       $43.6M   North Carolina    $134.4M   New Jersey     $153.7M   New York     $723.8M   Oregon        $99.7M   Pennsylvania     $121.6M   Texas      $123.1M   Washington     $162.9M     Of course, the most important component of this industry is our passengers.  Today, the typical cruise passenger is from middle America and comes from every state and age bracket.  The continued success of the cruise industry is in large part attributable to the fact that a cruise vacation is affordable for the average American.  The following provides a selected state listing of passengers who cruised in l998:   Alaska       4,969   California  725,581   Illinois   169,447   Maryland    74,881   Minnesota    81,892   North Carolina 106,459   New Jersey  176,812   New York  404,023   Oregon     40,818   Pennsylvania  192,689   Texas   199,068   Washington    83,682   SAFETY  The cruise industry’s highest priority is to protect the safety of our passengers and crew.  Beginning at the vessel design stage, safety is built into every aspect of a cruise ship.  Our industry’s commitment to safety is demonstrated by our excellent safety record.  In l996, the U.S. Coast Guard conducted a comprehensive cruise ship safety study which concluded that our industry was one of the safest modes of transportation available and that international safety initiatives coming into force would further improve our safety record.  As reported by this Task Force, SOLAS requirements “are now significantly more stringent than U.S. regulations.”  In fact over the past decade, an estimated 44 million passengers enjoyed a cruise vacation.  During this period, not one passenger death due to a marine incident was reported on any of our vessels operating from a U.S. port.  This enviable safety record is the direct result of the important focus that we place in this area.  Of course, our industry cannot be complacent, we are always looking for ways to improve our performance.   ICCL and its member lines actively participate in the development of new IMO safety initiatives that govern the operation of cruise vessels worldwide.  Over the past several years, IMO has adopted several new international regulations that significantly enhance passenger vessel safety.  These comprehensive IMO regulations established stringent new standards that require significant fire safety upgrades for new and existing vessels; adopt advanced crew safety training requirements; and require all vessels to implement a specified safety management system that delineates crew responsibilities and establishes mandatory codes of practice.  These internationally mandated standards – treaties adopted by the United States government – are closely monitored by both flag state and port state authorities.   To assure compliance with safety regulations, the U.S. Coast Guard exercises port state control authority over foreign flag cruise ships operating from U.S. ports.  The Coast Guard examines each cruise ship quarterly for structure and operation of onboard safety equipment and emergency procedures under the Control Verification Program to ensure compliance with the Safety of Life at Seas (SOLAS) Convention.   ICCL has a successful, formalized partnership with the Coast Guard. The partnership group meets on a regular basis both at the executive and technical levels to discuss emerging safety issues and recent passenger vessel initiatives adopted or under consideration at the IMO.  The partnership has discussed coordination of joint emergency preparedness exercises to ensure the effectiveness of response capabilities, has worked on methods to identify lessons learned from past marine casualties, and has instituted crew training policies in response to STCW. We believe that this partnership is a very productive way to exchange information on the operational impacts of proposed policies as well as identification of resources required to respond to various types of vessel emergencies.  We appreciate the guidance and leadership that the Coast Guard has provided to the industry, and we are very pleased to participate in this valuable partnership.   ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION  The cruise industry is committed to protecting the environment and to keeping our oceans clean.  Our industry has a strong environmental record and will continue to strengthen our onboard environmental programs through enhanced technologies and improved policies and practices.  Regrettably, there have been violations of environmental laws involving cruise lines in the past few years.  These incidents have served as an important wake-up call, and caused our industry to redouble its efforts to improve its environmental performance.  These incidents demonstrate, however, that the international cruise industry is strictly accountable to U.S. environmental enforcement agencies and subject to severe penalties whenever violations occur.   The importance our industry places on environmental matters is demonstrated by the recent adoption and ratification of an ICCL Policy on the Handling and Disposal of Waste Materials Onboard Cruise Vessels.  This policy strengthens the industry’s current practices and reinforces our commitment to being responsible stewards of the maritime environment.  This ICCL action enhances our policies and practices in the following major areas:  1. Design, construct and operate vessels with state-of-the-art equipment to minimize impact on the environment;  2. Develop improved technologies to exceed current requirements for protection of the environment;  3. Implement a policy goal of zero discharge of MARPOL, Annex V solid waste products by use of more comprehensive waste minimization procedures to significantly reduce shipboard generated waste;  4. Expand waste reduction strategies to include reuse and recycling to the maximum extent possible so as to land ashore even smaller quantities of waste products;  5. Improve processes and procedures for collection and transfer of hazardous waste; and  6. Strengthen comprehensive programs for monitoring and auditing of onboard environmental practices and procedures in accordance with the International Safety Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (ISM Code).   The passenger vessel industry is highly regulated and operates within a comprehensive scheme of international and domestic environmental laws.  The vessel owners, the flag state, the classification societies, and port state authorities, such as the U.S. Coast Guard, each play an important role in enforcing these stringent requirements.   The environmental regulations which most significantly impact the cruise vessel industry are found in the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) Annexes I and V.  MARPOL sets strict standards for all commercial vessels, including passenger vessels, to prevent ship-generated pollution from oil, garbage, and waste.  International law further regulates water discharge, air emissions, onboard solid waste management, and recycling.  This Convention has been ratified by some 90 nations, including the United States and most other maritime nations of the world.   Another important IMO Convention that will further enhance the cruise industry’s strong record of safety and environmental protection is the International Safety Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (ISM Code).  This stringent new regulation incorporates many of the proven concepts of quality management to provide for the prevention of accidents, casualties and damage to the environment.  The ISM Code specifically requires all vessels and vessel operators to establish a comprehensive program of safety management record keeping, conduct rigorous internal safety and environmental audits, and requires external audits by experienced technical experts.   In addition, the cruise industry is also required to comply with several U.S. environmental laws when operating within U.S. waters.  These include the Clean Water Act, the Oil Pollution Act of l990, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act among others.  The U.S. Coast Guard is the lead agency for enforcement of these statutes that impose stringent requirements for oil pollution and waste discharged by vessels registered in any nation.   The cruise industry has a vested interest in protecting the beauty of the oceans where our vessels sail.  We will continue to strengthen our onboard environmental programs through enhanced technology and improved policies and practices.  MEDICAL FACILITIES  The cruise industry has taken a proactive role in addressing the provision of shipboard medical care.  The industry is dedicated to providing a safe and healthy experience for both our passengers and crew.  Over four years ago, the members of ICCL began work on development of industry-wide guidelines for the facilities, staffing, equipment and procedures utilized aboard passenger vessels.  In l996, ICCL issued Medical Facilities Guidelines that represented the work of a group of experienced medical physicians and other medical experts knowledgeable about the unique needs and limitations of shipboard medical care.  During this effort, ICCL worked in conjunction with the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP), the national association representing over 20,000 practicing emergency and other physicians in the U.S. and abroad.  ACEP’s Section of Cruise Ship and Maritime Medicine is specifically dedicated to training, education and research in the advancement of shipboard medical care.  The ICCL Medical Facilities Guidelines are generally intended to foster the following goals:  ? To provide reasonable emergency medical care for passengers and crew aboard cruise vessels.  ? To stabilize patients and/or initiate reasonable diagnostic and therapeutic intervention.  ? To facilitate the evacuation of seriously ill or injured patients when deemed necessary by a shipboard physician.  Both ICCL and the cruise industry have continued their interest in promoting appropriate shipboard medical facilities.  Each year, ICCL medical facilities experts meet with the ACEP Cruise Ship Medicine Section to discuss new developments, as well as to update both organization’s published guidelines in this area.   Our next annual meeting is scheduled on October l4th.      PASSENGER SECURITY   The cruise industry takes any and all cases of reported crimes onboard our ships seriously.  The safety and security of our passengers and crew is our highest priority. With more than five million passengers cruising each year, the industry takes every precaution to ensure that our passengers are safe and that they have a fun and enjoyable vacation experience.  In fact, we have the highest customer satisfaction rating of any vacation option.   A cruise ship is inherently secure because it is a controlled environment with limited access.  Every person onboard a cruise ship, from the captain to the cleaning staff and all guests, are placed on an official manifest.  Passengers and crew may embark or disembark only after passing through security.  Once the ship is underway, access is strictly limited to documented employees and fare-paying passengers.  Cruise lines operate within a very strict legal framework that gives both federal and state authorities the right to investigate crimes onboard cruise ships. Unlike most instances of shoreside crime, the FBI has the authority to investigate alleged crimes in international waters when an American is involved.  Incidents of criminal conduct are extremely low in comparison to similar incidents reported ashore.  FBI and U.S. Census Bureau statistics indicate that the number of reported shoreside incidents are at least 20 times greater than the number of reported shipboard assaults.  However, our companies have not relied on these favorable statistics.  In July, ICCL executives adopted an industry-wide standard for dealing with the investigation and reporting of crimes committed onboard cruise ships.  This statement of zero tolerance for any crime committed onboard our vessels requires the reporting of all serious crimes involving U.S. citizens to the FBI for further investigation.  Cruising is one of the most popular vacation options, in large part, because of its excellent safety record and the high level of quality service provided onboard our ships.  The cruise industry is committed to providing a secure environment for its passengers and crew.  We will continue to work with all appropriate federal and state agencies to ensure the safety and well being of all passengers and crew onboard our vessels.  ICCL and its member lines have taken proactive steps to address significant industry issues through the development of industry-wide policies.  We maintain our commitment to operate in a responsible manner and intend to demonstrate this commitment through the continued development of new industry policies and guidelines.  As national and international issues arise, our industry has been and will continue to be aggressive in addressing them.  Thank you Mr. Chairman
GX250-00-3624264	"﻿                                                                                                                                                                                            National Alert                 A Warning About Continuing Patterns of Metallic Mercury        Exposure Metallic mercury is a hazardous chemical that can        cause serious health problems. Children (especially very young children)        and fetuses are most vulnerable. The Agency for Toxic Substances and        Disease Registry (ATSDR), part of the U.S. Public Health Service, and the         Environmental        Protection Agency (EPA)  are jointly issuing an alert to the general        public. There is a continuing pattern of metallic mercury exposure in        children and teenagers and in persons using certain folk medicines or        participating in certain ethnic or religious practices. It is        important for the general public to understand that either short-term or        long-term exposures to metallic mercury can lead to serious health        problems. Human exposure to metallic mercury occurs primarily from        breathing contaminated air. Other forms of mercury can be absorbed by        drinking contaminated water, eating food (usually fish containing        mercury), and from skin contact. At high levels, metallic mercury can        cause effects on the nervous system and the developing fetus. Other forms        of mercury can damage other organs. Even at low levels, metallic mercury        can cause health problems.  Metallic mercury exposure can cause harm        before symptoms arise.  Once released into the environment, mercury is        very hard to clear up. If it is left unattended where exposures can occur,        it can have dangerous effects on human health.         Incidents involving schoolchildren In recent years, increasing        numbers of metallic mercury spills and contamination involving        schoolchildren have been reported:  In August 1994, more than 500        students in Belle Glade, Florida, were contaminated with metallic mercury        after three children found 4 jars (totalling 55 pounds) of        metallic-mercury in an abandoned van. The local hazardous waste materials        team decontaminated the children (removed contaminated clothing and washed        the metallic mercury from their skin). More than 20 families had to be        evacuated while their homes were decontaminated.  In November 1994,        college students at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida,        removed metallic mercury from one of the school's laboratories. Students        living in the dormitory were evacuated and housed in a local hotel while        the dormitory was decontaminated.  In June 1996, metallic mercury        was taken from a middle school in St. Joseph, Missouri, and used in and        outside of school by a group of teenagers. Approximately 200 children were        tested for mercury exposure; one child was hospitalized and another five        underwent outpatient treatment to remove the mercury from their systems;        20 other children had mildly elevated mercury levels. Two homes and a car        required extensive decontamination.  In October 1996, a high school        in Oskaloosa, Kansas and a convalescent home in Johnson County, Kansas,        were contaminated with metallic mercury; 52 students and an unknown number        of residents of the home were tested. On the basis of ATSDR        recommendations, the school was closed for a week until indoor air levels        were safe. A month later, sampling at the school identified an increase in        air mercury concentrations. The school was re-evaluated and additional        clean-up was done as recommended by ATSDR.  In November 1996, ATSDR        again assisted state health officials and EPA in evaluating contamination        at a high school and a home in Dallas, Pennsylvania, near Wilkes-Barre.        Four areas in the school had levels of metallic mercury contamination that        required cleanup.  In March 1997, a middle school student on his        way to school found metallic mercury on the street in front of his home in        Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. The student took the metallic mercury to        school and shared it with three to four classmates. Also, in March 1997 a        broken mercury thermometer was discovered after school on the floor of a        bathroom stall in the boys bathroom. One thermometer was confirmed missing        from the science department's inventory. The school was found to be clear        of contamination with the exception of one science laboratory and the        carpet in a classroom. Two homes required decontamination.         Schoolteachers, particularly science teachers, and        administrators need to be aware of students' interest in mercury,        especially metallic mercury, and take steps to ensure that children are        aware of its dangers and that any mercury kept in school is safely and        securely contained.          Incidents involving religious practices Persons who use metallic        mercury in ethnic folk medicine and for religious practices are at risk.        Metallic mercury is sold under the name  ""azogue""  in stores        (sometimes called botanicas), which specialize in religious items used in        Esperitismo (a spiritual belief system native to Puerto Rico), Santeria (a        Cuban-based religion that venerates both African deities and Catholic        saints), and voodoo.  The use of azogue in religious practices is        recommended in some Hispanic communities by family members, spiritualists,        card readers, and santeros. Typically, azogue is carried on one's person        in a sealed pouch prepared by a spiritual leader or sprinkled in the home        or automobile. Some botanica owners suggest mixing it in bath water or        perfume and placing it in devotional candles.         General facts The following are general facts about metallic        mercury and its risks, as well as information about how people can protect        themselves from exposure and resulting health effects.         What is mercury and how is it used? Mercury occurs naturally in        the environment in several forms. Metallic Mercury is the liquid form used        in thermometers. Mercury is also used in other common consumer products        such as fluorescent light bulbs, barometers, medical equipment such as        blood pressure measurement instruments, and mercury switches in children's        sneakers that light up. This alert concentrates on metallic mercury, but        hazards are also associated with other types. Of these, the most common is        methyl mercury contamination of fish.         How could I be exposed to mercury? In the previously described        school-associated cases, children were unaware of the dangers involved in        exposing themselves and their families to this deadly poison. Adults are        also often unaware of the hazards associated with mercury; some have even        brought it home from work for children to play with. Just one-half        teaspoon of mercury spilled in the home can be dangerous.  Adults        using certain folk medicines or participating in certain religious or        ethnic practices may also expose themselves and their families to metallic        mercury's effects. Because metallic mercury vaporizes into the air at room        temperatures, it presents an immediate health risk to anyone spending a        significant amount of time in a room where metallic mercury is sprinkled        or spilled onto the floor, or where opened containers of metallic mercury        are present. Very small amounts of metallic mercury (for example, a few        drops) can raise air concentrations to levels that may be harmful to        health.         How does mercury affect health? At high levels, metallic mercury        can cause effects on the nervous system and the developing fetus. Other        forms of mercury can damage other organs. Even at low levels, metallic        mercury can cause health problems. Mercury exposure can begin to cause        harm before symptoms arise. Once symptoms do arise, health problems        related to metallic mercury poisoning can include tremors, changes in        vision or hearing, insomnia, weakness, difficulty with memory, headache,        irritability, shyness and nervousness, and a health condition called        acrodynia.  Pregnant women and their fetuses are especially        vulnerable to the toxic effects of metallic mercury because it readily        passes from the placenta to the fetus. Mercury may accumulate in higher        concentrations in the unborn baby than in the mother. Young children, who        often play on the floor where metallic mercury may have been spilled, are        particularly at risk for effects on the central nervous system. Mercury        vapors are readily absorbed into the bloodstream from the lungs, and the        human central nervous system, which is still developing during the first        few years of life, may become damaged.  Health effects can result        from short-term or long-term exposure. The body gets rid of mercury        through the urine and feces. Removal of this substance from the body can        take up to several months after exposure. Acrodynia is characterized by        itching, swelling, and flushing; pink-colored palms and soles of the feet;        excessive perspiration; rashes; irritability; fretfulness; sleeplessness;        joint pains and weakness. Children exposed to metallic mercury for long        periods may have trouble learning in school. When mercury levels in the        body are extremely high, ""chelation"" therapy is necessary. Chelation        therapy involves putting a chemical into the bloodstream; the chemical        combines with the mercury to aid in its removal from the body.         Prevention is the key to avoiding poisoning in homes,        schools, and families.          What is mercury contamination and how can I prevent it? First,        avoid using metallic mercury. Appropriate substitutes are available for        nearly all uses of metallic mercury. Therefore, be sure you need to use        it. If not, make arrangements to safely dispose of whatever metallic        mercury you might have. If you do need to use metallic mercury, make sure        it is safely stored in a leakproof container. Keep it in a secure space        (e.g., a locking closet) so that others cannot easily get it. Use of        metallic mercury in a controlled environment helps to reduce the risk that        contamination will occur.  Mercury contamination results from        exposure through the air, water, food, soil, or direct contact. Exposure        to metallic mercury occurs when it is not stored in a closed container.        Contamination may include the spilling of metallic mercury on clothes,        furniture, carpet, floors, walls, the natural environment, and even the        human body. Metallic mercury and its vapors are extremely difficult to        remove from such items as clothes, furniture, carpet, floors, and walls.        The vapors will also accumulate in walls and other structures in        contaminated rooms. The contamination can remain for months or years,        posing a risk to exposed individuals. The use of metallic mercury in a        home or apartment not only poses a threat to persons currently residing in        that structure, but also to those who subsequently occupy that dwelling        and are unaware of the past mercury use.         Can I clean up mercury with a vacuum cleaner? Never use a vacuum        cleaner. Using a vacuum cleaner causes metallic mercury to vaporize in the        air, creating greater health risks. It also ruins the vacuum cleaner.         Can electronic equipment collect mercury vapors? Metallic mercury        vapors can accumulate in electronic equipment, especially computers. When        the computer is turned on, the mercury revaporizes. This cycle of metallic        mercury collecting and vaporizing from computers has been seen in several        incidents in schools.         What should I do to keep my home safe? Metallic mercury is used in        a variety of household and industrial items including thermostats,        fluorescent light bulbs, barometers, glass thermometers, and some blood        pressure machines. Care must be taken in handling and disposing of all        items in the home that contain metallic mercury.  First,  do        NOT  try to vacuum or heat the metallic mercury in any way. Mercury        vapors are very dangerous and are virtually undetectable. Avoid breathing        mercury dust, vapor, mist, or gas. Avoid contact with eyes, skin, and        clothing. If you feel you have been exposed directly to metallic mercury,        wash thoroughly after handling. Remove contaminated clothing and wash        before reuse. Provide as much clean air as possible.  For example,        if a thermometer breaks, remove children from the area. Clean up the bead        of metallic mercury by carefully rolling it onto a sheet of paper or        sucking it up with an eye dropper. After picking up the metallic mercury,        put it into a bag or airtight container. The paper or eye dropper should        also be bagged and disposed of properly according to guidance provided by        environmental officials or your local health department. Try to ventilate        the room to the outside and close off from the rest of the home. Use fans        for a minimum of one hour to speed the ventilation. If larger amounts of        metallic mercury are found (for example, a jar), make sure that the        metallic mercury is in an airtight container and call your local health        department for instructions in how to safely dispose of it. If the larger        amount is spilled, leave the area and contact your local health department        and fire authorities.  Do not simply throw it away, but instead seek        professional guidance.

How and where to review written information and comments: The record for this notice has been established under docket number W-00-17 (Cruise Ships), and includes supporting documentation as well as printed versions of electronic correspondence. The record is available for inspection from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding legal holidays, at the Water Docket, EB 57, USEPA Headquarters, 401 M. St., SW., Washington, DC. For access to docket materials, please call 202-260-3027.     Background: On March 17, 2000, EPA received a petition asking that EPA undertake an ``assessment of the volumes and characteristics of the spectrum of waste streams from cruise ships, analysis of their potential impact on water quality, the marine environment, and human health.'' In response to that petition, we are assessing whether discharges from cruise ships currently pose a risk to the environment. EPA is working with the Coast Guard and other Federal agencies on this assessment.     The discharges of particular interest from cruise ships are gray water (wastewater from baths, sinks and galleys), black water (wastewater from toilets), oily bilge water, solid waste (e.g., food waste, paper, cardboard, plastic, wood, metal, glass) and wastes from equipment operations, hotel and restaurant services, photo labs, dry- cleaning, and paints.     Specific information that we are requesting for wastewater, solid waste, and hazardous materials includes:     (1) Quantities and properties;     (2) Methods of discharge or disposal;     (3) Locations of discharge or disposal, such as outside of State waters, 10 miles from port, or in-port waste receptacles;     (4) Environmental impacts; and     (5) Existing regulatory or voluntary controls.     As we consider the range of environmental issues concerning these cruise ship discharges, we are also interested in learning about voluntary environmental management programs and standards used by various cruise ships. We are interested in hearing about new and alternative approaches being proposed or used by the cruise ship industry or by public-private partnerships. These approaches may include: environmental management systems based on ISO 14000 and/or the International Safety Management (ISM) System Code; environmental certification programs developed by Ship Classification Societies; and local or regional Memoranda of Understanding or other agreements between the industry, government, and other stakeholders. We are interested in a comprehensive picture of how various pollution prevention programs are currently being used and how these efforts might be advanced to protect the marine environment. In addition, we are soliciting comments on whether we should consider changes to existing controls or regulations or add new regulations for control of these discharges in order to more adequately protect the environment from the effects of these discharges.     We are not attempting to collect information or comment on air emissions from cruise ships, or on possible impacts of cruise ships other than from their waste management or discharge practices, at these public information hearings.

ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  SUMMARY: The Coast Guard proposes regulations regarding sewage and graywater discharges from certain cruise vessels transiting applicable waters of Alaska. Operators of cruise vessels carrying 500 or more passengers and transiting applicable waters of Alaska are restricted in where they may discharge effluents and would be required to perform testing of sewage and graywater discharges and maintain records of such discharges. The Coast Guard would inspect, monitor, and oversee this process to ensure compliance with applicable water quality laws and regulations.  DATES: Comments and related material must reach the Coast Guard on or before May 25, 2001.  ADDRESSES: You may mail comments and related material to the Commander Seventeenth Coast Guard District (m), P.O. Box 25517, Juneau, AK, 99802-5517, or deliver them to room 751 of the Federal Building in Juneau, AK between 9:30 a.m. and 2 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The telephone number is 907-463-2802. You must also mail comments on collection of information to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, 725 17th Street NW., Washington, DC 20503, ATTN: Desk Officer, U.S. Coast Guard.     The Coast Guard Seventeenth District (m) Secretary maintains the public docket for this rulemaking. Comments and material received from the public, as well as documents indicated in this preamble as being available in the docket, will become part of this docket and will be available for inspection or copying at room 751, U.S. Coast Guard Seventeenth District (m), between 9:30 a.m. and 2 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: LCDR Spencer Wood, Seventeenth District (moc), 907-463-2809.  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Request for Comments      We encourage you to participate in this rulemaking by submitting comments and related material. If you do so, please include your name and address, identify the docket number for this rulemaking (CGD17-01- 003), indicate the specific section of this document to which each comment applies, and give the reason for each comment. Please submit two copies of all comments and related material in an unbound format, no larger than 8\1/2\ by 11 inches, suitable for copying. If you would like to know they reached us, please enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope. We will consider all comments and material received during the comment period. We may change this proposed rule in view of them.     We are using 30-day comment period for this rulemaking. Due to the localized interest in this proposed regulation, we feel that this comment period will allow all interested parties enough time to file comments with the Coast Guard. Additionally, because the Alaska cruise season is seasonal, a shorter comment period is needed in order to allow for publication of a Final Rule before the 2001 season ends in mid-September.  [[Page 20771]]  Public Meeting      We do not now plan to hold a public meeting. But you may submit a request for one to the docket at the address under ADDRESSES explaining why one would be beneficial. If we determine that one would aid this rulemaking, we will hold one at a time and place announced by a later notice in the Federal Register.  Background and Purpose      Congress passed ``Title XIV--Certain Alaskan Cruise Ship Operations'' of the Miscellaneous Appropriations Bill (H.R. 5666) on December 21, 2000 in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001 (P.L. 106-554) [``Title XIV''] in response to public concern with environmental impacts of cruise vessels on Alaska waters. This legislation was drafted in the wake of past incidents of illegal wastewater discharges, the discovery of high levels of fecal coliform in legal discharges of treated sewage and graywater, the projected growth of the industry, and the trend within the industry towards larger vessels that carry over 5000 people. In December of 1999, a task force comprised of representatives from the federal government, State government, the cruise industry, and environmental groups was established to develop voluntary procedures for sampling and analyzing wastes generated by cruise vessels while operating in Alaska's waters during the 2000 cruise vessel season.     During the summer 2000 cruise season, the relevant segment of the cruise industry voluntarily agreed not to discharge treated sewage or graywater while in port, not to discharge garbage or untreated sewage in Southeast Alaska's ``Donut Holes'' (bodies of water greater than three miles from any shoreline yet within Alaska's inside passage), and not to discharge treated sewage or graywater, unless more than 10 miles from port and proceeding at a speed of not less than 6 knots.     Additionally, a voluntary sampling and testing protocol and Quality Assurance/Quality Control Plan (QA/QPC) for treated sewage and graywater were developed. The protocol and QA/QPC were applied to 21 cruise vessels calling on Alaska ports during the 2000 season.     The test results revealed that the majority of the vessels' discharges, both treated sewage and graywater, exceeded marine sanitation device (MSD) design standards for water quality of 200 fecal coliform per 100 milliliters and 150 milligrams per liter total suspended solids (TSS). The high levels of fecal coliform and TSS found in treated sewage indicate that the MSDs used by cruise vessels may not be operating properly or functioning as designed. The Coast Guard boarded 15 vessels as a result of high fecal coliform and TSS levels. Five vessels were found to have evidence of improperly functioning MSDs. The source of the high fecal coliform and TSS found in graywater has yet to be positively determined.     Concurrent with this voluntary sampling process, Congress was drafting legislation that addressed sewage and graywater discharges in Alaska's waters and sought to close the ``Donut Holes'' located in Southeast Alaska's Inside Passage to untreated sewage discharge. This legislation was enacted into law on December 21, 2000, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001 in the form of Title XIV.     These proposed regulations are in response to Title XIV statutory mandate to draft implementing regulations. Section 1406 of Title XIV directs the Secretary to incorporate into the commercial vessel examination program an inspection regime sufficient to verify that operators of cruise vessels carrying 500 or more passengers and visiting ports in the State of Alaska or operating in the applicable waters of Alaska are in full compliance with the environmental record keeping and equipment requirements of Title XIV, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, and any regulations issued there under, other applicable Federal laws and regulations, and all applicable international treaty requirements. The applicable waters of Alaska are defined as the waters of the Alexander Archipelago, the navigable waters of the United States within the State of Alaska, and the Kachemak Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve.  Discussion of Proposed Rule      This rule would establish a regime for documentation and testing of treated sewage and graywater effluent as prescribed by Title XIV. The rule would apply to cruise vessels that carry at least 500 passengers, and operate in the navigable waters of the United States within the State of Alaska. This area extends out three nautical miles from the shore along any portion of land that is included within the jurisdiction of the State of Alaska. The rule also would apply to the same class of cruise vessels that operate in the Alexander Archipelago and the Kachemak Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve. The area designated as ``The Alexander Archipelago'' is defined in this proposed rule at Sec. 159.305. The definition closes areas of the Archipelago that would otherwise be open to dumping of untreated sewage. The rule would not affect normal transit through the designated areas. The rule would not apply in an emergency situation that threatens the safety of the vessel or its passengers.     Under this rule cruise vessels would maintain a Sewage and Graywater Discharge Record Book while operating in the applicable waters of Alaska. The content of the record book is designed to enable appropriate Coast Guard oversight of sewage and graywater handling practices and ensure compliance with Title XIV. The prescribed format is intended to facilitate both the entry of data, as well as the review of data by the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard is interested in input from the cruise industry and interested members of the public on any additional information that should be included in the Sewage and Graywater Discharge Record Book to enhance data collection and interpretation of sample test results.     This rule would prohibit the discharge of untreated sewage within the designated areas. It also provides for sewage and graywater discharge effluent standards, and establishes an interim treated sewage standard. To discharge treated sewage and graywater while in the applicable waters of Alaska, a cruise vessel would need to be underway at a speed of at least 6 knots and be at least one nautical mile from the nearest shore. Further, the vessel's discharge would need to comply with all applicable effluent standards, including those contained within this rule. Lastly, the vessel could not be in an area where such discharge is prohibited. There are currently no areas within the applicable waters of Alaska that have been designated as an area where such discharge is prohibited.     The rule also would allow for discharges of treated sewage and graywater inside of one mile from shore and at speeds less than six knots for vessels with effluent treatment systems that can treat sewage and graywater to a much stricter standard. To employ this provision a vessel would have to provide 30 days notice of the intended discharge to the appropriate Captain of the Port (COTP). In the notice the vessel would verify that the effluents it intends to discharge meet the minimum fecal coliform and residual chlorine standards listed in 159.307(b) of this rule and the standards set forth in 40 CFR 133.102. To satisfy these standards the vessel would provide to the COTP the test results of 5 samples taken over a 30-day period that meet the requirements. Further, for a vessel to  [[Page 20772]]  use this exemption it would have to demonstrate its continued compliance with this proposed rule by sampling and testing for conventional pollutants, as defined in 40 CFR Part 401.16, periodically as determined by the COTP and in accordance with the cruise vessel's Quality Assurance/Quality Control Plan (QA/QCP).     To ensure a viable sampling regime it is necessary to conduct sampling in accordance with a thorough and well developed QA/QPC with Vessel Specific Sampling Plan (VSSP). These documents would define the vessel, sampler, and laboratory's responsibilities in the process of discharge sampling and analysis to ensure the results are timely and accurate. The vessel owner/operator, and/or subcontracted sampling team and laboratory, using the outline in the regulation as a minimum standard, may craft the plans. Sample plans may be obtained from the Seventeenth Coast Guard District (moc) office or the Coast Guard Marine Safety office in Juneau, Alaska. Under the proposed rule the Coast Guard will review and either accept or reject the plans, and determine when and from which sampling ports samples will be drawn. In accordance with the accepted plans, a third party, contracted by the cruise vessel, would conduct the sampling and deliver the samples to a laboratory for analysis.     Between 30 and 120 days prior to coming into the applicable waters of Alaska, cruise vessel owners/operators would self certify that the vessel's effluents meet the minimum standards established by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. In the absence of such standards they would certify that they meet the minimum standards described in this rule. Title XIV provides for the Administrator to establish minimum effluent standards for treated sewage and graywater, but does not mandate that they do so. In the event the Administrator does establish effluent standards, they would supersede the standards listed in this rule. If a vessel is not able to certify their effluents for treated sewage and graywater as meeting the applicable standards, operational controls would be placed on the vessel by the COTP, directing the vessel not to discharge treated sewage and graywater in the applicable waters of Alaska.     A cruise vessel can expect to be sampled a minimum of two times while operating in the applicable waters of Alaska during a calendar year: Once, within 30 days after first arriving at the start of the cruise season, and a second sometime during the remainder of the vessel's cruise season. During either of the two sampling events, additional samples may be drawn from randomly selected discharge ports for priority pollutant analysis.     The proposed rule would allow for additional sampling, at the discretion of the COTP to ensure continued compliance throughout the operating season and to follow-up on high-test sample results.     All costs associated with compliance with this proposed rule will be paid by the cruise vessels operating in the applicable waters of Alaska, except for costs of oversight and enforcement by the Coast Guard.     Tests results for the samples would be forwarded to the COTP directly by the laboratory conducting the analysis. The time schedule specified in the rule is an industry standard for laboratories qualified to complete the analysis. The laboratory will hold the samples for six months in the case of disputed results. After six months the samples become unusable for any further beneficial analysis and should be discarded.     The reports the laboratory must submit on sample test results may be in an electronic form. However, if submitted electronically, they must be in a format readable by the Coast Guard and Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation's (ADEC) data systems. Currently, the Coast Guard and ADEC use a Windows operating system.     Finally, the proposed rule sets out the penalties that might be assessed if a cruise vessel is found discharging effluent that does not meet the applicable standards.  Regulatory Evaluation      This interim rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that Order. It has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that Order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, l979). A draft Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT follows:     A Quality Assurance/Quality Control Plan (QA/QCP) with Vessel Specific Sampling Plan (VSSP) is required by these regulations to establish procedures for collecting and analyzing treated sewage and graywater samples from cruise vessels. During the summer 2000 voluntary cruise vessel sampling program a single QA/QCP, acceptable to the Coast Guard, was used by all 21 cruise vessels. A VSSP was then developed for each vessel. It is anticipated the same, or similar depending on the laboratory used, QA/QCP and VSSP will be used for subsequent summer cruise vessel seasons negating the need to develop new ones. The Coast Guard is not able to estimate the burden that may be associated with individual cruise vessel revisions to the QA/QCP and VSSP, if any.     The annual burden of creating and maintaining a Sewage and Graywater Discharge Record Book on 23 cruise vessels is expected to be $460. This estimate is for the cost of purchasing a record book and maintaining it onboard each vessel. Entries into the record book should be made during the normal routine of the engineering watch so no additional labor costs are expected.     During the summer 2000 cruise vessel voluntary sampling program, the cruise industry operating in Alaska spent an estimated $65,000 on sampling of cruise vessels while underway. An additional estimated $150,000 was spent in having the samples analyzed for conventional pollutants and the complete suite of priority pollutants listed in 40 CFR 401.15. The summer 2000 sampling program included two separate sampling events on 21 cruise vessels from all overboard treated sewage and graywater effluents and marine sanitation devices. In addition to the conventional pollutant suites, one of the two sampling events included samples drawn for a complete suite of priority pollutants analysis.     These regulations provide for a similar sampling and analysis regime with cost savings in some areas and offsetting cost increases in others. While the number of more costly priority pollutants analysis will decrease, the number of overall sampling events for conventional pollutants will likely increase. Also, the number of respondents is expected to increase from 21 to 23. Therefore, the annual burden for sampling and analysis under these regulations is estimated to be $215,000. When divided by the number of participants, the annual cost to each individual vessel is estimated to be $9,348. The estimated cost to each cruise vessel line is as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                     Cruise line                      Vessels      Cost ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Princess Cruises..................................          6    $56,088 Holland American..................................          6     56,088 Celebrity.........................................          2     18,696 Norwegian.........................................          2     18,696 Royal Caribbean...................................          2     18,696 Carnival..........................................          1      9,348 Japan.............................................          1      9,348 World Explorer....................................          1      9,348 Crystal Cruises...................................          1      9,348  [[Page 20773]]  Radisson Seven Seas...............................          1      9,348 ------------------------------------------------------------------------      The cost is based on two sampling events on each cruise vessel. One sample event would be required within 30 days of entering Alaska waters. The second sample event, although discretionary by the Coast Guard, will be taken from vessels that visit Alaskan waters at least four times a year. Additional samples and analysis may be required, along with the associated cost increase, should the initial sample results indicate noncompliance.     The Coast Guard is not able to estimate the costs that might be incurred if a cruise vessel cannot certify that their discharges meet the applicable standards, and does not have the capacity to hold all of its discharges while transiting the applicable waters of Alaska. In that scenario, it is believed that the cruise vessel would need to alter its cruise itinerary in order to leave the applicable Alaskan waters and enter the high seas, thus enabling the vessel to discharge. We would appreciate any comments that might help us accurately assess these costs.  Small Entities      Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), we have considered whether this proposed rule would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The term ``small entities'' comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000.     The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This is due to the fact that the cruise vessels that would be subject to this proposed rule will be carrying 500 or more passengers. Typically, these cruise vessels are owned by corporations that do not qualify as small entities.     If you think that your business, organization, or governmental jurisdiction qualifies as a small entity and that this rule would have a significant economic impact on it, please submit a comment (see ADDRESSES) explaining why you think it qualifies and how and to what degree this rule would economically affect it.  Assistance for Small Entities      Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-121), we want to assist small entities in understanding this proposed rule so that they can better evaluate its effects on them and participate in the rulemaking. If the rule would affect your small business, organization, or governmental jurisdiction and you have questions concerning its provisions or options for compliance, please contact LCDR Spence Wood where listed at FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.  Collection of Information      This rule provides for a collection of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). As defined in 5 CFR 1320.3(c), ``collection of information'' includes reporting, record keeping, monitoring, posting, labeling, and other, similar actions. The title and description of the collections, a description of the respondents, and an estimate of the total annual burden follow. Included in the estimate is the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing sources of data, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection.     Title: Discharge of Effluents in Certain Alaskan Waters by Cruise Vessel Operations.     Summary of the Collection of Information: The following information will be required to be collected by these regulations:  Quality Assurance/Quality Control Plan (QA/QCP) with Vessel Specific Sampling Plan (VSSP). Sewage and Graywater Discharge Record Book. Sewage and graywater sampling test results.      Need for Information: Compliance and enforcement of ``Certain Alaskan Cruise Ship Operations'' (P.L. 106-554).     Proposed Use of Information: Regulatory oversight and compliance assurance.     Description of the Respondents: Master or other person having charge of each cruise vessel authorized to carry 500 or more passengers while operating in the waters of the Alexander Archipelago and the navigable waters of the United States within the State of Alaska and within the Kachemak Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve.     Number of Respondents: 23     Frequency of Response: Periodically while operating in the waters described above.     Burden of Response: There are three separate record keeping requirements involved in this regulation. Each is addressed separately, and the estimated total burden follows:     1. Quality Assurance/Quality Control Plan (QA/QCP) with Vessel Specific Sampling Plan (VSSP) development costs. A QA/QCP with VSSP is required by these regulations to establish procedures for collecting and analyzing treated sewage and graywater samples from cruise vessels. During the summer 2000 voluntary cruise vessel sampling program, a single QA/QCP acceptable to the Coast Guard, was used by all 21 cruise vessels. A VSSP was then developed for each vessel and sampling was conducted in compliance with these documents. It is anticipated the same, or similar, QA/QCP and VSSP will be used for subsequent summer cruise vessel seasons negating the need to develop a new QA/QCP or VSSP. The Coast Guard is not able to estimate the burden that may be associated with individual cruise vessel revisions to the QA/QCP or VSSP, if any.     2. Sewage and Graywater Discharge Record Book costs. The annual burden of creating and maintaining a Sewage and Graywater Discharge Record Book on 23 cruise vessels is expected to be $460. This estimate is for the cost of purchasing a record book and maintaining it onboard each vessel. Entries into the record book should be made during the normal routine of the engineering watch so no additional labor costs are expected.     3. Sample collection and analysis costs.     a. During the summer 2000 cruise vessel voluntary sampling program, the cruise industry operating in Alaska spent an estimated $65,000 on sampling of cruise vessels while underway. An additional estimated $150,000 was spent in having the samples analyzed for conventional pollutants and the complete suite of priority pollutants listed in 40 CFR 401.15. The summer 2000 sampling program included two separate sampling events on 21 cruise vessels from all overboard treated sewage and graywater effluents and marine sanitation devices. In addition to the conventional pollutant suites, one of the two sampling events included samples drawn for a complete suite of priority pollutants analysis.     These regulations provide for a similar sampling and analysis regime with cost savings in some areas and offsetting cost increases in others. While the number of more costly priority pollutants analysis will decrease, the number of overall sampling events for conventional pollutants will likely increase. Also, the number of respondents is expected to increase  [[Page 20774]]  from 21 to 23. Therefore, the annual burden for sampling and analysis under these regulations is estimated to be $215,000. When divided by the number of participants, the annual cost to each individual vessel is estimated to be $9,348.     Estimated Total Annual Burden: The estimated total annual burden is $215,460.     As required by section 3507(d) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, the Coast Guard has submitted a copy of this rule to OMB for its review of the collection of information.     The Coast Guard solicits public comment on the collection of information to: (1) Evaluate whether the information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the Coast Guard, including whether the information will have practical utility; (2) Evaluate the accuracy of the Coast Guard's estimate of the burden of the collection, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (3) enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (4) minimize the burden of the collection on those who are to respond, as by allowing the submittal of responses by electronic means or the use of other forms of information technology.     Persons submitting comments on the collection of information should submit their comments both to OMB and to the Coast Guard where indicated under ADDRESSES by the date under DATES.     Persons are not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. Before the requirements for this collection of information become effective, the Coast Guard will publish a notice in the Federal Register of OMB's decision to approve, modify, or disapprove the collection.  Federalism      Under Executive Order 13132, section 3(b), the Coast Guard finds that a program monitoring effluent discharge from cruise ships transiting certain Alaskan waters is in the national interest, as evidenced by Congress in enacting ``Title XIV--Certain Alaskan Cruise Ship Operations'' as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001 (Public Law 106-554). In that legislation, Congress empowered the Coast Guard to monitor wastewater discharges from cruise ships transiting certain Alaskan waters.     The sampling, testing and log-keeping program outlined in this regulation was taken from a similar program that was run on a voluntary basis during the summer of 2000. That program was one of the results of the Alaska Cruise Ship Initiative, which grew out of a working group composed of representatives from the cruise industry, the public, environmental groups, and state and federal government. The Coast Guard was one of the federal government representatives on that group. The working group was begun by the Commissioner of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC) in December of 1999.     At the conclusion of the 2000 Alaskan cruise ship season, data from the voluntary wastewater sampling and testing program showed that none of the tested vessels were in full compliance with all federal performance standards for the discharge of treated sewage. This data, as well as data showing high levels of pollutants in graywater, spurred the legislation cited above. It also spurred a meeting between the Alaska governor, ADEC, the Coast Guard, and members of the cruise ship industry in November of 2000. At this meeting, the governor expressed his approval of the then-proposed Title XIV, and the greater authority it granted to the Coast Guard to protect Alaskan waters from pollutants.     This established cooperation between the Coast Guard and the State of Alaska, and the State's support of the legislation and voluntary testing program on which the regulation is based shows how the Coast Guard has consulted with State officials in accordance with Executive Order 13132, Section 3(b). The Coast Guard will continue to consult the State by sharing the results of sample tests with the State, as well as requiring that discharge logbooks be kept in a format readable by the Alaskan Department of Environmental Conservation.     Section 6(c)(2) of Executive Order 13132, requires, that if the agency promulgating the regulations intends that they have preemptive effect, it state that intention and the rationale on which it is based. Accordingly, the following statement is provided:     Section 1411 (b) P.L. 106-554 specifies that, ``[n]othing in this Title shall in any way affect or restrict, or be construed to affect or restrict, the authority of the State of Alaska or any political subdivision thereof--(1) to impose additional liability or additional requirement; * * *.'' This language, as well as the entire Title, is identical to suggested text submitted to Congress by the Department of Transportation as part of a draft Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2000. While the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2000 did not pass, the provisions of Title XIV--Certain Alaskan Cruise Ship Operations did become law in P.L. 106-554. The Department of Transportation's letter transmitting the Administration's proposed alternative, which eventually became Title XIV of P.L. 106-554, contained an explanation of Section 1411, as follows:      There are a number of provisions in the Administration's substitute language that would benefit from guidance in a conference report. In particular, we would like to draw the Conferees attention to Section 715 [1411] of the Administration's proposed alternative to Title VII of H.R. 820, as adopted by the Senate, which contains the `Savings Clause.' In its drafting efforts, the Administration modeled section 715 [which is identical to Section 1411] after Section 1018 of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), 33 U.S.C. 2718. Section 1018 of OPA was recently interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of U.S. v. Locke, 120 S. Ct. 1135 (Mar. 6, 2000). The case concerned Washington State efforts to regulate oil tankers. The Court held that OPA section 1018 does not alter the preemptive impact of the Federal regulatory regime in the areas of design, construction, alteration, repair, maintenance, operation, equipping, personnel qualification, manning and casualty reporting for vessels. It is the intent of the Administration that section 715 be interpreted in the same manner as OPA section 1918, so that future litigation on the subject of Federal preemption of vessel regulation can be avoided.  Accordingly, these interim rules are construed in the same manner described in the Department of Transportation's views letter cited above. Thus, any of these regulations, which have the effect of regulating a cruise vessel's design, construction, alteration, repair, maintenance, operation, equipping, personnel qualification, manning and casualty reporting have preemptive effect under existing U.S. laws and treaties to which the United States is a party.  Unfunded Mandates Reform Act      The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538) governs the issuance of Federal regulations that require unfunded mandates. An unfunded mandate is a regulation that requires a State, local, or tribal government or the private sector to incur direct costs without the Federal Government's having first provided the funds to pay those costs. This proposed rule would not impose an unfunded mandate.  Taking of Private Property      This proposed rule would not effect a taking of private property or otherwise have taking implications under Executive Order 12630, Governmental Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights.  [[Page 20775]]  Civil Justice Reform      This proposed rule meets applicable standards in sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform, to minimize litigation, eliminate ambiguity, and reduce burden.  Protection of Children      We have analyzed this proposed rule under Executive Order 13045, Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks. This rule is not an economically significant rule and would not create an environmental risk to health or risk to safety that might disproportionately affect children.  Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal Governments      This proposed rule will not have tribal implications; will not impose substantial direct compliance costs on Indian tribal governments; and will not preempt tribal law. Therefore, it is exempt from the consultation requirements of Executive Order 13175. If tribal implications are identified during the comment period we will undertake appropriate consultations with the affected Indian tribal officials.  Environment      We have considered the environmental impact of this proposed rule and concluded that, under figure 2-1, paragraph (34)(d), of Commandant Instruction M16475.lC, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. This proposed regulation would require operators of cruise vessels carrying 500 or more passengers in Alaskan waters to document treated sewage and graywater discharges to ensure that they comply with effluent discharge standards. The content of effluent discharges reflects compliant equipment operations. A ``Categorical Exclusion Determination'' is available in the docket where indicated under ADDRESSES.  List of Subjects      Sewage disposal, Vessels, Reporting and record keeping requirements.

Sec. 159.319  Fecal coliform and total suspended solids standards.      (a) Treated sewage effluent discharges--Until such time as the Administrator promulgates effluent discharge standards for treated sewage, treated sewage effluent discharges in the applicable waters of Alaska shall not have a fecal coliform bacterial count of greater than 200 per 100 ml nor total suspended solids greater than 150 mg/l.     (b) Graywater effluent discharges [Reserved.]  Sec. 159.321  Enforcement.      (a) Administrative penalties.     (1) Violations. Any person who violates this subpart may be assessed a class I or class II civil penalty by the Secretary or his delegatee.     (2) Classes of penalties.     (i) Class I. The amount of a class I civil penalty under this section may not exceed $10,000 per violation, except that the maximum amount of any class I civil penalty under this section shall not exceed $25,000. Before assessing a civil penalty under this subparagraph, the Secretary or his delegatee shall give to the person to be assessed such penalty written notice of the Secretary's proposal to assess the penalty and the opportunity to request, within 30 days of the date the notice is received by such person, a hearing on the proposed penalty. Such hearing shall not be subject to 5 U.S.C. 554 or 556, but shall provide a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present evidence.     (ii) Class II. The amount of a class II civil penalty under this section may not exceed $10,000 per day for each day during which the violation continues, except that the maximum amount of any class II civil penalty under this section shall not exceed $125,000. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, a class II civil penalty shall be assessed and collected in the same manner, and subject to the same provisions as in the case of civil penalties assessed and collected after notice and an opportunity for hearing on the record in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 554.     (3) Rights of interested persons.     (i) Public notice. Before issuing an order assessing a class II civil penalty under this paragraph, the Secretary shall provide public notice of and reasonable opportunity to comment on the proposed issuance of each order.     (ii) Presentation of evidence. Any person who comments on a proposed assessment of a class II civil penalty under this section shall be given notice of any hearing held under this paragraph and of the order assessing such penalty. In any hearing held under this paragraph (a)(3), such person shall have a reasonable opportunity to be heard and present evidence.     (iii) Rights of interested persons to a hearing. If no hearing is held under paragraph (a)(2) before issuance of an order assessing a class II civil penalty under this section, any person who commented on the proposed assessment may petition, within 30 days after the issuance of such an order, the Secretary or his delegatee to set aside such order and provide a hearing on the penalty. If the evidence presented by the petitioner in support of the petition is material and was not considered in the issuance of the order, the Secretary, or his delegatee, shall immediately set aside such order and provide a hearing in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section. If the Secretary or his delegatee denies a hearing under this clause, the Secretary of his delegatee shall provide to the petitioner and  [[Page 20778]]  publish in the Federal Register notice of and the reasons for such denial.     (b) Civil judicial penalties.     (1) Generally. Any person who violates this subpart shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $25,000 per day for each violation. Each day a violation continues constitutes a separate violation.     (2) Limitation. A person is not liable for a civil judicial penalty under this paragraph for a violation if the person has been assessed a civil administrative penalty under paragraph (a) of this section for the violation.     (c) Determination of amount. In determining the amount of a civil penalty under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, the court or the Secretary or his delegatee shall consider the seriousness of the violation, any history of such violations, any good-faith efforts to comply with applicable requirements, the economic impact of the penalty on the violator, and other such matters as justice may require.     (d) Criminal Penalties.     (1) Negligent violations. Any person who negligently violates this subpart commits a Class A misdemeanor.     (2) Knowing violations. Any person who knowingly violates this subpart commits a Class D felony.     (3) False Statements. Any person who knowingly makes any false statement, representation, or certification in any record, report or other document filed or required to be maintained under this subpart, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any testing or monitoring device or method required to be maintained under this subpart commits a Class D felony.     (e) Awards.     (1) The Secretary or his delegatee or the court, when assessing any fines or civil penalties, as the case may be, may pay from any fines or civil penalties collected under this section an amount not to exceed one-half of the penalty or fine collected to any individual who furnished information which leads to the payment of the penalty or fine. If several individuals provide such information, the amount shall be divided equitably among such individuals. No officer or employee of the United States, the State of Alaska or any Federally recognized Tribe who furnishes information or renders service in the performance of his or her official duties shall be eligible for payment under this paragraph (e)(1).     (2) The Secretary, his delegatee, or a court, when assessing any fines or civil penalties, as the case may be, may pay, from any fines or civil penalties collected under this section, to the State of Alaska or any Federally recognized Tribe providing information or investigative assistance which leads to payment of the penalty or fine, an amount which reflects the level of information or investigative assistance provided. Should the State of Alaska or a Federally recognized Tribe and an individual under paragraph (e)(1) of this section be eligible for an award, the Secretary, his delegatee, or the court, as the case may be, shall divide the amount equitably.     (f) Liability in rem. A cruise vessel operated in violation of this subpart is liable in rem for any fine imposed under paragraph (c) of this section or for any civil penalty imposed under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, and may be proceeded against in the United States district court of any district in which the cruise vessel may be found.

EPA                Enforcement Officers Make Gulf Violators Pay                From illegal discharges to ocean dumping,                EPA enforcement officers let companies know it doesn't pay to pollute                the Gulf of Mexico.                Actually, Taylor Sharpe, an enforcement                officer at EPA-Dallas, says companies that operate offshore oil                platforms in the Gulf ""are getting very good at controlling pollutant                discharges into Gulf waters, but sometimes a company will mess up.""                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Illegal Discharges                              An Oklahoma company that operates                drilling platforms in 10 different regions of the Gulf operated                one platform without the required EPA permit for three years. Sharpe                says the platform was discharging produced water. National Pollutant                Discharge Elimination System permits are required under the Clean                Water Act to discharge produced water or produced sand by-products                from oil or gas operations in the Gulf. The permit limits the amount                of oil and grease such discharges may include.                ""The company had permits for other                platforms, but they were operating one illegally,"" says Sharpe.                EPA-Dallas filed an enforcement action, and the company agreed to                settle for a penalty of $67,000.                ""They claimed it was an administrative                oversight, and it may have been,"" says Sharpe, ""but now they are                committed to doing a better job, and the Gulf will be cleaner.""                A California Company                A large California oil company recently                paid a penalty of $66,000 after violating its permit that required                using new, cleaner synthetic drilling mud in the Gulf. ""The company                was headed in the right direction,"" says Sharpe, ""They were switching                to a cleaner product, but the transition was not legal because old                drilling mud remained in the equipment and was being discharged                along with the new.""                ""They were saving the company money,                but it was not a good technical solution,"" he added.                Sharpe says oil companies operating                over 4,000 oil and gas platforms in the Gulf are doing a good job                protecting its waters, ""definitely much better than 20 years ago.""                But there are still violations, he says, mostly by individual platform                employees who try to take shortcuts.                Sharpe says more EPA-Dallas enforcement                actions can be expected.                Gulf Dumping                Earlier this year, a federal jury                convicted a Canadian man for illegally dumping trash bags full of                asbestos into the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere. The man had been                hired to lead a crew to remove asbestos from an old ferry boat,                which eventually was to be transformed into a riverboat gambling                casino.                To save time and money, the crew bagged                up the debris and dumped it during a voyage south from San Diego,                through the Panama Canal, across the Gulf to Mobile, Alabama.                Lisa DeSiderio, resident agent in                charge of EPA's San Diego Border Office, says witnesses reported                ""hundreds"" of bags of asbestos and trash were dumped. Since the                asbestos removal contract was estimated from $600,000 to $1.7 million,                EPA believed a significant amount of asbestos was dumped.                Using crew photographs of the dumping                as evidence, EPA and the FBI obtained an indictment, and Canada                extradited the defendant back to the U.S. late last year. In March                2003 a federal jury in Washington, D.C., convicted the man of conspiracy                and violating both the Ocean Dumping Act and the Act to Prevent                Pollution from Ships. DeSiderio says sentencing is set for late                August.                An $18 Million Verdict                A large cruise ship operator last                year pleaded guilty to criminal charges and agreed to pay $18 million                in fines and restitution. Six cruise ships had illegally dumped                oily waste with bilge water into the Gulf and other locations. Shipping                lines are required to treat bilge water to reduce oil content or                dispose of it onshore. Untreated bilge water can harm sea life significantly.                Company employees allegedly ran fresh                water past the sensors in the ships' oil water separators to fool                detection equipment, and kept false records on the discharges. The                company was assessed probation for three to five years and agreed                to hire new personnel as part of an environmental compliance program.                The case was investigated by EPA's                Criminal Investigation Division, the U.S. Department of Transportation,                the FBI and the U.S. Customs Service.                Obviously, not only EPA, but the entire                U.S. government, will act to ensure violators don't profit from                polluting the Gulf of Mexico.

Volume one contains chapters one through three and the referenced appendix. Volume two contains the Partners' respective Fiscal Year 2001 workplans. The following chapter outlines the background, unique purpose, and benefits of this Partnership Agreement, lists the parties to it, cites the legal authority for establishing such a partnership, provides a description of the scope of the Agreement, the guiding principles, and priorities of each Agreement Partner. I. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE In the last few years, states and the federal government have been entering into agreements that seek to better coordinate efforts to protect human health and the environment. In 1998, Maryland's environmental, public health, and natural resources protection agencies entered into their first agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The purpose of the FY 1998 Agreement between the Maryland Departments of Environment (MDE) and Natural Resources (DNR) (the Departments) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region III, was to provide for the development of a long-term, results-based management plan that will improve the effectiveness of Maryland's environmental programs and strengthen the relationship between the Departments and EPA. That Agreement established a multi-year strategic planning/agreement process that set forth Maryland's environmental goals, identified the programs designed to achieve those goals, established and adopted indicators to measure progress, described existing workload responsibilities, defined the State/EPA relationship, and reflected a comprehensive public participation process that will help guide future program direction. In developing the first Agreements, the Partners realized that designing meaningful and substantive partnership agreements that will improve both the environmental results and the way in which the Partners interact in performing their respective responsibilities, would take longer than one agreement cycle. Therefore, the Partners agreed that the first two agreements would document what the environmental conditions and protection activities were at that time, and then target the FY 2000 Agreement as the time frame in which significant changes could begin to be implemented. The FY 2000 Agreement. The FY 2000 Agreement continued the focus on improving the working relationship between the Partners. For example, the Partners implemented the commitments to burden reduction, developed an agreement to use the EPA Fort Meade laboratory facility for training, negotiated federal grant application workplans consistent with the State's strategic planning format, and improved data management coordination. The Partners posted the Agreement and Environmental Indicators on MDE's Homepage www.mde.state.md.us. The FY 2000 Agreement also set the groundwork for exploring fiscal year realignment of federal grants, developing a Performance Partnership Grant (PPG) for MDE's Information Technology (IT) needs, and expanding federal facilities partnership opportunities.

First, the two-year time frame of this Agreement will afford the Partners the necessary time to focus on achieving improved environmental results. Second, this two-year Agreement will support the Partners' commitment to implementing Smart Growth policies. Growth trends and land use decisions directly affect many of the issues that state and federal environmental and public health protection agencies are facing today. The Partners commit to pro-actively address growth and development trends to minimize the adverse impacts to public health and the environment. In 1997, the State of Maryland launched its Smart Growth and Neighborhood Conservation Initiative, which encourages the revitalization of older, developed areas throughout the State and addresses issues such as the increased cost of infrastructure associated with sprawl patterns of development and loss of open space. The Federal Government policy recently was articulated when the U.S. EPA Regions II & III, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Federal Highway Administration, the U.S. Department of Army, among others, signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) committing to ""develop pilot projects with State and local governments to coordinate agency programs in a manner that supports State and local initiatives to manage growth and protect vital resources."" This MOA provides for technical assistance to State and local governments, eliminates federal programmatic incentives to inefficient development patterns, encourages revitalization, such as Brownfields redevelopment, and provides positive land preservation incentives. To explore how the State and federal governments can effectively implement these policies, the Partners will be focusing their efforts on two priority Smart Growth areas: (1) Baltimore Harbor and (2) the Anacostia Watershed, in conjunction with the existing ongoing restoration effort. By using targeted, multi-media teams, the Partners envision achieving greater environmental benefits than the traditional, single media approach to implementing Smart Growth policies. (See New Initiatives discussion for more information.) Note that the Partners have been using multi-media team approaches successfully over the past three agreements to address a variety of issues such as identifying burden reduction opportunities, developing environmental indicators, and improving information management approaches. Benefits. The primary benefits of Partnership Agreements continue to be protecting human health and the environment by improving the mutual effectiveness of Maryland's and EPA's environmental programs and strengthening the relationship between the Departments and EPA. The Partners envision that these Agreements will result in administrative benefits, including, increased flexibility, eliminating administrative burdens, joint goal setting and program evaluation, and reducing federal oversight of programs judged by EPA to be successful. For example, EPA recently assisted MDE in its efforts to relocate its headquarters by providing specifications about designing and building an environmentally friendly facility. In future years, shared State-EPA activities involving assessment, planning, education, compliance assistance, enforcement, reporting, and/or grant writing all can be developed and evaluated in the context of mutually agreed upon environmental goals.

AGREEMENT PARTNERS This Environmental Performance Partnership Agreement is entered into between the Regional Administrator of Region III of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Secretaries of the Maryland Departments of Environment (MDE) and Natural Resources (DNR). The Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) continues to provide input into the Agreement process, but is not a signatory to this Agreement. Back to Top  III. AUTHORITY   Environmental and Administrative Operations  II. Maryland DNR and EPA Goals Goal #1: Ensure sustainable populations of living resources and aquatic habitat in the mainstem of the Chesapeake Bay, tidal tributaries, and Coastal Bays Goal #2: Healthy Maryland watershed lands, streams, and non-tidal rivers Goal #3: A natural resources stewardship ethic for Marylanders Goal #4: Vibrant local communities in balance with natural systems Goal #5: Establish a protected statewide network of ecologically valuable private and public lands (Green Infrastructure)  In 1995, the Joint Committee to Reform Oversight, made up of the Environmental Council of States (ECOS) and EPA, created the National Environmental Performance Partnership System (NEPPS.) The purpose of NEPPS is to develop new approaches that provide improved environmental outcomes, greater coordination and flexibility, strengthened partnerships between the States and EPA, and administrative savings. In 1996, the U.S. Congress authorized EPA to create a Performance Partnership Grants Program, allowing states to combine various environmental grants into one or more multi-program grants. This approach can provide the states more flexibility in targeting their environmental programs. In 2000, ECOS and EPA re-affirmed their mutual commitment to optimizing NEPPS and utilizing Partnership Agreements as the primary tool for enhancing state-federal environmental protection efforts and improving their working relationship. IV. SCOPE OF THE AGREEMENT The Partners agree that nothing in this Agreement should be read or construed to abrogate or alter the responsibilities, authorities, and procedures conferred upon each Partner by statute, regulation, grant, delegation, or authorization agreement. The Departments administer many federally delegated and federally supported programs, including those from EPA, as well as from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Department of Interior, and the Food and Drug Administration, among others. While programs delegated by other federal agencies and programs wholly within the State's authority are described in this Agreement, the statutes and programs covered under this Agreement are all under the EPA's purview and include: The The The The The The The The Clean Air Act; Clean Water Act; Safe Drinking Water Act; Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act; Pollution Prevention Act; Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act, and Toxic Substances Control Act.  APPENDIX State/EPA Information Management Efforts Carroll/Camden Environmental Restoration Project EnPA Fiscal Year Realignment Workgroup Status Report - June, 2000 COMMENTS  This Agreement also recognizes that the Partners have certain obligations and opportunities to conserve endangered and threatened species and their critical habitat, as set forth in the Endangered Species Act. Back to Top  V. GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR PROTECTING MARYLAND'S CITIZENS AND NATURAL RESOURCES Results-based Management Approaches. Both Maryland and the federal government endeavor to link their programs with environmental goals. Maryland, in developing its goals and management objectives, looked first at its environmental and public health conditions. In Maryland, Governor Parris N. Glendening has created a Managing Maryland for Results system, a results-based approach to management that includes strategic planning, continuous quality improvement, and performance planning and evaluation, which includes self assessment. Maryland evaluates and reports its environmental program performance through use of performance measures that include environmental indicators, outcomes, outputs, input, quality and efficiency measures. For example, MDE has integrated the Performance Partnership Agreement, including the environmental indicators and workplan commitments, into its Managing for Results strategic plans. The FY 2001 EnPA workplan commitments may be found in Chapter 4. The federal government performs under the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) that is based on the same premise. GPRA requires EPA to develop a five-year  ----------PREVIOUS AGREEMENTS FY1999 EnPA FY2000 EnPA   strategic plan. Contained within Chapter workplan associated with achieving their Environmental Performance Partnership management systems and commitments  4 of the FYs 2001 & 02 Agreement is EPA's GPRA measures. The FYs 2001 & 02 Agreement has been developed with these in mind.  Public Participation. Involving the public throughout the Environmental Performance Partnership process has been a guiding principle for the Partners. Over the past 3 years, formal public meetings and stakeholder briefings were held at 30 locations across the state. The Partners re-affirm the importance of the public participation process and will continue to pursue opportunities to engage their stakeholders and the public (see discussion under FY 2000 workgroup commitments and new initiatives.) Environmental Justice. In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898 ""Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations,"" and an accompanying Presidential memorandum, to focus federal attention on the environmental and human health conditions in minority and low-income communities. This Executive Order directed federal agencies to each develop a draft Environmental Justice Strategy. The draft strategy was designed to identify and address disproportionately high exposure and adverse human health effects of their programs, policies, and activities on minority and low-income populations. The Executive Order states, ""To the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law, and consistent with the principles set forth in the report on the National Performance Review, each federal agency shall make achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations in the United States."" In accordance with the Executive Order, EPA Region III will work cooperatively with the State to implement this Executive Order. The Partners agree on the importance of equitable treatment of all people regardless of race, color, creed, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, policies, and programs. No person or group of people should shoulder a disproportionate share of adverse environmental impacts as a result of the execution of environmental policies, programs, or initiatives. The Partners are committed to working together to develop programs, activities, and initiatives in the state of Maryland that are consistent with the principles of environmental justice, that build capacity within communities, and that enhance the level of cooperation and understanding with regard to environmental justice. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in all federally assisted programs. As recipients of federal grant funding, Maryland recognizes its obligation under Title VI, and is fully committed to complying with its provisions. In this regard, the Partners are committed to working cooperatively in an effort to develop an enhanced working relationship in an effort to provide education and constructive insights in the development of a strategy for addressing Title VI. Commitment to Effective Enforcement. MDE remains committed to the use of formal enforcement tools. Incorporated by reference into Maryland's Environmental Performance Partnership Agreement is the Annual Enforcement and Compliance Report, which specifically describes the enforcement process and lists the number of enforcement actions taken. (For more information about MDE's Annual Enforcement and Compliance Report, see MDE's Homepage www.mde.state.md.us.) EPA, too, is committed to effective enforcement. EPA will conduct inspections in Maryland and should violations be discovered, EPA will take timely and appropriate enforcement action in accordance with its timely enforcement policies. EPA enforcement actions in Maryland will be communicated with the appropriate State program managers in accordance with the consultative process (described in Chapter 3  Dispute Resolution) and during quarterly calls with program managers.   One part of MDE's enforcement process involves an activity that MDE has named ""compliance assistance."" Because MDE's nomenclature may lead to some confusion, the following explanation is provided to supplement the description of MDE's enforcement statistic known as ""compliance assistance."" MDE compliance inspectors do not conduct ""compliance assistance visits."" They only conduct compliance inspections. When a compliance inspector discovers either a potential violation or a minor violation that can be quickly corrected, the inspector has the option of advising the facility to correct the problem before a formal enforcement action is taken. If the facility corrects the problem, that correction is counted in the Enforcement Report under the heading of ""compliance assistance."" This activity involves enforcement inspector discretion combined with an attempt to help the facility return to compliance. If the facility fails to correct the problem, then the Department takes an enforcement action and counts the event as a violation resulting in an enforcement action. The minor violation is either voluntarily corrected and counted as ""compliance assistance,"" or it becomes the subject of an enforcement action and is counted as such. Furthermore, an inspection in which an inspector provides discretionary assistance in helping a facility return to compliance after a violation has been noted is not counted as a ""Compliance Assistance Visit."" The individuals making traditional Compliance Assistance Visits are not MDE compliance inspectors. Although MDE recognizes that it is always in the business of informing and advising the regulated community on how to comply with the law, the infinite variations of potential factual patterns make distinguishing one form of contact from another almost impossible. Therefore, all contacts with the regulated community by compliance inspectors are counted as enforcement activity. All ""non-enforcement"" contacts and visits are counted separately. Back to Top  VI.

Reduction of Global and Cross Border Environmental Risks Safe Food Existing Grants and Delegations Under cover of the Agreement and its annual workplan, the Partners will implement the activities and track progress. For the purposes of this Agreement, the Partners may use the environmental indicators found in the FY 2000 EnPA Agreement and on MDE's Homepage www.mde.state.md.us. EPA uses GPRA and core performance measures to evaluate its performance. EPA relies on the State to collect and report the data, primarily through existing grant, authorization, and/or delegation agreements. Specific reporting requirements may be found in these grant and delegation agreements. In addition, each categorical grant includes Quality Assurance Climate Change Effective Management   Planning requirements, which are referenced in MDE's and DNR's Quality Management Plans. Incorporation by Reference MDE and DNR have various documents, including this Agreement, that present their commitments, activities, goals, and objectives. The other documents are incorporated into this Agreement by referencing their existence and by re-affirming their role in setting Maryland's environmental agenda. These documents include: MDE and DNR's State FY 2001 and FY 2002 Managing Maryland for Results budget submissions, The 1983 and 1987 Chesapeake Bay Agreements and Restoration Strategies, Chesapeake 2000: A Watershed Partnership, including its various commitments, State Revolving Fund (SRF) Intended Use Plans for Wastewater and Drinking Water, Section 319 Non-Point Source (NPS) Management Plan and Assessment Report, Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plans (CCMPs) for Maryland's Coastal Bays, Coastal Zone Management Plan, Clean Water Action Plan, Integrated Natural Resources Assessment, Comprehensive Ground Water Protection Plan, Administrative Assistance Applications, Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) Cooperative Agreement, Clean Water Act (CWA) Section 305(b) Water Quality Assessment Report, Environmental Indicators Report, MDE's Quality Management Plan, DNR's Quality Management Plan, From Mountains to the Sea: The State of Maryland's Freshwater Streams, MDE 2000 Annual Enforcement and Compliance Report, and Maryland Environment 2000 (ME 2000) Risk Assessment Report. Back to Top  CHAPTER 2: REVIEW OF FY 2000 COMMITMENTS AND FYs 2001 & 2002 NEW INITIATIVES Chapter 2 summarizes the Partners progress in meeting their various partnership commitments and provides information about FYs 2001 and 2002 new initiatives. FY 2000 ENFORCEMENT AND COMPLIANCE ACTIVITIES The Partners (Region III and MDE) have continued to meet on a regular basis (quarterly) using the Consultative Process as their guide (see Chapter 3 for a description of this Process.) During FY 2000 the disagreement elevation procedure was employed on one occasion concerning the Lehigh Portland asphalt facility in Carroll County. EPA Region III awarded MDE a $100,000 grant to develop a pilot project for deriving a statistically valid method for determining the ""compliance rate"" of identified regulated facilities/sectors/ or communities. The grant is to be administered over the next three years by Region III. MDE and Region III successfully completed a series of chemical process safety inspections   at five industrial facilities on the Fairfield peninsula in southeast Baltimore City. There had been several chemical accidents in close proximity to the residential community known as Wagner's Point. The five targeted facilities were inspected by an EPA multi-media and chemical process safety inspection team. The results of those inspections were shared with MDE as well as the targeted facilities and, where necessary, process changes were suggested and made. Coincidentally, since the inspections began, all of the residents in that small residential enclave have been able to relocate through the collective effort of Baltimore City, the State of Maryland, the federal government, and several of the regulated facilities. Working together, the governmental entities, businesses and the community developed a package which offered a fair price for the houses, covered some relocation costs, and provided low-interest loans to help residents acquire new housing. MDE and Region III continue to work cooperatively in the area of multi-media inspections at designated federal facilities. Specifically in FY 2000 MDE and Region III inspectors inspected the Baltimore Marine Industries ship scrapping operation being conducted under Navy a contract. MDE inspectors also participated in and reviewed Region III's multi-media inspection at the Veterans Administration Medical Center at Perry Point. MDE supports Region III's enforcement initiative concerning colleges and universities and will provide Region III with the names of two colleges and/or universities to be the subject of EPA multi-media inspection. In addition to the above referenced initiatives which will continue into FY 2001, MDE and Region III also plan to begin working cooperatively in the area of using Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEPs) as another available form of enforcement action. The Partners will also develop a set of protocols governing notification and coordination on the use of the State and federal environmental audit policies. In this regard MDE and Region III have begun discussion of using outreach to certain identified urban communities to increase compliance with environmental laws in underprivileged urban areas by effective use of voluntary self-disclosure. In addition to the activities listed above (i.e. ship scrapping and Veterans Administration Medical Center at Perry Point) MDE and Region III continue to meet on an as needed basis concerning federal facilities issues, as they arise. MDE participates in a monthly conference call between Region III's federal facilities coordinator and various federal agencies. MDE will participate again this year in the EPA/Department of Defense Colloquium. Back to Top  REVIEW OF FY 2000 WORKGROUP EFFORTS The following summarizes the findings and recommendations of the interagency workgroups. Updating the Environmental Indicators information. The Environmental Indicators are currently available on MDE's Homepage. In addition, there are links on the DNR website to the Indicators. The Partners made a commitment, to the citizens who participated in the public meetings and provided input through electronic and written correspondence, to regularly update the information in the Environmental Indicators Report. Therefore, in the summer of each year, the Partners will update those Indicators where new data are available. In addition, for each Indicator, under the Indicator development and data responsibility information, the Partners will indicate the frequency with which that Indicator will be updated (many Indicators are updated annually, biennially, triennially, etc., as the data are collected). The Partners also will indicate the date that the Indicator was last updated. By regularly updating the Indicators, we will be providing the public the most recent information about the environmental conditions in Maryland. In addition, to enable citizens   with questions to go directly to the source, each Indicator includes both the Program name and the phone number where those staff responsible for Indicator development and data responsibility can be contacted. Public Participation and Outreach. As part of the Partners' commitment to public participation and outreach, six meetings were held across Maryland in January and February 1999. The workgroup posted on MDE's Homepage a ""Response to Questions"" that reflected responses to comments received from the Winter 1999 meetings. The workgroup members briefed various stakeholder committees throughout 2000. Moreover, MDE has been providing information to its employees about EnPA through on-going Human Resources Training (see New Initiatives for more information.) Negotiating Grant Agreements Using MDE's Strategic Plan. MDE grant managers for Underground Storage Tank (UST), Clean Water Act Section 604(b), TSCA asbestos abatement, and Public Water System Supervision (PWSS) grants have been working with EPA to revise the federal grant application workplan to be consistent with the format used for MDE's MFR's submittal to Governor Glendening. This work has been part of the Partner's efforts to further reduce burden associated with grant applications. To apply for FY 2001 federal grants, MDE will be using, where feasible, this revised format for the previously mentioned four grants, and tracking the progress of this new approach throughout the next two years. Managing data systems and identifying data gaps. The purpose of this workgroup was to focus on existing data collection, storage, distribution, and interpretation. Since FY 1999, the workgroup has focused on four areas: (1) adequacy of data, (2) standardized data documentation, (3) data accessibility, and (4) duplication of effort. A status report of their efforts may be found in the Appendix . This workgroup will continue its efforts through FY 2002, providing regular semi-annual reports to Partnership Agreement Coordinating Team (EPACT) throughout the term of the new Agreement. Reducing the reporting burden on Maryland where possible. The purpose of this workgroup was to look at the reporting transactions between the state and federal Partners and to identify specific reporting requirements that can be eliminated, streamlined, reduced and/or changed through new or improved reporting processes. The workgroup has been tracking its recommended reporting burden reductions and is continuing its work on identifying other opportunities for reporting burden reductions in the Minority Business Enterprise/Women Business Enterprise Program (MBE/WBE), the drinking water program (PWSS), and other issue areas. These areas will continue to be evaluated, as well as the air program NOV reporting requirements, as part of the FYs 2001 & 02 Agreement. Training coordination. MDE and EPA have agreed on the use of conference space at EPA's Environmental Science Center in Fort Meade, Maryland, for the purpose of MDE participating in EPA's Air Pollution Training Institute (APTI) satellite classes. This agreement provides MDE convenient access to EPA's teleconferencing facility (see Appendix for more information.) Better aligning the state and federal fiscal year time frames. The purpose of this workgroup was to develop a process that can achieve re-alignment of federal fiscal year activities with the State's fiscal year time frame. The workgroup was tasked with answering: What has to be done? How long will it take? And when should it begin? The workgroup prepared simulations that included detailed analyses of the steps that are needed to assess whether or not such as transition benefits the Partners and how to make the realignment transition. Since FY 2000, MDE has been conducting a pilot program to include one small grant per media administration that would be tracked in the automated federal grant Financial Management Information System (FMIS) component (see Appendix for more information.) The workgroup recommended the UST, TSCA, and Underground Injection Control (UIC) grants and is adding a lead grant to the pilot as well. The pilot is being implemented in parallel with the existing grant system to provide the opportunity to troubleshoot any problems before it may be expanded to include the remaining EPA grants. This effort will continue   throughout the FYs 2001 and 02 time frame. Improving interagency coordination on federal facilities. The purpose of this workgroup was to identify state and EPA personnel with federal facilities responsibilities, list their responsibilities, look for overlap, and establish a process for improved communication and coordination. Moreover, the workgroup was tasked with identifying key opportunities at federal facilities in which the State and Region III could work together to resolve challenging compliance issues. (See New Initiatives for more information.) Multi-year Agreements. As noted above, this Agreement covers the FY 2001 through FY 2002 time frame. The Partners agree to regularly update the environmental indicator data. MDE will be conducting a programmatic self-assessment and DNR will be using an MFR selfassessment process during this time frame. Moreover, to ensure ongoing communication about progress toward meeting the partnership goals, the Partners agree to provide their respective FY 2002 EnPA workplans to each other. Erosion and Sediment Control Compliance Initiative. MDE has been strengthening its erosion and sediment control program, which is an extremely important element in the State's effort to protect and improve water quality. In FY 2000, EPA has provided MDE with TSCA multi-media grant funding to develop procedures that would enlist the services of both public and private interests to pursue voluntary procedures for achieving compliance, utilizing the efforts of Soil Conservation District personnel, aggregate operators, and possibly DNR's Maryland Forest Service. Additional Efforts. There has been a variety of other federal  State partnership efforts in addition to the examples reported above. These include Region III, the states in Region III and the Army Corps of Engineers working together to review the Formerly Used Defense Sites (FUDS) program. Topics of discussion include funding status and issues, CERCLIS prescreening, DSMOA reviews, and project prioritization. Back to Top  FYs 2001 AND 2002 NEW INITIATIVES The Partners agree to pursue several new initiatives under this Agreement: Public Participation and Outreach. During FYs 2001 and 2002, the workgroup will place the FYs 2001 & 02 EnPA Agreement on MDE's Homepage. The workgroup members will create opportunities for reviewers to ask questions and make comments on-line. Then the Partners will post responses to questions on-line, create a ""Frequently Asked Questions/Answers about EnPA"" on-line, Notify interested parties by letter who attended meetings that information about EnPA is available on-line and invite them to comment. MDE will advertise in MDEnvironment that the Agreement document is available on-line and provides opportunity for comments. Moreover, the Partners agree to invite interested parties to request a briefing about the current status. Depending on number of requests, the Partners will determine feasibility of holding meetings. Other ideas include: q  Target State Fair/MACO  create palm card or reference sheet that lists information available on Homepage, which includes EnPA, and state that comments can be made on-line. Engage Existing Audiences  Have Palm Card or Reference Sheet with information about Homepage, which includes EnPA, stating there is an opportunity to provide comments on-line about environmental priorities. Target community associations that hold regular meetings.  q  q   Smart Growth Projects. The Partners agree to pursue or undertake pilot projects that demonstrate the benefits of smart growth policies. For example, air quality benefits from state land use strategies in non-attainment areas or maintenance areas can be applied as a credit to State Implementation Plans. Or, these benefits may be part of state conformity determinations, where EPA has assurance that such strategies have produced the air quality benefits through reduced emissions from transportation-related sources. The Partners agree to evaluate land use strategies for potential air quality credits. Moreover, EPA is willing to provide workshops and training sessions for the State and various metropolitan planning organizations on developing air quality credits from various land use scenarios. Another example may include the Partners' willingness to develop pilot efforts to develop innovative approaches that will tailor the implementation of federal programs to reinforce the State's growth management objectives. Under this effort, EPA is willing to focus available federal resources on reinforcing local and State planning and environmental preservation objectives. This could be accomplished by providing technical assistance and tailoring regulatory approaches that would minimize possible regulatory burdens for development activity in priority funding areas. As noted earlier, the Partners will pursue these approaches in the Baltimore Harbor and Anacostia Watershed regions. Carroll/Camden Environmental Restoration Project. This project entails a multi-year effort to prepare tracts of land for redevelopment in a heavily industrialized and underutilized section of Baltimore City, the Carroll/Camden Industrial area. This pilot project supports EPA and MDE EnPA redevelopment objectives (i.e., Brownfields) and will result in a measurable environmental benefit in support of the Partners' commitment to implementing Smart Growth policies. For the project to undertaken, the Partners agree to identify possible project funding sources before the end of December 2000. Over the FYs 2001 & 02 time frame, the Partners will meet to review a variety of possible sources of multi-media funding in support of this proposed multi-year effort. (For more information see the Appendix.) Performance Partnership Grant for MDE's Information Technology. A key component to the success of MDE's Information Technology (IT) reorganization of systems, personnel, and information infrastructure, is the realignment of MDE's financial resources that support its information management systems. MDE believes this alignment can be accomplished through the establishment of a Performance Partnership Grant for Information Technology (IT PPG). The benefits associated with this IT PPG include, but are not limited, to: reduced administration paperwork in the Department for tracking and managing information technology related financial assistance; enhanced ability for the Department to leverage it's resources by pulling money together that will give the Department more buying power in the information technology market; and provide the ability to better control and direct funding to achieve the partners' goals in a more holistic fashion. This would eliminate the traditional ""stove pipe"" approach to information technology management. MDE and EPA agree to develop and implement an IT PPG during FY 2001. Exploring P2 Opportunities with Federal Facilities. In addition to the previously-mentioned cooperative efforts between MDE and federal facilities, the Partners agreed to explore the possibility of developing a formal ""Pollution Prevention Agreement"" among the State, EPA, and the federal facilities located in Maryland. This Agreement would seek to memorialize the federal facilities' current pollution prevention (P2) efforts and identify opportunities for providing further information transfer and sharing of successes to other Maryland facilities. Specifically, the goals include: identifying P2 opportunities at federal facilities; promoting the use of P2 as the preferred environmental policy at Maryland Department of Defense (DoD) facilities; promoting a P2 information clearinghouse; promoting DoD mentoring with Businesses for the Bay; and promoting the integration of P2 into everyday activities at all Maryland-based DoD installations. Commitment to Educate and Train Workforce on EnPA and NEPPS. The Partners recognize that the NEPPS system and Partnership Agreements provide a new and different   framework for achieving environmental and public health protection. Currently, many of the individuals who are performing the tasks associated with environmental and public health protection do not have a complete understanding of the opportunities and benefits NEPPS and Partnership Agreements can provide. Therefore, MDE and EPA agree to begin or continue conducting education and training of their respective workforce on NEPPS and Partnership Agreements. The purpose of this effort is to ensure that all individuals involved in Maryland  EPA activities are knowledgeable about NEPPS and have opportunities to contribute ideas and strategies for achieving greater environmental successes by using the new system. Further Burden Reduction. The Partners agree to continue implementing the recommendations of the FY1999/2000 Reporting Workgroup and to track progress. EPA agrees to pursue the MBE/WBE reporting issues and to seek help in reducing/refining the data collection and reporting burden on states. The Partners agree to inform their respective program staff of the need to identify potential opportunities for reporting burden reduction during grant negotiations and through the annual programmatic review process. Program staff shall be encouraged to look for innovative ways to streamline reporting so long as core regulatory requirements are met. Moreover, the Partners commit to an analysis of the grant, policy, and regulatory reporting requirements of the Drinking Water Program, including an evaluation of why the information is needed, how it is used, and opportunities to streamline the reporting process. The Workgroup will meet quarterly and report semi-annually to the E-PACT. Quality Management Plans. Region III approved MDE's Quality Management Plan (QMP) in Fiscal 2000. MDE is working toward writing or revising Quality Assurance Project Plans (QAPPs) for all appropriate programs or projects or business processes where standard operating procedures are necessary to ensure the collection and management of quality environmental data. In FY 2001, MDE will submit to EPA the QAPPs for all federally assisted programs in a format that is agreed to by the Partners. MDE has prepared a generic template that all programs are using to prepare the QAPPs. EPA will assist MDE and DNR with specialized training on developing, writing, and maintaining effective QAPPs. Back to Top  CHAPTER 3: ADMINISTERING THE AGREEMENT The Partners are committed to improving the effectiveness of Maryland's environmental programs and strengthening the relationship between the State and EPA. This chapter outlines how the Partners will communicate and coordinate, resolve any disputes that might arise, and identifies the members of the Partnership Coordinating Team. I. COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION The Partners agree to communicate on a regularly scheduled basis, and to discuss the overall progress of the activities in the Agreement. These activities, to be successful, are dependent upon MDE, DNR, and EPA dedicating personnel to implement, or modify if necessary, the Agreement once all parties adopt it. To ensure ongoing communication, each party has designated a point of contact. MDE's designated person chairs Maryland's Performance Partnership Coordinating Team (E-PACT), which is made up of key personnel from each participating agency, as well as a representative from MDA, who serves in an advisory capacity. The E-PACT will take part in regularly scheduled conference calls and in-person meetings to foster improvements in the Performance Partnership process and ensure that issues identified in the Agreement are resolved during the course of the year. A key objective of the E-PACT will be to quickly and efficiently resolve these issues by setting and meeting deadlines for resolution.   Back to Top  II. DISPUTE RESOLUTION The Partners are committed to timely resolution of disputes. The Partners agree to treat the resolution process as an opportunity to improve our joint efforts. With reference to enforcement and compliance issues, the consultative process identified earlier will be used in dispute resolution. On all other issues, the following procedures will be used: PRINCIPLE - all disputes should be resolved at the front line or staff level. TIMEFRAME - generally, disputes should be resolved as quickly as possible but within 2 weeks of their arising at the staff level. If unresolved at the end of 2 weeks, the issue should be raised to the next level of each organization. ELEVATION - when there is no resolution and the 2 weeks have passed, there should be comparable elevation in each organization, accompanied by a statement of the issue and a one-page issue paper. A conference call between the parties should be held as soon as possible. Disputes that need to be raised to a higher level should again be raised in comparable fashion in each organization.

MDE AND EPA GOALS MDE GOAL #1: ENSURING THE AIR IS SAFE TO BREATHE Under both Federal and State law, MDE is charged with ensuring that the air is safe for all Marylanders to breathe. The State and federal governments continuously evaluate the human health effects of airborne pollutants. For example, in response to recent studies regarding the health effects of small particles and aerosols, EPA has added a new fine particulate matter national ambient air quality standard for particles 2.5 microns or smaller. EPA has also revised the national ambient air quality standard for ozone. These standards have been challenged by several parties and will be reviewed by the Supreme Court in its session beginning in October 2000. The challenge does not reduce Maryland's efforts associated with meeting the one-hour ozone standard. Over the next few years, should the Court find in EPA's favor, Maryland will be working with EPA to implement the new health-based standards. The key areas of emphasis described below relate to: (1) Reducing the amount and frequency of high levels of ground-level ozone; (2) Reducing the amount of toxic pollutants discharged into the environment; (3) Maintaining attainment of National Ambient Air Quality Standards for pollutants other than ozone; (4) Reducing the amount of acid rain; (5) Ensuring that asbestos removal activities do not endanger human health and (6) Reducing the occurrence of air pollution nuisance conditions, such as from natural wood waste facilities. ACCOMPLISHMENTS, STATUS AND TRENDS  Although exceedences of the one-hour health-based ambient air quality standard continue to be measured throughout much of Maryland, the monitored one-hour ozone levels show a general downward trend. It is difficult to draw conclusions by comparing one year of data to another because of the impact of differing meteorological conditions from year to year. Generally, however, the number of ozone exceedances has decreased as well as the severity of the exceedance, i.e. the concentration measured. The Department has also begun reporting the ozone data on an eighthour basis for comparison to the eight-hour ozone standard promulgated by the EPA in 1997. The Maryland data indicate that there are numerous exceedances of the eight-hour standard (more than for the one-hour standard) and the presumption is that an eight-hour standard will be more difficult to meet. That eight-hour standard was the subject of a recent court decision in which the court found EPA's rulemaking to be unconstitutional and the standard was remanded to the agency for further consideration. Significantly, the standard was not vacated and the underlying science was not called into question. EPA is appealing the court decision and the matter has reached the Supreme Court where it will be reviewed during the session that begins in October 2000. The court's decision does not affect Maryland's obligations to continue its work as related to the one-hour ozone standard. Consistent with a Clean Air Act requirement for nonattainment areas, the Department has   I. Communication and Coordination II. Dispute Resolution III. EnPA Coordination Team IV.

MDE and EPA Goals Goal #1: Ensuring the Air is Safe to Breathe Goal #2: Ensuring that Marylanders Are Not Exposed to Unnecessary Levels of Radiation Goal #3: Ensuring Safe Drinking Water Goal #4: Reducing the Threat to Public Health from the Presence of Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Materials in the Environment Goal #5: Ensuring Water is Clean and Safe for Harvesting of Fish and Shellfish Goal #6: Improving and Protecting Maryland's Water Quality Goal #7: Ensuring Adequate Protection and Restoration of Maryland's Wetland Resources Goal #8: Protecting and Maintaining  developed a plan to bring the three nonattainment areas of the state into compliance with the federal one-hour ozone standard and is moving forward with its implementation. The plan contains numerous measures to reduce ozone precursor emissions from the three major pollution source sectors in Maryland: mobile, stationary and area. In addition to these measures, pollution reductions are assumed from sources that are located outside of Maryland but which influence our air quality. The plan was submitted to the EPA for their review, and the EPA has concluded that for the Baltimore nonattainment area Maryland needs to do more than is stated in the attainment plan as submitted if Maryland is to demonstrate to EPA's satisfaction that attainment with the ozone standard will be achieved by 2005. Specifically, 13 additional tons per day of VOC emission reductions are needed in the Baltimore area. Maryland is working with the Ozone Transport Region states to develop and implement regional reduction measures, such as cleaner fuels and household products, to address the 13-ton need. Similarly, Maryland continues to actively participate in the OTC Regional Planning Organization's efforts to address regional haze in the Mid-Atlantic Region. EPA Region III (Region III) will also provide any technical assistance to MDE in investigating potential VOC reduction strategies to address the 13-ton shortfall in the Baltimore area. EPA Region III is also committed to be an active participant in the OTC Regional Planning Organization's efforts to address regional haze in the Mid-Atlantic Region. It is important to note that the Washington metropolitan area was to be in compliance with the federal ozone standard in 1999. Monitoring data, however, showed that compliance was not achieved in 1999. The principal reason for this was the overwhelming influence of ozone transported from northern Virginia and Washington D.C. into the neighboring Maryland counties of Prince George's and Montgomery. In recognizing this situation and realizing that there is much that needs to be done to bring to fruition measures to address ozone transport, the EPA has granted Maryland an extension of the 1999 compliance deadline to 2005. Reductions in the transport of pollutants from upwind areas into Maryland is key to Maryland being able to achieve compliance with the national health-based standard for ground level ozone. Maryland, therefore, has participated in several regional efforts aimed at addressing the transport problem. One group has been the Ozone Transport Commission (OTC), which consists of representatives from the 12 Northeast states from Maine to Virginia and the District of Columbia. As part of the OTC, Maryland signed a resolution calling for reductions in NOx emissions from utilities and other large boilers located in the OTC by May 1, 1999. In 1998, the Department adopted regulations (NOx Budget Rule) to implement these reductions by the agreed deadline. Those regulations were challenged by utilities in Maryland and, as a result, the rules were overturned by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City and remanded to the agency for further rulemaking. The Department has since successfully re-promulgated the rules with a new compliance date of May 1, 2000. Region III also continues to be an active participant in the OTC efforts in addressing ground level ozone transport throughout the Northeast, including Maryland. When the rule was re-promulgated, the two major utilities in Maryland, BGE and PEPCO, were not able to have permanent equipment installed at all necessary facilities by the May 2000 deadline, so alternate compliance plans were developed for the 2000 ozone season, which involved, in part, the purchasing of NOx allowances from other sources. Legally binding orders capturing this approach to compliance were entered into in 1999 by both utilities. The Department's focus in FY2001 and beyond will be to track compliance with the orders and the budget rule as reports on electric generation rates, allowance purchases and NOx emission rates are filed throughout the course of the ozone season. A second, more stringent phase of NOx regulation has grown out of another regional effort, known as the Ozone Transport Assessment Group (OTAG), in which Maryland was involved. OTAG studied the entire area east of the Mississippi River and the contributions of that area to regional ozone pollution. As a result of those studies, OTAG made recommendations to the EPA for   Maryland's Natural Resource Land Base and Encouraging Smart Growth and Community Revitalization Goal #9: Preventing Pollution and Assisting the Regulated Community with Compliance Goal #10: Utilizing Information Technology to Optimize and Enhance Environmental and Administrative Operations  addressing the problem of transported pollution. Based on the OTAG recommendations and its own modeling work, the EPA promulgated a rule in 1998 calling for reductions in NOx emissions from a 22-state area, including the Northeast, Southeast, and Midwest. The rule established caps on NOx emissions in each of the affected states and required those states to develop plans to ensure that NOx emissions would stay below the applicable cap. The plans were to be submitted to EPA by September 30, 1999, and emission controls to achieve the necessary reductions were to be in place by May 1, 2003. The State of Michigan, utilities, manufacturers and others, challenged the rule and, as an interim measure, the Court stayed the portion of the rule requiring states to submit plans by September 1999. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia later upheld the EPA rule for 19 of the 22 states initially affected and lifted the stay that was in effect. As such, pollution reduction plans from the 19 affected states are due to the EPA in the fall of 2000. Maryland's plan has already been submitted to EPA, and calls for a cap on NOx emissions from affected sources to be achieved by May 2003 and maintained thereafter. No decision has been made on whether the ruling will be appealed to the Supreme Court. Regardless of the fact that there is a chance the challenge to the EPA rule may be pursued further legally, Maryland and other states in the Northeast have agreed to move forward with their planned regulations to achieve the NOx reductions. Maryland's regulations implementing the EPA requirements have been approved and were effective on May 1, 2000. The reductions are important to reduce transported pollution throughout the Northeast and to reduce NOx emissions in Maryland that not only contribute to air pollution in the form of ozone, but also, through atmospheric deposition, result in the increased introduction of nutrients into the Chesapeake Bay. The Department's focus in this arena will be to track the progress of actions needed to be taken by the affected sources to ensure that physical improvements or allowance purchases will be in place to allow Maryland's 2003 ozone season NOx cap to be met. Region III continues to be an active participant in providing technical and policy support and guidance to the Chesapeake Bay Program's nutrient reduction and restoration efforts, particularly in addressing the impacts of nitrogen atmospheric deposition to the Chesapeake Bay Watershed. Region III is also in the process of evaluating Maryland's N0x Budget Rule State Implementation Plan revision submission and will initiate appropriate federal rulemaking actions on Maryland's proposal. A third effort by Maryland to address the need for reductions in NOx emissions from upwind sources is a petition that was filed in April 1999 under 126 of the Clean Air Act. The petition requests EPA to make a finding that emissions from certain upwind sources are contributing to Maryland's failure to attain the national ambient air quality standard for ozone and to impose restrictions on those sources. Maryland's petition is similar to petitions that were filed by 10 other states in the Northeast. These petitions identify sources in the Midwest as well as within the Northeast. EPA has not yet ruled on Maryland's petition. Another action to address NOx emissions from out-of-state sources has taken the form of a lawsuit involving violations of Major New Source Review (NSR) and Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) requirements associated with a major mid-western utility. Maryland, along with six other states, has joined the EPA and the Department of Justice in a lawsuit against American Electric Power (AEP) which has ten electric power plants overall in Ohio, West Virginia and Indiana. The suit centers on AEP's avoidance of prescriptive NSR and PSD program requirements under the Clean Air Act, with the end result being that the utility failed to install pollution control equipment at the time certain plant improvements were made. The equipment would, among other things, reduce NOx emissions from AEP's plants, which would help clean up the air in the states involved in the lawsuit. The Department intends to remain a part of the suit and will take whatever actions are necessary to see the issue through to the end. In addition to these efforts to limit NOx emissions from large stationary sources, such as utilities, the Department is also engaged in activities to lower emissions from other source sectors.

Recognizing the link between transportation planning and air pollution, Congress established a requirement in the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments that transportation projects must ""conform"" to the State Implementation Plan in order to be eligible for federal funding. In order to satisfy these conformity requirements, the Attainment Plans for the Washington Nonattainment Area, the Baltimore Nonattainment Area, and Cecil County contain mobile emissions budgets that limit the amount of pollution that vehicles in the nonattainment areas emit collectively. Limits are set for volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides. New projects from transportation plans and improvement programs in the nonattainment area cannot result in emissions increases above the budget or federal transportation funds will not be released to the region. The Department develops the budgets in coordination with the Maryland Department of Transportation and the metropolitan planning organization in the nonattainment area. The budgets help reduce emissions from mobile sources so that emission reductions, called rate-ofprogress requirements, from the Clean Air Act can be met. Compliance with the rate of progress requirements is charted through periodic inventories of emissions every three years. The next step in this arena is to revise the mobile source budget for the Baltimore area and Cecil County to include federal Tier 2 car and light truck emission standards and to process this revision as an amendment to the State Implementation Plan. Other measures are planned to address the requirement that transportation projects conform to the State Implementation Plan. Effort is underway and will carry forward for several years to increase the use of alternative fueled vehicles (AFVs) and other beneficial technology vehicles in the Baltimore area. Increasing the infrastructure with the necessary fueling equipment and using marketing techniques to encourage the public to use vehicles not dedicated solely to the use of gasoline is the focus of this exercise. The Department will be responsible for overseeing the activities of the various parties responsible for infrastructure development and promoting the use of the alternative technologies. As time moves forward, the Department's activities will increase with respect to implementing recent legislation aimed at providing tax credits for energy efficient vehicles and at encouraging increased use of rapid transit and decreased levels of vehicle miles traveled. Because of the contributions that everyday activities such as refueling and mowing the lawn make to the pollution problem in Maryland, the Department has made a substantial effort to educate the public on ground-level ozone and its health effects. The Ozone Pollution Map and Ozone Action Days programs are cornerstones of the Department's efforts to increase pollution prevention activities by ordinary citizens. The Map, which Maryland and the American Lung Association jointly developed, will be used in 32 states this year and has achieved semi-finalist status in a national competition, Innovative Programs in Government. The map and the Ozone Action Days program continue as part of Maryland's effort to address its ozone problem. Region III will continue to support Maryland's Ozone Action Partnerships, Ozone Mapping program and associated activities. Other Air Program Activities The Department's air quality compliance and permit programs are two key mechanisms for implementing the strategies necessary to attain and maintain the health-based national air quality standards. The number of air pollution sites generally increases slightly each year: the current number of sites exceeds 10,000. These are more than the Department has resources to inspect. Therefore, the Department makes a selection of facilities each year for which inspections will be made. The sources are selected for inspection based on size, potential impact on air quality, citizen concerns and importance to the regulatory scheme. The Department also has federal grant commitments to inspect major and other sources that are subject to federal regulatory requirements. As a result, about 300 sources, those that have the greatest potential for adverse impact, are earmarked each year for a detailed air quality inspection. Inspections at other facilities  ----------PREVIOUS AGREEMENTS FY1999 EnPA FY2000 EnPA   are also conducted. Which facilities are inspected is a function of several factors, among them are compliance status, potential for harm, potential for creating a nuisance. Special initiatives are undertaken at times to focus on a single category of sources. For instance, the 60+ asphalt plants in Maryland were inspected and stack tested in one year to get a complete compliance picture of the industry. Also, beginning in early 2000, all dry-cleaning establishments across the State are being inspected to determine compliance with federal air toxics requirements (dry cleaners can emit perchloroethylene, a hazardous air pollutant, if the machines are not tested and maintained regularly). This effort will stretch over the next five years (20% per year will be inspected), after which a decision will be made based on the five-year findings to what extent the effort should continue. Beginning State FY01, ARMA will be inspecting Stage II vapor recovery facilities. Previously, these inspections were conducted by the Department's Waste Management Administration (WAS). Due to changing priorities within WAS, it was mutually agreed that ARMA would undertake the inspection task after the close of FY00. For Region III, please refer to Chapter 2, ""Review of FY 2000 Commitments and FY 2001 New Initiatives,"" which includes the MDE/Region III cooperative agreement with respect to Enforcement and Compliance Activities. The air quality permitting program issues permits to construct, state operating permits, federal Acid Rain Program permits and federal Title V operating permits. Construction permits ensure that air pollution sources are constructed in accordance with air quality regulatory requirements protective of public health and the environment. These permits also ensure that emissions of toxic air pollutants will not endanger public health. About 800 construction permits are issued each year. Operating permits, through the imposition of monitoring, record keeping, and reporting requirements, ensure that air pollution sources, once constructed and placed in operation, are operated in compliance with air quality requirements. Operating permits are valid for up to five years, after which renewal is required. About 450 sources in Maryland hold state operating permits and 172 of these sources are required to secure a Title V permit. Through the use of an outside contractor, the use of overtime, a temporary shifting of personnel into the Permits Program and the addition of new staff, the Department has issued about one-third of the required Title V permits and is on course to draft the remaining two-thirds in 2000 and to issue them in 2000 and 2001 (FY01 and 02). Acid Rain Program permits are issued to require affected sources to implement the NOx and SO2 emission reduction provisions of the Clean Air Act. The EPA issued Acid Rain Program permits to four sources in Maryland as part of Phase I of the Program under the Clean Air Act. The Department has since issued such permits to the remaining affected sources. Acid Rain Permit compliance tracking and audits of emission monitoring equipment installed under the Program will take place in 2000 and beyond. Maryland operates a program to control the emissions of toxic air pollutants, and has done so since 1988. The program includes a technology and a public health protection element. Similarly, the Clean Air Act requires the EPA to control the emissions of 188 hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). The control is to be done through a two-step process. The first is the setting of technology standards, called Maximum Achievable Control Technology, and the second is examining the residual risk associated with the particular HAP. If, after such examination, an unacceptable level of risk remains, then further reductions of HAP emissions would be sought. The EPA is partway through the standard-setting process: MACT standards for 86 HAPs have been issued, 102 remain to be issued. Maryland has taken delegation from the EPA for inspecting and enforcing against those major MACT sources for which EPA has promulgated standards to date. When the EPA issues additional standards, the Department will seek to include them under its delegation as well. The EPA has also promulgated MACT standards for several minor source categories. The Department is inspecting all minor MACT sources and has issued a proposed regulation to provide enforcement authority in this regard. Once the proposed regulation is final, the EPA will grant Maryland delegation of authority. As in the case for major MACT sources, the Department will seek to add additional MACT standards to its delegation authority for minor sources as additional standards are issued by the EPA. Region III is committed to reviewing MDE draft new source and Clean Air Act Title V operating permits and provide any appropriate comments and/or issues during the review cycle in a timely   manner. This may include providing assistance to MDE such as defining Best Available Control Technology requirements, conducting air quality impact modeling reviews, and other associated permit matters.

Objective #2  Beginning in the 2000 ozone season ensure that NOx Budget Rule sources in Maryland comply with the NOx emission/allowance requirements in the Rule and the consent orders arising from the Rule, as applicable. Objective #3  Beginning in the 2003 ozone season ensure that NOx SIP Call sources in Maryland do not emit in excess of 14,600 tons of NOx emissions during the ozone season. Objective #4 Achieve attainment with the one-hour ozone standard by 2005 in the Baltimore and Washington metropolitan areas and Cecil County. Objective #5  Implement the federal MACT program for those major MACT sources for which standards have been issued by the EPA and beginning no later than January 1, 2001 implement the federal MACT program for those minor sources for which MACT standards have been issued by the EPA. Objective #6  Implement existing state programs to measure and control the emissions of toxic air pollutants. Objective #7  Implement existing programs to prevent the public from being exposed to asbestos. Back to Top  MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AND ACTION PLANS  FY 2001 Ozone The Federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act) require Maryland to attain and maintain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) within the deadlines established in the Act. The only NAAQS for which Maryland still has nonattainment areas is ozone. The Act requires Maryland to demonstrate attainment for ozone by 1999 in the Washington, D.C. region and 2005 in the Baltimore region and Cecil County (part of the Philadelphia nonattainment area). As noted earlier, a compliance-date extension to 2005 has been granted for the Washington metropolitan area. In general in FY01, Maryland will concentrate its efforts on developing the 1999 emissions inventory, implementing existing control strategies to continue to reduce ozone precursor emissions, and developing additional control strategies to eliminate the 13 ton shortfall in Maryland's attainment demonstration. Air Toxics State air toxics regulations require new sources of toxic air pollutants to install Best Available   Control Technology for toxics. Both new and existing sources must demonstrate that their air toxic emissions will not or do not unreasonably endanger human health. The Act establishes requirements for sources of hazardous air pollutants, including Maximum Available Control Technology (MACT) standards and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP). Maryland currently has delegation from EPA to implement and enforce the NESHAP standards and the MACT standards as they apply to major sources. Maryland is seeking delegation of authority for the MACT standards as they apply to area sources. Delegation is expected in early FY01. Irrespective of delegation status, inspection of major and minor MACT sources is currently being undertaken and will continue. Acid Rain The Act established stringent emission limitations for utilities with reductions to be achieved in two phases. EPA was responsible for issuing Phase I permits and the states were to issue Phase II permits. As of May 1998, MDE has issued all of the required Phase II permits which have an effective date of January 1, 2000. The permits require the affected sources to comply with all the requirements of the federal acid rain regulations and to hold allowances equal to or greater than the allowances allocated by regulation. As an ongoing activity, which will continue unabated, MDE staff has served as field inspectors for EPA's Acid Rain Program to observe quality assurance testing and to audit the required continuous emission monitoring systems at sources in the Program. Ozone, Air Toxics Control and Acid Rain (The following includes commitments on behalf of both MDE and Region III in addressing major program activities listed below.) q  MDE will participate in 8-hour ozone attainment/nonattainment area boundary discussions with EPA following their review of Maryland's recommendations in this regard. Once agreement is reached between Region III and MDE on the 8-hour ozone area boundary designations. Region III will initiate appropriate federal rulemaking actions on Maryland's submission. Implement Maryland's NOx Budget Rule limiting NOx emissions from affected utilities and large industrial boilers. As previously mentioned, Region III is in the process of evaluating MDE's N0x Budget Rule submission and will initiate appropriate federal rulemaking actions. MDE will participate in efforts to develop regional control measures to further reduce ozone precursor emissions from sources within the Baltimore metropolitan area. As previously mentioned, Region III will also assist in identifying additional control strategies and measures to further reduce ozone precursor emissions, from stationary, mobile and area sources in the Baltimore metropolitan area. MDE will continue to prepare the 1999 VOC and N0x emissions inventory. Region III will provide any necessary support in this effort as well as conduct inventory completeness reviews and provide comments, as warranted. MDE will develop and implement a banking and trading program for VOC and NOx emission offset credits. Region III will provide any appropriate comments and assistance on Maryland's banking and trading program. MDE will implement the delegated federal air toxics program for major NESHAP MACT sources and accept delegation of EPA's authority upon promulgation of a state regulation providing authority for enforcing the NESHAP MACT requirements at area sources. Region III will assist MDE in its efforts to implement the National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA), including support for developing air toxics inventories. MDE will implement outreach efforts for voluntary action to reduce emissions on high ozone days. Region III is committed to promoting voluntary programs to reduce ozone precursor emissions, including such energy efficient programs as Energy Star Buildings and Homes,  q  q  q  q  q  q   etc. q  MDE will revise the mobile source budget for the Baltimore area and Cecil County to include federal Tier 2 car and light truck emission standards and to process this revision as an amendment to the State Implementation Plan. Region III will provide any requested technical assistance to MDE in these efforts and, upon receipt of this proposed revision to the Maryland State Implementation Plan, will initiate appropriate federal rulemaking actions. Maryland will continue to implement enhanced Vehicle Emissions Inspection Program requirements and the emission repair technician certification program. MDE commits to maintaining a statewide air monitoring network, including monitoring for fine particulate matter and air toxics, and install and operate speciation monitors for fine particulate matter at four sites. Region III will, to the extent possible, provide as much early communication as soon as possible on what monitoring commitments will be proposed each year in the grant narrative and subsequent award(s). This will allow MDE to efficiently and effectively prepare to meet any new grant commitments that may arise. In addition, Region III will provide MDE written confirmation of any statements made or agreements reached that affect the use, management, or availability of grant funds in the area of air quality monitoring. MDE will increase the public's understanding and use and benefits of alternative fuel vehicles. MDE will issue new source permits for major sources to construct and modify and state Clean Air Act Title V permits to operate containing conditions adequate to ensure compliance with air pollution control requirements, including appropriate toxic air pollution controls. Region III, upon receipt of draft permits from MDE, review and provide appropriate comments in a timely manner. Where major issues arise during the course of permit reviews by Region III, Region III promptly notify MDE of the issue(s) either verbally or in writing, so as to begin a dialog at the earliest possible time to resolve the issue(s). MDE will perform routine inspections of regulated facilities in Maryland and respond to citizen complaints about air pollution. MDE will conduct inspections of Stage II facilities. MDE will take appropriate enforcement actions in cases of non-compliance. MDE will continue working with EPA on Acid Rain Program activities. Region III will coordinate with Maryland agencies, other federal agencies and the public-at-large on voluntary programs such as Energy Star Buildings and Homes, Green Lights, etc., and other energy conservation measures to reduce acid rain precursor emissions. Maryland will implement its diesel smoke testing/repair program (effective July 2000). MDE will finalize Maryland's air toxics inventory, which includes emission estimates for area, mobile and stationary sources. Region III will provide and appropriate technical assistance in this endeavor. Region III will also commit to the following to enhance communications and to assure timely responses to MDE's program activities: - Communicate with MDE's Planning Program monthly to provide as much forewarning as possible on any new or changes to existing deadlines established by EPA relative to SIP submittals, SIP commitments and other SIP-related matters.  q  q  q  q  q  q  q  q  q  q  q   - Evaluate State land use strategies for potential air quality benefits in line with EPA policies and provide guidance as necessary in this regard. Asbestos State law establishes licensing requirements for business entities and public units that engage in asbestos removal or encapsulation and accreditation requirements for individuals engaged in certain asbestos occupations involving schools and public buildings. State and federal regulations also establish procedures for the removal and disposal of asbestos materials. A Governor's Executive Order established the Asbestos Oversight Committee (AOC), which addresses imminent health hazards from asbestos in State-owned buildings and ensures proper training for State employees involved in asbestos-related work. The Secretary of MDE serves as the Chairperson of the AOC and ARMA provides staff support. q  Issue asbestos removal licenses and asbestos occupation accreditation to qualified business entities, public units, and individuals. Perform inspections of asbestos removal and/or encapsulation projects in Maryland. Conduct enforcement actions as appropriate. Audit training courses to ensure adequacy of asbestos-related training. Provide training to State employees in asbestos-related work. Provide technical support and assist the AOC in establishing priorities for asbestos abatement in State-owned buildings.  q  q  q  q  q  Natural Wood Waste Natural wood waste poses the potential for difficult to extinguish fires with resultant adverse and noxious air quality impacts. Fires at natural wood waste facilities can pollute the air and affect the health, comfort, and safety of all Maryland residents. To reduce the occurrence of nuisance conditions, health impacts, and air pollution created by smoke from these fires, MDE implements controls through a permitting and enforcement program. These activities include requirements to prevent and minimize fires through effective planning of sire operations and contingency plans, compliance activities to implement these plans, and enforcement activities to penalize those responsible when poor management practices have allowed a fire to occur or worsen. Facilities that manage natural wood waste must comply with the State natural wood waste regulations and operators must obtain a natural wood waste recycling facility permit. The regulations and permits prescribe requirements for fire control and other preventive measures. In FY 2001, MDE is undertaking the following management strategies: q  Continue coordination with the State Fire Marshal's Office to ensure that plans for natural wood waste facilities meet applicable fire prevention standards and have adequate provisions for fighting fires should they occur, and Emphasize fire prevention activities in inspections of unpermitted natural wood waste recycling facilities and prioritize enforcement and cleanup activities at facilities that lack fire prevention and controls. Back to Top  q   RESOURCE DISCUSSION Air Programs In terms of staffing, the single most pressing problem is that of staff turnover. The Planning and Permit programs have suffered the most in this regard. The Planning Program has decreased the number of vacancies it has had over the past twelve months, but a few key vacancies remain, and for the positions that were newly filled it will take some time before performance within those positions match what existed previously. This, coupled with the amount of work needed to be done over the next twelve months in the area of developing regional control measures, preparing the 1999 inventory, updating conformity budgets and developing attainment area boundaries for an eight-hour ozone standard, will present a significant challenge for the Planning Program. Outsourcing of modeling activities to the University of Maryland occurs, and has been occurring for several years. This is expected to continue, as the expertise does not exist in-house. Outsourcing of some inventory work to a contractor has taken place to supplement the efforts of existing staff. More outsourcing may be done in the future. An additional staff position was approved in the FY01 budget for PM-fine activities. As part of its grant commitment with the EPA, the Planning Program performs analyses on ambient air quality data from PAMS monitoring stations in an effort to determine pollutant trends and various data corollaries, such as the relationship between ozone levels and source emissions. Due to data gaps and the short-term nature of some data, these analyses can yield weak conclusions on occasion. Additional, stronger analyses need to be performed at times to provide information that would be more useful in the future in making decisions regarding cost-effective pollution control strategies. Also, there is a need to analyze the data to determine whether any logical reductions in data gathering can occur, such as ceasing to collect ozone data during evening hours when ozone levels are generally non-problematic. These additional analyses require substantial commitment of resources. Regional efforts, where broader and higher volumes of information are available, and the use of outside contractors to examine these data offer the best hope in this regard. Regional bodies, such as NESCAUM and MARAMA, are beginning to examine data on a multi-state scale through the use of outside contractors. More examinations of the data are needed, and the Department encourages the EPA to support such efforts. The Permit Program has several vacancies and has had difficulty filling them in recent times, which is making it difficult to keep up with the workload or to conduct special initiatives, like additional general permits. A lack of sufficient candidates, possibly owing to state pay rates versus those the private sector can offer, has been an issue. Even when candidates are available and offers of employment are eventually made, the person offered employment often declines due to having received a better offer elsewhere. To improve the chances of attracting good candidates, outreach to colleges has been increased and the method of announcing job openings has been broadened. As a stopgap measure, an employee from the Compliance Program has been assigned to the Permits Program to draft permits until staffing levels improve. Also, the services of an outside contractor has been used since February 2000 to help draft 12 Title V permits. The effort will be extended in FY01. Staff is also devoting overtime hours to the drafting of Title V permits. Despite these efforts, the Permits Program is behind in issuing Title V permits and will not meet EPA's goal of having all Title V permits issued by January 1, 2001. Two additional staff engineering positions were approved into the FY01 budget to assist in the Title V effort. These two positions, when filled and after training takes place, will provide a benefit to the program in the latter part of 2001. A third position, a contractual secretary, is being sought through an amendment to the FY01 budget. This too should help improve matters. The delay in issuing Title V permits can not be totally attributed to staffing issues, as there are other factors at play, such as State Implementation Plan deficiencies and the time-consuming need to provide assistance to permit applicants on several very large projects needing construction permits. Effort is underway to develop a plan and a schedule for addressing State Implementation Plan deficiencies, which will allow those permits that are currently unable to be issued to subsequently be issued. Correcting the Plan deficiencies may not be fully complete until the spring of 2001, which means that the ensuing permit issuances will continue into FY02. As part of the 105 grant activities, the Department is conducting inspections at area MACT sources. Dry-cleaning establishments represent the largest source category, with over 500 known   individual sources in Maryland. Twenty percent of these sources will be inspected over the next five years (2/00-2/05) and will be done so by staff within the Compliance Program. In order to accomplish the additional task of inspecting dry-cleaning operations, certain facilities inspected by these staff on a yearly basis in the past will now be inspected every other year or every third year depending on the nature of the facility. A recent change in the area of Stage II inspections will also have an impact on resources. As of July 1, 2000, ARMA is inspecting the 1,500 Stage II facilities in the major metropolitan areas of Maryland. Prior to this, such inspections were conducted by the Department's Waste Management Administration (WAS) in conjunction with their oil operations activities. Due to a change in priorities within WAS, it was mutually agreed that the inspection duties would transfer over to ARMA at the beginning of FY01. One additional staff person has been hired for this effort for a six-month period (which has just expired) and two additional full-time staff positions are being sought (FY01 contractual authorization budget amendment is pending). Until the requested new staff positions are approved and filled, existing Compliance Program staff are performing the inspections. As such, and similar to what is occurring relative to minor MACT sources, further adjustments have been made in the inspection schedules for the universe of non-Stage II facilities normally inspected by the Compliance Program each year. Maryland is to add four PM-fine speciation samplers to its monitoring network in the latter part of 2000. Based on issues that arose with the installation of the more basic PM-fine monitors, it is estimated that operation will commence in 2001. During the first year of the stations' operation, they will be attended to by the University of Maryland and samples will be analyzed by the EPA at a lab in North Carolina. After the first year, the Department will take over the effort. Consideration will need to be given in the FY03 budget to addressing this need, both in terms of positions and funds. A position was added to the FY01 budget to address insufficient staffing levels in the area of quality assurance/quality control of PM-fine sampling data. An assessment will need to be made in FY01 and FY02 as to whether two (one new, one existing) positions are adequate for all QA/QC activities. Natural Wood Waste The natural wood waste recycling program is not specifically funded. Resources from other generalfunded programs are necessary to provide needed activities associated with this program. Functions that are not being adequately performed include responding to increasing numbers of complaints involving natural wood waste recycling facilities. Additional inspectors are needed to provide faster response times on complaints and increase the numbers of natural wood waste recycling facility inspectors. Increased compliance rates could be expected as a result. Back to Top  DATA DISCUSSION Air Programs In terms of meeting the overall goal of providing clean air, much of the data used throughout this document would give the appearance that not much is changing for the better: the number of people living in an ozone nonattainment area has not decreased from year to year, the number of ozone exceedance days is not declining significantly and Maryland's performance compared to other states in the Ozone Transport Region is relatively poor. There is an indication, however, that control programs may be working based on how Maryland is avoiding an ozone exceedance when the air temperature exceeds 90 degrees. Also, the 1990-1996 downward trend for ozone precursor emissions and the major NOx reduction programs and motor vehicle-related improvement measures that have recently been implemented and are on the horizon are further indications that progress is being made.   What is not shown by the current data that has been used to date is the effect ozone transport can have on Maryland's air quality. Currently, one of the principal indicators for whether air quality is improving  that of ozone exceedance days - only shows whether the ozone standard was exceeded. No information is provided to show whether an exceedance may be related to a large degree to ozone being transported into Maryland, which would be helpful to know for long-term planning purposes. To attempt to rectify this deficiency, the Department will begin to evaluate practical approaches to measuring and displaying levels of transported ozone from areas west and southwest of Maryland. Reviewing data from the Shenandoah Park monitoring station, from other monitors not influenced by ozone generated in the Baltimore area and the Washington suburbs and from available upper atmosphere measurements and drawing some correlations between these data and the daily ground-level ozone concentrations is a possible option in this regard. A second deficiency relative to the current data used is that the degree and the pervasiveness of an ozone exceedance are not made evident. Information exists to show whether an ozone exceedance is limited to a single area of the State or whether an exceedance blanketed the entire metropolitan region. Information also exists to show the degree to which the standard was exceeded (maximum value above the standard). Knowing the amount by which an exceedance is above the standard would be useful to know for health concerns purposes, especially if any longterm trend towards very high levels starts to develop. A review of the past data will be undertaken in 2000 to see if it is possible to chart the information mentioned above in a manner that is easily presented and useful to concerned parties. In FY00, the Department began posting on its web site the annual air monitoring report. This report is a summary of air monitoring data, including that for air toxics, collected over the course of the previous calendar year. This effort will continue in the future. The air programs collect emissions data from stationary sources within the State. These data are compiled into an emissions inventory, which serves as the basis for all planning and modeling efforts, as well as a resource for the permit and compliance staffs. The emissions data currently reside in flat file format on an IBM mainframe computer at the Annapolis Data Center. The Department intends to move these data to a PC server in database format, as funds are available. A PC-based system would make correlation between the permit system and the registration database much easier than the current hard copy approach. The initial step to evaluate the tasks and the difficulty level of those tasks to make the conversion is scheduled to occur in FY01 using $100,000 in budgeted funds.

Communication and Coordination II. Dispute Resolution  MDE GOAL #2: ENSURING THAT MARYLANDERS ARE NOT EXPOSED TO UNNECESSARY LEVELS OF RADIATION Under both federal and state law, MDE is charged with ensuring that the public is protected from unnecessary levels of radiation. As such, MDE's major focus is on preventing exposures to radiation. The key areas of emphasis described below relate to (1) licensing and inspecting users of radioactive materials; (2) registering, certifying and inspecting radiation machines, and (3) responses to emergencies involving radioactive materials and transportation activities or nuclear power plant operations. ACCOMPLISHMENTS, STATUS AND TRENDS  X-Ray The number of x-ray machines has been increasing in Maryland at a state of 9-10% per year, creating a corresponding need to increase the number of inspections. Through the end of the second quarter of FY 19999, the X-Ray Division inspection staff did not keep pace with the growth in facility registrations. This resulted in a steadily increasing backlog and a relatively low rate for enforcement actions resolved, particularly for dental and veterinary facilities, which are inspected every 3 years. A major reason for the low rate of resolution of enforcement actions has been the lack of follow-up by inspectors. This has been due in part because of the focus on completing a certain number of inspections and in part because of the high vacancy rate for much of the fiscal year in the X-Ray Division. Those vacancies were filled halfway through the fiscal year, but several months were then necessary for formal and in-house training of the new inspectors. The X-Ray Division's productivity has improved substantially. The Department anticipates that, with a full complement of trained inspectors, the x-ray unit's ability to follow-up and resolve violations will be enhanced in FY 2000. In addition, continued vigilance in acquiring experienced health physicists to fill vacancies and implementing efficient and effective management procedures under the direction of a newly hired division chief, are expected to result in significant improvements in all x-ray performance categories in FY 2000. Another performance measure on which the Department intends to focus more attention is the very poor rate of compliance that has been found among dental x-ray machines. This measure reflects the fact that Department inspectors find significant violations of regulations in the majority of dental facilities that they inspect. These violations include excessive accuracy errors in the equipment, failure to change developing solutions at the proper frequency, and underdeveloped film. Violations of this type normally result in increased patient exposure and represent serious lapses in radiation safety practiced by the violating facility. The poor compliance rate is especially troubling because the facilities are always given notice of the inspection in order to avoid disruption of patient services. The Department will address the compliance rate issue through enhanced enforcement of these types of violations.   III. EnPA Coordination Team IV.

MDE and EPA Goals Goal #1: Ensuring the Air is Safe to Breathe Goal #2: Ensuring that Marylanders Are Not Exposed to Unnecessary Levels of Radiation Goal #3: Ensuring Safe Drinking Water Goal #4: Reducing the Threat to Public Health from the Presence of Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Materials in the Environment Goal #5: Ensuring Water is Clean and Safe for Harvesting of Fish and Shellfish Goal #6: Improving and Protecting Maryland's Water Quality Goal #7: Ensuring Adequate Protection and Restoration of Maryland's Wetland Resources Goal #8: Protecting and Maintaining Maryland's Natural Resource Land Base and Encouraging Smart Growth and Community Revitalization Goal #9: Preventing Pollution and Assisting the Regulated Community with Compliance Goal #10: Utilizing Information Technology to Optimize and Enhance  Radioactive Materials The Department's radioactive materials licensing and inspection activities are carried out under an agreement with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), whereby the NRC's authority with respect to certain types of radioactive materials is transferred to the State and the State program operates in lieu of the federal. The State currently licenses approximately 1000 radioactive materials facilities under this authority. This number has been increasing slightly each year. Inspections of these facilities range from once per year to once every five years, depending on the potential hazard of the radioactive materials activities and the enforcement history of the facility. Maryland's radioactive materials licensing and inspection program is subject to review by the NRC. In order to maintain its Agreement status with the NRC, Maryland's program must be found to be adequate to protect the state health and safety and compatible with the NRC's regulatory program. The determinations of adequacy and compatibility are made following periodic reviews of the State's program by the NRC. These evaluations are called ""Integrated Materials Performance Evaluation Program"" (IMPEP) reviews and are conducted by a team consisting of NRC staff and at least one agreement state member. An IMPEP review of Maryland's program was conducted during March 1999 concluded that Maryland's program is both adequate and compatible. This review is the first one in more than 20 years in which Maryland's program has been found to be both adequate and compatible. In order to be determined to be compatible, a state must adopt federal requirements within 3 years from promulgation by the NRC. During the past review period, the Department has made a concerted effort to be more timely in its adoption of the federal requirements and has succeeded in eliminating the backlog and in finally achieving compatibility with the NRC program. Although the IMPEP review found the Maryland program overall to be adequate to protect public health and safety, there were two specific areas in which the review team found the program to be satisfactory, but with need for improvement. Those two areas were the technical quality of licensing and the sealed source and device evaluation program. The IMPEP team comments are being addressed by the Department through internal reorganization to establish a radioactive materials licensing section head to provide closer supervision of licensing actions and reassignment of another position to the licensing section. The Department is also considering using a consulting service contract to assist in the mechanical analysis of sealed source and device applications.  Back to Top  MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES  FY 2001 There are two key management objectives under this goal. They are:   Environmental and Administrative Operations  Objective 2.1 To implement the radioactive materials licensing and inspection, and radiation machines registration, certification and inspection programs so as to ensure that the public is protected from unnecessary radiation; and, Objective 2.2 To respond rapidly and effectively to accidents/incidents involving nuclear material including nuclear power plant events. Back to Top  II. Maryland DNR and EPA Goals Goal #1: Ensure sustainable populations of living resources and aquatic habitat in the mainstem of the Chesapeake Bay, tidal tributaries, and Coastal Bays Goal #2: Healthy Maryland watershed lands, streams, and non-tidal rivers Goal #3: A natural resources stewardship ethic for Marylanders Goal #4: Vibrant local communities in balance with natural systems Goal #5: Establish a protected statewide network of ecologically valuable private and public lands (Green Infrastructure)  MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AND ACTION PLANS  FY 2001 The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 provides for the licensing and control of the use, storage and disposal of radioactive materials by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and authorizes the NRC to enter into agreements with the states to transfer part of this authority to states so that the state has complete regulatory control over licensees. Maryland is one of 31 Agreement States that have entered into such an agreement as provided in Section 274 of the Act. Maryland became an Agreement State in 1971. Regulations adopted under Title 8 of the Environment Article, Annotated Code of Maryland, are found in COMAR 26.12, Radiation Management. These regulations contain requirements and procedures for the licensing, use, storage and disposal of radioactive materials and the registration and operation of electronic devices that produce radiation. These regulations also specify the qualifications and procedures for the licensing of qualified health physicists to inspect certain radiation machines as part of Maryland's certification program. To implement these laws, MDE is undertaking the following activities. q  q q  q q  APPENDIX q  State/EPA Information Management Efforts Carroll/Camden Environmental Restoration Project EnPA Fiscal Year Realignment Workgroup Status Report - June, 2000 COMMENTS  q  q q  q  ----------PREVIOUS AGREEMENTS FY1999 EnPA FY2000 EnPA  q  License and inspect users of radioactive materials to ensure compliance with license conditions imposed by the State and State regulations that are consistent with the Agreement State compatibility requirement with the NRC.

If requested, EPA Region III will participate in Maryland Emergency radiation response exercises, as well as respond to any calls or requests involving actual or potential releases of radiation; and Require municipal and commercial medical waste incinerators to monitor for radioactive materials in incoming waste streams, and to manage regulated radioactive materials appropriately. Back to Top   RESOURCE DISCUSSION Increasing workload brought on by increases in the number of regulated facilities and enforcement pressures have stressed the staff resources in the Radiological Health Program in both the x-ray and radioactive materials areas. In radioactive materials, in particular, one facility with substantial compliance problems has required numerous hours of staff time to prepare for and participate in several simultaneous enforcement actions, including a major court case. Personnel within the program have multiple responsibilities and the need to devote significant amounts of time to one facility necessarily detracts from other duties. The same is true in the x-ray program where an increased emphasis on compliance could affect the number of inspections that can be completed. An additional factor that contributes to the Department's being able to achieve its goals is the recruitment and retention of qualified staff. Technological advances in the fields of radiography, teletherapy, mammography, dentistry, etc. dictate the need for high level and continuous training of the licensing and inspection staff. The Department has found it increasingly difficult to fill positions with qualified people when vacancies occur and the learning curve before those newly hired individuals are productive is becoming increasingly long. The x-ray program, in particular, has suffered from chronic vacancies in inspector positions. That program now has a full complement of inspectors. The Department will continue its evaluation of this program throughout FY 2000 to determine the adequacy of the staffing level. Funding for the Radiological Health Program comes from a combination of general funds and special funds. Special funds come from the Radiation Control Fund, which consists of license, certification, and registration fees and penalties. A small amount of support is provided for inspection of mammography machines under a contract with the Food and Drug Administration. With the exception of dental facilities, fees were recently raised to more closely reflect the costs associated with administering the license programs. Fees for dental facilities are capped by statute and may not be raised without a statutory change. Current funding should support the existing level of effort for the programs. DATA DISCUSSION The Radiological Health Program currently maintains its licensing and compliance databases using Paradox software. The Department intends to convert these databases into the Department's planned enterprise system. Initial steps for this conversion were scheduled to begin in FY 2000.

Authority  MDE GOAL #3: ENSURING SAFE DRINKING WATER Under federal and state laws and regulations, MDE is responsible for ensuring that all public drinking water systems throughout Maryland meet strict drinking water quality standards. Public drinking water system serves at least fifteen service connections or regularly serves at least twenty-five individuals. Public drinking water system serve approximately 4.3 million Marylanders, or about 84% of the total population of the State, (based on 5.1 million) so it essential that our groundwater and surface water resources are protected. Private wells serve fewer than twenty-five individuals on a regular basis. The wells may serve one home, or be shared by a few homes or businesses. Individual wells, which serve one lot or home, are regulated by local governments through delegation from MDE. Key areas of emphasis for ensuring safe drinking water include implementing various programs to protect: 1) public drinking water supplies, (1A) source water protection and (1B) groundwater, and other programs such as 2) oil pollution prevention, and 3) solid waste management. Also, in its FY2001 management strategies and actions plans, MDE is addressing the emerging issue of contamination from Methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) in public drinking water supplies and private wells. ACCOMPLISHMENTS, STATUS AND TRENDS  IV. Scope of the Agreement V. Guiding Principles for Protecting Maryland's Citizens and Natural Resources VI. Strategic Priorities CHAPTER 2: REVIEW OF FY 2000 COMMITMENTS AND FY 2001 & 2002 NEW INITIATIVES FY 2000 Enforcement and Compliance Activities Review of FY 2000 Workgroup Efforts FY 2001 & 2002  Source Water Protection Unsafe drinking water can have immediate consequences of widespread diseases, sickness, and even death to vulnerable members of our communities. Long term exposure to other contaminants at unsafe levels may increase the occurrence of cancer. High levels of lead in water can increase blood lead levels. Maryland has experienced no waterborne disease outbreaks attributable to unsafe water in recent years. However, more stringent federal standards have created the current situation in which many individual public systems must upgrade their treatment process and operations in order to be in full compliance with all applicable requirements. The number of new systems that are regulated has grown by over 200 water systems in FY 1999 versus a normal annual increase of approximately 50 systems. The increase in regulated systems results in a comparable increase in violations and enforcement actions. The compliance rate for public water systems in significant compliance has gradually increased over the past few years. A large percentage of Maryland's smaller public water systems (e.g., restaurants and campgrounds) are regulated by county environmental health departments. In FY 1999 Maryland made significant progress in achieving more uniform oversight of these systems by initiating new delegation agreements with standard operating procedures with corresponding funding to county health departments. Groundwater The groundwater discharge permits (industrial and municipal) portion of this goal reflects an increase in the number of inspections conducted during FY 1999 and the associated enforcement actions also indicate a slight increase. The compliance rate for groundwater discharge permits remains at 97%.   New Initiatives  Private Drinking Water Supplies CHAPTER 3: ADMINISTERING THE AGREEMENT I. Communication and Coordination II.

MDE and EPA Goals Goal #1: Ensuring the Air is Safe to Breathe Goal #2: Ensuring that Marylanders Are Not Exposed to Unnecessary Levels of Radiation Goal #3: Ensuring Safe Drinking Water Goal #4: Reducing the Threat to Public Health from the Presence of Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Materials in the Environment Goal #5: Ensuring Water is Clean and Safe for Harvesting of Fish and Shellfish Goal #6: Improving and Protecting  While the number of individual wells drilled during FY 1999 remained relatively constant compared to prior years, it is possible that the projected drought conditions during summer of 1999 (FY 2000) may result in a significant increase in the need for new wells to be drilled. Oil Pollution Prevention Oil pollution resulting from unlawful spills, discharges or leaking storage tanks can cause groundwater and surface water contamination, which, in turn, could impact public health through drinking water supplies. Housing and economic development can decline in areas that become contaminated from oil due to the reduced value of real estate and perceived or real contamination. Under Maryland Law and regulation (and as provided by Subtitle I of RCRA for Underground Storage Tanks), MDE is responsible for regulating all oil-related activities, including aboveground and underground oil storage facilities, oil-contaminated soil treatment facilities, and oil transportation and for overseeing remediation activities at sites where petroleum products have been discharged. In addition, MDE oversees the installation, maintenance, operation and removal of underground storage tanks (UST's) and investigates complaints of illegal dumping and improper handling of oil. Through MDE's compliance and remediation activities, the use of substandard oil storage systems is reduced, oil storage systems are upgraded with pollution prevention devices, and cleanups of sites impacted by oil are expedited. The prevention of oil releases reduces the public's exposure to contaminated drinking water supplies and reduces the need for costly site cleanups. MDE's strengths include our ability to work with site-specific conditions and to provide direct oversight to responsible parties. Our cooperative working relationship with industry, tank owners, and the public enhances our ability to accomplish this goal. A potential weakness in accomplishing our goal is the availability of public and private funding. The ability of responsible parties to fund cleanups and availability of State budget resources to fund MDE oversight, inspections, and state lead activities directly impact the activities needed to accomplish this goal. In FY2000, the Oil Control program continued to direct resources to respond to the impact of the 1998 UST upgrade deadline. These efforts focused on ensuring that tanks taken out of service rather than upgraded where property taken out of service and subsequently removed from the ground or abandoned in place. In addition, the removal activity generated additional confirmed releases into the environment, which increased the total active leaking underground storage tank sites requiring direct oversight. The Oil Control Program has several new challenges, which may delay continued progress toward reaching prescribed targets. The expected drop off in new releases anticipated following the 1998 deadline has yet to occur. The number of releases from existing heating fuel storage tanks which are not subject to the 1998 deadline have averaged over 400 new releases over the last three years. The number of domestic wells impacted by MTBE stands at 228 as of April 2000, and continues to rise. Defining the extent of the MTBE problem is a major priority and is further discussed in the Management Strategies and Action Plans section. New legislation also expanded the eligibility criteria for cleanup reimbursement funds to cover releases of heating fuel form both commercial and residential heating fuel tanks, both above and underground. Even with these new challenges, there has been progress in several areas as described below: q  As of May 2000, Maryland's compliance with the 1998 upgrade requirements reached 89.3%, and through a compliance assistance review project it has been determined that the remaining systems not declared compliant are either scheduled for proper closure or the   Maryland's Water Quality Goal #7: Ensuring Adequate Protection and Restoration of Maryland's Wetland Resources Goal #8: Protecting and Maintaining Maryland's Natural Resource Land Base and Encouraging Smart Growth and Community Revitalization Goal #9: Preventing Pollution and Assisting the Regulated Community with Compliance Goal #10: Utilizing Information Technology to Optimize and Enhance Environmental and Administrative Operations  q  q  database record has the system incorrectly listed as out of compliance. The Oil Contaminated Site Environmental Cleanup Fund has assisted responsible parties in accomplishing clean-ups of old, leaking UST's. Over 121 applications were approved with UST owners having been reimbursed a total of $6,958,513. Until loan closure deadline of December 31, 1998, 97 low-interest loans from the UST Upgrade and Replacement Fund provided approximately $5 million to tank owners to assist them in meeting the 1998 EPA requirements requiring UST's to be protected from corrosion and have overfill/spill prevention installed.  Solid Waste Management Under State law and in accordance with Subtitle D of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), MDE regulates the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of municipal solid waste facilities in the State. The Solid Waste Program strives to protect public health and the environment from the adverse impacts that solid waste can have on drinking water supplies by ensuring that permitted solid waste facilities are designed and operated in compliance with all applicable water pollution control requirements. The impacts caused by poor waste disposal practices include: q q  pollution of groundwater which many Marylanders rely on for drinking water supplies; and pollution of surface water, with the potential for impacting drinking supplies including many of the larger municipalities in Maryland (e.g., Baltimore City).  Polluted water resources affect public health and safety; restrict development and growth, and have adverse economic impacts on Maryland. To reduce the risk of health impacts, water pollution, and nuisance conditions that can be created by solid waste facilities, MDE implements controls to minimize the release of pollutants from these facilities through a permitting and enforcement program. MDE's solid waste management activities include issuing permits for the State's 21 municipal landfills, performing over 600 inspections annually to ensure that solid wastes are managed properly, and ensuring that closed landfills are properly capped and monitored for a 30year post closure period. Before a landfill permit is issued, the proposed site of the landfill is subject to a comprehensive assessment that encompasses a wide variety of scientific and technical disciplines. The program requires the incorporation of effective pollution prevention and control systems into site designs, planning for site operations, contingency plans, and monitoring systems and conducts inspections to ensure these systems are in place and functioning properly. Other State and local agencies are involved early in the permit review process to ensure that all environmental and regulatory requirements are met. The environmental performance of landfills is assessed through MDE's review of groundwater monitoring data, soil gas monitoring data, and surface water monitoring data. The Solid Waste Program is in the process of redrafting solid waste regulations to accommodate federal requirements. As the federal regulations governing municipal landfills came into being after the current state regulations were developed, some of our requirements are out-of-date. Changing our regulations will give us the opportunity to streamline and update our requirements to include recent changes in State law. MDE's solid waste management strategies have been consistently applied over many years, and have demonstrated major improvements which are obvious when contrasting the waste disposal in Maryland in 1980, and even 1990, with the situation today. For example, there are fewer active municipal landfills, but more active rubble landfills and other types of facilities, than there were 10 or 20 years ago. However, the older, inactive facilities still exist, and require monitoring and inspection. As communities expand to include areas that were previously largely undeveloped, homes and businesses are being sited much nearer to these older landfills. Program responsibility for monitoring and ensuring proper groundwater remediation at these facilities will continue for many years.

Maryland DNR and EPA Goals Goal #1: Ensure sustainable populations of living resources and aquatic habitat in the mainstem of the Chesapeake Bay, tidal tributaries, and Coastal Bays Goal #2: Healthy Maryland watershed lands, streams, and nontidal rivers   Goal #3: A natural resources stewardship ethic for Marylanders Goal #4: Vibrant local communities in balance with natural systems Goal #5: Establish a protected statewide network of ecologically valuable private and public lands (Green Infrastructure)  the Program's workload, including case tracking, has improved our performance by identifying areas in which we are being successful, the areas where we have weaknesses, and the causes of those weaknesses. Additional staffing is needed for the review of landfill groundwater monitoring data and for gathering technical information concerning old landfill sites to answer many inquiries received. Staff turnover has also reduced performance in this area. In FY 2000, all but one of the operating municipal waste landfills in the State were in compliance with groundwater standards (e.g., have no significant release, or if a release has been identified, a remedial plan has been approved by MDE). All operating municipal solid waste landfills are now equipped with liners and leachate collection systems to prevent the migration of landfill contaminants from entering surface and groundwaters. MDE implemented regulations that require liners and leachate collection systems in all operating rubble landfills by July 2001, or they must close. The regulated community is midway to the goal of shifting to the use of lined rubble landfills and it is anticipated that this deadline will be met. Several currently operating rubble landfills have decided to close rather than comply with the liner and leachate collection system requirements. Other trends included the following:  APPENDIX State/EPA Information Management Efforts Carroll/Camden Environmental Restoration Project EnPA Fiscal Year Realignment Workgroup Status Report - June, 2000 COMMENTS  q  Over 100 investigations of solid waste complaints from citizens and other stakeholders were conducted. The number and percentage of groundwater monitoring reports for landfills reviewed decreased due to staff shortages and turnover. This is an area of strategic weakness, which needs to be addressed. The number of compliance assistance events for solid waste activities increased due to greater staff familiarity with the need and methods for collection of compliance assistance data and improved information capture techniques.  q  q  GOAL PERFORMANCE DATA Unsafe drinking water can have immediate consequences of widespread diseases, sickness, and even death to vulnerable members of our communities. Long term exposure to other contaminants at unsafe levels may increase the occurrence of cancer. High levels of lead in water can increase blood lead levels. Maryland has experienced no waterborne disease outbreaks attributable to unsafe water in recent years. However, more stringent federal standards have created the current situation in which many individual public systems must upgrade their treatment process and operations in order to be in full compliance with all applicable requirements. The number of new systems that are regulated has grown by over 200 water systems in FY 1999 versus a normal annual increase of approximately 50 systems. The increase in regulated systems results in a comparable increase in violations and enforcement actions. The compliance rate for public water systems in significant compliance has gradually increased over the past few years. A large percentage of Maryland's smaller public water systems (e.g., restaurants and campgrounds) are regulated by county environmental health departments. In FY 1999 Maryland made significant progress in achieving more uniform oversight of these systems by initiating new delegation agreements with standard operating procedures with corresponding funding to county health departments. Groundwater The groundwater discharge permits (industrial and municipal) portion of this goal reflects an increase in the number of inspections conducted during FY 1999 and the associated enforcement actions also indicate a slight increase. The compliance rate for groundwater discharge permits remains at 97%.  ----------PREVIOUS AGREEMENTS FY1999 EnPA FY2000 EnPA   Private Drinking Water Supplies While the number of individual wells drilled during FY 1999 remained relatively constant compared to prior years, it is possible that the projected drought conditions during summer of 1999 (FY 2000) may result in a significant increase in the need for new wells to be drilled. Oil Pollution Prevention Oil pollution resulting from unlawful spills, discharges or leaking storage tanks can cause groundwater and surface water contamination, which, in turn, could impact public health through drinking water supplies. Housing and economic development can decline in areas that become contaminated from oil due to the reduced value of real estate and perceived or real contamination. Under Maryland Law and regulation (and as provided by Subtitle I of RCRA for Underground Storage Tanks), MDE is responsible for regulating all oil-related activities, including aboveground and underground oil storage facilities, oil-contaminated soil treatment facilities, and oil transportation and for overseeing remediation activities at sites where petroleum products have been discharged. In addition, MDE oversees the installation, maintenance, operation and removal of underground storage tanks (UST's) and investigates complaints of illegal dumping and improper handling of oil. Through MDE's compliance and remediation activities, the use of substandard oil storage systems is reduced, oil storage systems are upgraded with pollution prevention devices, and cleanups of sites impacted by oil are expedited. The prevention of oil releases reduces the public's exposure to contaminated drinking water supplies and reduces the need for costly site cleanups. MDE's strengths include our ability to work with site-specific conditions and to provide direct oversight to responsible parties. Our cooperative working relationship with industry, tank owners, and the public enhances our ability to accomplish this goal. A potential weakness in accomplishing our goal is the availability of public and private funding. The ability of responsible parties to fund cleanups and availability of State budget resources to fund MDE oversight, inspections, and state lead activities directly impact the activities needed to accomplish this goal. In FY2000, the Oil Control program continued to direct resources to respond to the impact of the 1998 UST upgrade deadline. These efforts focused on ensuring that tanks taken out of service rather than upgraded where property taken out of service and subsequently removed from the ground or abandoned in place. In addition, the removal activity generated additional confirmed releases into the environment, which increased the total active leaking underground storage tank sites requiring direct oversight. The Oil Control Program has several new challenges, which may delay continued progress toward reaching prescribed targets. The expected drop off in new releases anticipated following the 1998 deadline has yet to occur. The number of releases from existing heating fuel storage tanks which are not subject to the 1998 deadline have averaged over 400 new releases over the last three years. The number of domestic wells impacted by MTBE stands at 228 as of April 2000, and continues to rise. Defining the extent of the MTBE problem is a major priority and is further discussed in the Management Strategies and Action Plans section. New legislation also expanded the eligibility criteria for cleanup reimbursement funds to cover releases of heating fuel form both commercial and residential heating fuel tanks, both above and underground. Even with these new challenges, there has been progress in several areas as described below: q  q  As of May 2000, Maryland's compliance with the 1998 upgrade requirements reached 89.3%, and through a compliance assistance review project it has been determined that the remaining systems not declared compliant are either scheduled for proper closure or the database record has the system incorrectly listed as out of compliance. The Oil Contaminated Site Environmental Cleanup Fund has assisted responsible parties in accomplishing clean-ups of old, leaking UST's. Over 121 applications were approved with   q  UST owners having been reimbursed a total of $6,958,513. Until loan closure deadline of December 31, 1998, 97 low-interest loans from the UST Upgrade and Replacement Fund provided approximately $5 million to tank owners to assist them in meeting the 1998 EPA requirements requiring UST's to be protected from corrosion and have overfill/spill prevention installed.  Solid Waste Management Under State law and in accordance with Subtitle D of the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), MDE regulates the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of municipal solid waste facilities in the State. The Solid Waste Program strives to protect public health and the environment from the adverse impacts that solid waste can have on drinking water supplies by ensuring that permitted solid waste facilities are designed and operated in compliance with all applicable water pollution control requirements. The impacts caused by poor waste disposal practices include: q q  pollution of groundwater which many Marylanders rely on for drinking water supplies; and pollution of surface water, with the potential for impacting drinking supplies including many of the larger municipalities in Maryland (e.g., Baltimore City).  Polluted water resources affect public health and safety; restrict development and growth, and have adverse economic impacts on Maryland. To reduce the risk of health impacts, water pollution, and nuisance conditions that can be created by solid waste facilities, MDE implements controls to minimize the release of pollutants from these facilities through a permitting and enforcement program. MDE's solid waste management activities include issuing permits for the State's 21 municipal landfills, performing over 600 inspections annually to ensure that solid wastes are managed properly, and ensuring that closed landfills are properly capped and monitored for a 30year post closure period. Before a landfill permit is issued, the proposed site of the landfill is subject to a comprehensive assessment that encompasses a wide variety of scientific and technical disciplines. The program requires the incorporation of effective pollution prevention and control systems into site designs, planning for site operations, contingency plans, and monitoring systems and conducts inspections to ensure these systems are in place and functioning properly. Other State and local agencies are involved early in the permit review process to ensure that all environmental and regulatory requirements are met. The environmental performance of landfills is assessed through MDE's review of groundwater monitoring data, soil gas monitoring data, and surface water monitoring data. The Solid Waste Program is in the process of redrafting solid waste regulations to accommodate federal requirements. As the federal regulations governing municipal landfills came into being after the current state regulations were developed, some of our requirements are out-of-date. Changing our regulations will give us the opportunity to streamline and update our requirements to include recent changes in State law. MDE's solid waste management strategies have been consistently applied over many years, and have demonstrated major improvements which are obvious when contrasting the waste disposal in Maryland in 1980, and even 1990, with the situation today. For example, there are fewer active municipal landfills, but more active rubble landfills and other types of facilities, than there were 10 or 20 years ago. However, the older, inactive facilities still exist, and require monitoring and inspection. As communities expand to include areas that were previously largely undeveloped, homes and businesses are being sited much nearer to these older landfills. Program responsibility for monitoring and ensuring proper groundwater remediation at these facilities will continue for many years. The use of technology, particularly the use of computers and advanced software to assist in tracking the Program's workload, including case tracking, has improved our performance by identifying areas in which we are being successful, the areas where we have weaknesses, and the causes of those weaknesses. Additional staffing is needed for the review of landfill groundwater monitoring data and   for gathering technical information concerning old landfill sites to answer many inquiries received. Staff turnover has also reduced performance in this area. In FY 2000, all but one of the operating municipal waste landfills in the State were in compliance with groundwater standards (e.g., have no significant release, or if a release has been identified, a remedial plan has been approved by MDE). All operating municipal solid waste landfills are now equipped with liners and leachate collection systems to prevent the migration of landfill contaminants from entering surface and groundwaters. MDE implemented regulations that require liners and leachate collection systems in all operating rubble landfills by July 2001, or they must close. The regulated community is midway to the goal of shifting to the use of lined rubble landfills and it is anticipated that this deadline will be met. Several currently operating rubble landfills have decided to close rather than comply with the liner and leachate collection system requirements. Other trends included the following: q  Over 100 investigations of solid waste complaints from citizens and other stakeholders were conducted. The number and percentage of groundwater monitoring reports for landfills reviewed decreased due to staff shortages and turnover. This is an area of strategic weakness, which needs to be addressed. The number of compliance assistance events for solid waste activities increased due to greater staff familiarity with the need and methods for collection of compliance assistance data and improved information capture techniques.  q  q  Percent of Marylanders Served by Community Groundwater Systems with Active Wellhead Protection Programs In Place   Marylanders Served by Surface Systems with Source Protection Programs in Place  Back to Top  MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES  FY 2001  The key management objectives under this goal are: Objective 3.1 To ensure compliance of public water systems with all federal and State requirements; Objective 3.2 To ensure that private wells used by Marylanders comply with state regulations;   Objective 3.3 To prevent pollutant contamination of potable surface waters; Objective 3.4 To fully develop and implement source protection programs for all public drinking water systems that receive water from surface sources; Objective 3.5 To prevent contamination of potable groundwater aquifers that are vulnerable to underground hydrological transport mechanisms; Objective 3.6 To develop locally based wellhead protection programs to ensure long-term viability of supply sources; Objective 3.7 To ensure that municipal landfills operate in significant compliance with all State and federal laws and standards; Objective 3.8 To ensure that permitted solid waste facilities are designed and operated in significant compliance with all applicable water pollution control requirements; Objective 3.9 To initiate and complete cleanups of sites impacted by discharge of oil or other hazardous substances; and, Objective 3.10 To manage the State's water resources to ensure adequate quantity for the future. Back to Top  MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AND ACTION PLANS  FY 2001 Source Water Protection Key activities related to source water protection include developing a source to water protection include developing a source water assessment program that is consistent with the 1996 Amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act and managing withdrawal of water resources. This requires the delineation of source water assessment areas, identifying potential sources of contaminants, conducting a susceptibility analysis of the source to those contaminants and allocating water usage in Maryland. EPA approved Maryland's Source Water Assessment Program in November 1999. Other strategies include building partnerships with local governments, federal government, agricultural interests, river basin commissions, and neighboring states to implement source water assessment and protection programs, and to conserve water resources in Maryland. Also, enhancing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) data to allow for comprehensive review of potential contaminant sources with on source water assessment areas. Finally, MDE will administer the State Revolving Fund )SRF) set-aside dollars to fund source water assessment projects, acquisition to sensitive lands and wellhead protection projects. Pollution prevention is a part of the strategy to protect source water. Efforts include land or easement purchases through a loan program, a pilot conservation plan with an education component, and utilization of land use planning tolls like wellhead protection ordinances. EPA will continue to provide support to the SRF financing of non-traditional water quality activities and coordinate SRF programs with Maryland's comprehensive watershed management program and place-based initiatives. Drought   The first meetings of the Advisory Committee on Water Conservation and the technical Committee on Water Supply Infrastructure were held on April 26, 2000 at MDE. The two advisory committees were established by gubernatorial executive order, following last year's drought emergency. They will assist the state in developing and implementing long-term water conservation policies and programs. The Water Conservation Advisory Committee is comprised of members appointed by the Governor to represent state and local government, major water suppliers, environmental interest organizations, business, farming, public education, and the general public. This committee will examine current practices, procedures and policies across Maryland for conserving water supplies, and recommend short and long-term planning which will enhance the state's preparedness and ability to respond to future drought emergencies. Some suggested outcomes include: q q  q  Recommend a statewide Drought Response Action Plan for future droughts. Recommend a new statewide barometer for measuring drought conditions/severity that includes triggers for drought response. Differing drought conditions in geographic regions of the state may necessitate geographic differences in drought responses. Develop a process for granting variances/exceptions. Determine how Maryland's response plan should be coordinate with local drought/emergency response plans, regional agencies (i.e., SRBC, ICPRC, etc.) And neighboring states. The Technical Advisory Committee on Water Supply Infrastructure is comprised of members appointed by the Governor to represent state and local government agencies involved in water supply and resources management, technical experts with planning design and engineering expertise and others with relevant interest and expertise. This committee will study the impact of infrastructure deficiencies on water conservation and recommend and prioritize infrastructure improvements to minimize water loss. Some suggested outcomes include: r  q q  q  r r  r r  Recommend criteria for requiring water utilities to address failing infrastructure (i.e., assessments and improvements to leaking distribution systems within cost-effective guidelines). Recommend policy for interconnection of adjacent water supply systems. Recommend guidance for local utility self-assessments on adequacy of water supply systems to sustain service during periods of drought (i.e., are alternate supplies available, what is the condition and extent of storage, how are supply storage capacities managed to meet average/peak demands and to respond to drought emergencies). Recommend policy for interconnection of adjacent water supply systems. Determine if funding mechanisms are needed.  Treatment System Compliance Treatment system compliance is assured through a variety of activities, including: q q q  q q  q q  On-site technical assistance (e.g., Comprehensive performance Evaluations (CPE's) Sanitary surveys program; Annual solicitation, rating, and ranking of Drinking Water Projects to be considered for funding under the Drinking Water SRF Program./ Provision of financial assistance (e.g., grants and drinking water SRF loans); Capacity Development Assessments to ensure projects targeted for financial assistance have the technical, managerial, and institutional resources for effective operations. Support of operator training; and. Enforcement against water systems that are not insignificant compliance with state and federal standards.  Private Drinking Water Supplies Work with local county health departments to educate the public to identify risks to individual wells   and private well systems from natural or man-made contaminants. Establish criteria for well construction. Oil Control Program In FY 2001, the Oil Control Program will strive to ensure proper data collection and management and target inspections on non-compliant storage systems. In addition, the Program will strive to achieve all Government Performance Review Act (GPRA) goals set EPA grant work-plans including: q q q  Increase the number of clean-ups completed; Achieve 93% of active UST's meeting upgrade goals; and Increase UST's in-compliance with release detection regulations.  In FY 2001, the fee that supports oil related activities in the State was scheduled to be reduced by 33 1/3 percent. However, on May 18, 2000, Governor Glendening signed legislation that eliminated the reduction and raised the current fee from 1.5 cents per barrel to 2 cents per barrel. The bill also added an additional 1 cent per barrel fee to be directed for the next five years to the Oil Contaminated Site Environmental Cleanup and Reimbursement Program, the scope of which was expanded to include reimbursements for costs associated with releases from commercial and residential heating fuel tanks. Solid Waste Program In FY2001, the Solid Waste Program will: q  q  Attempt to ensure that permitted solid waste facilities are designed and operated in compliance with all applicable water pollution control requirements. Act to prevent and control the release of pollutants through the review of proposed disposal site locations, preventive engineering, pollution control technologies, review of construction, illegal site interdiction, and remedial activities.  To implement these strategies, MDE will continue the following: q  q  q q  q  q  q  Notify and seek input from County Health Departments, Natural Resources Conservation Districts, appropriate federal agencies, and other interested programs within MDE on applications for solid waste facilities; Require that regulated facilities be designed and operated with at least the minimum requirements established in regulation for pollution prevention and control; Routinely perform unannounced inspections of refuse disposal and other solid waste facilities. Oversight of operating permits for the State's 25 active municipal landfills and other solid waste facilities; Perform inspections annually to ensure landfills and other solid waste facilities are managed properly; Ensure that closed municipal landfills are properly capped and monitored for a 30 year post closure period; and Request funding through a budget initiative for staff for FY 2002 to review landfill groundwater monitoring data, to provide technical customer assistance concerning groundwater and water quality conditions at landfill sites, and to conduct inspections of solid waste facilities.  Emergency Response MDE maintains an Emergency Response Division whose responsibility is to work with local jurisdictions and industries to respond to emergency spills of oil and hazardous substances that endanger drinking water supplies. Details for this program can be found in Goal #4. Methyl tertiary butyl either (MTBE)   Methyl tertiary butyl either (MTBE) is a fuel additive used as an octane enhancer since the early 1970's when lead was being phased out of gasoline. MTBE is used in oxygenated and reformulated gasolines as an air quality control measure. In recent years, MTBE has been found in 5 to 10 percent of public drinking water supplies in the United States. Private wells is also of concern regarding MTBE, although data is lacking. An EPA Blue Ribbon Panel has recommended that the use of MTBE should be substantially reduced because it can contaminate drinking water. EPA has endorsed the Panel's findings adding that significant cuts in MTBE use should be achieved as quickly as possible. MDE has developed both a short-term and long-term strategy to evaluate the extent of MTBE contamination in Maryland. The plan includes: q  compiling existing data on MTBE and identifying gaps within MDE programs to further define the extent of contamination; collecting data on MTBE contamination and identifying probable sources of known MTBE contamination; developing recommendations for other State and local agencies to include testing for MTBE in conjunction with other mandated testing; targeting environmentally sensitive areas for more frequent sampling; and providing information to further educate the general public.  q  q  q  MDE will work with EPA, other States, and fuel suppliers as EPA addresses its Blue Ribbon Panel's recommendations to phase-out MTBE in gasoline. Additional funding and staff resources have been obtained via the signing of legislation to begin a more complete evaluation of the water quality concerns associated with MTBE. Emergency legislation signed during the 2000 legislative session created a MTBE Task Force consisting of 16 members from various governments, petroleum industry, health-related professionals, and the ethanol industry. The Task Force's preliminary report is due 12/01/2000, with a final report due before 12/01/01. The Task force will assess environmental and health risks associated with ground and surface water contamination by MTBE, examine efforts concerning MTBE contamination, make recommendations regarding risks associated with MTBE contamination, and explore other alternatives to MTBE. In support of Maryland's efforts to: (1) protect ground and surface water used to supply public water systems (source water protection) from contamination, and (2) ensure compliance of public water systems (PWS) with all federal and State requirements, EPA Region III will do the following:  1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9.  Provide MDE with timely electronic and paper copies of proposed and final drinking water rules and guidance for use in commenting and implementation. Provide MDE with timely comments on draft and proposed MDE drinking water rules, regulations and primacy packages submitted to EPA for comment and approval. Consult with MDE regarding primacy extension agreements and provide documents and comments in a timely manner. Provide timely and relevant comments on drinking water and drinking water state revolving fund work plans associated with federal grants. Continue to provide federal funding to support MDE's Safe Drinking Water Act activities, which includes source water protection and compliance assistance. Consult with MDE and take appropriate and timely enforcement actions on PWS's from the Exceptions list. Continue to assist and refer citizen inquires regarding private wells to MDE. Continue to work collaboratively with MDE on burden reduction proposals and allow MDE to utilize the pertinent programmatic portion of the MFR Workplan as the basis for its annual federal grant application. Participate in the upcoming Fall, 2000 meeting with MDE to review the federal grant guidance (Public Water System Supervision Program, Maryland Grant Workplan Guidance, June, 2000   10.  Final) to determine the activities and requirements that are set by regulation and statute for integration into the MFR Workplan and compliance in FFY2001 by MDE's Water Supply Program. Continue to work with Maryland using the SNC process to address both exceptions and new SNCs. High priority areas include: compliance with microbial rules (such as total coliform), compliance with surface water treatment rules, and compliance with lead and copper rules in schools that exceeded the action levels initially. Provide support to Maryland in seeking primacy for the Consumer Confidence Report Program, among other primacy requirements. Back to Top  11.  RESOURCE DISCUSSION Within the Water Management Administration, the federal Public Water System Supervision Grant and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund support a large portion of the staffing costs under this goal. General funds provide the required match. The Solid Waste Program's principal weaknesses include a lack of resources due to statutory reliance on general funds, inability to obtain legislative approval to impose permit fees for solid waste facilities, and a large and complex workload. In addition, the Program lacks staff to maintain landfill files. The Oil Control Program will seek additional EPA support for assistance in resolving the data entry backlog associated with UST Access (described below.) DATA DISCUSSION MDE's drinking water data is maintained in an Oracle 7 database. The database accommodates data pertaining to water system characteristics, ownership, permits, operations, water treatment plants, treatment methods, and geo-referenced well data. The database also contains bacteriologic, chemical, and radiological sampling results for all public water supplies as well as lists of certified operators, samplers, and laboratories. The database applications allow for: 1) tracking of all required chemical, radiological, and bacteriological monitoring, 2) tracking of all inspection, violation, and enforcement actions, 3) tracking system compliance with EPA Total Coliform Rule, Lead and Copper Rule, and Surface Water Treatment Rule, 4) electronic reporting of water system inventory, violation/enforcement actions and other data required by the federal Environmental Protection Agency's State Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS) data system. In 1999, the drinking water data was directly linked with a Geographic Information System (GIS). A networked GIS server was created which holds all available and relevant geographic information for source water assessment and protection efforts including contaminant sources, digital topographic and image base maps, watershed boundaries and wellhead protection area boundaries. The information will be shared with local communities, other State programs and agencies to help develop effective source water protection programs. The Solid Waste Program has existed as a regulatory entity for over 85 years and regulates facilities that can have active lives of many decades in length and MDE maintains a tremendous amount of this historical data by hard copy. In FY 2001, MDE intends to integrate data from the drinking water program, the oil program and the solid waste management program into the Department's Enterprise Data System (See Goal #10), and allow greater public access to this information. The Oil Control Program is utilizing the EPA developed program UST Access to track registration information and is still in the process of manually transferring files from the previous database to UST Access. In planning for the transition, the UST data to be entered into the system was to come from   newly submitted registration data from UST owners. The registration data on active systems worked well, however, a large number of UST owners did not resubmit registration information for closed UST systems and a smaller number failed to re-register active systems. This has created a backlog of data needing entry into the system. Therefore, the Program intends to request additional EPA support for either additional data entry or computer technical support to transfer the data from the old system into the new.

Strategic Priorities CHAPTER 2: REVIEW OF FY 2000 COMMITMENTS AND FY 2001 & 2002 NEW INITIATIVES FY 2000 Enforcement and Compliance Activities Review of FY 2000 Workgroup Efforts FY 2001 & 2002 New Initiatives CHAPTER 3: ADMINISTERING THE AGREEMENT I. Communication and Coordination  Childhood lead poisoning is a critical environmental health issue and is generally preventable. There are major initiatives at both the State and federal levels to effect lead risk reduction and to ultimately eliminate lead poisoning in children. MDE investigates cases of childhood lead poisoning referred through the MDE Childhood Lead Registry and has been regulating lead abatement activities since 1988. Under the Maryland Lead Poisoning Prevention Act of 1994, MDE tracks and reports the number of lead paint hazard treatments undertaken each year. The Program administers lead poisoning prevention and lead paint abatement services accreditation, maintains a residential rental property registry, conducts paint surveys of residential buildings as part of investigations of lead poisoned children, and educates health care providers and the general public on lead poisoning prevention. Note: Data concerning blood lead screening and lead poisoning is collected by calendar year, is reported to MDE over the first few months of the following year, is evaluated and analyzed over the following several months, and is available in late summer or early fall. Therefore, the calendar year 1998 data will not be available until after submittal of the MFR FY 2001 Workplan. The percentage of children at risk who are screened is an important indicator of Maryland's surveillance system. The incidence of childhood lead poisoning throughout the State indicates the effectiveness of the efforts, including rental property registration, risk reduction, lead paint accreditation, education/outreach, and enforcement activities to reduce lead paint hazards and childhood lead poisoning. Since implementation of the regulations in 1996, over 40,000 lead paint hazard treatments have been completed. In 1997, there were 67,118 children 0-6 years of age screened for lead poisoning (15.3% of all children aged 0-6 years in Maryland). There were 1,233 reported incidences of elevated blood-lead levels statewide (1.8% of children screened exceeded the lead poisoning standard), indicating a decrease in reported occurrences of lead poisoning in children  6 years of age statewide from 1996 to 1997. (See Environmental Indicator chart for 1996 data.)   II. Dispute Resolution III. EnPA Coordination Team IV. Signature Page CHAPTER 4: MARYLAND-EPA FY 2001 WORKPLAN I. MDE and EPA Goals Goal #1: Ensuring the Air is Safe to Breathe Goal #2: Ensuring that Marylanders Are Not Exposed to Unnecessary Levels of Radiation Goal #3: Ensuring Safe Drinking Water Goal #4: Reducing the Threat to Public Health from the Presence of Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Materials in the Environment Goal #5: Ensuring Water is Clean and Safe for Harvesting of Fish and Shellfish Goal #6: Improving and Protecting Maryland's Water Quality Goal #7: Ensuring Adequate Protection and Restoration of Maryland's Wetland Resources Goal #8: Protecting and Maintaining Maryland's Natural Resource Land Base and Encouraging Smart Growth and Community Revitalization Goal #9: Preventing  More time is needed to adequately assess the Program's performance. It is known that there are regional differences in the frequency of blood lead screenings and the Program is evaluating the significance of the reduction in the reported lead poisoning cases. Early indications are that there has been a reduction in screening in high risk areas and an increase in screening in lower risk areas, however, more years of data collection and analyses are needed to determine the reason for this finding. In addition, there is an increasing public awareness of the lead poisoning risk and more property owners are complying with the lead risk reduction standards. As compliance in all aspects of the lead law increases, it is expected there will be a concomitant decrease in lead poisoning. No changes to the management strategies should be made until there has been an adequate time period (3+ years) to review performance and analyze trends. Some significant accomplishments of the Program in FY99 include: q  negotiated MOU's with 15 Counties and the City of Baltimore to enhance lead education/outreach activities, including integrating efforts with immunization of Women, Infants, and Children programs, outreach to local property owners, and office visits to local health care providers to encourage an increase in blood lead testing; conducted annual Lead Update Meetings in Hagerstown, Baltimore, and Denton for Health Officers, Environmental Health Directors, and local health department sanitarians and nurses regarding national and State legislation, planning local lead outreach programs, case management protocols, medical updates, coordination of environmental investigations and enforcement activities; conducted meetings with lead paint abatement contractors and training providers regarding updates on legislation, new technology development, new federal requirements, policies and reporting procedures, and data management; and coordinated the annual Lead Poisoning Prevention Week activities throughout the State, including placing advertisements in major and local newspapers reminding rental property owners of the need to comply with the ""Reduction in Lead Risk in Housing"" requirements, placing posters in 400 post offices statewide, providing information to local television stations, and making presentations on lead hazards and lead poisoning prevention at numerous events across the State.  q  q  q  The Lead Poisoning Prevention Program experiences frequent turnovers in enforcement staff. As a result, there is some backlog of enforcement activities. A major strength of the Program, however, is the information it shares with the public and the regulated community regarding lead hazards and lead poisoning prevention. The continued availability of federal funding to support program functions is of concern. For example, the Centers for Disease Control recently significantly cut the Program's grant for data collection and evaluation related to childhood lead poisoning. Environmental Restoration (Superfund) (This applies to NPL, State Superfund and federal facility sites that are not subject to the Base Realignment and Closure Act (BRAC). BRAC and Voluntary Cleanup Program sites are covered under goal # 8.) The Program seeks to eliminate threats to public health from exposure to soils, groundwater, and surface waters contaminated by hazardous waste and other substances. Maryland's rich industrial history has resulted in a significant number of properties where investigation and/or cleanup of contamination are necessary to ensure public health is protected. Cleanup of these properties also has secondary positive impacts, including supporting smart growth by revitalizing formerly used properties, removing blighted properties from community landscapes, increasing the tax base, and, in some cases, supporting economic development efforts. Consistent with federal guidelines under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and State Superfund Law, MDE initiates and oversees the assessment and cleanup of hazardous waste sites where releases have occurred.   Pollution and Assisting the Regulated Community with Compliance Goal #10: Utilizing Information Technology to Optimize and Enhance Environmental and Administrative Operations  MDE participates as a partner with EPA in decision-making at all phases of environmental investigations and in overseeing hazardous waste cleanups at National Priority List (NPL) sites and federal facilities. MDE also oversees cleanups at State Superfund sites. The success of the Program's activities is directly related to its ability to communicate with its stakeholders. For example, at ten federal facilities, restoration advisory boards, (which include members of the community, military base, and local, state and federal regulatory agencies) have been formed to monitor, review, and evaluate federal facilities undergoing environmental restoration activities. At other federal facilities, MDE has entered formal partnering agreements with EPA and the facilities. In addition, several stakeholder groups which were created when Voluntary Cleanup/Brownfields legislation was enacted continue to provide informal feedback on issues related not only to the Voluntary Cleanup Program but also to other ""Superfund"" related issues through forums, meetings and informal discussions.  II. Maryland DNR and EPA Goals Goal #1: Ensure sustainable populations of living resources and aquatic habitat in the mainstem of the Chesapeake Bay, tidal tributaries, and Coastal Bays Goal #2: Healthy Maryland watershed lands, streams, and non-tidal rivers Goal #3: A natural resources stewardship ethic for Marylanders Goal #4: Vibrant local communities in balance with natural systems Goal #5: Establish a protected statewide network of ecologically valuable private and public lands (Green Infrastructure)  A major Program weakness is the insufficient number of staff and funding to oversee the large number of sites. The Program is required to investigate all sites on the State's Master List, a list of 436 sites known to be, or potentially, contaminated by hazardous waste (also known as State Superfund sites). EPA designated 335 of these sites as ""no further remedial action planned"" or ""NFRAP"". This federal designation does not mean that there is no risk to public health or the environment posed by the site; rather, it means the federal government will not provide funding for the site. These sites are, in essence, turned over to the State program to address. Capital monies are the only source of funds that can be used for the remediation of contamination. MDE must rely on cost recovery from responsible parties and State general funds to oversee remedial work at State Master List sites. On sites where there is no responsible party, work is not progressing due to insufficient funding. In FY99, EPA approved the use of federal monies to pay for the first stage of work, the survey of 132 sites of the 335 NFRAP coded sites on the State Master List. Additionally, the State received general funds for staffing in the FY2000 operating budget to conduct site assessments of the surveyed sites. These assessments have enabled MDE to identify sites by FY2001 that will need remediation. MDE has thus far determined that 3 of the 7 sites assessed using FY 2000 using General Funds will need remediation. Furthermore, 2 of the 3 sites will not have a viable, responsible party and will require State intervention to affect cleanup of the property. FY 2001 PAYGO funds have been provided to remediate the first of these sites: the Sauer Dump site, in Baltimore County. MDE will request FY 2002 PAYGO funding to remediate the next site where a viable, responsible party does not exist. As MDE contacts additional property owners about the need for remediation, we expect that additional contaminated sites with non-viable responsible parties will be discovered. Currently, MDE is actively overseeing remediation and investigations at 105 sites located on 17 federal facilities, 9 NPL sites (non-federal facility/operable units) and 34 State Superfund sites. Overall, steady progress, limited by the available number of staff, is being made on this work. Other accomplishments include:  APPENDIX State/EPA Information Management Efforts Carroll/Camden Environmental Restoration Project  q  q  The Program oversaw an innovative groundwater remediation project involving the discharge of chemical solvents from the former Spectron Solvent Recycling Center, a National Priorities List (NPL) site, into the Little Elk Creek River in Cecil County. This project involved the diversion of a stream around a groundwater collection and treatment system and then restoration of surface water flow to the area once the remediation was completed. MDE participated in the Bainbridge Naval Training Center Remedial Action Team (BRAT) to plan and coordinate efforts toward completion of CERCLA related environmental cleanup at the site 1200 acre site. Environmental cleanup at the site was completed in   EnPA Fiscal Year Realignment Workgroup Status Report - June, 2000 COMMENTS  Fall1999 and the property was transferred under the Base Realignment and Closure Act in February 2000 for development. MDE continued to oversee the removal and treatment of contaminated soils at the former Southern Maryland Wood Treating Site in St. Mary's County, a NPL site. Over 240,000 tons of soil has been treated at the site since the remediation action began. MDE is responsible for long-term monitoring at the site once the remediation is completed. Hazardous Waste Hazardous waste is produced as a byproduct of many manufacturing operations and processes. Also, numerous commercial chemical products are regulated as hazardous waste once they are declared to be waste or are intended to be discarded. Consistent with federal guidelines under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), MDE regulates the management of hazardous waste in Maryland. The State's hazardous waste regulations have established a comprehensive management program that regulates all aspects of hazardous waste handling, including generation, transport, treatment, storage and disposal. This program is preventative in nature and is designed to eliminate the release of hazardous waste to the environment and achieve a continual decrease in the aggregate amount of hazardous waste generated per year. If such releases occur, cleanup is compelled. Waste minimization industry visits are conducted to promote implementation of pollution prevention technologies. The Hazardous Waste Program: q q  ----------PREVIOUS AGREEMENTS FY1999 EnPA FY2000 EnPA  q q  q q q  q  q  issues permits for hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal (TSD) facilities; conducts compliance inspections of hazardous waste generators, transporters and TSD facilities; responds to hazardous waste complaints; responds to hazardous materials incidents involving transportation and conducts inspections of Maryland certified hazardous waste hauling vehicles; oversees groundwater remediations; performs groundwater-monitoring evaluations; encourages waste minimization and pollution prevention through multi-media approaches to the compliance and permitting processes; tracks and identifies generators and transporters of hazardous waste through the issuance of EPA identification numbers and a manifesting system for hazardous waste from point of generation to point of disposal; and drafts comprehensive rules and regulations for the management of hazardous wastes consistent with federal rules.  Information regarding hazardous waste generation in Maryland is reported to MDE biennially by hazardous waste generators. MDE is currently collating and conducting quality assurance/quality control checks on hazardous waste generator report information for the 1999 calendar year which was due by April 2000. This information will then be provided to EPA for a report that will be published in late 2001. The Hazardous Waste Program is considered a maintenance program to ensure protection of public health and the environment from releases of hazardous waste. Since a majority of the funding is received from EPA, the activities of the Program are largely directed by priorities set by EPA for States. It should be noted, that there is a trend toward decreasing numbers of permitted hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSD's) in Maryland. In July 1998, there were 28 permitted TSD's in the State and as of the end of FY200, the number of permitted TSD's is 23. The increase in closure of these sites is believed to be a direct result of better hazardous waste management, waste minimization and pollution prevention activities at facilities, which reduces hazardous waste generation and the need for long-term storage of hazardous wastes. This trend shows an admirable voluntary effort by industry, however, it has not reduced the workload for the Program. The number of small quantity hazardous waste generators which must be monitored   and inspected has remained the same but has the potential to increase, and sites where groundwater contamination is being investigated or remediated still need intensive MDE oversight to ensure protection of public health and the environment. Other accomplishments include: q  Construction activities have begun at the Beazer (former Koppers Company Wood Treating Site) located near Salisbury. The final remedial design has been finalized and approved. Initial studies began at the site shortly after wood-treating operations ceased in 1984. In 1991, Beazer and the Waste Management Administration signed an Administrative Consent Order that served as the framework for additional studies, evaluation of remedial option and implementation of the selected remedy. Planned site activities which began in June 2000 and will continue through June 2001 include construction of a subsurface barrier wall; installation of a hydraulic gate, and in-situ biological treatment system; rerouting of Keens Creek, and several wetlands mitigation projects.  Emergency Response MDE, in cooperation with local hazardous materials units, has the capacity to respond to emergencies to minimize risks to human health and the environment resulting from accidents and/or deliberate actions causing the release of hazardous substances to the air, water or land from fixed facilities, rail, waterway, and truck transportation routes. MDE's management strategies include: q q  q  Responding to emergency situations quickly and effectively. Coordinating planning and training activities with other state, local and private industry emergency response organizations and hazardous materials units to ensure that Maryland has the capacity to respond to emergencies to minimize risks to human health and the environment. Providing training, technical assistance, and logistical support to local government emergency response personnel.  q  Measurements of numbers of emergency response actions are the best means of evaluating success in emergency response. However, the random nature of these events, and the linkage of events to natural factors such as weather, reduces the ability to accurately identify the reasons for any reported trends. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Chemical spill responses have remained relatively constant, with downward trends over the past two years that appear to be associated with milder winters and less highway transportation of heating oil. Local government spill reports continue on a voluntary basis and detract from the use of the information in definitive trend analyses. MDE continued to provide support to local governments in hazardous chemical spill response. In addition to response support, MDE provided training opportunities for local emergency responders in association with the South Baltimore Industrial Mutual Aid Plan. MDE continued to work closely with industry in sharing resources and expertise during chemical spill events. The federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) requires that businesses and government agencies that manufacture and/or store hazardous materials report annually to local emergency response officials and the state regarding quantities and types of chemicals present at their facilities. MDE is the repository for this information in the State of Maryland. The Emergency Operations Program maintains a database of this information that is   available for public information. This program also maintains the state's copy of the federal toxic materials release inventory database (TRI). The unit also maintains files and reports regarding hazardous materials released to the air, water and land. Trends in chemical releases from facilities that report under the federal right-to-know program have been presented in ""Maryland's Environmental Indicators"" report. Although there are a number of shortcomings with the use of composite information for trend assessment, the graph of total releases to the environment (page 44 of the 1999 Maryland Environmental Indicators report) is instructive as the general downward trend over the past decade. As with Emergency Response, the random nature of spills and the linkage of events to natural factors such as weather also reduces the ability to accurately identify the reasons for trends in reporting of chemical releases under the federal Toxic Release Inventory reporting. Natural conditions and the economic well being of the country often determine the production of materials that use or release toxic chemicals. Congress and EPA frequently change reporting guidelines and thresholds, thus also making trend assessments challenging. MDE worked with industry to insure that data reports submitted under the Right-to-Know programs was timely and accurate. The public was provided timely access to all data. Enhancements in data handling, specifically the electronic submission and handling continues to progress under an EPA funded grant. When electronic data management is fully implemented in the future, staff efforts can then be directed toward data analysis and utilization in a variety of regulatory, response, and planning functions. Health and Ecological Risk Assessment MDE's Environmental Risk Assessment Program works in cooperation with other MDE programs and state and local health departments in order to ensure that Marylanders and our natural resources are protected from unacceptably high levels of risk due to environmental contamination. MDE toxicologists collect and analyze environmental data to support toxicological evaluations of the health and environmental risk due to hazardous waste sites, chemical releases, contaminated drinking water, naturally occurring radiation, and many other sources of environmental contamination. MDE staff serve on the Maryland Cancer Council, the Maryland Conference of Local Environmental Health Directors and other groups established to evaluate environmentally related health issues. Noise Control Although excessive noise levels are not a ""hazardous material"", noise from human activities can have a significant adverse effect on the public health, the general welfare, and property. Title 3 of the Environment Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland, requires that MDE develop and enforce environmental noise standards and coordinate and provide technical assistance to noise control programs in other state and local agencies. Noise complaints are generally constant, with seasonally elevated reports associated with weather conducive to outdoor activities and open windows. MDE staff respond to noise complaints and take measurements and issue notices of violation as required. In most cases, by providing education, mediation, and technical assistance, MDE is able to obtain resolution of complaints without administrative penalties or legal action in 99% of cases. MDE continues to provide technical expertise to other state agencies (e.g. State Highway, Motor Vehicle) and local governments (local police and liquor boards) in regard to noise control. Through training and other technical support, these entities are able to effect noise reductions independently, thus broadening state noise control and monitoring capabilities. Air Pollution Releases of air toxics are controlled by both federal and state regulations. These programs are   described under Goal #1. Back to Top  GOAL PERFORMANCE DATA  Environmental Indicators Children Exceeding Lead Poisoning Standard  MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES - FY 2001 The key management objectives under this goal are: Objective 4.1 To reduce the percentage of children poisoned of those tested by 10% each year.   The baseline for poisoning is a venous Elevated Blood Lead (EBL) greater than or equal 20  g/DL (micrograms per deciliter) each year. Objective 4.2 To reduce the amount of hazardous waste potentially subject to release or already released in the environment; Objective 4.3 To prohibit the improper disposal of hazardous waste; Objective 4.4 To oversee environmental restoration at historically contaminated sites; and Objective 4.5 To ensure that Marylanders are protected from unacceptably high levels of environmental contamination by maintaining a strong health and ecological risk assessment capability within MDE. Back to Top  MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AND ACTION PLANS Lead Poisoning Prevention The management strategies and action plans described here have been evolving since the organizational infrastructure to implement the most recent of the strategies was put in place in February 1996. In FY 2001, the Lead Poisoning Prevention Program plans to reduce the percentage of lead poisoning by 10%. The baseline for poisoning is an EBL (venous) equal to or greater than 20  g/DL (micrograms per deciliter). This means we are seeking a 10% annual downward trend in the environmental indicator for Lead Poisoning Prevention. The indicator is the number of reported occurrences of blood lead levels at or above 20  g/DL (lead poisoned) expressed as a percentage of the tested population. This will be accomplished through the following strategies: Increase Prevention: q  q  q  q  q q q q  q  Increase the number of units identified in the Lead Property Registry by 10% this year to meet a goal of 85% by the end of year 2003. Increase the number of inspections (both private sector and MDE) to meet a target of inspecting 75% of Maryland's ""Affected Properties"" meeting risk reduction standards by 2003. Increase the number of MOU's to 100% of jurisdictions within the next two years by negotiating MOU's with all 24 local jurisdictions to enhance lead education/outreach work. Negotiate a new 3-year contract to provide counseling services, outreach, and education statewide to tenants as needed to support the ""qualified offer"" by property owners (cap on liability) for relocation and health care assistance to lead poisoned children. Continue other outreach activities and meetings. Add registration and inspection information to the MDE Web site by 2003. Increase early intervention: Track timelines of home community health nurse visits with environmental investigation for lead poisoning cases. Continue to work cooperatively and provide support to the Lead Poisoning Prevention Commission for their statutorily mandated responsibilities. Increase enforcement: MDE will serve as State agency lead to coordinate lead poisoning prevention efforts statewide. SOP's for enforcement are still evolving. A workgroup has been established and meets on a regular basis to resolve this issue. This, in addition to attorneys dedicated to lead enforcement for the program and additional inspectors and support staff, should result in increased enforcement.  q q  q   q  q  q  Issue a minimum of 90% of all accreditations within standard time. 94% of all issued within standard time for CY 99. Continue oversight of accredited contractors, supervisors, and inspectors to ensure accuracy and competency. Begin measurement of enforcement actions taken against lead paint abatement contractors and training providers. EPA will work with Maryland to sample Baltimore schools for lead in drinking water and paint.  Environmental Restoration (Superfund) In FY 2001, the Program will continue to: q  conduct preliminary assessments and environmental site investigations to identify sites that may be contaminated by hazardous waste and prioritize sites for cleanup; provide sole oversight for cleanups at 34 State Superfund sites; and participate in decision-making with EPA, DOD, and responsible parties at all phases of environmental investigations and overseeing cleanups at NPL sites and federal facilities.  q q  EPA will continue to provide MDE with technical and programmatic assistance through the CORE and Site Specific Cooperative Agreements to ensure that MDE has meaningful and substantial involvement in the Federal Superfund program. In addition, for federal facilities, the Program will use new DOD funding to provide oversight of the many formerly used defense sites (FUDS) in the State, an activity that the Program currently has insufficient resources to address. Potential strategies include seeking federal pre-remedial funding, an EPA multi-site agreement, or Defense State Memorandum Of Agreement (DSMOA ) funding. Under State Superfund activities, in FY 2000, the Program conducted further assessments of up to seven of the 132 State Superfund sites (see ""Accomplishments, Status and Trends"" for more detail) designated through initial site surveys as having a high priority regarding environmental contamination and public health impacts. In addition, in FY 2001, the Program will use State capital funds for the planned remediation of up to one site where no viable responsible party can be identified. Hazardous Waste Since this Program is dependent upon EPA federal funding to support its activities and EPA determines priorities for the Program, planning activities can only be projected for one year. Based upon the fact the Program conducted similar activities over the last several RCRA grant periods, it is expected that our level of activity will remain consistent with previous years, depending upon Congressional decisions regarding federal funding. EPA Activities 1. The routine permitting, including renewal and modification, of standard TSD facilities is managed by the authorized states in Region III. Historically, Maryland has been diligent in completing permit commitments each year. In order to assist states as they help in meetings EPA's goal of Better Waste Management, the Region developed a state-specific spreadsheet, which designates the status of each TSD facility for operating and post closure facilities. 2. During FY00, the Region and Maryland undertook a mammoth effort to clean up the RCRIS database for permits and post closure facilities. Both Region III staff and managers worked cooperatively with MD to sort out outdated information. Based on feedback from Headquarter's staff, our combined efforts have resulted in an accurate RCRA universe of permit and post closure facilities. EPA will continue to assist MD with the implementation of RCRA information in   2001. 3. Recently, the Region has formed an Open Burning/Open Detonation (OB/OD) workgroup with VA, WV, MD and PA. In addition, the Region has set aside contract funds to provide OB/OD training as well as technical assistance for Part B reviews. VA has agreed to host the training. The Region's goal is to develop model permits that will be available to all the states. Emergency Response The Program plans to have all oil and chemical spill information geo-coded by the end of the year and will enhance the quality of spill reporting, to include precise address information. Outreach efforts will be directed toward local governments that submit spill reports to MDE. MDE staff will also need to be provided Geographical Positioning System (GPS) equipment and be trained in its use. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know The Program will have an electronic reporting system in place for all right-to-know reporting requirements by the end of FY 2001. Electronic data reporting and management systems being developed under the federal grant will need to be institutionalized within existing programs. Staff resources currently being used to manually manage the data will be redirected toward improved data utilization and analysis as the electronic submission process reduces existing work requirements. Internet accessible databases for all spill and chemical reporting programs will be established by the end of FY 2001. Noise Control The Program will maintain 99% resolution of noise complaints without legal actions being required for each year. Plans are to continue with outreach efforts with local governments and provide complainants with prompt and courteous service. Noise complaint records are scheduled for entry into a database being developed in association with the Department's Compliance Database. Back to Top  RESOURCE DISCUSSION Lead Poisoning Prevention The program will begin to experience decreases in rental property registration fees in upcoming years. Owners of rental units constructed after 1949, who do not elect to be covered by the law, pay a $5 per unit fee each year. This portion of the law expires on December 31, 2000. Federal funding has also been reduced in recent years. Governor Glendening's Lead Initiative's increased funding for enforcement activity in Baltimore City should stabilize the program funding resources and allow for growth in the activities necessary to implement the strategies and action plans for three years. Superfund Current funding and staff resources allow MDE to address only a portion of NPL, federal facility, and State Superfund sites. With current staff, the Program is able to: q q  oversee investigation and remediation of all active, non-federal facility NPL sites; oversee investigation and remediation of only high and medium priority federal facility sites; and oversee investigation and remediation of a small percentage of State Superfund sites (34  q   sites). The majority of the funding for pre-remedial surveys and investigations at State Superfund sites is provided by EPA, however, the majority of the remedial activities to be performed at State Superfund sites are ineligible for federal funding. In addition, current staffing levels are not sufficient to address formerly used defense sites. (See ""Accomplishments, Status, and Trends for details.) Emergency Response, Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know, and Noise Control MDE plans to operate its spill, chemical reporting, and noise control activities within a budget that is similar to preceding years. Enhancements to the program activities will be sought through the reallocation of resources gained through improvements in automated data management. DATA DISCUSSION Hazardous Waste The Program is converting Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Information System data from RCRA facility inspections pertaining to evaluations, violations, and enforcement actions to EPA's RCRA Info system. This conversion will make the data more reliable, and make tying State information into the EPA system easier. MDE intends to conduct this conversion so there is compatibility or integration with MDE's Enterprise System (Goal 10). Emergency Response, Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know, and Noise Control Spill and other chemical data is received by MDE units from industry and local governments. All data currently is submitted in paper format and maintained in files. Spill data is converted to electronic files. Selected tracking information obtained from submissions under the federal and state right-to-know programs is recorded electronically, but the information is only converted to electronic format for selected data sets. Noise complaint reports are being entered into a local database in a format that will allow for incorporation into a planned Enterprise System. Lead Poisoning Prevention Problems that make measurements and comparisons questionable at present.  1.  2. 3.  There is no current list of rental properties in the State of MD. There is no listing of owners of rental properties built before 1978. The Md. Department of Assessments & Taxation database contains a listing of residential property and property owners. The listing sometimes has date of construction information. It does not have information on whether a property is a rental or not. There is no current reliable source of information on this. MDE is coordinating with Baltimore City to exchange data they have compiled in a rental property database. There is no requirement for property owners to report turnover. This is the condition that triggers an inspection. Therefore, the number of inspections is driven by turnover frequency. There is no data available on either a statewide basis or a jurisdictional basis to determine a valid and acceptable turnover rate. Data concerning blood lead testing and lead poisoning is analyzed by calendar year. The report is available in August of the subsequent year. Therefore, the calendar year 1999 data is not available at this time.   4. 5.  Year 2000 legislation requires expanded screening for blood lead levels. The increased number of children screened during the next several years may result in higher numbers of elevated blood lead. Given a new database, the statistics may change significantly. Many measurements, comparisons or reports must be created manually due to the fact that various databases at MDE and other agencies are not yet able to be queried sequentially or compared. An enterprise system is under development to resolve this problem. This system may or may not be completed in the next fiscal year.

Maryland's program has been in place for decades and puts a strong emphasis on preventing pollutants from entering the waters of the State and monitoring the quality of shellfish harvesting waters and edible fish tissue to certify that they are safe for human consumption. Increased pressure from population growth and expanded development in the Chesapeake and Coastal Bays watersheds present a huge challenge for maintaining this goal. The key areas of emphasis for this goal are (1) ensuring shellfish harvesting waters are safe; and (2) adequately assessing contaminants in fish tissue to assure that Maryland citizens are not exposed to undue carcinogenic or other health risk from fish and shellfish consumption. ACCOMPLISHMENTS, STATUS AND TRENDS  Shellfish Harvesting Waters In FY99 a net amount of 1400 acres were closed to harvesting and is attributed to non-point source pollution and several years of above average rainfall. This represents less than a 0.2% increase in areas closed to harvesting. Non-point source pollution combined with climatological events are very difficult to manage. Pollution sources, which can be managed, such as farm practices, are routinely addressed. Also, intensive shoreline surveys were conducted to identify any outstanding pollution sources in the vicinity of the areas closed to harvesting. Fish Tissue Analysis In FY 99 MDE issued an advisory that fishermen should not eat more than 8 oz per month of Potomac River eels and carp, or catfish, larger than 16 inches. The advisory was coordinated with Virginia, which issued a similar advisory and in consultation with the Potomac River Fisheries Commission. Additional follow-up monitoring is planned for FY2000. This advisory will make fishermen aware of the risk of eating those fish so that they can adjust their behavior accordingly. The press release was sent to DNR to distribute with fishing licenses and a brochure was printed for distribution to provide additional advice on how to properly prepare the fish to further reduce risk. The existing advisories in Baltimore Harbor (catfish, eel), Back River (catfish, eel) and Lake Roland (black crappie, carp) continue. The Baltimore Urban Risk Initiative continued this summer to evaluate the effectiveness of the advisories by outreach to fishermen in the Baltimore Harbor region. In addition, to evaluating the effectiveness and public understanding of the advisories, it educated those unfamiliar with the advisories about them, and obtained a better estimate of fish consumption rates which are an important variable in estimating the risk that lead to the advisories.   I.

Without the laboratory data we cannot assess other areas of the state, or re-assess existing advisories to determine if they need to continue, if the contamination has abated. Data have been transferred from the Annapolis data center to local servers, and programs have been upgraded to meet Y2K requirements. Fish Kill Investigations MDE manages and coordinates the interagency program to investigate fish kills in all waters of the state. This is a mandated program, requiring TARSA to effectively receive, respond to, and interpret all reports of damaged aquatic resources. The investigative findings are acted on to enforce the water pollution laws of the Maryland, protect public health, aid in resource management, and contribute to public outreach. Fish kills are caused by a variety of natural and human induced circumstances. Each investigation endeavors to determine the nature and extent of the event and establish a cause if feasible. If a specific pollution source is identified, the investigative findings become invaluable evidence in support of water pollution enforcement litigation, or public health advisory decisions. The fish kill investigation program is an integral component of the current national project to identify and interpret the effects of Pfiesteria piscicida and other harmful algae blooms (HAB's) in waters of the state, and relate the findings to various sources of nutrient pollution.

Further refine the current approach to stream-line the fish kill investigation process through a working relationship with sister agencies, qualified volunteers, technical support, and laboratory support.  EPA Activities In support of Maryland's efforts to achieve the above objectives, EPA Region III will do the following: q  q q q q  q  q  q  Continue to work with Maryland to establish a statewide policy of using risk assessment procedures for consumption advisories that conform to EPA's recommendations. Continue to work with Maryland to develop appropriate E. coli standards. Continue to work with Maryland on the implementation of Pfiesteria strategy. Continue to support the Coastal Bays CCMP. Continue to support Maryland's efforts to identify CAFO facilities located in high-priority areas and to develop a compliance assistance and enforcement strategy to ensure CAFO regulations are complied with. Continue to work with Maryland to investigate causes of microbial, nitrate, and organic MCL violations. Continue to work with MDE to develop a universe of SSOs and investigate and address SSO violations. Continue to provide support in meeting Maryland's commitment to CSO compliance assurance. Back to Top  RESOURCE DISCUSSION Shellfish Harvesting Waters The goals for shellfish harvesting waters are entirely generally funded. A request has been submitted to increase staff for field monitoring efforts and data management so efforts to meet Information Technology objectives. Without adequate staffing, there is not enough staff time available to devote to implement GIS and meet monitoring needs under pressures from increasing population in the Chesapeake and Coastal Bays. Fish Tissue Analysis There are currently no funds specifically allocated for laboratory analysis. Past analyses were dependent on the DHMH laboratory providing ""environmental laboratory services"" which they have not done effectively. This is being handled both by requesting general funding for a contract laboratory and by discussion with DHMH regarding laboratory services. The shortfall as represented by our budget request is approximately $360,000. Staff resources are also not properly devoted to this effort. Two additional positions have been requested to aid in the required field work, to manage the data more effectively, to write more frequent reports, and to work closely with the laboratory to assure the quality of the data and obtain timely results. Fish Kill Investigations This program is entirely supported through general funds.   Back to Top  DATA DISCUSSION Shellfish Harvesting Waters Improvements in data management using new technology will streamline and enhance the program and permit better public access to data. Plans are currently underway to provide better access and ability to share data for other Departmental objectives under the Enterprise System plan (see Goal 10.) Fish Tissue Analysis Recent metals data have been downloaded to a PC-based database for analysis for a report that is in preparation. The entire database has been moved to local servers to increase the ability to share this data in conjunction with the Department's Enterprise System plan (see Goal 10.) Fish Kill Investigations The department needs to improve the fish kill database and incorporate it with the departmental database.

Strategic Priorities CHAPTER 2: REVIEW OF FY 2000 COMMITMENTS AND FY 2001 & 2002 NEW INITIATIVES FY 2000 Enforcement and Compliance Activities Review of FY 2000 Workgroup Efforts FY 2001 & 2002 New Initiatives  MDE GOAL #6: IMPROVING AND PROTECTING MARYLAND'S WATER QUALITY Under federal and State law and regulation, MDE is required to ensure the water resources of the state are maintained and protected. Designated uses for Maryland's waters are specified in regulation and are designed to ensure that its waters meet the federally-mandated Clean Water Act goals of having ""fishable, swimmable"" waters. MDE addresses these responsibilities by implementing various programs to prevent point and non-point source pollutants from entering the waters of the state. MDE uses several legal and programmatic tools to meet this goal, including through strong regulatory programs such as regulation development, permitting, and enforcement as well as non-regulatory or voluntary pollution reduction activities. Key areas of emphasis for this goal include (1) regulatory activities; (2) voluntary activities; (3) stormwater, erosion and sediment (nonpoint source) controls; (4) concentrated animal feeding operations; (5) sewage sludge; (6) abandoned mine reclamation; (7) financial assistance programs; (8) triennial review; and (9) air pollution control (see Goal #1.) ACCOMPLISHMENTS, STATUS AND TRENDS  Regulatory Activities Healthy, sustainable living resources are achieved through the development of management objectives and the implementation of plans that may include both regulatory and voluntary measures. A major portion of Maryland's efforts to achieve living resources goals in the Bays are accomplished through Maryland's participation in the Chesapeake Bay Program and the implementation of our Bay restoration goals. There are a number of Bay Program goals, including reducing the levels of nutrients entering the Chesapeake Bay from controllable sources by 40% by the year 2000, reducing inputs of toxic contaminants and numerous specific living resources goals (submerged aquatic vegetation, blue crab management plan, etc). MDE, DNR, and MDA work together with the U.S. EPA and the other signatories to the bay agreement (Pennsylvania, Virginia and the District of Columbia) to develop effective regulatory and voluntary strategies for reducing pollutant runoff into the Bay and its tributaries. Other activities include special projects, such as the Gunpowder Watershed Project, the Anacostia Watershed Restoration, the Coastal Bays of the National Estuaries Program, and the Baltimore Harbor Toxics Regional Action Plan. These projects provide elements of research and development to enable Maryland to learn and implement new strategies for protecting the waters of the State. MDE's Annual Enforcement and Compliance Report provides detailed information on the regulatory functions performed by MDE staff. Actual data by fiscal year is available each fall. For the past five years, inspection services have been prioritized. The priority order is complaints, violations and their follow-up, and permitted facilities. Total numbers of inspections are relatively consistent from year to year. In FY 1999, an increased number of water quality complaints were received relative to prior years and were responded to in a timely manner. Quarterly permit data show that based on the watershed approach to permitting associated with the implementation of TMDLs, a reduction has resulted in the number of surface water permits issued during FY 1999. However, the number of coal and non-coal mining permits and oil and gas exploration and production permits have increased over prior years. Dam safety, stormwater management and erosion   CHAPTER 3: ADMINISTERING THE AGREEMENT I. Communication and Coordination II. Dispute Resolution III. EnPA Coordination Team IV.

MDE and EPA Goals Goal #1: Ensuring the Air is Safe to Breathe Goal #2: Ensuring that Marylanders Are Not Exposed to Unnecessary Levels of Radiation Goal #3: Ensuring Safe Drinking Water Goal #4: Reducing the Threat to Public Health from the Presence of Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Materials in the Environment Goal #5: Ensuring Water is Clean and Safe for Harvesting of Fish and Shellfish Goal #6: Improving and Protecting Maryland's Water  and sediment control, and water supply and sewerage construction permits have remained level or decreased slightly. Under Goal #6, the FY 1999 efficiency measure for the percentage of significant violations resolved per total significant violations for stormwater, erosion and sediment control suggests a decline due to the increasing number of unresolved violations (some carried over from prior fiscal year) pending further action by the Administration. This measure fluctuates dramatically during the year but over time it is expected to average around 80%. Voluntary Activities For the past two years, compliance rates across all media have remained consistent which may be due to MDE's approach to compliance assistance. When minor problems are noted at the site, the compliance specialist may give a directive to make a correction without the issuance of a formal violation. At the same time, the number of enforcement cases has increased slightly due to a focus on the elimination of case backlog. Stormwater, Erosion and Sediment (Nonpoint Source) Controls Currently, MDE inspects 100% of industrial and wastewater treatment plants and approximately 55% of stormwater permits. This shortfall in field services has resulted in inadequate oversight of various development projects associated with significant land disturbances. If funded, the FY 2001 initiative will identify and mitigate violations occurring at projects currently not inspected. It will also reduce the impacts of nonpoint source sediment pollution on impaired waterways and assure equity in compliance activity between point and nonpoint sources. MDE's ability to assure appropriate reductions in nonpoint source loadings to impaired waters will fall short of what will be required to implement TMDLs. Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFO) An important component of Maryland's water pollution control strategy includes control of nonpoint source pollution from animal feeding operations. The following chronology is provided as background to the current status of the CAFO effort. MDE issued a CAFO general permit in December, 1999, which covered all CAFO's over 1,000 animal units and those operations with documented water quality violations. In the fall of 1998, MDE submitted to EPA a CAFO Strategy that identified who in Maryland would receive general permit coverage, which CAFO's would require individual permits, and how compliance and enforcement actions would be taken. The Maryland Legislature passed a bill and the Governor signed into law the Water Quality Improvement Act of 1998. This bill requires all farms in Maryland to submit nitrogen and phosphorus based nutrient management plans by 2004 and implementation of these plans by 2005. This bill mandated phytase addition to feed, established manure transport program, provided cost share for development of nutrient management plans, established funding and research efforts for evaluating alternative technologies, and related activities. The first draft of the CAFO permit was prepared in 1998 and was provided to Perdue to review. In the summer of 1999, this language was refined and targeted for distribution as a final draft to Allen Foods, Perdue and Tysons in August. In August,1999, MDE and the Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) met with the Speaker of the House and the Chairman of the Environmental Matters Committee and the three companies to brief them on the permits. In FY 2001, the new CAFO co-permits will be issued. MDE's regulatory function will include ensuring that the poultry companies are providing capacity for excess litter and manure; providing technical assistance to contract growers; ensuring that poultry companies are providing quarterly reports on the status of nutrient management planning and implementation of these plans. Sewage Sludge Under State law, MDE regulates the collection, handling, burning, land application, storage, disposal, and transportation of sewage sludge. Improperly managed sewage sludge utilization or disposal practices could result in pollution of groundwater and surface waters, with the potential for impacting drinking water well users, surface water drinking supplies, and boaters and the potential for propagation of disease. The Solid Waste Program's permitting and enforcement activities prevent and control pollutant releases   Quality Goal #7: Ensuring Adequate Protection and Restoration of Maryland's Wetland Resources Goal #8: Protecting and Maintaining Maryland's Natural Resource Land Base and Encouraging Smart Growth and Community Revitalization Goal #9: Preventing Pollution and Assisting the Regulated Community with Compliance Goal #10: Utilizing Information Technology to Optimize and Enhance Environmental and Administrative Operations  through the careful assessment of proposed utilization sites and practices, pollution control technologies, routine monitoring of sewage sludge generation facilities and application sites, and complaint investigations. Sewage sludge utilization permits are comprehensive and include evaluations of application rates, slope requirements, evaluation of soil and water conditions on the application site, nutrient requirements, minimum buffers to streams, drainage ditches, springs, wells, roads, property boundaries and groundwater, monitoring requirements, and financial assurance. County governments provide comments regarding permit applications, participate in public meetings and inspections, and in some delegated counties, County Health Departments assist MDE by providing supplemental inspections and monitoring of the permitted sites. Currently, 87% of sewage sludge generated in the State is recycled through land application, pellitizing and composting. Declining revenues in the Sewage Sludge Fund have led to reductions in the inspection staff. The program no longer conducts ""pre-start inspections"", inspection of sites prior to sludge application to ensure that buffer zones are properly marked, restricted soils are avoided, and compliance with other permit conditions. Today the focus is on inspections of operating sites. Often problems are discovered only after they have occurred. Also threatening the program is the increasing polarization of Maryland residents to the use of sewage sludge related to its characteristic odor and perceived public health threats, which limits its availability to farmers and others who use the material as fertilizer. The number of sewage sludge inspections performed increased due to reduction in turnover. In addition, the compliance rate increased and the number of enforcement actions taken has declined. This is believed to be a result of stabilization, which has occurred within the industry and the concomitant development of experience on the part of the sludge applicators' staffs. Abandoned Mine Reclamation Acid mine drainage remediation contributes to ensuring that designated uses are maintained. Examples of recent projects include: q q q q  The North Branch of the Potomac Doser Liming Project; The Cherry Creek Mine Drainage Assessment and Mitigation Project; The GIS/GPS Database Development for Maryland's Abandoned Mine Lands; and Federalsburg Stream Restoration and Abandoned Mine Project.  Projects for the current fiscal year (FY 2000) include: q q q  II. Maryland DNR and EPA Goals Goal #1: Ensure sustainable populations of living resources and aquatic habitat in the mainstem of the Chesapeake Bay, tidal tributaries, and Coastal Bays Goal #2: Healthy Maryland watershed lands, streams, and nontidal rivers  Little Meadows Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Project George's Creek Stream Stabilization Project Federalsburg Stream Restoration and Abandoned Mine Project, Phase II.  Financial Assistance Programs Financial assistance methods available for controlling and preventing water pollution are: cost-share program for nutrient removal at municipal wastewater plans, low cost loans from the State's Revolving Loan Fund for point and nonpoint source pollution control projects, grants for stormwater retrofits, costshare grant funds for stream restoration, wetlands restoration and agricultural technical assistance programs, and supplemental State grants for wastewater projects. Additionally, the Department's Financial Assistance Programs have expanded and/or accelerated the use of funding through major enhancements like the Integrated Capital Project Priority System, Linked Deposition Program, and Biological Nutrient Removal Program. In FY 1999, Maryland provided more than $68.6 million in financial assistance to qualified applicants to control pollutant loads which totals about $25.7 million (or 60%) over what was originally projected for FY 1999. MDE is also on track to provide a record $179 million in FY 2000. Much of this increase is associated with the tremendous success achieved in the Water Quality Financing Revolving Loan Fund Program and the accelerated use of funding.   Goal #3: A natural resources stewardship ethic for Marylanders Goal #4: Vibrant local communities in balance with natural systems Goal #5: Establish a protected statewide network of ecologically valuable private and public lands (Green Infrastructure)  Triennial Review In FY 1999, MDE began its Triennial Review of water quality standards. As part of this review, four public hearings were held to solicit input on what changes should be considered. Although the review is ongoing, current plans include development of a regulation to allow designation of Outstanding Natural Resource Waters in the State, adoption of biological criteria, adoption of ammonia criteria and several other new criteria for toxics. Field evaluation of the effectiveness of new criteria to protect recreational beaches has also begun. Air Pollution Control Air pollution control activities have reduced emissions of nitrogen oxides into the air which have also resulted in a decrease of nitrogen deposition into the waters of the State.

Shellfish monitoring contributes to ensuring that designated uses are maintained. The designated uses for Maryland's waters are defined in regulation and require that certain water quality criteria and standards are achieved through both voluntary and regulatory pollution source controls. Waters that do not meet designated uses are classified as ""impaired"". As required by the federal Clean Water Act, Maryland is developing Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) for each impaired water body in the State. These TMDLs will be used to help in Maryland's existing efforts to protect and restore water quality. Over 465 TMDLs must be developed for Maryland waters in order to address all of the impairments listed on Maryland Clean Water Act Section 303(d) list of impaired waters. This will require a large effort on the part of MDE and DNR to collect, compile and analyze the available data necessary to assess water quality and point and nonpoint source pollutant-loading sources. The TMDLs must be closely coordinated with the ongoing Chesapeake Bay Nutrient and Toxic Contaminant Reduction Strategies, as well as EPA's Clean Water Action Plan. This coordination is being accomplished through MDE's Interagency TMDL Workgroup and Maryland's participation in the Chesapeake Bay Program, the Coastal Bays Program and the Clean Water Action Plan development and discussions with Maryland's Tributary Strategy Teams. MDE has not held a formal and complete Triennial Review in ten (10) years, so there is a large   accumulation of issues to be dealt with. In addition, there has been several relevant new initiatives from EPA including the Clean Water Action Plan and development of nutrient standards. These activities will be reflected in next year's performance measures as the review of standards is completed and the move to promulgate new regulations begins. Regulatory strategies include permitting and inspection of permitted facilities to ensure compliance. MDE has committed its resources to incorporating EPA's watershed approach into an integrated system of addressing water quality protection activities. A watershed permitting plan has been developed which coincides with Maryland's Agreement to produce TMDLs for impaired water quality segments. The State has been divided into five (5) permitting regions to coordinate NPDES individual permit limits with the point source TMDL allocations. The initial work product will be expanded to include General Permit registrations and has the potential to incorporate other permit activities (e.g., groundwater discharges, stormwater outfalls, non-tidal wetland disturbances, etc.) within a geographically based (GIS) watershed representation. Aside from local government's role in Maryland's water quality standards, and identifying waters to be included on Maryland's 303(d) list, they have three broad roles associated with the TMDL Program. The first is with regard to the development of specific TMDLs. The second is with regard to general topics associated with Maryland's TMDL Program (e.g., striving for coordinated State and local responses to influence evolving federal policies, exploring methodologies for sediment TMDLs as they might relate to stream restoration and biocriteria, exploring the details of TMDL implementation, etc.). The third is with regard to the implementation of specific TMDLs. Additional pollution reductions may also be achieved through pollution prevention efforts and supplemental environmental projects. Compliance Specialists look for opportunities for facilities to explore pollution prevention. Facilities currently in compliance may present a process, waste stream, or operational situation which if changed are not only cost effective for the business but can result in pollutant reductions. Compliance Specialists make referrals to the Maryland Center for Environmental Training to work independently with companies on pollution prevention efforts. Supplemental environmental projects (SEPs) are considered where appropriate in settlement of major pollution enforcement actions. These projects must provide environmental enhancements beyond the regulatory requirements applicable to the company. In exchange for completing the SEP, an offset of penalty  which is far less than the cost/value of performing the project by the facility  is provided. (See Goal #9 for more pollution prevention/compliance assistance information.) MDE's regulatory authority to protect and restore the waters of the State includes the following programs: q q q q q q q q q q  q q q  q q q q q  NPDES Wastewater and Stormwater Discharge Permits to Surface Water (Industrial) Water Appropriation and Use Permit Groundwater Discharge Permit (Municipal or Industrial) NPDES Surface Water Discharge Permit (Municipal) Toxic Material Permit Underground Injection Control Permit Mine Operation Permits (including Land reclamation requirements) Sewerage Construction Permit Well Construction Permit Wetlands and Waterways Permit (Nontidal Wetland/Waterway Construction/Water Quality Certification) Tidal Wetland Licenses and Permits Discharge permits at oil facilities Erosion & Sediment Control and Stormwater Management Approvals for State and Federal Construction Projects NPDES Industrial Stormwater Discharge General Permit for Construction Activities NPDES Municipal Stormwater Permits Dam Safety Permits Gas and Oil Production Permits Inspection, enforcement and compliance activities associated with the above regulatory programs.   q  q q q q q q  NPDES General Permits (seafood processors, mineral mining, coal mining, animal feedlot operations, and hydrostatic testing) Watershed permitting and watershed cycling for monitoring and TMDL development Water quality certification Coastal Zone Consistency Nitrogen oxides control program (see Goal #1) Development or revision of water quality standards Budget initiative for meeting TMDL commitments will allow a comprehensive approach to this new strategy and addresses all critical points to allow each required component of TMDLs to proceed in an efficient and coordinated manner.  Voluntary Activities A variety of voluntary efforts are also underway in Maryland to reduce pollution levels entering Maryland waters by implementation of best management practices on agricultural and urban/residential land uses, residential septic systems, forest harvesting plans, implementation of biological nutrient removal at municipal sewage treatment plants and numerous other programs. These efforts basically rely upon education and outreach efforts, coupled with financial incentives designed to encourage the voluntary participation of citizens and businesses. Pollution prevention is part of a strategy to protect water quality. Efforts include performing P2 screening during pretreatment inspections, incorporating P2 incentives into the permit process, utilizing the established referral system with private contractors, producing P2 videos for industry, promoting P2 training and workshops as an educational tool, and others. Nonpoint Source Other key strategies include the following: q  Ten local jurisdictions are required to submit annual reports in accordance to Section 402 of the Clean Water Act, National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) regulations 40 CFR 122. 26(d)(2)(I) documenting new source identification, discharge characterization, and management programs as a condition to their permits. MDE and certain permitted local jurisdictions will certify individuals for the Responsible Personnel Certification Program for implementing erosion and sediment control measures. Finalize and adopt Maryland's draft State Stormwater Design Manual and proposed regulation changes that promote our new approach for the treatment of urban runoff from new and redevelopment sites. Review and delegate erosion and sediment control enforcement authority to local jurisdictions, and perform triennial reviews for county stormwater management programs. Issue stormwater management and erosion/sediment control approvals for state and federal construction projects. Conduct safety inspections of dam structures in Maryland, and issue dam safety permits. Request funding through a budget initiative for sediment and water pollution control field inspections will allow the identification and mitigation of violations occurring at projects not currently being inspected. It will also reduce the impacts of nonpoint source sediment pollution on impaired waterways and assure equity in compliance activity between point and nonpoint sources.  q  q  q  q  q q  Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations MDE will continue to work with EPA and the agricultural community to develop reasonable approaches to improving current animal waste management practices. Local Health Services Initiative Over the past 20 year, major pollution reduction initiatives have focused on point sources. The   Chesapeake Bay Program, the State's Tributary Strategies, source protection initiatives of the Safe Drinking Water Act, and Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) requirements have brought into focus the need to reexamine regulatory schemes for siting, designing, constructing, operating, and maintaining septic systems. There also needs to be a more comprehensive approach to alternatives for addressing increasing numbers of failing septic systems. Septic system regulations, policy directives, and delegation agreements with local health departments need to be significantly updated to reflect changing federal, State, and local laws/regulations. The State's subdivision regulations need to be reconciled with local land use planning and subdivision regulations to assure statewide consistency in approving new development projects. Lot size and set back requirements need to be evaluated along with location of septic systems relative to reservoirs, neighboring wells, paved areas, property lines, buildings, etc. New requirements need to incorporate expanded opportunities for clustering, use of shared facilities, innovative/alternative technologies, etc. New subdivision configurations, new septic system maintenance requirements, and broader options for addressing system failures will result in smarter subdivision planning, reduced non-point source pollution, and the systematic elimination of septic system failures. This puts emphasis on pollution prevention, creative subdivision planning, and consideration of cumulative impacts. This initiative will help to reduce nonpoint source pollution and improve water quality through new policy directives for local health departments, closer oversight and improved accountability of locally delegated programs, and new regulations to reflect ways to incorporate new maintenance requirements and new criteria for lot configuration to allow for clustering and use of innovative technology as a means to address cumulative impacts and maximize opportunities for pollution prevention. Successful outcomes would include reduced paved structures, reduced land disturbance, increased buffers, and promotion of open space/green areas. Other benefits will include overall reductions in pollution from subdivisions with on lot septic systems, and the implementation of environmental designs that result in ""low impact development"". Sewage Sludge Program In FY 2001, the Sewage Sludge Program will continue to ensure that permitted sewage sludge utilization and disposal sites facilities are designed and operated in compliance with all applicable water pollution control requirements. To implement this strategy, the following activities will continue to be performed: q  overseeing operating permits for over 900 permitted sewage sludge utilization sites and facilities; performing over 600 inspections annually to ensure these sites are managed properly; ensuring that agricultural and other sludge application sites are properly maintained for 5 years following sludge application; notifying County governments of applications for sewage sludge utilization and disposal sites within their jurisdictions; requiring that regulated facilities are designed and operated with suitable requirements established for pollution prevention and control, including continuing requirements that Nutrient Management Plans be instituted at all farms utilizing sewage sludge as fertilizer; and  q  q  q  q  q  routinely performing unannounced inspections of sewage sludge generation, storage, utilization, and disposal sites to insure compliance.  Abandoned Mine Reclamation The abandoned mine reclamation program's goal is to restore Maryland's ecosystems impacted by prelaw abandoned mines to a healthy condition. The management objectives are to mitigate damage in   streams adversely affected by abandoned mine drainage; remove safety hazards; and restore the quality of terrestrial habitats and return the land to productive use. MDE's management activities include: q q  q  Regulating the activities associated with existing mining operations; Providing funding and oversight of contracts for the cleanup and reclamation of abandoned mines; and Providing funding and oversight of contracts for stream restoration.  Projects to be accomplished in FY 2001 will be: q q q q q q  Mill Run II Shallman Gob Pile Bass Hole Reclamation Potomac Hill Acid Mine Drainage Abatement Everhardt Acid Mine Drainage Abatement Matthew Acid Mine Drainage Abatement  The Bureau of Mines plans to host a symposium in October, 1999 to bring together several states and levels of government to discuss accomplishments to date regarding acid mine drainage and stream restoration. Financial Assistance Maryland anticipates providing up to $83 million in FY 2001in financial assistance to control pollutant loads. The following financial assistance methods continue to be available for controlling and preventing water pollution: cost share program for nutrient removal at municipal wastewater plants, low-cost loans from the State's Revolving Loan Fund for point and nonpoint source pollution control projects, grants for stormwater retrofits, cost share grant funds for stream restoration, wetlands restoration and agricultural technical assistance programs, and supplemental State grants for wastewater projects. Additionally, there has been major enhancements to the Department's Financial Assistance Programs to strategically expand and/or accelerate the use of funding: Integrated Capital Project Priority System The Department has recently adopted an Integrated Project Priority System (IPS) for rating and ranking water quality projects under the Maryland Water Quality State Revolving Loan Fund. The system integrates point and non-point source pollution control project benefits and incorporates State water quality priorities reflected in management strategies contained in the Non-Point Management Plan, the Estuary Plan, the Coastal Bays Plan, Priorities Watersheds, and the Total Maximum Daily Load criteria as the minimum threshold requirement to be considered for funding. Linked Deposit Program  Water Quality Loan Fund Through its ""Linked Deposit Program"" the Department has implemented an innovative way of assisting private properly owners in addressing on-site water quality problems resulting from non-point source pollution. The program allows private landowners to enter into a loan with any one of 39 eligible lending institutions (and branch offices) around the State for capital improvements such as: agricultural best management practices, shoreline erosion control, wetlands creation or enhancement, correction of failing septic systems, removal or replacement of privately-owned and maintained stormwater management facilities. The lending institute underwrites the loan, sets loan terms and conditions, and assumes financial risks for the loan. The lender and the Department enter into an investment agreement for a sum equal to the loan amount where the Department takes a lower than usual rate of interest with the lender passing this discounted rate on to the private borrower. Biological Nutrient Removal (BNR)  Eastern Shore   The BNR Program continues to be the State's principle program for decreasing nutrient loads from point source discharges and a cornerstone in the Chesapeake Bay 40% Nutrient Reduction Goal. In response to Pfiesteria outbreaks on the Lower Eastern Shore and possible linkages to elevated nutrient levels, the Department is fast-tracking implementation of the BNR Program on the Eastern Shore. In total, some 18 Eastern Shore wastewater treatment facilities are now targeted to do BNR and the Department has developed accelerated funding schedules. Triennial Review The President's Clean Water Action Plan places additional emphasis on water quality standards including development of new standards, revision of existing standards, development of bacteria and nutrient standards and streamlining the whole water quality standards process. MDE has requested the staff to meet these needs. Air Pollution Control Air pollution control activities will continue to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides into the air to further decrease nitrogen deposition into the waters of the State. These control activities are described in Goal #1. EPA Activities In support of Maryland's clean water goal, EPA Region III will do the following: q  Continue to work with Maryland to address outstanding Water Quality Standards Issues and triennial reviews. Continue to provide technical assistance for the development of TMDLs and the 303(d) list. Continue to provide technical assistance for the development of TMDLs for the Coastal Bays with the EPA Estuary Program. Continue to support Maryland's implementation of watershed-based permitting. Continue to provide support to the SRF financing of non-traditional water quality activities and coordinate SRF programs with Maryland's comprehensive watershed management program and place-based initiatives. Continue to work with Maryland to develop the universe of SSOs and investigate and address SSO violations. Provide Maryland support in meeting its commitment to CSO compliance assurance. Provide support in dealing with CAFO groundwater and surface water contamination. Support Maryland's effort to identify CAFO facilities located in priority areas and to develop a compliance assistance and enforcement strategy to ensure CAFO regulations are complied with. Continue to provide Maryland support through compliance assistance and outreach efforts focused on stormwater. Support Maryland's implementation of an effective stormwater program that includes strong enforcement and compliance assurance Continue to work with MDE in the spirit of the July 14, 1998 document known as ""EPA Region III and MDE Water Management Administration Agreement Regarding NPDES and Water Pollution  q  q  q  q  q  q  q  q  q  q  q   Civil and Administrative Enforcement Response."" Back to Top  RESOURCE DISCUSSION In addition, two initiatives requesting additional FY 2001 general funds have been approved by the General Assembly under MFR Goal #6:  1.  Meeting Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) Commitments* The TMDL process is built on water quality standards including designated uses and water quality criteria. This process requires acquisition of data from local governments, volunteer monitoring and other databases. It is implemented through development of TMDLs with public participation, and is then implemented in permits. This initiative is a comprehensive approach and addresses all critical points to allow each required component of TMDLs to proceed in an efficient and coordinated process. The initiative includes eight permanent positions, nine contractual positions and funding for contractual services. Two of the eight permanent positions will develop and revise water quality standards as required by the federally mandated Triennial Review for TMDL development. Two other positions will acquire data to write TMDL documentation and will serve as technical liaisons to the regulated community and our stakeholders. Two positions will serve as modelers and will actually develop TMDLs at a faster pace than is possible with current staff. The final two additional permit writers will be necessary to implement TMDLs in permits. (* This initiative also supports MFR Goals #5 and #14.)  2.  Sediment and Water Pollution Control Field Inspections This initiative is to address a shortfall in field services, which results in inadequate oversight of various development projects associated with significant land disturbances. Field verifications are needed to assure that requirements of permits are satisfied and violations are corrected to minimize water quality impairments. Environmental groups continue to raise the issue of the level of inspection of construction projects and have correlated insufficient field services with increased incidence of pollution. This initiative provides funding for the identification and mitigation of violations occurring at projects currently not inspected. It will also reduce the impacts of nonpoint source sediment pollution on impaired waterways and assure equity in compliance activity between point and nonpoint sources. This initiative includes five new positions: four Environmental Compliance Specialists and one Water Resources Engineer. The Sewage Sludge Program's principal weaknesses include a lack of resources due to declining revenues in the Sewage Sludge Fund. The increased use of out-of-state disposal sites and the institution of water-reduction techniques at the larger wastewater treatment plants have reduced the volume of sludge produced and therefore decreased the billable volume of sewage sludge which previously supplied the special fund. However, since permits are issued based on fertilizer value in dry tons, not wet tons, this has not decreased the workload for the Program, just the revenue generated. Declining revenues in the Fund have also resulted in MDE eliminating funding of a research project by the University of Maryland regarding the chemicals that cause sewage sludge odor and possible ways of combating the odor, a major public concern regarding land application of the material. Research is essential and must be a key component of sewage sludge management in Maryland.  DATA DISCUSSION Currently, discharge permit data is tracked and reported by MDE's Environmental Permits Service   Center. The mining, gas and oil, and stormwater management and erosion and sediment control data are maintained and reported independently by the respective programs within Water Management. As of July 1, 1999, compliance data is maintained in the newly enhanced Field Investigation Report (FIR). The FIR system is one of the 19 databases that will be used to develop the prototype for the Department's Enterprise System. The new FIR system will allow all inspections conducted for 10 different media to be recorded within the Enterprise System. Concurrently, the new system will allow management to determine if all facilities/sites are being inspected on a timely basis. A scheduling feature of the new system will allow inspectors and management to maximize inspection time. The new system will calculate and record all information needed for the Annual Enforcement and Compliance Report on a monthly basis. (See Goal #13 for the link to MDE's Enterprise System.) The Wetlands and Waterways Program currently maintains its permitting data in an Informix database, RAMS (Regulatory Analysis and Management System), using an HP9000 mini-computer which interfaces with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The RAMS system was developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and is operational at MDE and the Baltimore District Offices of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. MDE's system is compatible with the data system used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Maintenance and technical support for RAMS are provided by Applied Systems in Las Vegas, Nevada and includes support for systems administration, systems modifications and enhancements, and for continued systems maintenance, development, and configuration management. The HP9000 mini-computer primarily supports the RAMS critical database application for the wetlands permitting function that is used by four WMA programs and provides services to 150 internal and external users. This application collects and provides wetlands permits information to MDE and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The HP9000 mini-computer was not Y2K compliant and required the FY 1999 procurement of a replacement computer and communication device. The Informix database, RAMS, will be migrated to the replacement computer during the first half of FY 2000. In FY 2001, major enhancements to RAMS will take place when it is upgraded to RAMS II, a clientserver software environment. MDE plans to migrate/integrate wetlands data to the Department Enterprise System in FY 2001.

In addition, the State has recently adopted an ambitious goal of voluntary restoration of 60,000 acres of wetlands lost since the late 1940s. Key areas of emphasis for the Wetlands program include: (1) maintaining strong regulatory and planning programs to protect tidal and non-tidal wetlands; and (2) developing and maintaining the Governor's Wetlands Restoration Initiative for wetland conservation and creation. ACCOMPLISHMENTS, STATUS AND TRENDS  Regulatory Activities MDE's Wetlands and Waterways Program administers regulatory and planning functions which address the protection, conservation, and management of Maryland's tidal and nontidal wetlands, waterways and floodplains. Although these functions are conducted under state statutes and regulations, the challenge is to look beyond the boundaries of state environmental programs to local and federal government authorities and to develop partnerships that take advantage of similar requirements. The goal of these partnerships is not only to establish an efficient regulatory process that eliminates duplicative government actions, but also to produce a strong commitment to resource protection, restoration, conservation and management. Another challenge is to establish mechanisms to enhance customer service. One of the most effective methods implemented to date has been a pre-application meeting, which enable MDE staff to review projects during the planning stages in cooperation with local governments. Using this strategy, all regulatory requirements can be addressed, contradictory requirements can be identified, and an environmentally sensitive project can be designed that complies with both State statutes and local ordinances. Wetland protection and management in Maryland continues to achieve the State's no-net loss goal. A tidal wetland permit or license must be obtained before a person fills, dredges, or otherwise alters a tidal wetland. Similarly, a nontidal wetlands and waterways permit is required for grading or filling activities, excavation or dredging, changing existing drainage patterns, disturbing the water level or water table, or destroying or removing wetland vegetation. Working with our environmental partners, this program received a multi-year award from the Maryland Department of Transportation under the federal Transportation Equity Act for the Twenty First Century (TEA-21) which provides funding for a wide variety of wetland creation projects for mitigating road construction. In recent years, the regulatory program has limited the loss of vegetated tidal wetlands to less than one acre per year. More importantly, Maryland is realizing a net gain in tidal wetlands through mitigation and enhancement projects. Fiscal Year 1999 continued this trend with authorized losses of 0.119 acres, offset by the creation of 7.19 acres of tidal wetlands. Since the inception of the State's nontidal wetland regulatory program in 1991, nontidal wetland losses have averaged approximately 35 acres per year. For Fiscal Year 1999, authorized losses were 22.95 acres, which were mitigated   New Initiatives CHAPTER 3: ADMINISTERING THE AGREEMENT I. Communication and Coordination II. Dispute Resolution III.

While permit compliance rates for tidal and nontidal wetland activities remain constant at 98-99%, the efficiency measure for FY 1999 suggests a decline in the number of significant violations resolved per the total number of significant violations for nontidal, tidal and floodplain activities. This decline is due to the increasing number of unresolved violations (some carried over from prior fiscal year) pending further action by the Administration. Governor's Wetlands Restoration Initiative MDE's regulatory efforts will be enhanced by the Governor's Wetland Restoration Initiative, which strengthens Maryland's policy of ""no net loss"" of wetlands by including a specific target to increase the State's wetland acreage base by 10 percent. A steering committee of State, federal and local agencies, business and development interests, mining and agricultural interests, and environmental groups has been appointed by the Governor to provide guidance on wetland restoration opportunities and advise on the development of the State Wetland Conservation Plan. This ambitious voluntary effort is a commitment to create, restore, or enhance 60,000 acres of wetlands to restore Maryland's wetland base to post-World War II levels. Wetland gains were also demonstrated under Governor Glendening's Wetland Restoration Initiative. Since its introduction in May of 1997, approximately 1,500 acres of wetlands have been created statewide. This trend should continue with the development of new outreach programs like the State's Landowner Stewardship Referral Service. This cooperative effort, between the Departments of Natural Resources, Environment and Agriculture, Maryland Environmental Trust, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Ducks Unlimited, and the Wetlands Restoration Steering Committee, encourages stewardship programs on privately owned properties to restore critical habitats and protect our waterways from pollutants.

ACTION: Final rule.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is implementing regulations regarding sewage  and graywater discharges from certain cruise vessels transiting  applicable waters of Alaska. Operators of cruise vessels carrying 500  or more passengers and transiting applicable waters of Alaska are  restricted in where they may discharge effluents and will be required  to perform testing of sewage and graywater discharges and maintain  records of such discharges. The Coast Guard will inspect, monitor, and  oversee this process to ensure compliance with applicable water quality  laws and regulations.  DATES: This rule shall be effective on July 26, 2001.  ADDRESSES: Comments and material received from the public, as well as  documents indicated in this preamble as being available in the docket,  are part of docket CGD17-01-003 and are available for inspection or  copying at room 751 of the Federal Building in Juneau, AK between 9:30  a.m. and 2 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: LCDR Spencer Wood, Seventeenth  District (moc), 907-463-2809.  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Regulatory Information      On April 25, 2001, we published a notice of proposed rulemaking  (NPRM) entitled Discharge of Effluents in Certain Alaskan Waters by  Cruise Vessel Operations in the Federal Register (66 FR 20770). We  received 7 letters commenting on the proposed rule. No public hearing  was requested, and none was held.     Under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), the Coast Guard finds that good cause  exists for making this rule effective less than 30 days after  publication in the Federal Register. The regulations enacted by this  final rule are the product of ``Title XIV--Certain Alaskan Cruise Ship  Operations'' of the Miscellaneous Appropriations Bill (H.R. 5666)  passed by Congress on December 21, 2000 in the Consolidated  Appropriations Act of 2001 (Pub. L. 106-554) (``Title XIV''). Discussed  at greater length below, Title XIV gives the Coast Guard new  enforcement tools essential to curb current sewage and graywater  effluent discharges from large cruise vessels in Alaskan waters. There  is good cause to make this final rule effective upon publishing because  the Coast Guard needs the regulations to enforce the standards set in  Title XIV during the summer 2001 cruise season. The lack of a final  rule has inhibited enforcement of the new legislation during this  season. The Coast Guard has initiated law enforcement action against  two vessels that arrived during the first week of the season for  violating the Title XIV standards. These and other potential violators  of the legislation and these regulations, in particular the self- reporting and record keeping requirements, are currently escaping  complete enforcement action. The inability to wholly enforce Congress'  mandate in Title XIV will continue until the rule is made effective.  Further, the majority (6 of 7) of the public comments received stated  that the Coast Guard should immediately begin enforcement of these  proposed regulations.  Background and Purpose      Congress passed Title XIV in response to public concern with  environmental impacts of cruise vessels on Alaska waters. This  legislation was drafted in the wake of past incidents of illegal  wastewater discharges, the discovery of high levels of fecal coliform  in legal discharges of treated sewage and graywater, the projected  growth of the industry, and the trend within the industry towards  larger vessels that carry over 5000 people.     In December of 1999, a task force comprised of representatives from  the federal government, State government, the cruise industry, and  environmental groups was established to develop voluntary procedures  for sampling and analyzing wastes generated by cruise vessels while  operating in Alaska's waters during the 2000 cruise vessel season.     During the summer 2000 cruise season, the relevant segment of the  cruise industry voluntarily agreed not to discharge treated sewage or  graywater while in port, not to discharge garbage or untreated sewage  in Southeast Alaska's ``Donut Holes'' (bodies of water greater than  three miles from any shoreline yet within Alaska's inside passage), and  not to discharge treated sewage or graywater, unless more than 10 miles  from port and proceeding at a speed of not less than 6 knots.     Additionally, a voluntary sampling and testing protocol and Quality  Assurance/Quality Control Plan (QA/QPC) for treated sewage and  graywater were developed. The protocol and QA/QPC were applied to 21  cruise vessels calling on Alaska ports during the 2000 season.     The test results revealed that the majority of the vessels'  discharges, both treated sewage and graywater, exceeded marine  sanitation device (MSD) design standards for water quality of 200 fecal  coliform per 100 milliliters and 150 milligrams per liter total  suspended solids (TSS). The high levels of fecal coliform and TSS found  in treated sewage indicate that the MSDs used by cruise vessels may not  be operating properly or functioning as designed. The Coast Guard  boarded 15 vessels as a result of high fecal coliform and TSS levels.  Five vessels were found to have evidence of improperly functioning  MSDs. The source of the high fecal coliform and TSS found in graywater  has yet to be positively determined.     Concurrent with this voluntary sampling process, Congress was  drafting legislation that addressed sewage and graywater discharges in  Alaska's waters and sought to close the ``Donut Holes'' located in  Southeast Alaska's Inside Passage to untreated sewage discharge. This  legislation was enacted into law on December 21, 2000, as part of the  Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001 in the form of Title XIV.  [[Page 38927]]      The summer 2001 cruise season began on May 1st. As in the past two  seasons, the cruise industry has consented to voluntarily participate  in a sampling protocol. The regulatory requirements set forth in the  NPRM are being observed voluntarily. Despite notice of the new  standards and voluntary industry participation in a sampling program  based on those standards, the Coast Guard has initiated law enforcement  action against two vessels that arrived during the first week of the  season for violating the Title XIV standards. However, this law  enforcement action has been limited in the absence of the regulations  stated in this final rule.     These regulations are in response to Title XIV statutory mandate to  draft implementing regulations. Section 1406 of Title XIV directs the  Secretary to incorporate into the commercial vessel examination program  an inspection regime sufficient to verify that operators of cruise  vessels carrying 500 or more passengers and visiting ports in the State  of Alaska or operating in the applicable waters of Alaska are in full  compliance with the environmental record keeping and equipment  requirements of Title XIV, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as  amended, and any regulations issued there under, other applicable  Federal laws and regulations, and all applicable international treaty  requirements. The applicable waters of Alaska are defined as the waters  of the Alexander Archipelago, the navigable waters of the United States  within the State of Alaska, and the Kachemak Bay National Estuarine  Research Reserve.  Discussion of Comments and Changes      As noted above, the Coast Guard received 7 comments on the NPRM.  These comments were received from private individuals and  representatives of private environmental organizations. No comments  were received from the cruise ship industry. The comments raised both  general issues about Title XIV and the proposed regulations and  specific issues about the language of the proposed regulations.     The general issues indicated three things. First, commenters  uniformly supported the new legislation and recommended immediate  enforcement of the statute and the proposed regulations. Second, the  majority of the letters urged the Coast Guard to seek increased funding  to ensure rigorous implementation and enforcement of the regulations.  Third, the letters recommended the Coast Guard use as many unannounced  inspections of cruise vessels as necessary to ensure pollution control  equipment is functioning properly.     In raising these general issues, commenters did not recommend  specific changes to the proposed regulations, therefore none have been  made. The first general comment recommending immediate enforcement of  the proposed regulation does, however, support the Coast Guard's  determination that good cause exists for the final rule to be made  effective upon publishing.     One of the 7 comments stated that Title XIV and the proposed  regulations would only create a large environmental problem and that  all cruise ship effluent discharges should be directed to shoreside  processing plants. This comment sought action that is beyond the scope  of Title XIV and this rulemaking. As such, no changes were made in  response to this comment.     Four commenters recommended immediate designation of ``no-discharge  zones'' under Sec. 159.309(a)(2). This section, along with section 1404  of Title XIV from which Sec. 159.309(a)(2) is derived, does not provide  for establishment of no-discharge zones. Instead, they provide for  establishment of areas less than a mile from shore, by the Coast Guard  in consultation with the State of Alaska, for discharge by cruise  ships. The language in Sec. 159.309(a)(2) is directly quoted from the  law. Establishment of no-discharge zones is provided for in Title XIV  section 1410, however, it gives authority to State of Alaska to  petition the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to  establish no-discharge zones, not the Coast Guard. Therefore,  establishment of no-discharge zones is not addressed in this  rulemaking.     Four commenters criticized Secs. 159.309(b)(5) and (6) for being  too general and recommendations were made that a more specific sampling  regime be used. The Coast Guard disagrees with these comments and has  made no changes to these sections. The language in Secs. 159.309(b)(5)  and (6) allows for current and future advances in effluent discharge  technology and gives the Captain of the Port (COTP) discretion to  tailor testing for individual vessels. Similarly, there were four  recommendations that the Coast Guard develop a more specific Quality  Assurance /Quality Control Plan (QA/QCP) than that prescribed in  Sec. 159.317(b). This section also has not been changed to ensure COTP  flexibility in the face of varying vessel effluent discharge systems.  The Coast Guard believes these concerns are more appropriately  addressed during review of the QA/QCP and VSSP.     Four commenters recommended that the language of Sec. 159.313(b) be  expanded to include inspection of Marine Sanitation Devices, holding  tanks, and other equipment. This equipment is already being examined by  the Coast Guard and the existing language ``general examination of the  vessel'' includes this specific equipment obviating the need for more  specific direction to Coast Guard inspectors.     Four commenters recommended expansion of the Graywater Discharge  Record Book minimum requirements to specify whether the effluent was  treated or untreated, and, if treated, in what manner or with what  specific technology or equipment. The Coast Guard agrees with this  suggestion and has modified Sec. 159.315 to reflect this change.     One commenter recommended that the requirement under  Sec. 159.317(a)(1) be modified to ensure QA/QCPs be uniformly  applicable to all cruise ships. The Coast Guard agrees and the language  of this section has been modified. In addition, the requirement for  submission of a Vessel Specific Sampling Plan has been moved from this  section to Sec. 159.317(a)(3). The Coast Guard believes this change is  necessary after observation of the startup of the 2001 cruise season.  This change is intended to allow a third party contractor, hired to  conduct the sampling, to develop a VSSP adequate for operations in the  applicable waters of Alaska. Therefore, submission of the VSSP should  occur within 30 days of each vessel's initial entry into the applicable  waters of Alaska.     Four commenters recommended the self certification requirement  under Sec. 159.317(a)(2) be based on current samples from treated  sewage and graywater effluents. The Coast Guard agrees and the language  of this section has been modified to ensure that samples are coincident  with the cruise vessel's window of time for annual self certification.     One commenter recommended a requirement be included in Sec. 159.315  that copies of the Sewage and Graywater Discharge Record Book be  submitted to the Coast Guard and Alaska Department of Environmental  Conservation at regular intervals. The Coast Guard disagrees. The  current language provides for maintenance of the Sewage and Graywater  Discharge Record Book on board the vessel and that it be readily  available for inspection. In addition, language under Sec. 159.313(b)  provides that a copy of any entry in the Sewage and Graywater Discharge  Record Book may be made and the Master of the vessel may be required to  certify that the  [[Page 38928]]  copy is a true copy of the original entry. The Sewage and Graywater  Discharge Record Book is an enforcement tool to ensure compliance with  environmental laws and regulations. The Coast Guard has determined that  maintenance of this record on board the vessel, with full access by the  Coast Guard, is adequate to ensure compliance as mandated by Title XIV.  Regulatory Evaluation      This rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under section  3(f) of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, and does  not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section  6(a)(3) of that Order. The Office of Management and Budget has not  reviewed it under that Order. It is not ``significant'' under the  regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation  (DOT)(44 FR 11040, February 26, 1979). A draft Regulatory Evaluation  under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT  follows:     A Quality Assurance/Quality Control Plan (QA/QCP) with Vessel  Specific Sampling Plan (VSSP) is required by these regulations to  establish procedures for collecting and analyzing treated sewage and  graywater samples from cruise vessels. During the summer 2000 voluntary  cruise vessel sampling program a single QA/QCP, acceptable to the Coast  Guard, was used by all 21 cruise vessels. A VSSP was then developed for  each vessel. It is anticipated the same, or similar depending on the  laboratory used, QA/QCP and VSSP will be used for subsequent summer  cruise vessel seasons negating the need to develop new ones. The Coast  Guard is not able to estimate the burden that may be associated with  individual cruise vessel revisions to the QA/QCP and VSSP, if any.     The annual burden of creating and maintaining a Sewage and  Graywater Discharge Record Book on 23 cruise vessels is expected to be  $460. This estimate is for the cost of purchasing a record book and  maintaining it onboard each vessel. Entries into the record book should  be made during the normal routine of the engineering watch so no  additional labor costs are expected.     During the summer 2000 cruise vessel voluntary sampling program,  the cruise industry operating in Alaska spent an estimated $65,000 on  sampling of cruise vessels while underway. An additional estimated  $150,000 was spent in having the samples analyzed for conventional  pollutants and the complete suite of priority pollutants listed in 40  CFR 401.15. The summer 2000 sampling program included two separate  sampling events on 21 cruise vessels from all overboard treated sewage  and graywater effluents and marine sanitation devices. In addition to  the conventional pollutant suites, one of the two sampling events  included samples drawn for a complete suite of priority pollutants  analysis.     These regulations provide for a similar sampling and analysis  regime with cost savings in some areas and offsetting cost increases in  others. While the number of more costly priority pollutants analysis  will decrease, the number of overall sampling events for conventional  pollutants will likely increase. Also, the number of respondents is  expected to increase from 21 to 23. Therefore, the annual burden for  sampling and analysis under these regulations is estimated to be  $215,000. When divided by the number of participants, the annual cost  to each individual vessel is estimated to be $9,348. The estimated cost  to each cruise vessel line is as follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                     Cruise line                      Vessels      Cost ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Princess Cruises..................................          6    $56,088 Holland American..................................          6     56,088 Celebrity.........................................          2     18,696 Norwegian.........................................          2     18,696 Royal Caribbean...................................          2     18,696 Carnival..........................................          1      9,348 Japan.............................................          1      9,348 World Explorer....................................          1      9,348 Crystal Cruises...................................          1      9,348 Radisson Seven Seas...............................          1      9,348 ------------------------------------------------------------------------      The cost is based on two sampling events on each cruise vessel. One  sample event would be required within 30 days of entering Alaska  waters. The second sample event, although discretionary by the Coast  Guard, will be taken from vessels that visit Alaskan waters at least  four times a year. Additional samples and analysis may be required,  along with the associated cost increase, should the initial sample  results indicate noncompliance.     The Coast Guard is not able to estimate the costs that might be  incurred if a cruise vessel cannot certify that their discharges meet  the applicable standards, and does not have the capacity to hold all of  its discharges while transiting the applicable waters of Alaska. In  that scenario, it is believed that the cruise vessel would need to  alter its cruise itinerary in order to leave the applicable Alaskan  waters and enter the high seas, thus enabling the vessel to discharge.  We asked for comments to help us estimate this cost, but none were  received.  Small Entities      Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), we have  considered whether this rule would have a significant economic impact  on a substantial number of small entities. The term ``small entities''  comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are  independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields,  and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000.     Because the population of affected cruise vessels are owned by  entities that do not qualify as small entities, the Coast Guard  certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule will not have a  significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  Collection of Information      This rule provides for a collection of information under the  Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). As defined in  5 CFR 1320.3(c), ``collection of information'' includes reporting,  record keeping, monitoring, posting, labeling, and other, similar  actions. The title and description of the collections, a description of  the respondents, and an estimate of the total annual burden follow.  Included in the estimate is the time for reviewing instructions,  searching existing sources of data, gathering and maintaining the data  needed, and completing and reviewing the collection.

L. 106-554).     Proposed use of Information: Regulatory oversight and compliance  assurance.     Description of the Respondents: Master or other person having  charge of each cruise vessel authorized to carry 500 or more passengers  while operating in the waters of the Alexander Archipelago and the  navigable waters of the United States within the State of Alaska and  within the Kachemak Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve.  [[Page 38929]]      Number of Respondents: 23.     Frequency of Response: Periodically while operating in the waters  described above.     Burden of Response: There are three separate record keeping  requirements involved in this regulation. Each is addressed separately,  and the estimated total burden follows:     1. Quality Assurance/Quality Control Plan (QA/QCP) with Vessel  Specific Sampling Plan (VSSP) development costs.     A QA/QCP with VSSP is required by these regulations to establish  procedures for collecting and analyzing treated sewage and graywater  samples from cruise vessels. During the summer 2000 voluntary cruise  vessel sampling program, a single QA/QCP acceptable to the Coast Guard,  was used by all 21 cruise vessels. A VSSP was then developed for each  vessel and sampling was conducted in compliance with these documents.  It is anticipated the same, or similar, QA/QCP and VSSP will be used  for subsequent summer cruise vessel seasons negating the need to  develop a new QA/QCP or VSSP. The Coast Guard is not able to estimate  the burden that may be associated with individual cruise vessel  revisions to the QA/QCP or VSSP, if any.     2. Sewage and Graywater Discharge Record Book costs. The annual  burden of creating and maintaining a Sewage and Graywater Discharge  Record Book on 23 cruise vessels is expected to be $460. This estimate  is for the cost of purchasing a record book and maintaining it onboard  each vessel. Entries into the record book should be made during the  normal routine of the engineering watch so no additional labor costs  are expected.     3. Sample collection and analysis costs.     a. During the summer 2000 cruise vessel voluntary sampling program,  the cruise industry operating in Alaska spent an estimated $65,000 on  sampling of cruise vessels while underway. An additional estimated  $150,000 was spent in having the samples analyzed for conventional  pollutants and the complete suite of priority pollutants listed in 40  CFR 401.15. The summer 2000 sampling program included two separate  sampling events on 21 cruise vessels from all overboard treated sewage  and graywater effluents and marine sanitation devices. In addition to  the conventional pollutant suites, one of the two sampling events  included samples drawn for a complete suite of priority pollutants  analysis.     These regulations provide for a similar sampling and analysis  regime with cost savings in some areas and offsetting cost increases in  others. While the number of more costly priority pollutants analysis  will decrease, the number of overall sampling events for conventional  pollutants will likely increase. Also, the number of respondents is  expected to increase from 21 to 23. Therefore, the annual cost for  sampling and analysis under these regulations is estimated to be  $215,000. When divided by the number of participants, the annual cost  to each individual vessel is estimated to be $9,348.     Estimated Total Annual Burden: The estimated total annual burden is  $215,460.     As required by section 3507(d) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of  1995, the Coast Guard submitted a copy of this rule to OMB for its  review of the collection of information.     The Coast Guard solicited public comment on the collection of  information to: (1) Evaluate whether the information is necessary for  the proper performance of the functions of the Coast Guard, including  whether the information will have practical utility; (2) evaluate the  accuracy of the Coast Guard's estimate of the burden of the collection,  including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used; (3)  enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be  collected; and (4) minimize the burden of the collection on those who  are to respond, as by allowing the submittal of responses by electronic  means or the use of other forms of information technology.     OMB has approved our collection of information and assigned to it  OMB control number 2115-0647. This approval expires on December 31,  2001. Persons are not required to respond to a collection of  information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.  Federalism      Under Executive Order 13132, section 3(b), the Coast Guard finds  that a program monitoring effluent discharge from cruise ships  transiting certain Alaskan waters is in the national interest, as  evidenced by Congress in enacting ``Title XIV--Certain Alaskan Cruise  Ship Operations'' as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of  2001 (Pub. L. 106-554). In that legislation, Congress empowered the  Coast Guard to monitor wastewater discharges from cruise ships  transiting certain Alaskan waters.     The sampling, testing and log-keeping program outlined in this  regulation was taken from a similar program that was run on a voluntary  basis during the summer of 2000. That program was one of the results of  the Alaska Cruise Ship Initiative, which grew out of a working group  composed of representatives from the cruise industry, the public,  environmental groups, and state and federal government. The Coast Guard  was one of the federal government representatives on that group. The  working group was begun by the Commissioner of the Alaska Department of  Environmental Conservation (ADEC) in December of 1999.     At the conclusion of the 2000 Alaskan cruise ship season, data from  the voluntary wastewater sampling and testing program showed that none  of the tested vessels were in full compliance with all federal  performance standards for the discharge of treated sewage. This data,  as well as data showing high levels of pollutants in graywater, spurred  the legislation cited above. It also spurred a meeting between the  Alaska governor, ADEC, the Coast Guard, and members of the cruise ship  industry in November of 2000. At this meeting, the governor expressed  his approval of the then-proposed Title XIV, and the greater authority  it granted to the Coast Guard to protect Alaskan waters from  pollutants.     This established cooperation between the Coast Guard and the State  of Alaska, and the State's support of the legislation and voluntary  testing program on which the regulation is based shows how the Coast  Guard has consulted with State officials in accordance with Executive  Order 13132, Section 3(b). The Coast Guard will continue to consult the  State by sharing the results of sample tests with the State, as well as  requiring that discharge logbooks be kept in a format readable by the  Alaskan Department of Environmental Conservation.     Section 6(c)(2) of Executive Order 13132, requires, that if the  agency promulgating the regulations intends that they have preemptive  effect, it state that intention and the rationale on which it is based.  Accordingly, the following statement is provided:     Section 1411 (b) Pub. L. 106-554 specifies that, ``[n]othing in  this Title shall in any way affect or restrict, or be construed to  affect or restrict, the authority of the State of Alaska or any  political subdivision thereof--(1) to impose additional liability or  additional requirements; * * *.'' This language, was drafted so as to  be identical to the savings clause in Section 1018 of the Oil Pollution  Act of 1990, which was recently interpreted by the Supreme Court in the  case of U.S. v. Locke, 120 S.Ct. 1135 (Mar. 6, 2000). The Court held  that a state could regulate regarding actual discharges, but could  [[Page 38930]]  not regulate in the areas of design, construction, alteration, repair,  maintenance, operation, equipping, personnel qualification, or manning  of vessels. In the Department of Transportation's letter transmitting  Title XIV of Pub. L. 106-554 to Congress, we explained that conference  report language on Title XIV should explain that preemption for this  bill would work in the same manner as in OPA 90. We also discussed this  position with the Alaska Attorney General's Office.     Accordingly, these rules are construed in the same manner as OPA  90, as described in the Department of Transportation's views letter  referred to above. Thus, any of these regulations that have the effect  of regulating a cruise vessel's design, construction, alteration,  repair, maintenance, operation, equipping, personnel qualification,  manning and casualty reporting have preemptive effect under existing  U.S. laws and treaties to which the United States is a party. However,  state legislation regulation actual discharges only is not preempted by  these regulations.  Unfunded Mandates Reform Act      The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531-1538)  requires Federal agencies to assess the effects of their discretionary  regulatory actions. In particular, the Act addresses actions that may  result in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in  the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 or more in any  one year. Though this rule will not result in such an expenditure, we  do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere in this preamble.  Taking of Private Property      This rule will not effect a taking of private property or otherwise  have taking implications under Executive Order 12630, Governmental  Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property  Rights.  Civil Justice Reform      This rule meets applicable standards in sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2)  of Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform, to minimize litigation,  eliminate ambiguity, and reduce burden.  Protection of Children      We have analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13045, Protection  of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks. This rule  is not an economically significant rule and does not create an  environmental risk to health or risk to safety that may  disproportionately affect children.  Indian Tribal Governments      This rule does not have tribal implications under Executive Order  13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments,  because it does not have a substantial direct effect on one or more  Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and  Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities  between the Federal Government and Indian tribes.  Environment      We have considered the environmental impact of this rule and  concluded that, under figure 2-1, paragraph (34)(d), of Commandant  Instruction M16475.1C, this rule is categorically excluded from further  environmental documentation. This proposed regulation would require  operators of cruise vessels carrying 500 or more passengers in Alaskan  waters to document treated sewage and graywater discharges to ensure  that they comply with effluent discharge standards. The content of  effluent discharges reflects compliant equipment operations. A  ``Categorical Exclusion Determination'' is available in the docket  where indicated under ADDRESSES.  Energy Effects      We have analyzed this rule under Executive Order 13211, Actions  Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply,  Distribution, or Use. We have determined that it is not a ``significant  energy action'' under that order because it is not a ``significant  regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866 and is not likely to  have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution, or use  of energy. It has not been designated by the Administrator of the  Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs as a significant energy  action. Therefore, it does not require a Statement of Energy Effects  under Executive Order 13211.

Children (especially very young children) and fetuses are most vulnerable.  The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), part of the U.S. Public Health Service, and the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  are jointly issuing an alert to the general public.  There is a continuing pattern of metallic mercury exposure in children and teenagers and in persons using certain folk medicines or participating in certain ethnic or religious practices.   It is important for the general public to understand that either short-term or long-term exposures to metallic mercury can lead to serious health problems.  Human exposure to metallic mercury occurs primarily from breathing contaminated air. Other forms of mercury can be absorbed by drinking contaminated water, eating food (usually fish containing mercury), and from skin contact. At high levels, metallic mercury can cause effects on the nervous system and the developing fetus.  Other forms of mercury can damage other organs. Even at low levels, metallic mercury can cause health problems.  Metallic mercury exposure can cause harm before symptoms arise.   Once released into the environment, mercury is very hard to clear up.  If it is left unattended where exposures can occur, it can have dangerous effects on human health.    Incidents involving schoolchildren    In recent years, increasing numbers of metallic mercury spills and contamination involving schoolchildren have been reported:   In August 1994, more than 500 students in Belle Glade, Florida, were contaminated with metallic mercury after three children found 4 jars (totalling 55 pounds) of metallic-mercury in an abandoned van. The local hazardous waste materials team decontaminated the children (removed contaminated clothing and washed the metallic mercury from their skin). More than 20 families had to be evacuated while their homes were decontaminated.     In November 1994, college students at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida, removed metallic mercury from one of the school's laboratories. Students living in the dormitory were evacuated and housed in a local hotel while the dormitory was decontaminated.    In June 1996, metallic mercury was taken from a middle school in St. Joseph, Missouri, and used in and outside of school by a group of teenagers. Approximately 200 children were tested for mercury exposure; one child was hospitalized and another five underwent outpatient treatment to remove the mercury from their systems; 20 other children had mildly elevated mercury levels. Two homes and a car required extensive decontamination.   In October 1996, a high school in Oskaloosa, Kansas and a convalescent home in Johnson County, Kansas, were contaminated with metallic mercury; 52 students and an unknown number of residents of the home were tested. On the basis of ATSDR recommendations, the school was closed for a week until indoor air levels were safe. A month later, sampling at the school identified an increase in air mercury concentrations.  The school was re-evaluated and additional clean-up was done as recommended by ATSDR.     In November 1996, ATSDR again assisted state health officials and EPA in evaluating contamination at a high school and a home in Dallas, Pennsylvania, near Wilkes-Barre. Four areas in the school had levels of metallic mercury contamination that required cleanup.   In March 1997, a middle school student on his way to school found metallic mercury on the street in front of his home in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. The student took the metallic mercury to school and shared it with three to four classmates. Also, in March 1997 a broken mercury thermometer was discovered after school on the floor of a bathroom stall in the boys bathroom. One thermometer was confirmed missing from the science department's inventory. The school was found to be clear of contamination with the exception of one science laboratory and the carpet in a classroom. Two homes required decontamination.    Schoolteachers, particularly science teachers, and administrators need to be aware of students' interest in mercury, especially metallic mercury, and take steps to ensure that children are aware of its dangers and that any mercury kept in school is safely and securely contained.     Incidents involving religious practices    Persons who use metallic mercury in ethnic folk medicine and for religious practices are at risk. Metallic mercury is sold under the name  ""azogue""  in stores (sometimes called botanicas), which specialize in religious items used in Esperitismo (a spiritual belief system native to Puerto Rico), Santeria (a Cuban-based religion that venerates both African deities and Catholic saints), and voodoo.    The use of azogue in religious practices is recommended in some Hispanic communities by family members, spiritualists, card readers, and santeros. Typically, azogue is carried on one's person in a sealed pouch prepared by a spiritual leader or sprinkled in the home or automobile. Some botanica owners suggest mixing it in bath water or perfume and placing it in devotional candles.    General facts    The following are general facts about metallic mercury and its risks, as well as information about how people can protect themselves from exposure and resulting health effects.    What is mercury and how is it used?    Mercury occurs naturally in the environment in several forms.  Metallic Mercury is the liquid form used in thermometers.  Mercury is also used in other common consumer products such as fluorescent light bulbs, barometers, medical equipment such as blood pressure measurement instruments, and mercury switches in children's sneakers that light up. This alert concentrates on metallic mercury, but hazards are also associated with other types. Of these, the most common is methyl mercury contamination of fish.    How could I be exposed to mercury?    In the previously described school-associated cases, children were unaware of the dangers involved in exposing themselves and their families to this deadly poison. Adults are also often unaware of the hazards associated with mercury; some have even brought it home from work for children to play with. Just one-half teaspoon of mercury spilled in the home can be dangerous.   Adults using certain folk medicines or participating in certain religious or ethnic practices may also expose themselves and their families to metallic mercury's effects. Because metallic mercury vaporizes into the air at room temperatures, it presents an immediate health risk to anyone spending a significant amount of time in a room where metallic mercury is sprinkled or spilled onto the floor, or where opened containers of metallic mercury are present. Very small amounts of metallic mercury (for example, a few drops) can raise air concentrations to levels that may be harmful to health.    How does mercury affect health?    At high levels, metallic mercury can cause effects on the nervous system and the developing fetus.  Other forms of mercury can damage other organs. Even at low levels, metallic mercury can cause health problems. Mercury exposure can begin to cause harm before symptoms arise. Once symptoms do arise, health problems related to metallic mercury poisoning can include tremors, changes in vision or hearing, insomnia, weakness, difficulty with memory, headache, irritability, shyness and nervousness, and a health condition called acrodynia.     Pregnant women and their fetuses are especially vulnerable to the toxic effects of metallic mercury because it readily passes from the placenta to the fetus. Mercury may accumulate in higher concentrations in the unborn baby than in the mother. Young children, who often play on the floor where metallic mercury may have been spilled, are particularly at risk for effects on the central nervous system. Mercury vapors are readily absorbed into the bloodstream from the lungs, and the human central nervous system, which is still developing during the first few years of life, may become damaged.    Health effects can result from short-term or long-term exposure. The body gets rid of mercury through the urine and feces. Removal of this substance from the body can take up to several months after exposure. Acrodynia is characterized by itching, swelling, and flushing; pink-colored palms and soles of the feet; excessive perspiration; rashes; irritability; fretfulness; sleeplessness; joint pains and weakness. Children exposed to metallic mercury for long periods may have trouble learning in school. When mercury levels in the body are extremely high, ""chelation"" therapy is necessary. Chelation therapy involves putting a chemical into the bloodstream; the chemical combines with the mercury to aid in its removal from the body.     Prevention is the key to avoiding poisoning in homes, schools, and families.    What is mercury contamination and how can I prevent it?    First, avoid using metallic mercury.  Appropriate substitutes are available for nearly all uses of metallic mercury.  Therefore, be sure you need to use it. If not, make arrangements to safely dispose of whatever metallic mercury you might have. If you do need to use metallic mercury, make sure it is safely stored in a leakproof container. Keep it in a secure space (e.g., a locking closet) so that others cannot easily get it.  Use of metallic mercury in a controlled environment helps to reduce the risk that contamination will occur.    Mercury contamination results from exposure through the air, water, food, soil, or direct contact.  Exposure to metallic mercury occurs when it is not stored in a closed container. Contamination may include the spilling of metallic mercury on clothes, furniture, carpet, floors, walls, the natural environment, and even the human body.  Metallic mercury and its vapors are extremely difficult to remove from such items as clothes, furniture, carpet, floors, and walls. The vapors will also accumulate in walls and other structures in contaminated rooms. The contamination can remain for months or years, posing a risk to exposed individuals. The use of metallic mercury in a home or apartment not only poses a threat to persons currently residing in that structure, but also to those who subsequently occupy that dwelling and are unaware of the past mercury use.   Can I clean up mercury with a vacuum cleaner?    Never use a vacuum cleaner. Using a vacuum cleaner causes metallic mercury to vaporize in the air, creating greater health risks. It also ruins the vacuum cleaner.    Can electronic equipment collect mercury vapors?    Metallic mercury vapors can accumulate in electronic equipment, especially computers.  When the computer is turned on, the mercury revaporizes. This cycle of metallic mercury collecting and vaporizing from computers has been seen in several incidents in schools.   What should I do to keep my home safe?    Metallic mercury is used in a variety of household and industrial items including thermostats, fluorescent light bulbs, barometers, glass thermometers, and some blood pressure machines. Care must be taken in handling and disposing of all items in the home that contain metallic mercury.   First,  do NOT  try to vacuum or heat the metallic mercury in any way.  Mercury vapors are very dangerous and are virtually undetectable.  Avoid breathing mercury dust, vapor, mist, or gas.  Avoid contact with eyes, skin, and clothing. If you feel you have been exposed directly to metallic mercury, wash thoroughly after handling.  Remove contaminated clothing and wash before reuse. Provide as much clean air as possible.    For example, if a thermometer breaks, remove children from the area. Clean up the bead of metallic mercury by carefully rolling it onto a sheet of paper or sucking it up with an eye dropper. After picking up the metallic mercury, put it into a bag or airtight container. The paper or eye dropper should also be bagged and disposed of properly according to guidance provided by environmental officials or your local health department. Try to ventilate the room to the outside and close off from the rest of the home. Use fans for a minimum of one hour to speed the ventilation. If larger amounts of metallic mercury are found (for example, a jar), make sure that the metallic mercury is in an airtight container and call your local health department for instructions in how to safely dispose of it. If the larger amount is spilled, leave the area and contact your local health department and fire authorities.  Do not simply throw it away, but instead seek professional guidance.    ATSDR and EPA do not recommend the use of uncontained metallic (liquid) mercury (that is, mercury not properly enclosed in glass as it is in thermometers) in homes, automobiles, day care centers, schools, offices, and other public buildings.

The State of Alaska last year passed the first state law providing          for inspection, monitoring, and oversight of cruise ships and setting          standards for wastewater discharges.         ""We're pleased          to see a sharp decrease in the number of smoke violations and emissions          complaints from the public this year as compared to last,"" said Commissioner          Michele Brown. ""The cruise companies have been attentive and inventive          in achieving emissions improvements, attributable to the use of shoreside          power, fuel additives, and increased use of gas turbine engines.""                   The wastewater treatment          progress has been more mixed. ""Seven ships have installed advanced          wastewater treatment systems which meet all standards when operating properly.          These systems are costly and represent a serious commitment to prevent          polluting our waters. We remain concerned, however, that ten large and          three small vessels still opt to discharge wastewater outside state waters          rather than improve treatment,"" Brown said. ""Vessels that choose          this course may not be treating wastes and do not provide the monitoring          and verification required by the Alaska program.""         As a result, Governor          Tony Knowles has asked the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to take          action to curb cruise ship wastewater discharges beyond Alaska's waters.          ""I ask the Environmental Protection Agency to take swift and firm          action to control sewage and graywater discharges from cruise ships operating          both inside and outside of Alaska waters,"" Knowles wrote in a letter          last year.         Knowles specifically          asked the EPA to prohibit wastewater discharges in U.S. waters unless          the wastes have been processed through a properly operating and maintained          sewage treatment system, to set strict treatment standards, and to require          testing. ""It's not acceptable to simply move sewage outside Alaska's          borders,"" Knowles said. ""Alaskans are concerned that the continuous          discharge of wastewater with high levels of contamination may result in          unintended impacts that could harm marine life.""         The mid-season report          summarizes the performance of large and small vessels, under the new state          law, based on data collected through the first week of August. The new          state program requires registration and fees, which finance the oversight          effort. A final report is expected to come out after the end of the season.         Forty-four cruise          ships registered this year: 25 large vessels, 14 small ones, and 5 ferries.          Small vessels accommodate between 50 and 249 overnight passengers.         The following summarizes          where cruise vessels are discharging their wastewater:         "" Seven ships          have installed advanced wastewater treatment to remove bacteria and solids.          Six of these meet very stringent requirements that allow them to discharge          at any time in Alaska waters. One vessel meets the standards set for discharging          over one mile from shore while cruising at a minimum of six knots.         "" Eight large          ships hold their blackwater (sewage) for discharge outside state waters          and discharge graywater over one mile from shore while cruising at a minimum          of six knots. The law provided for a transition period to phase in graywater          treatment. Next season, all vessels must treat graywater to the same level          as blackwater before discharging in state waters.         "" 10 large ships          hold both black and gray water for discharge outside state waters.         "" 19 small ships          and ferries must test their wastewater but don't need to meet standards          until January 2004 and can discharge black and graywater anywhere, anytime.         Carolyn Morehouse          of DEC's Commercial Passenger Vessel Environmental Compliance program          said that DEC has not received laboratory results on tests for other pollutants          in the wastewater discharged in Alaska's waters.          DEC is investigating          a discharge of foamy sludge August 17th from the Ryndam at a dock in Juneau.          Sample test results are still pending. The Ryndam is one of five of Holland          America's six Alaska-bound ships that use advanced wastewater treatment.          Morehouse said that the discharge appears accidental, but DEC will be          fully investigating since proper operation of a wastewater system is as          important as having a quality system.         The report notes          that DEC increased its smoke readings by five percent to include for the          first time Southcentral Alaska ports of Seward, Valdez, Kodiak, Cordova          and Whittier. Previous ambient air monitoring studies in Juneau, with          the highest cruise ship traffic, showed levels well below regulatory standards.         A Science Advisory          Panel of independent experts continues to help DEC assess the impact of          wastewater discharges from cruise ships and ferries on human health and          the Alaska environment. The panel's findings will be included in an assessment          report on the impact of small commercial passenger vessels in Alaska,          due out in December.                    ##         For more information          contact Carolyn Morehouse, 465-5279.

GX232-87-12394531	"Marina Management Once you have adopted some of the best management practices outlined in this Guidebook, tell people about it! Train your staff so that they will routinely minimize pollution. Inform boaters how their actions can effect water quality. And let the public know that you are doing your part to protect the environment.  Staff Training Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan. The General Permit for Discharges from Marinas requires that you teach your employees about the components and goals of the stormwater pollution prevention plan. The training must be conducted at least twice a year and must address the following topics as applicable. u Used oil management u Spent solvent management u Proper disposal of spent abrasives u Disposal of vessel wastewater u Spill prevention and control u Fueling procedures u General good housekeeping u Painting and blasting procedures u Used battery management Also, provide training on the proper use of equipment such as dustless sanders and high-volume low-pressure spray guns. Refer to Appendix XI for a training guide to help you organize and track your employee training. Emergency Response Plans. During a real emergencywhen time is of the essenceyou will want people to know what to do and how to do it. v Review plans and response procedures with staff at the beginning of each boating season. v Train employees in the use of containment measures. v Run emergency response drills at least twice annually.  Invite the U.S. Coast Guard and local fire department to demonstrate emergency response procedures at your marina. Be Watchful. Involve all employees in policing your marina for waste. Encourage your staff to look for and immediately halt the following activities.  Colored plumes in the water where a hull is being cleaned.  Bilge water discharge with a sheen.  Uncontained sanding, painting, varnishing, or cleaning.  Maintenance debris being washed into the water.  Sewage discharges within the marina.  The use of environmentally harmful cleaning products.  u  --Law or regulation, v--Highly recommended, --Recommended / Maryland Clean Marina Guidebook  65   Approach Polluters. v Determine who will address boaters and contractors who are polluting. Generally speaking, this is a job for the manager. Let your staff know whether they should handle polluters themselves or report pollution incidents to the manager. v Politely inform boaters and contractors why what they are doing is harmful. Describe a more environmentally sensitive method and ask the boater or contractor to stop work until it can be done with less environmental impact. It will be easier to get cooperation if you require boaters and contractors to practice pollution prevention as a condition of their contracts. v If the problem persists, take these additional steps  Talk to the boater or contractor again.  Mail a written notice asking that the harmful practice stop. Keep a record of the mailing.  Remove the problem from the dock. Charge the boater or contractor for the cost of removal and clean-up.  Ask the tenant or contractor to leave your marina. Investigate Community College Offerings. v Look for college courses related to environmental protection. For example, Anne Arundel Community College has offered a course titled Environmental Compliance for Marinas and Boatyards. Maintain Training Records. v Record training dates, topics, and names of employees and instructors. v Keep copies of instructional material.  If a boater is sanding and not containing the debris, bring a vacuum sander to him or her. Explain that it collects most of the dust and allows one to work more quickly. Charge him or her your standard rental fee for the equipment.  Inform Patrons and Independent Contractors The General Permit for Discharges from Marinas requires that customers and contractors be informed about pollution control practices and be required to use them. Incorporate Best Management Practices into Contracts. In addition to being a legal document, contracts are very effective educational tools. Use the contract to inform boaters and contractors how to minimize their environmental impacts. v Include language requiring the use of best management practices in all of your contracts: slip holders, liveaboards, transients, charters, workers, contractors, and tenants. v Include language specifying the consequences for not using best management practices, e.g., failure to use best management practices will result in expulsion from the marina and forfeiture of rental fees. v Include information about requirements for Marine Sanitation Devices.  See Appendix V for sample contract language. Call the Department of Natural Resources if you would like to receive an electronic copy of the contract language.  66  Marina Management   Post Signs Detailing Best Management Practices. v Post signs at fuel docks and pumpout stations, along piers, in vessel maintenance areas, and at dumpsters and recycling stations.

GX235-83-0380639	"Press Release                               October 6, 2000        Alaska Cruise Ship Initiative wastewater testing continues. Initial samples of priority pollutants from four ships analyzed.   See our cruise ship pages           Wastewater samples for priority pollutants, a list of 126 toxic       compounds adopted by Congress in 1977, have been collected and analyzed       for four cruise ships that ply Alaskas waters. Although more analysis       is necessary, preliminary results  do not  indicate that the cruise       ships are mixing hazardous wastes with their wastewater discharges. Mixing       hazardous waste with wastewater discharges is one of the things the       federal government fined Royal Caribbean Cruise Line for last year.         The samples for priority pollutants analyzed thus far indicate elevated       levels of copper, silver, and other trace metals on all four ships, and       lead levels on three ship that are above state water quality standards.       The applicable state water quality standard is designed to protect aquatic       life, so further analysis will be performed to determine the possible       effects on aquatic organisms. However, these metal levels are not above       the state drinking water standard . Trace amounts of a pesticide called       heptachlor were also found on three of the four ships.         The sources of the pollutants are unknown at this time. The ships are       testing the water loaded onto the vessels to see if that may be the source       of the metals. The vessels are also beginning to soften water on board to       reduce the risk of metals from shipboard pipes leeching into the water.       The source of the heptachlor is a mystery, as it has been banned for most       uses in the United States since the 1980s. It is still used outside the       U.S. for termite control and wood treatment. Heptachlor is also present in       chlordane, a pesticide used outside the U.S. primarily in shipping       containers. Chlordane was also banned in the U.S. in the 1980s. Cruise       ship operators are checking imported agricultural products on board to see       if they are the source.         ""We will be tracking these pollutants to their sources,"" said       DEC Cruise Ship Initiative leader Mike Conway. ""When we find the       sources, we will do all we can to eliminate them.""         The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, U.S. Coast Guard,       and EPA are just beginning to receive the raw wastewater sample results       for priority pollutants. Twenty-one large cruise ships were tested this       season in Southeast Alaska.         The Alaska Cruise Ship Initiative Water Quality Work Group, composed of       state and federal agency, industry, community and environmental members,       will be working through the month of October and into November to analyze       these results and answer the questions these results have raised.         ###         For more information contact Mike Conway at 907-465-5337.

The State of Alaska last year passed the first state law providing          for inspection, monitoring, and oversight of cruise ships and setting          standards for wastewater discharges.         ""We're pleased          to see a sharp decrease in the number of smoke violations and emissions          complaints from the public this year as compared to last,"" said Commissioner          Michele Brown. ""The cruise companies have been attentive and inventive          in achieving emissions improvements, attributable to the use of shoreside          power, fuel additives, and increased use of gas turbine engines.""                   The wastewater treatment          progress has been more mixed. ""Seven ships have installed advanced          wastewater treatment systems which meet all standards when operating properly.          These systems are costly and represent a serious commitment to prevent          polluting our waters. We remain concerned, however, that ten large and          three small vessels still opt to discharge wastewater outside state waters          rather than improve treatment,"" Brown said. ""Vessels that choose          this course may not be treating wastes and do not provide the monitoring          and verification required by the Alaska program.""         As a result, Governor          Tony Knowles has asked the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to take          action to curb cruise ship wastewater discharges beyond Alaska's waters.          ""I ask the Environmental Protection Agency to take swift and firm          action to control sewage and graywater discharges from cruise ships operating          both inside and outside of Alaska waters,"" Knowles wrote in a letter          last year.         Knowles specifically          asked the EPA to prohibit wastewater discharges in U.S. waters unless          the wastes have been processed through a properly operating and maintained          sewage treatment system, to set strict treatment standards, and to require          testing. ""It's not acceptable to simply move sewage outside Alaska's          borders,"" Knowles said. ""Alaskans are concerned that the continuous          discharge of wastewater with high levels of contamination may result in          unintended impacts that could harm marine life.""         The mid-season report          summarizes the performance of large and small vessels, under the new state          law, based on data collected through the first week of August. The new          state program requires registration and fees, which finance the oversight          effort. A final report is expected to come out after the end of the season.         Forty-four cruise          ships registered this year: 25 large vessels, 14 small ones, and 5 ferries.          Small vessels accommodate between 50 and 249 overnight passengers.         The following summarizes          where cruise vessels are discharging their wastewater:         "" Seven ships          have installed advanced wastewater treatment to remove bacteria and solids.          Six of these meet very stringent requirements that allow them to discharge          at any time in Alaska waters. One vessel meets the standards set for discharging          over one mile from shore while cruising at a minimum of six knots.         "" Eight large          ships hold their blackwater (sewage) for discharge outside state waters          and discharge graywater over one mile from shore while cruising at a minimum          of six knots. The law provided for a transition period to phase in graywater          treatment. Next season, all vessels must treat graywater to the same level          as blackwater before discharging in state waters.         "" 10 large ships          hold both black and gray water for discharge outside state waters.         "" 19 small ships          and ferries must test their wastewater but don't need to meet standards          until January 2004 and can discharge black and graywater anywhere, anytime.         Carolyn Morehouse          of DEC's Commercial Passenger Vessel Environmental Compliance program          said that DEC has not received laboratory results on tests for other pollutants          in the wastewater discharged in Alaska's waters.          DEC is investigating          a discharge of foamy sludge August 17th from the Ryndam at a dock in Juneau.          Sample test results are still pending. The Ryndam is one of five of Holland          America's six Alaska-bound ships that use advanced wastewater treatment.          Morehouse said that the discharge appears accidental, but DEC will be          fully investigating since proper operation of a wastewater system is as          important as having a quality system.         The report notes          that DEC increased its smoke readings by five percent to include for the          first time Southcentral Alaska ports of Seward, Valdez, Kodiak, Cordova          and Whittier. Previous ambient air monitoring studies in Juneau, with          the highest cruise ship traffic, showed levels well below regulatory standards.         A Science Advisory          Panel of independent experts continues to help DEC assess the impact of          wastewater discharges from cruise ships and ferries on human health and          the Alaska environment. The panel's findings will be included in an assessment          report on the impact of small commercial passenger vessels in Alaska,          due out in December.                    ##         For more information          contact Carolyn Morehouse, 465-5279.

GX236-23-14195679	"4. A.  SPECIAL PROJECTS AND REPORTS Marine Pollution by Cruise Ships (GAO)  The U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) has published a report (GAO/RCED-00-48) dated February 2000 and titled Marine Pollution: Progress Made to Reduce Marine Pollution by Cruise Ships, but Important Issues Remain. The report focuses on the following specific issues: (1) the nature and extent of reported illegal discharge cases for foreign-flagged cruise ships from 1993 through 1998; (2) the efforts of relevant federal agencies to prevent, detect, investigate, and prosecute illegal discharges from foreign-flagged cruise ships; (3) the actions taken by cruise ship companies with proven illegal discharge violations to prevent future illegal discharges; and (4) the views of relevant federal agencies and third-party interest groups regarding the actions that cruise ship companies have taken, and what issues, if any, require further attention. Federal data indicate that foreign-flagged cruise ships were involved in 87 confirmed illegal discharge cases in U.S. waters from 1993 through 1998. Overall, the number of confirmed illegal discharge cases by cruise ships in U.S. waters generally declined during this period. Oil o r related chemicals were discharged in 81 cases; 6 cases involved discharges of garbage or plastic. GAO determined that about three-fourths of these cases were accidental, resulting from human or mechanical error, while the remainder were either intentional or their cause could not be determined from the available information. A few of the 87 cases involved multiple illegal discharge incidents that, according to the U.S. Department of Justice, numbered in the hundreds over the 6-year period. In addition to the 87 confirmed cases, 17 other alleged incidents were referred to the countries where the cruise ships were registered because the incidents occurred outside U.S. waters or because jurisdiction could not be clearly ascertained. Both large and small cruise ship companies were involved in illegal discharge cases. The U.S. Coast Guard, the Department of Justice, and, to a lesser extent, other agencies undertake a variety of efforts to prevent, detect, investigate, or prosecute illegal marine discharges by foreign-flagged cruise ships. The Coast Guard inspects ships in port, watches them as part of aircraft surveillance in the open sea, investigates reported incidents, and, if warranted, adjudicates cases under its civil penalty procedures. However, the Coast Guard' s ability to detect and resolve violations is constrained by the narrow scope of its routine inspections, a significant reduction in aircraft surveillance for marine pollution purposes, and a breakdown of the process for identifying and resolving alleged violations referred to flag states. Both the Coast Guard and the Department of Justice have been involved in these pollution cases, w ith Justice prosecuting the most serious offenses. Civil penalties levied from 1993 through 1998 against cruise ship companies by the Coast Guard ranged from a warning with no penalty to a $17,500 penalty; Justice' criminal penalties against cruise ship companies ranged from s $75,000 to $18 million. In addition, federal agencies have implemented or partially implemented a number of recommendations made by GAO and others to improve the coordination of enforcement, data sharing, and other efforts among relevant agencies. GAO spoke with representatives from 9 cruise ship companies responsible for ships involved in nonaccidental pollution cases, as well as from 3 additional companies (involved in accidental  22   cases) that represent a large segment of the cruise ship industry. These 12 companies have implemented new or updated environmental plans designed to enhance ship safety and prevent pollution. The plans, which were prepared pursuant to new international standards of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) or were mandated by U.S. district courts after the companies pled guilty to pollution violations, call for such steps as regular third-party verification of ships'co mpliance with environmental procedures. Among the 12 companies, the 8 that operate relatively large fleets of ships have taken additional steps to reduce the amounts of plastics and other potential wastes brought onboard, as well as to install incinerators and additional equipment for treating or storing solid wastes, hazardous wastes, and oily bilgewater. Officials from the four smaller companies said they have not had to take these additional steps because their ships are away from port only 5 to 7 hours daily and have space onboard to store wastes until the ships return to port. Officials from the Coast Guard, the Department of Justice, and the Center for Marine Conservation (a nongovernmental, science-based advocacy, research, and public education organization that monitors marine pollution issues) said that cruise ship companies were making progress toward changing a maritime culture that once permitted discharges of garbage and oil from ships before international standards and U.S. laws to control such discharges were adopted. They pointed out, however, that cruise ship companies must demonstrate a sustained commitment to eliminate illegal discharges at sea. Some officials expressed concern about the large volume of wastewater from sinks, showers, drains, and sewage systems that cruise ships legally discharge at sea and the possible effects of these discharges on sensitive marine life.

Sea-Level Rise and Global Climate Change (Pew Center)  The Pew Center on Global Climate Change released a report during February 2000 titled SeaLevel Rise and Global Climate Change: A Review of Impacts to U.S. Coasts. According to the report, climate change is likely to accelerate the historical rise in sea level through warming of oceans and melting of ice, which in turn will affect coastal development, wetland resources, and recreation along U.S. coasts. The impacts of sea-level rise will occur in coastal areas that are continually evolving and already face a wide range of natural and human-induced stresses, including erosion, storms, land subsidence, wetland loss, and environmental degradation from recreation and development pressures. Responses to sea-level rise at the national, state, and local level must therefore reflect an understanding of the complex interactions of human and ecological systems in coastal areas. This report reviews the state of understanding of the impacts of sea-level rise on U.S. coasts. Impact assessment of sea-level rise requires careful assessment of local conditions, the magnitude and uncertainties of global sea-level rise, and the costs and feasibility of response options. Important local conditions include coastal topography, geology, and economic and demographic factors. The areas in the United States most vulnerable to sea-level rise are in the  23   mid-Atlantic and south-Atlantic states (because of low-lying topography, high economic value, and relatively high storm frequency) and along the Gulf Coast (because of low-lying topography and rapid land subsidence). Parts of New England are also at risk, particularly coastal islands in southern New England. The West Coast is generally at lower risk, with the exception of San Francisco Bay and Puget Sound. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1996 concluded that increases in global temperatures over the next century could accelerate the historical rate of global mean sealevel rise from 1 to 2.5 millimeters per year to about 5 millimeters per year (50 centimeters per century), with an uncertainty range of 2 to 9 millimeters per year. More recent work using new greenhouse gas emissions scenarios shows a slightly higher rate of sea-level rise. The impacts of sea-level rise will vary by location and depend on a range of biophysical characteristics and socioeconomic factors, including human response. The primary impacts of sea-level rise are physical changes to the environment. These changes, in turn, affect human uses of the coast such as tourism, settlement, shipping, commercial and recreational fishing, agriculture, and wildlife viewing. The most serious physical impacts of gradual sea-level rise on coastal lowlands are: (1) inundation and displacement of wetlands and lowlands; (2) coastal erosion; (3) increased vulnerability to coastal storm damage and flooding; and (4) salinization of surface water and groundwater. Three options have been proposed to respond to coastal threats: planned retreat, accommodation, and protection. Impact and adaptation assessments evaluate where these responses might be implemented and then calculate the costs of implementation and the damages to resources that are not protected. Generally, property losses or the costs to protect property dominate the existing impact estimates for the United States. The implications of lost wetlands, which are not reflected in most current impact estimates, could also be significant. Based on a review of the existing literature, estimates of the cumulative impacts of a 50-centimeter sea-level rise by 2100 on coastal property range from about $20 billion to $150 billion. Estimates at the low end of the range reflect modeling of the most economically efficient adaptation to sea-level rise. Those estimates at the high end reflect assessments of vulnerability or protection costs, and assume that all currently developed vulnerable areas will be protected, regardless of costs. In many cases, the impacts of sea-level rise could be mitigated by forward-looking state or local land-use policies. The major challenges of future impact assessments include improving their comprehensiveness and accuracy and making their results more accessible and useful to state and local decision-makers who are most able to prepare coastal areas to respond to the threat of sealevel rise.

Site Investigation Requirements for Dredging Works (PIANC)  The International Navigation Association (PIANC) has published a report (ISBN 2-87223-113-7) titled Site Investigation Requirements for Dredging Works. According to this report, dredging works are major operations that are often complex and costly. They may account for a substantial proportion of the cost of maritime projects. Effective planning and execution of dredging works require knowledge about the material to be dredged and the environmental conditions in which the dredging plant will operate. The high mobilization and capital costs of the dredging plant mean that the wrong assessment of basic ground and environmental parameters and consequent selection of unsuitable plant and methods may lead to substantial economic losses. Appropriate ground and environmental surveys are fundamental to the success of dredging operations, from both technical and economic points of view. It is in the interests of both contractor and employer to obtain a full understanding of ground and environmental conditions at the site, in order to ensure the smooth progress of the works and avoid claims and disputes. The survey techniques applicable to the marine environment are different from those applicable on land. The difficulty of working (sometimes in poor conditions), the cost of the specialized techniques that are required, and the often large areas that need to be investigated for dredging projects probably explain why investigations for dredging works are sometimes inadequate. Surveys should be based on a preliminary study of existing geological and environmental data against a background of a preliminary design of what is proposed to be dredged. The study should lead to an overall appreciation of the site and provide a focus on the difficulties likely to be encountered in the course of the works, the types of data that need to be collected, and the areas and depths to be investigated. The field investigations are likely to include one or more of the following: (1) bathymetric surveys to define water depths in and around the dredging and disposal sites; (2) geophysical investigations to identify obstacles on or under the seabed (shipwrecks, pipelines, debris, etc.); (3) geophysical and geotechnical investigations of the bed to identify the types of soil and rock to be dredged, and to define their physical and mechanical properties; and (4) investigation of the environmental conditions (hydraulic, meteorological, etc.) that affect dredging operations. Dredging methods and disposal of dredged materials also may be influenced by contamination of the materials being dredged.

Scrapping Obsolete Vessels (OIG/DOT)  The Office of Inspector General (OIG), U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), has issued a report (MA-2000-067) dated March 10, 2000, and titled Report on the Program for Scrapping Obsolete Vessels. This report presents the results of the OIG audit of the program for scrapping  25   obsolete vessels controlled by DOT' Maritime Administration (MARAD). The objectives of s this review were to evaluate MARAD' progress in meeting its legislative mandate to dispose of s obsolete vessels in the National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF) by September 30, 2001; identify what action MARAD has taken toward meeting the mandate; and identify potential alternatives to assist MARAD in achieving its goals. The Merchant Ship Sales Act of 1946 created the NDRF, a U.S. government-owned and administered fleet of inactive, but potentially useful, merchant and nonmilitary vessels to meet shipping requirements during national emergencies. MARAD administers the NDRF, and the Department of Defense (DOD) provides the funding to maintain the Fleet. The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act gave MARAD the responsibility of disposing of all federal government merchant-type vessels of 1,500 gross tons or more. The National Maritime Heritage Act of 1994 requires MARAD to dispose of obsolete vessels in the NDRF by September 30, 2001, in a manner that maximizes financial return to the United States. As of February 29, 2000, 110 vessels were designated for disposal because the majority of them are no longer operational. Eighty-eight of the 110 vessels are slated for scrapping. The remaining 22 vessels will be disposed of through the fish reef program, used by a state or federal agency, or held for useful parts and equipment. With the exception of 2 vessels, MARAD maintains these inactive vessels slated for disposal at the James River Reserve Fleet, Ft. Eustis, Virginia; the Beaumont Reserve Fleet, Beaumont, Texas; and the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet, Benecia, California. Two vessels are held by the Coast Guard in Mobile, Alabama. MARAD expects its inventory of obsolete vessels awaiting priority disposal will increase to 152 by the end of fiscal year 2001 because of additional vessel transfers from the U.S. Navy, downgrades of other NDRF vessels to obsolete status, and the inability to sell ships for scrap. Environmental dangers associated with MARAD' old, deteriorating ships are increasing daily. s These vessels are literally rotting and disintegrating as they await disposal. Some vessels have deteriorated to a point where a hammer can penetrate their hulls. They contain hazardous substances such as asbestos and solid and liquid polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). If oil from these vessels were to enter the water, immediate federal and state action would be required. According to the report, DOT, the Administration, and the Congress face a challenge in determining how to dispose of MARAD' Fleet of environmentally dangerous vessels in a timely s manner. MARAD will not achieve the legislative mandate to dispose of its obsolete vessels by 2001 nor will the disposals yield financial benefits to the United States. MARAD will need relief from these requirements. The current approach of selling obsolete vessels for domestic scrapping is not likely to work in today' marketplace. There is limited domestic scrapping s capacity, and, by law, MARAD is prohibited from paying for scrapping services. It cannot, therefore, compete with a Navy pilot project, which pays contractors for scrapping obsolete vessels. Further, MARAD is constrained from selling vessels overseas for scrapping, although this had been a key market in the past. The longer the vessels are in MARAD' Fleet awaiting s disposal, the more the environmental risks increase. MARAD will need authorization and funding for a program to pay for the disposal of vessels if it is to have the potential to significantly reduce the number of obsolete vessels in the NDRF.  26   The report' recommendations to the Maritime Administrator are as follows: (1) seek legislative s approval to extend the 2001 mandate for disposing of obsolete vessels and to eliminate the requirement that MARAD maximize financial returns on the sale of its obsolete vessels; (2) continue to pursue programs to improve scrapping sales, and identify alternative disposal methods that can contribute to the goal of reducing the number of obsolete vessels awaiting disposal, including working with the U.S. Navy on the results of its studies on the environmental impact of sunken vessels; and (3) develop a proposal for submission to Congress seeking approval and funding for a project to pay contractors for vessel scrapping. The proposal to Congress should include a plan to target the 40 ""worst condition"" vessels first, identify funding and staffing requirements, and provide milestone dates to dispose of all obsolete vessels.

Single-Hull Oil Vessels (GAO)  The U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) has published a report (GAO/RCED-00-80) dated April 2000 and titled Maritime Industry: As U.S. Single-Hull Oil Vessels Are Eliminated, Few Double-Hull Vessels May Replace Them. According to the report, the U.S. Coast Guard' s approach for implementing the Oil Pollution Act' phase-out requirements relies on inspectors at s individual ports to: (1) identify single-hull vessels subject to the Act' requirements; (2) use the s Act' phase-out schedule to establish a deadline for the vessel; and (3) ensure that vessels are not s being used for transporting oil after the deadline has passed. Inspectors monitor these vessels as part of their existing inspection and boarding activities. If the Coast Guard were to find a vessel is still being used to transport oil beyond its phase-out date, it has authority to require the vessel to cease operation, revoke its certificate, and potentially levy a civil penalty against the owner or operator. So far, no instances of noncompliance have been identified. The 22 domestic shipping companies GAO contacted that own single-hull oil vessels stated that they have only limited plans to replace or convert these vessels. Most said they would simply take their vessels out of service when their phase-out deadlines occurred and would take a ""wait and see"" approach to making replacements in the future. The industry currently has more vessels than needed to meet the current shipping demand, and vessel owners said the rates they receive for shipping oil products are currently not high enough to justify investing in replacements for the future. After taking into account available double-hull capacity and the limited amount of planned double-hull replacements, the phase-out of single-hull vessels will on balance cut total carrying capacity by about 1.9 million gross tons by the end of 2005, assuming no major changes in industry replacement plans. Decisions by ship owners to make only limited replacements will probably have little effect on the ability to meet demand over the next few years, because the available supply of U.S.-built vessels is still expected to be greater than demand for their services. Beyond the next few years, however, the potential effect of limited replacement is less certain. Shipping company officials, along with oil company officials that GAO contacted, said that if enough U.S.-built vessels could not be found to move oil between U.S. ports, their most likely alternatives would be to import oil products from foreign ports using non-U.S. ships or to  27   make greater use of domestic pipelines. Two parts of the country  New England and Florida  are not served by pipelines; however, both regions are served extensively by tank barges and U.S. and non-U.S. tankers.

This testing was done as a part of the a partnership between the cruise line industry, the U.S. Coast Guard, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, the Environmental Protection Agency, Alaska communities represented by Southeast Conference and environmental groups called the Alaska Cruise Ship Initiative. The results from testing done earlier this month are still being analyzed.   This initial sampling indicates that the sewage and gray water being discharged may have bacteria counts higher than expected. This may be partially attributable to the policy of not discharging treated sewage and gray water in port and holding it in tanks with little air flow before discharge. Also, the sampling process is going to be looked at closely to see if modifications are necessary to get accurate information. It took longer than the optimal six hours to get the samples to a lab to be tested and the samples were too warm. Warm temperatures and long holding times can allow bacteria to grow and lead to skewed results in the samples.   There have been no reported problems from cruise ship wastewater discharges, but more work is necessary, and is being done, to understand what the current information means. To refine the data, the Coast Guard and DEC will be requiring additional tests of marine sanitation devices or onboard sewage treatment plants.   Mike Conway, DECs coordinator of the Alaska Cruise Ship Initiative said, ""We are learning much from the early sampling efforts. We are breaking new ground in gathering information on cruise ship discharges. Sampling of the cruise ships to get the information we need is more complex than initially thought. We are striving to get samples that accurately represent discharges from vessels into Alaska waters.""   The wastewater and solid waste work group, composed of members of the Alaska Cruise Ship Initiative, developed a sampling plan and sampling procedures to determine the type and quantity of wastewater being discharged. This has been a cooperative effort, with the agencies, cruise ship industry, environmental groups and interested citizens all playing a valuable role.   Each cruise ship will have its overboard discharges sampled twice this summer. Since the cruise industry committed to discharging only when 10 miles on its route to or from its last or next   port of call, the sampling of overboard discharges will occur while the ships are underway. A private contractor has been hired to conduct the independent sampling.   Each cruise ship typically has 3 overboard discharges:       gray water from sinks, showers and food prep areas     treated black water from sewage treatment devices     combined gray and treated black water retained in holding tanks while the     ship is in port     It is in the morning and evening meal time that most gray and black water is generated and sampling during one of these peak times will provide information on how well these treatment devices and management practices are working. This additional information, combined with the sampling from all the ships, will be analyzed by the agencies, the work groups and industry. The goal is to come up with the best practices needed to insure proper wastewater management.   The agencies will continue to improve the sampling process and analysis of the results over the 2000 season. We will provide results of this action in a report to the public, once all the results are in and the work group completes the analysis work.       ""Knowledge and sharing of knowledge is powerful. An important part of this process for all of us- regulators, industry and interested citizens- is to get as much information as we can"", Conway said. "" We then have the ability to use that information to solve problems. The results of this preliminary sampling are moving us in that direction.""   U.S. Coast Guard Captain Ed Page agreed. ""This is our first step in a journey we are taking with cruise ship companies and the Alaska public to understand and minimize the impacts the cruise ship industry has on Alaskas air, water and land. The first steps are often the hardest.""   The Alaska Cruise Ship initiative started in December of last year and has clear objectives.       Identify the waste streams and spill risks that could impact Alaskas     air and water resources;     Develop pollution prevention and waste management solutions that will     eliminate or reduce impacts, including better technology and management     practices;     Assess what process is needed to verify compliance; and     Keep Alaskans informed.

GX238-37-16642809	Editorial                                                         Back         to           press releases          menu           Cruise         ship pages                  April 20, 2001                Cruise Ship Legislation Protects Alaskas Environment        by Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation                Commissioner Michele Brown         JUNEAUThe equivalent of Alaskas third largest city on any summer day cant be found on a map. Thats because its afloat.          More than 45,000 cruise ship passengers and crew sail Alaskan waters at a time, constituting our states third largest city. During an entire summer, more than 1,000,000 visitors and crew cruise Alaskas pristine waters.         They arrive on ships 10 stories high and several football fields long.  Theyre an important part of Alaskas booming tourism industry.  Yet they also generate a lot of waste.          Just one large cruise ship can discharge 350,000 gallons of wastewater and sewage daily. Until now, this flotilla of mostly foreign-flagged vessels has largely escaped regulation.           The time is well overdue for Alaskans to require the cruise ship industry to meet responsible environmental standards in the same manner that Alaskans expect from other industries.          Last summers wake-up call for action was shocking and deeply troubling. Serious pollution problems associated with the cruise ship industry came to light during federal investigations, which led to felony convictions for hazardous waste dumping. Testing conducted for the Alaska Cruise Ship Initiative Working Group, convened by the state Department of Environmental Conservation, further documented serious and unanticipated pollution problems with cruise ship discharges.         None of the wastewater samples collected from cruise ships fully met standards imposed on sewage.  Even more disturbing, over 70 percent of the graywater samples from sinks, showers and kitchens, exceeded standards for fecal coliform, an indicator of human waste.  Fifteen percent of cruise ships stacks spewed smoke in violation of state and federal clean air rules.          Alaskans rightfully expect all industries to operate in Alaska according to reasonable standards, which protect our air, land, and waters. Now, its time to extend that expectation to the cruise ship industry.          Governor Tony Knowles introduced legislation creating the Alaska Commercial Passenger Vessel Coastal Protection Program (HB 183 and SB 134).  The bill takes four important steps by: (1) requiring cruise ships that ply Alaskas waters to comply with permits that regulate wastewater discharges, air emissions, and solid waste disposal; (2) providing for independent monitoring and research, including addressing sensitive marine areas; (3) creating incentives for innovative approaches to reducing waste; and (4) implementing a dollar per passenger fee to pay for this cruise ship oversight program.         For cruise ships and every other industry, it is ultimately the states responsibility to protect Alaskas air and water.  Recent federal legislation addressing some cruise ship wastewater and voluntary efforts on the part of some cruise lines are steps in the right direction.          But they do not provide the consistent, fair and responsible oversight of the industry Alaskans deserve. Alaskans can not and should not rely solely on the federal government to ensure our air and water are not being fouled.          So far, the Governors cruise ship legislation has been met with deafening silence from the cruise industry and hostility from the legislative majority.  In the House, the legislation was buried in four committees, more than any other bill this session.  It has not emerged from even one committee.  Despite promises last year to support improved state regulation, cruise ship company representatives are actively lobbying for a different bill which falls short of the comprehensive, independent oversight program needed to ensure the protection of Alaskas coastal resources.         Alaskans welcome the benefits of our growing tourism industry.  But we also recognize our foremost responsibility to maintain the health of our oceans, air, and coastal communities.         Treatment of the cruise ship industry in Alaska must be fair and consistent with the level of care we expect from other industries that depend on our natural resources.  This legislation expands the states safety net to address cruise ship pollution and puts Alaskans in charge or protecting Alaskas resources.          To do anything less to protect our oceans and watersheds would be irresponsible.  Please tell your legislator to act on these important measures.

GX238-79-7497354	"August 8, 2003  Ms. Hetty Richardson Bureau of Land and Water Quality Maine Department of Environmental Protection 17 State House Station Augusta, ME 04333-0017 Dear Ms. Richardson: I am writing today to provide rebuttal to certain comments that have been made in correspondence to State of Maine Vessel Discharge Stakeholders Group and which have been posted on the website. In particular, we would like to provide comment with regard to the statements by Ms. Diane Gould  EPA representative: Statement : Subject: Re: cruise ship discharges ICCL Comment : We believe that the subject is vessel discharges in general. It is apparent that this representative has chosen to focus on an industry that represents only 2.3% of the worlds total merchant shipping, approximately 1.8% of commercial shipping calling at U.S. ports and less than .1 % of commercial shipping calling at ports in the State of Maine. Statement : Treated sewage discharges from MSDs (blackwater) do not attain the level of treatment achieved under landside treatment regulations. ICCL Comment : Type II MSD require that there not be more than a 200 fecal coliform count per 100 ml and suspended solids of not more than 50 mg/l. All cruise ships are required to have installed an approved Type II MSD. EPA field studies confirmed industry estimates that wastewater dispersion from a moving cruise ship is significant  dispersion factors of over 200,000:1. (See EPA Report: Cruise Ship Plume Tracking Survey Report, EPA842-R-02-001   www.epa.gov/owow/oceans/, September 2002). This fact combined with the W.E.T. testing in Alaska led that panel to state that discharges from cruise ships will essentially have no impact on the environment. Irrespective of this, ICCL member operated cruise ships have all adopted the ICCL Industry Standard of not discharging any treated blackwater within 4 miles of land and only when underway at a speed at least 6 knots. This requirement has been placed in each ships' mandatory Safety Management System and is thus audited and verifiable. Non-compliance with this standard may subject a vessel to various enforcement sanctions. Statement : ... discharges are not tested, they are potentially a source of contaminations by enteric bacteria, and viruses. When absorbed by filter-feeding clams... they can become a human health hazard. ICCL Comment : Landside sewage is treated in essentially the same manner using the same technologies. Additionally, landside systems, the so called combined systems that handle both storm drains and sewer drains, are frequently subject to storm overflows where raw sewage is discharged directly into coastal waters. We understand that this occurs in the United States about 40,000 times a year. (""American Rivers"" http://216.161.14.72 ) Thus, this is not an issue specific to MSDs. We are unaware of any evidence that the use of required, approved MSDs has resulted in any illnesses or other harm from this ""potential"" threat. In particular we are unaware of any scientific evidence linking viruses to MSDs. We are unaware of any case in which a shellfish bed has been closed for this reason as a result of cruise ship discharge. We believe that the issue of storm overflows of municipal sewage systems that discharge raw sewage from landside sources is a much greater threat in this regard. While there may be some general scientific support for these statements, we believe that linking them directly to cruise ship discharges is unfounded given the above discussion of dispersion and the policy of our members not to discharge in coastal waters. Statement : The 2001 study of treated sewage from 22 cruise ships ... ICCL Comment : While this is true, what is not stated is that the same results were found for the smaller passenger ships and the Alaska Marine Highway state ferries. The cruise industry took immediate steps to correct the situation of improperly operating and maintained MSDs as a result of these findings. The 2002 survey showed entirely different results. Statement : Prohibition of discharges from MSDs would offer enhanced protection for the waters of Casco Bay from pollution.   ICCL Comment : Given that the cruise ships do not discharge within 4 miles from land and the discharges are diluted by factors of greater than 200,000:1 (EPA field Study results), we believe that the objective evidence is that cruise ships are not a source of pollution of the coastal waters. Statement : Federal No Discharge Zone ... is an important step in protecting the coastal waters from blackwater pollution. ICCL Comment : While this may be true it should be given serious thought as it may not have the impact desired and given current cruise ship operations, it is unclear to us as to the source of this coastal waters pollution. A recent PEW Oceans Commission Report states that 80% of coastal water pollution is cause by runoff from land sources. It is our understanding that a Federal No Discharge Zone would apply to all marine traffic not just cruise ships. It also requires that the municipalities located within the zone provide shoreside reception facilities. Statement : Graywater discharges carry a cocktail of pollutants including food wastes ... cleaners, pesticides, medical wastes and even high levels of fecal coliform. ICCL Comment : Graywater is the drainage from sinks, showers, laundry wash, and the like. It does not include toilets, urinals or medical sinks. Medical sinks are specifically required to be piped into the blackwater system. Medical Biohazard waste is required to be handled as such in accordance with applicable rules. The Alaska testing of graywater and blackwater found no indication of pesticides - initial reports of their presence were proven false. The testing of discharges against the EPA list of ""primary pollutants"" (www.epa.gov/waterscience/pc/revcom.pdf) was conducted with interesting results. Phthalates were detected at very low levels  the Scientific Panel explains: Plastic types of containers, wrappings ... are ubiquitous in their use in modern society. As a consequence, low levels of phthalate acid esters . . . are now routinely detected in various environmental media as a mark of our industrialized society. Higher than background levels of metals: Some of this was attributed to the level of the metal that was taken onboard as potable water from municipal water systems. The report discusses these in detail. The Alaska Cruise Ship Waste Disposal Management study report by the Alaska Science Advisory Panel contains a very thorough discussion of all of these issues   and more. This is a peer reviewed scientific report published in November 2002 can be found at www.state.ak.us/dec/press/cruise/documents. This report specifically states: ""the current requirements for large cruise ships  wastewater discharge at a minimum speed of 6 knots and at least 1 nautical mile from shore unless they can meet the strict effluent standards for stationary discharge  is good management practice and should be practiced by all passenger ships. The report goes on to say: ""The Panel concluded that the high dilution of wastewater caused by a large moving cruise ship would prevent significant accumulation of contaminates in the microlayer . . . this conclusion is further bolstered by the Whole Effluent Toxicity (WET) tests conducted in July 2002. We encourage you to read this report in its entirety as it is the result of a multiyear scientific study and presents a different picture than presented by Ms. Gould. Statement : Unregulated Discharges of Oily bilge water . . . ICCL Comment : Bilgewater discharge is regulated by international regulation by the Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 (MARPOL 73/78) and by United States Coast Guard Regulations found in 33 CFR Part 151. Bilge water discharges may not contain more than 15ppm of oil and a ship must be underway and actually moving before any bilgewater discharge may be conducted. The requirement is applicable to U.S. coastwise ships as well as non-U.S. flag vessels operating in U.S. navigable waters. Statement : Ballast Water ...disease-causing pathogens. While this may be true in some instances, to connect this statement with cruise ships is a real reach especially in the Northeast and given cruise ship ballasting operations. While there have been one or two instances of pathogens being found in ballast water in ships calling in U.S. ports these ships were bulk carriers that ballasted in contaminated tropical harbors. Additionally it is our understanding that ICCL member cruise ships calling at Maine ports to not conduct ballast discharge operations as they do not take on fuel in these ports of call. These ships may take on ocean water while underway off shore but taking on ballast water poses no threat to Maine ports. Statement : State discharge regulations in Alaska have been difficult to enforce, suggesting that a plan for compliance should be addressed. ICCL Comment : The Commissioner of the Alaska DEC stated at the SeaTrade Cruise Industry Conference that the cruise industry operating in Alaska ""has achieved general compliance with the toughest laws in the country.""   We appreciate the opportunity to participate in the Stakeholders Working group and to provide these comments which we hope will add to the discussion, clarify some points and provide further insight into cruise ship operations. We would appreciate having this correspondence posted at the website. Respectfully,  T. E. Thompson Executive Vice President"
GX015-59-11894196	"http://www.epa.gov/oppfead1/cb/csb_page/updates/npdes8-13.htm                                                U.S. NATIONAL PROFILE ON THE MANAGEMENT OF CHEMICALS        EXECUTIVE SUMMARY               INTRODUCTION               The Intergovernmental Forum on Chemical Safety (IFCS) has identified the need for      national profiles on management of chemicals to indicate current capabilities and      capacities for management of chemicals and identify program needs. This National Profile      on Management of Chemicals in the United States may be the first time that information on      all of the Federal chemical safety programs, as well as information about representative      state and non-governmental activities, has been brought together in one document. It is      hoped that it will serve as a useful reference document both domestically and      internationally to inform both specialists and the general public and help guide U.S.      chemical safety activities and coordination efforts.                1. NATIONAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION                Chemical safety management in the U.S. must be considered in the overall context of      physical, political, demographic, industrial and agricultural characteristics of the      country. The U.S. is the world's fourthlargest country (after Russia, Canada, and      China). The climate is mostly temperate but has wide extremes in some areas. It has a      diverse terrain, rich natural resources and 20% arable land. The population of the United      States is 264 million (1995 est.). There is a high literacy rate -- 97% of the population      age 15 and over has completed five or more years of schooling. The U.S. is a      constitutional democracy with authority distributed between the central Federal government      and the 50 states. The US has the most powerful, diverse, and technologically advanced      economy in the world, with a per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of $25,850, the      largest among major industrial nations. The economy is market oriented with most decisions      made by private individuals and business firms and with government purchases of goods and      services made predominantly in the marketplace. Agriculture accounts for 2% of GDP and      2.9% of labor force; favorable climate and soils support a wide variety of crops and      livestock production; world's second largest producer and number one exporter of grain.                2. CHEMICAL PRODUCTION, IMPORT, EXPORT AND USE               The United States has a complex chemical industry structure. The chemical industry      represents about 10.3 per cent of value added in the manufacturing sector and accounts for      5.1 percent of GDP in the United States. Some 7, 335 companies employ about 1.1 million      people, or 6 per cent of the manufacturing industry labour force. Most of the companies      are quite small; some 200 account for more than 83 per cent of total sales, which reached      $337 billion in 1994. The largest concentrations of chemical plants are in Texas,      Louisiana and New Jersey. The chemical industry is strong and growing. Investment in new      plant and equipment reached $21.8 billion in 1993 and R&D spending totalled $16.7      billion. The US chemical industry is the world's largest, and the second largest chemical      exporter. In 1994, its exports were worth over $51 billion and accounted for some 15 per      cent of its output; US imports of chemicals amounted to over $33 billion. Chemicals are      used by the general publc in many facets of daily life at home and in the workplace.         3. PRIORITY CONCERNS RELATED TO CHEMICAL PRODUCTION, IMPORT, EXPORT AND USE                The United States has strong chemical safety authorities and programs implemented by      many public and private organizations. Priorities and needs vary across agencies and      regions of the country. EPA's pesticides and industrial chemicals program offices are      developing draft chemical safety goals as part of EPA's comprehensive Environmental Goals      Project and these are briefly described in Section 3.1. General chemical safety program      needs are described in section 3.2. EPA's priority concerns for pesticides and industrial      chemicals are described in section 3.3. Other agencies have also established priorities.      For example, the Public Health Service has its ""Healthy People 2000 goals."" A      comprehensive listing of the priority concerns of all U.S. agencies involved in chemical      safety is beyond the scope of this profile.               OECD recently reviewed the United States' environmental performance and made a number      of recommendations that are under review within the U.S (ref. Section 3.4). Finally, EPA      is participating in the government-wide effort to implement the Government Performance and      Results Act (GPRA) (ref. Section 3.5).                The principal goals being established for EPA in concert with other agencies as part of      EPA's Environmental Goals Project are expected to include the following broad themes, each      of which will have associated indicators and milestones: (1) the foods Americans consume      will continue to be safe for all people to eat; (2) all Americans will live, learn, and      work in safe and healthy environments; (3) by relying on pollution prevention, reuse and      recycling in the way we produce and consume materials, all Americans will live in      communities free of toxic impacts; and (4) Americans will be informed and educated      participants in improving environmental quality; they will exercise their right to know      about pollutants in their communities, make informed environmental decisions, and      participate in setting local and national priorities.                As described in Section 3.3.1, EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) has identified      a number of areas where improvements are needed in pesticide regulatory programs and      significant changes are expected by 2001. These improvements will cumulatively have a      major effect in increasing program efficiencies and risk reduction to the public and the      environment. They include: (1) the need for a more stable funding base; (2) completion of      the first round of reevaluation of older pesticides; (3) implementation of the major      pesticide statutory changes enacted in 1996; (4) broader input from stakeholders; (4) a      fully trained agricultural worker population, achieving significant risk reduction for      this most exposed population; (5) electronic submission and processing of data and      electronic access to non-confidential review information by the public; (6) meaningful      work sharing on pesticide reviews with other countries; (7) achievement of risk reduction      through expedited approval and encouragement of biopesticides and other generally safer      chemicals through an expanded Pesticide Environmental Stewardship Program (PESP), which      established partnerships with grower organizations and others to reach measurable,      voluntary risk reduction goals; (8) responding to public concerns to have non-carcinogenic      pesticides and focus on exposures other than food; (9) availability of a 24-hour toll-free      hotline to respond to citizen concerns; (10) an updated National Food Consumption Survey      and a more comprehensive Residue Data Base; and (11) free access to information by all      interested parties.         As described in Section 3.3.2, EPA's Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics has      identified the following principles to guide its current and future industrial chemicals      program initiatives:                First, preventing pollution offers the first and often the best opportunity for      protecting health and the environment.                Second, empowering the public with information helps assure compliance with existing      laws and encourages companies to take additional measures to reduce industrial chemical      releases.                Third, industry and EPA can work cooperatively and in partnership to improve our      environment. When empowered with information on pollution prevention and other important      tools, industry has taken the initiative to reduce the impact their products and processes      have on the environment.               These lessons are the cornerstone of EPA's new approach for addressing industrial      chemicals in the environment. EPA plans to continue to incorporate these three lessons      into its programs in an intelligent and responsible manner. The agency recognizes that      there are times when it may need to move beyond the first choice on the waste management      hierarchy, pollution prevention, that public empowerment carries with it the need to      provide the information and education that the public requires to make sound decisions;      and that there will always be the need for Federal oversight in environmental issues.      However, when applied thoughtfully, these principles will result in a better environment.      The principles of pollution prevention, right-to-know, and stakeholder partnerships form      the foundation of the nation's industrial chemical program now and in the future. As it      has over the past twenty years, EPA's understanding and application of TSCA will continue      to grow and evolve as it faces the challenges of reducing industrial chemical risks over      the coming decades.               4. LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND NON-REGULATORY MECHANISMS FOR MANAGING CHEMICALS               (a)  Principal Statutes.  The United States has a complex set of chemical      safety statutes and regulations administered by a number of Federal agencies. The      principal statutes are briefly described below.               Toxic Substances and Control Act (TSCA)  regulates industrial chemicals,      including heavy metals. Identifies and controls industrial chemical hazards that are toxic      to human health and the environment. Administered by the Environmental Protection Agency      (EPA).               Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)  requires EPA      registration for all pesticides sold in U.S. It is a violation of FIFRA to use a pesticide      in a manner inconsistent with its label, including the specified uses. FIFRA was revised      and strengthened substantially in August 1996.               Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA)  regulates the establishment      of pesticide tolerances (maximum residue levels). FFDCA was revised and strengthened      substantially in August 1996. (EPA and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA))               Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA)  requires local      emergency planning for responses to industrial chemical or pesticide accidents; requires      industry to notify their communities and states of releases; provides information from      companies about possible industrial chemical or pesticide hazards in the facility's      community; mandates a national inventory of toxic chemical releases (Toxics Release      Inventory (TRI)). (EPA)               Clean Air Act (CAA)  establishes criteria and standards for regulating      toxic air pollutants in order to safeguard public health and the environment. (EPA)               Clean Water Act (CWA)  establishes criteria and standards for pollutants,      including some pesticides, in surface water bodies to protect against chronic ecosystem      effects. (EPA)                Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA)  establishes enforceable Maximum      Contaminant Levels (MCLs) for pesticides and Health Advisories. There were major revisions      to strengthen SDWA enacted in August 1996. (EPA)               Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)  requires appropriate      handling and disposal of hazardous waste. (EPA)               Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA)       covers incidents with hazardous materials and mandates the EPA Superfund program to clean      up the highest priority sites contaminated by chemicals. The Agency for Toxic Substances      and Disease Registry (ATSDR) evaluates data on release of hazardous substances to assess      impact on public health, initiate toxicologic research, establishes and maintains      registries for persons exposed to hazardous substances, and provides response to emergency      release of substances. (EPA and ATSDR).               Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (HMTA)  ensures the safe and      environmentally sound transportation of hazardous materials by all modes of transportation      through a comprehensive, risk-based, national program. (Department of Transportation      (DOT))                Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA), Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA) and      Poison Prevention Packaging Act (PPPA)  regulate the safety of consumer products,      including chemical safety. (Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC))               Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA)  regulates toxic chemicals      related to occupational safety. (Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and      the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).                      (b)  More Information About Principal EPA Regulatory Authorities.  EPA's  Office      of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances (OPPTS)  has the lead U.S.      responsibility for implementing TSCA, EPCRA, FIFRA and FFDCA (ref. 4(a) above) through its      two program offices: the  Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT)  and the  Office      of Pesticide Programs (OPP) .                EPA/OPPT oversees implementation of the  Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) .      TSCA was enacted in 1976 to identify and control industrial chemical hazards that are      toxic to human health and the environment. Episodes of environmental contamination,      including the pollution of a major waterway with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), the      threat of stratospheric ozone depletion from chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) emissions, and      contamination of a State's agricultural produce by polybrominated biphenyls, showed the      need for stronger and more comprehensive industrial chemical legislation. Subsequently, in      the 1980s and 1990s, TSCA was strengthened to control three chemicals -- asbestos, radon,      and lead -- that are very harmful and have widespread exposure. EPA has broad authority,      under TSCA, to regulate new and existing chemicals.                TSCA directs EPA to use the least burdensome option that can reduce the risk to a level      that is reasonable given the benefits provided by the chemical product or process. Civil      and/or criminal penalties are imposed on any person who violates a requirement made under      the Act. While EPA implements most of the provisions under TSCA, the States have authority      to fulfill some of the Act's mandates. In particular, TSCA gives the States authority when      their knowledge of local conditions is needed to control certain chemicals.                EPA/OPP has primary responsibility for implementing the  Federal Insecticide,      Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)  and pesticide regulatory authorities in the  Federal      Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) . The U.S. first started regulating pesticides in      1910. FIFRA was passed in 1947 to govern the registration (licensing) of pesticides. FFDCA      was amended in 1954 to add the regulation of pesticide residues. Pesticide residues in      food, farmworker exposure, and pesticide contamination of ground water have all      contributed to a growing concern over the widespread use of pesticides. In 1988, FIFRA was      amended substantially to accelerate the review and reregistration of older pesticides.      Both FIFRA and FFDCA were substantially revised and strengthened in 1996 by the  Food      Quality Protection Act , which gives EPA important new tools: a uniform healthbased      standard based on ""a reasonable certainty of no harm,"" better protection for      children, and an improved science base for EPA decisions.                FIFRA and FFDCA address risk reduction through licensing restrictions on individual      pesticide products and the establishment of tolerances (maximum residue levels) for      chemical/use combinations. No pesticide may be legally sold in the U.S. unless it bears an      EPA registration number. FIFRA Section 3(c)(2) contains important provisions that provide      EPA with the authority to establish data requirements for registration of pesticide      products and to call in additional data after registration if EPA determines this is      necessary to ensure the product is not likely to cause unreasonable adverse effects. It is      a violation of the law for any person to use a pesticide in a manner inconsistent with its      label, including the specified uses. FIFRA imposes civil as well as criminal penalties for      violations. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture      (USDA) enforce tolerance (maximum residue) levels on both domestic and imported foods. The      States generally assume responsibility for enforcement of pesticide distribution and use      requirements, aided by Federal grants.                In 1992, EPA issued strengthened  worker protection standards . The new standards      covers 3.9 million workers employed on farms, forests, nurseries, and greenhouses. The new      standards are expected to reduce very significantly the number of reported and unreported      acute pesticide poisoning incidents each year.                Some states have pesticide regulatory and enforcement programs that exceed Federal      requirements in some areas. For example, the State of California's Department of Pesticide      Regulation (Cal/DPR) has state-level requirements to conduct independent assessments and      registration of pesticide products. EPA and DPR are working closely together to harmonize      assessment procedures and share the assessment workload.                OPPT implements part of the  Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act      (EPCRA).  EPCRA was passed in 1986 to prevent major chemical accidents from occurring      due to industrial activities and to limit their consequences for man and the environment.      Chemical release incidents-such as in Institute, West Virginia; Bhopal, India; and      Chernobyl-heightened government awareness of the critical need for effective emergency      planning. These accidents also made Americans more concerned than ever before about the      need for information on the presence of hazardous chemicals in their communities and      releases of these chemicals into the environment.                Under EPCRA, EPA has authority to promulgate regulations for the emergency preparedness      and the community access to chemical information provisions. EPCRA has four main purposes:                 To require local emergency planning for responses to industrial chemical or pesticide          accidents.                         To require industry to notify their community and the State of the routine or accidental          release of an industrial chemical or pesticide.                         To provide the public and the State with information from companies about possible          industrial chemical or pesticide hazards in the facility's community.                         To develop a national inventory of toxic chemical releases that will give the public and          government information about chemicals to which they may be exposed (Section 313 of          EPCRA). Manufacturers, importers, processors, and users are required to report          approximately 600 industrial chemicals, pesticides, and categories of these chemicals. EPA          and the States receive data on the amounts of the chemicals that the companies release          directly to air, water, or land, or that they transfer to off-site facilities that treat          or dispose of wastes.                EPA implements the  Toxics Release Inventory (TRI)  provisions under EPCRA.      Certain facilities are required to annually report their releases and waste management      information for listed chemicals. EPA then makes this information publicly available      through TRI, which is a database that is accessible electronically. In 1996, EPA published      a proposed rule to add seven industry sectors to the current list of facilities required      to submit data. This effort, known as TRI Industry Expansion, will greatly strengthen      community right-to-know by providing information on toxic chemical releases and waste      management from companies that are not the manufacturing facilities that are currently      reporting.               In the past, EPA relied heavily on its regulatory authorities to achieve its goals. EPA      now recognizes that more cooperative methods are often more efficient and effective.      Regulation is still a viable tool and is used when necessary. However, the risk management      activities are increasingly turning to cooperative and voluntary methods as first      approaches to reducing or eliminating the likelihood of harm to human health and the      environment.                (c) Non-Regulatory Approaches.  EPA uses many non-regulatory methods to      manage chemical risks. These approaches include voluntary actions -- such as negotiated      agreements for testing, hazard communication, product stewardship, safer work practices,      or termination of the sale or use of a chemical or product. Voluntary methods or a      combination of voluntary actions and regulation are sometimes the best solution. Voluntary      methods are comparable in effectiveness to regulation and often can be accomplished more      quickly. Government partnerships involve cooperation among regional, Federal, State, and      local governments. EPA often provides technical and analytical work to support the actions      of its partners. EPA emphasizes pollution prevention and promotion of safer substitutes,      including removing chemicals of concern from the marketplace or reducing the emissions of      certain chemicals. EPA uses chemical emission data from TRI to target chemicals and      facilities of concern.               The 33/50 program is a good example of a successful, voluntary pollution prevention      program. The 33/50 program targets seventeen high priority toxic chemicals for reduction      through voluntary partnerships with industry. The program's name stems from its goals: a      33% reduction by 1992 and a 50% reduction by 1995. EPA is proud to report that almost      1,300 companies agreed to reduce voluntarily their releases and transfers of the targeted      33/50 chemicals. Their efforts helped 33/50 reach the 50% goal a year ahead of schedule.               Information dissemination has been found to be a valuable tool for obtaining results.      Advisories warning the public of hazards from chemicals have encouraged people to      voluntarily reduce the risks. The involvement of stakeholders early in the risk management      process helps to ensure that their needs are met. Product stewardship is a principle many      industries have committed to follow.                Past approaches to pesticide regulation focused on careful analysis and evaluation of      discrete pesticides. Although this remains important, it is insufficient to deal with new      issues, such as multiple residues, differential sensitivities of infants and adults, and      the need to manage pests. The U.S. is beginning to look at risk concerns more      comprehensively, finding faster and more effective ways to reduce real risks and share      resources and expertise. The most effective, least costly solution is prevention of      problems rather than trying to fix them retroactively.                While EPA and FDA retain a primary focus on regulatory action, they also, in concert      with USDA, are working to create non-regulatory programs which encourage voluntary efforts      to prevent or mitigate the human health and environmental impacts of pesticide use. The      U.S. has begun a special initiative to reduce pesticide risks, both through      legislative/regulatory initiatives and voluntary efforts. The initiative focuses      particularly on risk/use reduction strategies and increased use of Integrated Pest      Management (IPM). As part of this initiative, EPA has implemented the Pesticide      Environmental Stewardship Program (PESP) in which committed grower groups and utilities      develop and implement plans to reduce pesticide risks and use. PESP is proving to be a      very successful public/private partnership that achieves significant risk reduction      through voluntary efforts by EPA's PESP partners. USDA is focusing on expanded use of IPM.      Growers in many parts of the U.S. are changing their pest control practices to make      significant reductions in use of synthetic chemical pesticides.                5. U.S. FEDERAL AGENCIES RESPONSIBLE FOR CHEMICAL SAFETY MANAGEMENT                Four U.S. Federal agencies have promulgated most of the regulations controlling      chemicals and, hence, have the most information on the chemicals they manage. Each agency      regulates chemicals at a different stage of their life cycle. The  Occupational Safety      and Health Administration   (OSHA)  identifies and controls the hazards to workers      in most industries from exposure to chemicals. The  Consumer Product Safety Commission      (CPSC)  and the  Food and Drug Administration  determine and manage the risks from      chemicals in consumer products and foods, human and animal drugs, and cosmetics,      respectively. These organizations have information on the potential hazards of chemicals      in these products. The  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  regulates chemicals      that can not be controlled using the authorities of the above three agencies. Hence, EPA      is an excellent source of information on the potential adverse effects of certain      chemicals at any stage of their life cycle, from manufacture to disposal. The agencies      often work together to manage chemicals. For example, EPA received input from OSHA and      CPSC in banning and phasing out asbestos.                Other agencies provide scientific support to the four principal regulatory agencies.      The following descriptions provide brief overviews of the responsibilities and programs of      the U.S. agencies responsible for some aspect of chemical safety management.               Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) . EPA is charged by Congress to      protect the Nation's land, air, and water systems. Under a mandate of national      environmental laws, the Agency strives to formulate and implement actions that lead to a      compatible balance between human activities and the ability of natural systems to support      and nurture life. The Agency's priorities include emphasizing flexibility and innovation,      working in partnerships with private and government groups, and encouraging sound science      and engineering. For example, under the ""Common Sense Initiative"" the Agency      looks at pollution industrybyindustry, rather than by using the      pollutantbypollutant approach of the past. Everyone concerned with a given      industryfrom manufacturers to community organizationsworks together to fashion new      strategies to emphasize preventing pollution.               EPA works in partnership with state, county, municipal, and tribal governments to carry      out its mission. State and local standards may exceed federal standards, but they cannot      be less stringent. EPA works with states and municipalities so they can carry out federal      standards consistently but flexibly. The Agency also makes extensive efforts to involve      the public in environmental protection. Some laws specifically invite public monitoring;      others allow individuals to sue polluters or to notify environmental agencies of      violations.               Through research, development, and technical assistance, EPA generates and disseminates      sound science and engineering to support its missions. These efforts provide the data that      the Agency needs to set and address priorities in identifying, assessing, and managing      serious risks to public health and the environment. EPA's research combines the inhouse      expertise of its scientists and engineers with complementary research by universities and      nonprofit organizations under a competitive, peerreview extramural program.               State Department.  The State Department coordinates the participation of      U.S. government agencies in international chemical safety fora, including the development      of U.S. policies on international issues. It also funds a number of international programs      and helps coordinate Federal agency funding of international chemical safety activities.               Food and Drug Administration.  FDA is an agency within the Public Health      Service of the Department of Health and Human Services. It is FDA's job to ensure the      safety and wholesomeness of U.S. food and the safety of cosmetics, medicines and medical      devices, and radiationemitting products. Animal feed and drugs for pets and farm animals      also come under FDA scrutiny. FDA also ensures that all of these products are labeled      truthfully with the information that people need to use them properly. A major FDA mission      is to protect the safety and wholesomeness of food. The agency's scientists test samples      to see if any substances, such as pesticide residues, are present in unacceptable amounts.      If contaminants are identified, FDA takes corrective action. FDA also sets labeling      standards to help consumers know what is in the foods they buy. The nation's food supply      is protected in yet another way as FDA sees that medicated feeds and other drugs given to      animals raised for food are not threatening to the consumer's health.               FDA regulates prescription and overthecounter medicines for humans through its      Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. Cosmetic safety also comes under FDA's      jurisdiction. The agency can have unsafe cosmetics removed from the market. The dyes and      other additives used in drugs, foods and cosmetics also are subject to FDA scrutiny. The      agency must review and approve these chemicals before they can be used. FDA's scrutiny      does not end when a drug or device is approved for marketing; the agency collects and      analyzes tens of thousands of reports each year on drugs and devices after they have been      put on the market to monitor for any unexpected adverse reactions.               U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)  in cooperation with EPA, assesses      the benefits of pesticides, and works with farmers and other pesticide users on the proper      use of and alternatives to pesticides. USDA enforces tolerance (maximum residue) levels      for meat, milk and eggs on both domestic and imported foods. USDA and EPA work together      closely to implement coordinated research, technology development, and technology transfer      systems that support agricultural practices that protect and enhance the environment. As      part of an initiative to reduce pesticide risks and use, EPA and USDA will promote      sustainable agriculture and Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices, including      biological and cultural control systems, setting a goal of implementing IPM programs on      75% of the total crop acreage in the U.S. by the year 2000. USDA supports research and      education programs with the cooperation of State Agricultural Experiment Stations and      State Cooperative Extension Service staff.                Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)  authorities and regulations for      consumer product safety provide for labeling or banning hazardous household chemicals and      products, regulation of various consumer products, including extremely flammable contact      adhesives and lead-containing paint and related products, and requirements for special      packaging of hazardous products, including oral prescription medicine. CPSC can declare a      substance to be a banned hazardous substance pending completion of rulemaking procedures      for imminent hazards. CPSC can bring a court action to seize any misbranded or banned      hazardous substance. CPSC can also bring a court action based on imminent hazard under the      Consumer Product Safety Act, and can apply for preliminary injunctions while repair,      replacement, or refund is being sought.               Department of Transportation (DOT)  is responsible for the U.S. program      for ensuring the safe and environmentally sound transportation of hazardous materials by      all modes of transportation through a comprehensive, risk-based, national program. The      regulations apply to hazardous materials consignors, consignees, and carriers and      manufacturers of hazardous materials packagings. DOT participates on the UN Economic and      Social Council's Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods (UNCETDG). The      work of the Committee has become increasingly important to both international and domestic      transportation of hazardous materials to, from and within the United States. Virtually all      hazardous materials imported to or exported from the United States are transported in      accordance with international regulations based on the UN Recommendations.                Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR)  works to prevent      exposure and adverse human health effects and diminished quality of life associated with      exposure to hazardous substances from waste sites, unplanned releases, and other sources      of pollution present in the environment. ATSDR performs public health assessments of waste      sites, health consultations concerning specific hazardous substances, health surveillance      and registries, response to emergency releases of hazardous substances, applied research      in support of public health assessments, information development and dissemination, and      education and training concerning hazardous substances.               National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)  works to      reduce the burden of human illness and dysfunction from environmental causes by      understanding the interactive elements: environmental factors, individual susceptibility      and age and how they interrelate in human health and disease. NIEHS achieves its mission      through multi-disciplinary biomedical research programs, prevention and intervention      efforts, and communication strategies that encompass training, education, technology      transfer, and community outreach.                Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)  has a mission to      save lives, prevent injuries and protect the health of America's workers. To accomplish      this, federal and state governments must work in partnership with the more than 100      million working men and women and their six and a half million employers who are covered      by the OSHA's statutory authorities. OSHA's establishes protective standards, enforces      those standards, and reaches out to employers and employees through technical assistance      and consultation programs. OSHA regulates chemical safety in the workplace. This is      accomplished through a variety of regulatory approaches. There are chemical-specific      standards that establish permissible exposure limits to control employee exposures. In      some cases, these exposure limits are supplemented with specific requirements for exposure      assessment, medical management, and other aspects of a control program. In addition to      these chemical-specific requirements, the Agency also has many standards which address      various aspects of chemical safety in the workplace. These include, for example,      requirements for respiratory protection programs, handling and storage of flammable      liquids, ventilation, and handling of chemicals in laboratory settings. OSHA also has a      rule which requires the development and transmittal of information about all hazardous      chemicals. The Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) requires chemical manufacturers and      importers to evaluate the hazards of the chemicals they product or import, and to      disseminate this information to their employer customers through labels on containers and      material safety data sheets (MSDSs). All employers who have such chemicals in their      workplaces are required to implement a hazard communication program to provide the      information to their employees. Exposed employees are also required to be trained about      the hazards and the available precautionary measures to prevent adverse effects from      occurring.                National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)  is      responsible for conducting research and making recommendations for the prevention of      workrelated illnesses and injuries. NIOSH identifies the causes of workrelated      diseases and injuries and the potential hazards of new work technologies and practices.      With this information, NIOSH determines new and effective ways to protect workers from      chemicals, machinery, and hazardous working conditions. NIOSH works to create new ways to      prevent workplace hazards.                U.S. Agency for International Development  (USAID) supports development      assistance projects related to the sound management of chemicals as part of its      sustainable development initiative. USAID will pursue an integrated approach to      environmental issues as outlined in Agenda 21 of the UNCED (Earth Summit) guidelines for      ecologically sustainable development. USAID will strengthen its institutional capacity to      ensure that all Agency-supported efforts, whether projects or program-related investments,      are environmentally sound. An important element of USAID's sustainable development program      includes improving agricultural, industrial, and natural resource management practices      that play a central role in environmental degradation.               U.S. Department of Commerce  conducts indepth analysis of the chemicals      industry and identifies and promotes the development of domestic and international      business opportunities. It provides industry analysis and statistical information, as well      as business counseling and export assistance, and participates in domestic and foreign      policy discussions affecting the U.S. chemicals industry.               6. INTERAGENCY COMMISSIONS AND COORDINATING MECHANISMS                There are a variety of coordinating mechanisms in place in the United States for      chemical safety activities.                The  U.S. National Focal Point  for the Intergovernmental Forum on Chemical Safety      (IFCS) is the  EPA Assistant Administrator for Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic      Substances (OPPTS) . It is this official's responsibility, working with the State      Department, other agencies, and stakeholders to ensure broad-based discussion of chemical      safety issues and policy positions across the affected departments, agencies and      non-governmental organizations. This coordination is achieved in part through meetings of      interagency working groups. In addition, the National Focal Point meets separately with      interested non-governmental organizations to seek their input prior to IFCS meetings and      at other times as issues arise.               Special coordinating mechanisms are established between agencies as needed to address      cross-agency issues, such as legislative and regulatory initiatives. In addition, Federal      agencies consult with a variety of stakeholders groups and associations, including those      representing state regulatory and enforcement interests for industrial chemicals and      pesticides.                States and territories are true partners with EPA in protecting human health and the      environment from pesticide risks. They assist in developing and implementing field      programs, and they enforce OPP's regulations and pesticide labeling and use requirements.      To further these common goals, OPP supports a cooperative agreement with the Association      of American Pesticide Control Officials for the State FIFRA Issues Research and Evaluation      Group (SFIREG). SFIREG meets regularly with OPP to develop pesticide programs and discuss      implementation and enforcement issues of concern to the states and territories.               7. DATA ACCESS AND USE               Public and private entities in the United States have generated very extensive data      sets and analyses of this information to manage chemical safety programs and activities.      Regulatory agencies, such as EPA, generally have authority to require data submissions      from industry that are needed to make regulatory decisions. There are also extensive data      systems with information on approved chemicals, products and uses, though use information      is generally limited to pesticides. The Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) (ref. Section 4(b))      provisions require certain facilities to annually report their releases and waste      management information for listed chemicals. EPA then makes this information publicly      available through TRI, which is a database that is accessible electronically. TRI operates      under the community right-to-know principle by providing information on toxic chemical      releases and waste management from companies.                Data are maintained within the research and regulatory program offices described in      Chapter 5. In general, the U.S. Freedom of Information Act and related program policies      make the data and agency analyses available to the public upon request, except for      confidential business information as defined in the relevant statutes.                U.S. agencies are investigating ways of making data and other information on chemical      safety available through the Internet Web or online networks. Information about and access      to Federal government data sources has been greatly improved by the Government Information      Locator Service (GILS) project. GILS is a decentralized collection of agencybased      information locators and associated information services. GILS is intended to identify      public information resources throughout the U.S. Federal government, describe the      information available in those resources, and provide assistance in obtaining or accessing      the information.                8. TECHNICAL INFRASTRUCTURE               The U.S. has invested heavily in public and private chemical safety laboratory      facilities. These facilities generate the data needed to support government regulatory      decisions on approval and safe use of chemicals, or, in the case of government      laboratories, conduct research on chemical safety issues. Federal agencies with research      responsibilities are described in chapter 5. Scientists at higher education institutions      conduct extensive research on chemical safety. Private laboratory facilities develop the      extensive data that pesticide registrants and other chemical industry sources are required      to submit to EPA.                9. INTERNATIONAL LINKAGES                The U.S. is involved in a wide range of international activities and agreements, as      indicated in         Chapter 9. The U.S. also participates in technical assistance projects world-wide      related to chemicals safety. For example, chapter 9 describes Central American and      Indonesian projects on pesticides that could serve as models for other regions of the      world.               It is EPA's goal to share the burden of national chemical safety responsibilities      within the Americas region and internationally to protect human health and the environment      by using resources more effectively. This goal will be achieved by: (1) harmonizing      regional approaches through the Intergovernmental Forum on Chemical Safety; (2) assisting      countries in building national capacities and explaining U.S. programs and standards; and      (3) informing other governments about U.S. pesticide exports and regulatory actions. The      expected benefits of improved coordination and harmonization are: (1) improved food      safety; (2) efficiencies gained through workload sharing among national regulatory      agencies; (3) upgrading of supporting science through broader dialogues; and (4) fewer      trade problems.               Cooperative bilateral efforts on chemical safety through the Canada/U.S. Trade      Agreement (CUSTA) were recently expanded to include Mexico pursuant to the North America      Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). All three countries have much to gain from the work of a      trilateral NAFTA. The goal of the expanded effort under NAFTA is to build the blocks      necessary for the construction of an integrated, coordinated chemicals regulatory      framework. The North American Working Group on the Sound Management of Chemicals has      chosen four priority persistent and toxic substances for joint attention due to their      potential risks: PCBs, DDT, chlordane and mercury. The U.S., Canada and Mexico intend to      take action on a regional basis to reduce use/reliance on these chemicals and to replace      them with safer alternatives.                10. RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR CHEMICALS MANAGEMENT               EPA's obligations for pesticides and industrial chemicals regulatory, enforcement, and      research activities in fiscal year 1995 were $117 million and 1003 workyears for      pesticides and $148 million and 910 workyears for toxic substances. This does not include      EPA resources for work on statutes related specifically to air, water or hazardous wastes.      Other agencies involved in chemical safety, described in Chapter 5, also have substantial      chemical safety budgets but these resources were not compiled as part of this profile.      U.S. Federal agencies identify resource needs and priorities as part of the annual budget      process in the Administration and the Congress.               11. RELEVANT ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE OF GOVERNMENT               There are many Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) that are active in the field of      chemical safety in the U.S. A number of NGOs were asked to provide brief summaries of      their chemical safety activities for inclusion in this profile and this information has      been included in Chapter 11.         This listing should be considered only as an illustration of the many strong and      diverse U.S. NGO chemical safety programs.               12. INFORMATION SHARING FOR WORKERS AND THE PUBLIC               EPA's extensive information sharing activities are described in Chapter 12, as well as      the activities of several other agencies. Information on other government information      sharing programs is described under the relevant agency in Chapter 5. EPA provides      information to the general public, the press, State and local governments, EPA offices and      regions, other Federal agencies, industry, grower groups, workers, certified applicators,      trade and professional associations, environmental groups, public interest associations,      libraries, researchers, international organizations, and foreign governments.                Many EPA clearinghouses and hotlines provide information on their area of expertise to      the general public. The services send copies of regulations, guidance documents, and      outreach material; loan videos; and answer questions or refer callers to sources of      information on a more specific area.               EPA is implementing the Toxics Risk Management ""Going Public"" effort. The      ""Going Public"" effort has two related goals. The first mission is to educate      people so that they are cognizant of chemical risks and benefits. The first goal acts as a      catalyst for the second goal, which is to have the public be an integral part of the      regulatory process and help ensure that the government sets appropriate priorities and      makes the best choices on toxics control. Informed people can also identify and solve      local environmental problems without solely relying on government intervention and      resources.                 Appropriate outreach activities are vital to EPA's efforts to ensure that          groups and individuals have the information they need to make responsible          decisions about pesticides and promote public health and environmental          protection goals. The challenge is to make information widely available,          easily accessible, and suited to the needs of EPA's many publics. To accomplish          this, the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) issues announcements and          publications for both general and scientific audiences, provides information          by telephone and electronic network, responds to written requests for          information, maintains a public docket for walk-in visitors, holds public          meetings, and presents speeches and Congressional testimony. OPP and other          EPA offices respond to technical or complicated requests for information          from the public under the  Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) . The          majority of requestors receive all of the records requested, with the          mo                        Note: This information is provided for reference purposes only.                Although the information provided here was accurate and current                when first created, it is now outdated.    st          common requests to OPP being for science reviews of registration data,          administrative files for pesticide products, and reregistration information.                OPP also has an extensive outreach effort to inform foreign governments about changes      in the status of pesticides in the U.S. and major OPP programs. The purpose of these      efforts is to help foreign governments, especially those that have not yet developed      extensive pesticide regulatory and information-gathering programs, make informed choices      about the use of pesticides in their countries. Not only do these efforts benefit citizens      of foreign nations, but they also benefit Americans by helping to ensure the safety of      imported food and other commodities treated with pesticides. In addition, these efforts      help to protect wildlife, like migratory birds, that cross international borders.

Children (especially very young children) and fetuses are most vulnerable.  The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), part of the U.S. Public Health Service, and the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  are jointly issuing an alert to the general public.  There is a continuing pattern of metallic mercury exposure in children and teenagers and in persons using certain folk medicines or participating in certain ethnic or religious practices.   It is important for the general public to understand that either short-term or long-term exposures to metallic mercury can lead to serious health problems.  Human exposure to metallic mercury occurs primarily from breathing contaminated air. Other forms of mercury can be absorbed by drinking contaminated water, eating food (usually fish containing mercury), and from skin contact. At high levels, metallic mercury can cause effects on the nervous system and the developing fetus.  Other forms of mercury can damage other organs. Even at low levels, metallic mercury can cause health problems.  Metallic mercury exposure can cause harm before symptoms arise.   Once released into the environment, mercury is very hard to clear up.  If it is left unattended where exposures can occur, it can have dangerous effects on human health.    Incidents involving schoolchildren    In recent years, increasing numbers of metallic mercury spills and contamination involving schoolchildren have been reported:   In August 1994, more than 500 students in Belle Glade, Florida, were contaminated with metallic mercury after three children found 4 jars (totalling 55 pounds) of metallic-mercury in an abandoned van. The local hazardous waste materials team decontaminated the children (removed contaminated clothing and washed the metallic mercury from their skin). More than 20 families had to be evacuated while their homes were decontaminated.     In November 1994, college students at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida, removed metallic mercury from one of the school's laboratories. Students living in the dormitory were evacuated and housed in a local hotel while the dormitory was decontaminated.    In June 1996, metallic mercury was taken from a middle school in St. Joseph, Missouri, and used in and outside of school by a group of teenagers. Approximately 200 children were tested for mercury exposure; one child was hospitalized and another five underwent outpatient treatment to remove the mercury from their systems; 20 other children had mildly elevated mercury levels. Two homes and a car required extensive decontamination.   In October 1996, a high school in Oskaloosa, Kansas and a convalescent home in Johnson County, Kansas, were contaminated with metallic mercury; 52 students and an unknown number of residents of the home were tested. On the basis of ATSDR recommendations, the school was closed for a week until indoor air levels were safe. A month later, sampling at the school identified an increase in air mercury concentrations.  The school was re-evaluated and additional clean-up was done as recommended by ATSDR.     In November 1996, ATSDR again assisted state health officials and EPA in evaluating contamination at a high school and a home in Dallas, Pennsylvania, near Wilkes-Barre. Four areas in the school had levels of metallic mercury contamination that required cleanup.   In March 1997, a middle school student on his way to school found metallic mercury on the street in front of his home in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. The student took the metallic mercury to school and shared it with three to four classmates. Also, in March 1997 a broken mercury thermometer was discovered after school on the floor of a bathroom stall in the boys bathroom. One thermometer was confirmed missing from the science department's inventory. The school was found to be clear of contamination with the exception of one science laboratory and the carpet in a classroom. Two homes required decontamination.    Schoolteachers, particularly science teachers, and administrators need to be aware of students' interest in mercury, especially metallic mercury, and take steps to ensure that children are aware of its dangers and that any mercury kept in school is safely and securely contained.     Incidents involving religious practices    Persons who use metallic mercury in ethnic folk medicine and for religious practices are at risk. Metallic mercury is sold under the name  ""azogue""  in stores (sometimes called botanicas), which specialize in religious items used in Esperitismo (a spiritual belief system native to Puerto Rico), Santeria (a Cuban-based religion that venerates both African deities and Catholic saints), and voodoo.    The use of azogue in religious practices is recommended in some Hispanic communities by family members, spiritualists, card readers, and santeros. Typically, azogue is carried on one's person in a sealed pouch prepared by a spiritual leader or sprinkled in the home or automobile. Some botanica owners suggest mixing it in bath water or perfume and placing it in devotional candles.    General facts    The following are general facts about metallic mercury and its risks, as well as information about how people can protect themselves from exposure and resulting health effects.    What is mercury and how is it used?    Mercury occurs naturally in the environment in several forms.  Metallic Mercury is the liquid form used in thermometers.  Mercury is also used in other common consumer products such as fluorescent light bulbs, barometers, medical equipment such as blood pressure measurement instruments, and mercury switches in children's sneakers that light up. This alert concentrates on metallic mercury, but hazards are also associated with other types. Of these, the most common is methyl mercury contamination of fish.    How could I be exposed to mercury?    In the previously described school-associated cases, children were unaware of the dangers involved in exposing themselves and their families to this deadly poison. Adults are also often unaware of the hazards associated with mercury; some have even brought it home from work for children to play with. Just one-half teaspoon of mercury spilled in the home can be dangerous.   Adults using certain folk medicines or participating in certain religious or ethnic practices may also expose themselves and their families to metallic mercury's effects. Because metallic mercury vaporizes into the air at room temperatures, it presents an immediate health risk to anyone spending a significant amount of time in a room where metallic mercury is sprinkled or spilled onto the floor, or where opened containers of metallic mercury are present. Very small amounts of metallic mercury (for example, a few drops) can raise air concentrations to levels that may be harmful to health.    How does mercury affect health?    At high levels, metallic mercury can cause effects on the nervous system and the developing fetus.  Other forms of mercury can damage other organs. Even at low levels, metallic mercury can cause health problems. Mercury exposure can begin to cause harm before symptoms arise. Once symptoms do arise, health problems related to metallic mercury poisoning can include tremors, changes in vision or hearing, insomnia, weakness, difficulty with memory, headache, irritability, shyness and nervousness, and a health condition called acrodynia.     Pregnant women and their fetuses are especially vulnerable to the toxic effects of metallic mercury because it readily passes from the placenta to the fetus. Mercury may accumulate in higher concentrations in the unborn baby than in the mother. Young children, who often play on the floor where metallic mercury may have been spilled, are particularly at risk for effects on the central nervous system. Mercury vapors are readily absorbed into the bloodstream from the lungs, and the human central nervous system, which is still developing during the first few years of life, may become damaged.    Health effects can result from short-term or long-term exposure. The body gets rid of mercury through the urine and feces. Removal of this substance from the body can take up to several months after exposure. Acrodynia is characterized by itching, swelling, and flushing; pink-colored palms and soles of the feet; excessive perspiration; rashes; irritability; fretfulness; sleeplessness; joint pains and weakness. Children exposed to metallic mercury for long periods may have trouble learning in school. When mercury levels in the body are extremely high, ""chelation"" therapy is necessary. Chelation therapy involves putting a chemical into the bloodstream; the chemical combines with the mercury to aid in its removal from the body.     Prevention is the key to avoiding poisoning in homes, schools, and families.    What is mercury contamination and how can I prevent it?    First, avoid using metallic mercury.  Appropriate substitutes are available for nearly all uses of metallic mercury.  Therefore, be sure you need to use it. If not, make arrangements to safely dispose of whatever metallic mercury you might have. If you do need to use metallic mercury, make sure it is safely stored in a leakproof container. Keep it in a secure space (e.g., a locking closet) so that others cannot easily get it.  Use of metallic mercury in a controlled environment helps to reduce the risk that contamination will occur.    Mercury contamination results from exposure through the air, water, food, soil, or direct contact.  Exposure to metallic mercury occurs when it is not stored in a closed container. Contamination may include the spilling of metallic mercury on clothes, furniture, carpet, floors, walls, the natural environment, and even the human body.  Metallic mercury and its vapors are extremely difficult to remove from such items as clothes, furniture, carpet, floors, and walls. The vapors will also accumulate in walls and other structures in contaminated rooms. The contamination can remain for months or years, posing a risk to exposed individuals. The use of metallic mercury in a home or apartment not only poses a threat to persons currently residing in that structure, but also to those who subsequently occupy that dwelling and are unaware of the past mercury use.   Can I clean up mercury with a vacuum cleaner?    Never use a vacuum cleaner. Using a vacuum cleaner causes metallic mercury to vaporize in the air, creating greater health risks. It also ruins the vacuum cleaner.    Can electronic equipment collect mercury vapors?    Metallic mercury vapors can accumulate in electronic equipment, especially computers.  When the computer is turned on, the mercury revaporizes. This cycle of metallic mercury collecting and vaporizing from computers has been seen in several incidents in schools.   What should I do to keep my home safe?    Metallic mercury is used in a variety of household and industrial items including thermostats, fluorescent light bulbs, barometers, glass thermometers, and some blood pressure machines. Care must be taken in handling and disposing of all items in the home that contain metallic mercury.   First,  do NOT  try to vacuum or heat the metallic mercury in any way.  Mercury vapors are very dangerous and are virtually undetectable.  Avoid breathing mercury dust, vapor, mist, or gas.  Avoid contact with eyes, skin, and clothing. If you feel you have been exposed directly to metallic mercury, wash thoroughly after handling.  Remove contaminated clothing and wash before reuse. Provide as much clean air as possible.    For example, if a thermometer breaks, remove children from the area. Clean up the bead of metallic mercury by carefully rolling it onto a sheet of paper or sucking it up with an eye dropper. After picking up the metallic mercury, put it into a bag or airtight container. The paper or eye dropper should also be bagged and disposed of properly according to guidance provided by environmental officials or your local health department. Try to ventilate the room to the outside and close off from the rest of the home. Use fans for a minimum of one hour to speed the ventilation. If larger amounts of metallic mercury are found (for example, a jar), make sure that the metallic mercury is in an airtight container and call your local health department for instructions in how to safely dispose of it. If the larger amount is spilled, leave the area and contact your local health department and fire authorities.  Do not simply throw it away, but instead seek professional guidance.    ATSDR and EPA do not recommend the use of uncontained metallic (liquid) mercury (that is, mercury not properly enclosed in glass as it is in thermometers) in homes, automobiles, day care centers, schools, offices, and other public buildings.

The Initiative promotes and celebrates voluntary adoption of measures to reduce pollution from marinas and recreational boating. The Initiative is coordinated by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources in partnership with representatives of the marina industry. There are two main aspects to the Clean Marina Initiative: boater education and an awards program to recognize environmentally-responsible marinas. The first Clean Marina awards will be presented during the 1999 boating season. Boaters are encouraged to look for the Clean Marina logo when selecting a marina. The boater education component compliments the Clean Marina awards program. The goal is to foster wide-spread adoption of pollution prevention measures by making boaters aware of what they can do to protect natural resources. This Lesson Plan introduces recreational boaters to the environmental concerns associated with boating, reviews legal requirements, and enumerates pollution prevention practices.  How to use this Lesson Plan This lesson plan is designed to be incorporated into Maryland' Basic Boating Course. It may s be used by any instructor wishing to educate boaters about general pollution prevention measures, however. The Lesson Plan is divided into four sections:  Petroleum control  Vessel sewage  Waste containment and disposal  Vessel cleaning and maintenance Each section contains a speaking plan for the instructor, overheads, and a handout (i.e., Clean Boating Tip Sheet). It is the instructor' responsibility to photocopy the overheads onto s transparencies and to make copies of the handouts for students. Students may request individual copies of tip cards, brochures, pumpout information, and other DNR materials by calling 410-260-8770. They can also find clean boating materials on line at www.dnr.state.md.us/boating.   Section Contents Petroleum Control Section Plan Overheads  Environmental Concerns  The Law  Fueling Practices  Bilge Maintenance and Oil Changes  Disposal of oil Absorbent Materials  Emissions Control  Preventative Equipment  In Case of a Spill Handout  Clean Boating Tip Sheet: Petroleum Control Additional Resources  Oil absorbent pad  Container to capture fuel-vent overflows (Examples are "" No-Spill""and "" Guzzler.""

Content and Activity Plan: Time 10 minutes Activity Lecture and follow up questions covering: (overhead 1)  Environmental Concerns  Petroleum in or on the water is harmful and, in some cases, fatal to aquatic life. Benzene, a carcinogen, is in gasoline. Oil contains zinc, sulfur, and phosphorous. Once petroleum is introduced into the water, it may float at the surface, evaporate into the air, become suspended in the water column or settle to the sea floor. Floating petroleum is particularly noxious because it reduces light penetration and the exchange of oxygen at the water' surface. s Floating oil also contaminates the microlayer. The microlayer refers to the uppermost portion of the water column. It is home to thousands of species of plants, animals, and microbes. Ninety-nine percent of the Chesapeake Bay' blue crab larvae feed in the microlayer which also serves as a s nursery ground for rockfish (Hardy 1991). The abundance of life in the microlayer attracts predators: seabirds from above and fish from below. Pollution in the microlayer, thus, has the potential to poison much of the aquatic food web. Also worth noting, a single pint of oil released onto the water can cover one acre of water surface area.  The Law  Because of the harm associated with petroleum, the discharge of oil is absolutely prohibited. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act prohibits the discharge of oil or oily waste into or upon the navigable waters of the United States or the waters of the contiguous zone if such discharge causes a film or sheen upon, or discoloration of, the surface of the water, or causes a sludge or emulsion beneath the surface of the water. Violators are subject to a penalty of $5,000. The United States Coast Guard must be notified anytime a spill produces a sheen on the water. Call the National Response Center at 1-800-424-8802. Report the location, source, size, color, substance, and time of the spill. Failure to report a spill may result in fines.  (overhead 2)   The Clean Water Act (33 CFR 153.305) also prohibits the use of soaps or other dispersing agents to dissipate oil on the water or in the bilge without the permission of the Coast Guard (specifically, the Captain of the Port of Baltimore). Soaps, emulsifiers and dispersants cause the petroleum to sink in the water column and mix with sediments where they will remain for years. Also, the soaps themselves are pollutants. You may be fined up to $25,000 per incident for the unauthorized use of soap or other dispersing agents on the water or in the bilge. Maryland State Law The discharge of oil is also prohibited by State law. Section 4-410(a) of Maryland Environment Article, Annotated Code of Maryland, states that Except in case of emergency imperiling life or property, unavoidable accident, collision, or stranding, or as authorized by a permit issued under 9-323 of this article, it is unlawful for any person to discharge or permit the discharge of oil in any manner into or on waters of this State. All spills must be reported immediately to the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE): 410-974-3551.  Fueling Practices  Gas or diesel may be spilled during the act of fueling: as backsplash out the fuel intake or as overflow out the vent fitting. Spills of this sort harm aquatic life, waste money, and can result in stains on the hull and damage to the gel coat and striping. Follow these tips to avoid problems: C Fill tanks to no more than 90 percent capacity--gas that is drawn from cool storage tanks will expand as it warms up onboard your vessel. C To determine when the tank is 90 percent full, listen to the filler pipe, use a sounding stick (if possible), and be aware of your tank' volume. s C Rather than filling your tank upon your return to port, wait and fill it just before leaving on your next trip. This practice will reduce spills due to thermal expansion because the fuel will be used before it has a chance to warm up. C Fill portable tanks ashore where spills are less likely to occur and easier to clean up. C Use oil absorbent pads to catch all drips. C Slow down at the beginning and end of fueling.  (overhead 3)  Engine oil tends to accumulate in bilges. If no precautions are taken, the oil is pumped overboard along with the bilge water. Discharging oily water is illegal. To avoid fines and to protect water quality, follow these tips: C Keep your engine well tuned to minimize the amount of oil that is released. Be sure there are no leaking seals, gaskets or hoses. C If you change your own oil, purchase a non-spill pump to draw crankcase oils out through the dipstick tube and slip a plastic bag over used oil filters prior to their removal to capture any drips. Hot drain the filter by punching a hole in the dome end and draining for 24 hours. Recycle the collected oil. Recycle the metal canister if practical. If not, dispose in your regular trash. C Place oil absorbent materials or a bioremediating bilge boom in the bilge. C Place an oil absorbent pad under the engine.  Bilge Maintenance and Oil Changes (overhead 4) Note pass around oil absorbent pad as demonstration   C C C  Replace oil absorbent materials regularly. Look for contractors or marinas that offer a bilge pumpout service. Do not treat oily water with detergents. Soaps pollute and make clean up impossible. You may be fined up to $25,000 for using soaps to dissipate oil.  Disposal of Oil Absorbent Materials  The disposal of used oil absorbent material depends on what type of product it is and how it was used: C Standard absorbents that are saturated with gasoline may be air dried and reused. C Standard absorbents saturated with oil or diesel may be wrung out over oil recycling bins (if they are saturated with oil or diesel only!) and reused. Alternatively, they should be double bagged with one plastic bag sealed inside of another and tossed in your regular trash. C Bioremediating bilge booms may be disposed in your regular trash as long as they are not dripping any liquid. Because the microbes need oxygen to function, do not seal them in plastic bags.  (overhead 5)  Emissions Control  Marine engines--especially 2-stroke outboard motors--produce the highest average level of hydrocarbon exhaust emissions after lawn and garden equipment. Hydrocarbon emissions contribute to ground level ozone, a known health risk. Follow these tips to help your engine operate as efficiently as possible: C Use the gas to oil ratio recommended by the engine manufacturer. Too much oil can foul spark plugs and too little can lead to increased engine wear or even failure. C Use premium two-cycle engine oil (TC-W3 or TC-W4). Premium oils improve engine performance and reduce pollution because they burn cleaner, contain more detergents, and prevent formation of carbon deposits. C Use gasoline with the octane level recommended by the engine manufacturer.  (overhead 6)  Preventative Equipment (overhead 7) Suggestion bring samples of the following items to class to use as visual aids.  Products are available commercially which can help you prevent spills and reduce emissions: C Install a fuel/air separator along your vent line. These devices allow air, but not fuel to escape through a vent opening. C Attach a safety nozzle to portable gas cans used to fill outboard engines. These nozzles automatically stop the flow of fuel when the receiving tank is full. C To prevent oily bilge water from being discharged, install a bilge pump switch that leaves an inch or two of water in the bilge. Alternatively, connect a bilge water filter to your vessel' s bilge pump. Filters will remove oil, fuel and other petroleum hydrocarbons from the water. C When it is time to buy a new engine, select a fuel efficient, low emission model. C Attach a container to the external vent fitting to collect overflow. There are products on the market that may be attached to the hull with suction cups. A rubber seal on the container fits over the fuel vent allowing the overflow to enter the container. Fuel captured in this manner can be added to the next boat to fuel.   In Case of a Spill      Stop the flow. Contain the spill. Call the U.S. Coast Guard National Response Center at (800) 424-8802.

Content and Activity Plan: Time 10 minutes Activity Lecture and follow up questions covering: (overhead 1)  Environmental Concerns  Raw or poorly treated boat sewage is harmful to human health and water quality. Typhoid, hepatitis, cholera, gastroenteritis, and other waterborne diseases may be passed directly to people who swim in contaminated waters. People may also become infected by eating shellfish contaminated with viruses and other microorganisms contained in sewage discharge. Sewage is also harmful to water quality. Because the microorganisms within sewage need oxygen, any effluent discharged to waterways reduces the amount of oxygen available to fish and other forms of aquatic life. Furthermore, the heavy nutrient load in sewage promotes excessive algal growth. As the algae multiply, they prevent life-giving sunlight from reaching subsurface vegetation. When the algae die they create another problem: the algae are decomposed by bacteria which further reduce levels of dissolved oxygen.  The Law  According to Federal and State law, it is illegal to discharge raw sewage. All vessels with installed toilets must have a Marine Sanitation Device (MSD): C Type I systems mechanically cut solids and disinfect waste. They must bear a U.S. Coast Guard certification label. C Type II systems are similar to Type I systems. The difference is that they treat sewage to a higher standard and generally require more space and energy. Type II systems must also have a Coast Guard certification label. C Type III systems do not discharge sewage. Holding tanks are the most common Type III system. Incinerating systems are another option. A Coast Guard label is not required. Vessels 65 feet and under may have any of these three types of MSDs. Vessels over 65 feet must have a Type II or III system.  (overhead 2)   Holding Tanks (Type III MSD)  A free booklet explaining how to retrofit a boat to include a holding tank is available from the Department of Natural Resources (410) 260-8770. Use good plumbing to control holding tank odor. Fiberglass and metal tanks are highly resistant to permeation. Specially labeled flexible "" sanitation hoses""and PVC piping are also highly impermeable. Hose runs should be as short and as straight as possible. Wherever practical, use rigid pipe below the level of the holding tank and in other areas where sewage will accumulate. Keep the number of connections to a minimum and insure that seals are tight. Use enzyme-based products in your holding tank to further control odor. Enzymatic products use biological processes, rather than harsh chemicals, to breakdown sewage. Be sure to pump and rinse your holding tank prior to initial use of an enzyme product if you have used chemical-based odor control additives in the past. Chemical residues may interfere with the effectiveness of enzymebased products. Avoid holding tank products that contain quaternary ammonium compounds (QAC) and formaldehyde. These products may disrupt sewage treatment plants.  (overhead 3)  Type I and II MSD (overhead 3)  Maintain your Type I or II MSD. Establish a regular maintenance schedule based on your owner' s manual to remind yourself when chemicals need to be added, electrodes need to be cleaned, etc. Do not discharge your Type I or II MSD while in a marina, in a swimming area, over an oyster bar or in a poorly flushed area. Effluent from legal Type I and Type II systems contains nutrients and possibly toxic chemicals. It may contain pathogens as well. Use shoreside restrooms when in port.   Sewage: Environmental Concerns  Harmful to human health  Diseases may be passed to swimmers or to people who eat contaminated shellfish  Harmful to water quality  Reduces oxygen available to fish and other aquatic life  Excess nutrients cause algal blooms  Excess algae blocks sunlight  Bacteria that decompose algae reduce dissolved oxygen  Sewage overhead 1   Sewage: The Law  Discharging raw sewage is against State and Federal laws  All vessels with installed toilets must have a Marine Sanitation Device (MSD)  There are 3 types of MSDs  Type I: Cut solids, disinfect and release sewage. Must have a USCG certification label.  Type II: Similar to Type I, but treat sewage to a higher standard before releasing. Must have a USCG certification label.

Content and Activity Plan: Time 10 minutes Activity Lecture and follow up questions covering: (overhead 1)  Environmental Concerns  Solid waste, particularly plastics, must be contained. There are many well-documented instances of marine mammals, fish, turtles, and seabirds that have become entangled in or choked on plastic marine debris. Plastics also represent a hazard to navigation as they can snare propellers and clog engine intake systems. Divers are, likewise, susceptible to entanglement. Furthermore, solid waste that washes up on shore is unattractive and may be costly to remove.  The Law  The Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act of 1987 (MPPRCA), Title II of Public Law 100220, restricts the overboard discharge of garbage. Its primary emphasis is on plastics; it is illegal to discharge plastic materials into any waterbody. The disposal of other types of garbage is restricted according to how far a vessel is out to sea. The important thing to remember is that within the Chesapeake and coastal bays, along rivers, and on inland lakes, the discharge of any garbage into the water is illegal. Fish guts are an exception. The discharge of fish waste into Maryland waters is not desirable, however. (overhead 3) C Within U.S. lakes, rivers, bays, sounds and within 3 nautical miles from the ocean shore, it is illegal to dump anything other than fish waste. C Between 3 and 12 nautical miles from shore, it is illegal to dump plastic and any other garbage that is greater than one inch in size. C Between 12 and 25 nautical miles from shore, it is illegal to dump plastic and dunnage, i.e, lining and packing material, nets, lines, etc. C Beyond 25 nautical miles, it is illegal to dump plastic.

Purchase refreshments in recyclable containers and recycle them.  Properly dispose of all trash on-shore, e.g., bring home or leave in a dumpster at the marina.  Fish Scraps  For safety reasons, marinas are often located in sheltered areasareas that will protect boats from wind and waves during a storm. The same features that protect boats during a storm, however, also limit the exchange of water. Poor exchange, or flushing, means that any waste which is discharged into the water may stay in the same general area for an extended length of time. Fish cleaning may pose a problem if the guts are discarded into a poorly flushed marina basin. Fish waste is smelly and unsightly.

Content and Activity Plan: Time 10 minutes Environmental Concerns  Activity Lecture and follow up questions covering:  (overhead 1) As a boater, you are well aware of the care your vessel requires. In order to keep your boat safe, reliable, and attractive, you must clean and maintain it. As you do so, minimize environmental impacts by following the recommendations listed here. Sanding, blasting, and pressure washing are meant to remove paint and marine growth. In the process, toxic heavy metals such as copper and tin may be released. If heavy metals find their way into the water, they may be consumed by mussels, worms and other bottom-dwelling creatures and passed up the food chain to fish, birds and humans. Heavy metals that are not incorporated into living tissue will remain in the sediments where they will substantially increase the cost of dredge spoil disposal. Paints, solvents, thinners and brush cleaners generally are toxic and may cause cancer. If spilled, they may harm aquatic life and water quality. Additionally, the fumes known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released by some paints and solvents contribute to air pollution. Likewise, oil and grease from maintenance areas threaten aquatic life. Many of the cleaning products used on boats are also toxic. Many contain caustic or corrosive elements. They may also contain chlorine, phosphates, inorganic salts, and metals. Even non-toxic products are harmful to wildlife. For example, detergents found in many boat cleaning products will destroy the natural oils on fish gills, reducing their ability to breathe. Boaters can minimize environmental impacts by following the recommendations listed below:   Cleaning Vessels Carefully C C  C C  C  (overhead 2) Wash frequently with a sponge or nonabrasive pad and plain water. This approach is very effective at removing salt. Additional "" elbow-grease""is required to remove stains. When detergents are necessary, use soaps that are phosphate-free, biodegradable, and nontoxic. Any soap should be used sparingly because even non-toxic products can be harmful to wildlife. For example, detergents will destroy the natural oils on fish gills, limiting their ability to breathe. Wax your boat, if appropriate. A good coat of wax prevents surface dirt from becoming ingrained. Clean teak with a mild soap and abrasive pads or bronze wool. This method is safe for the environment and better for the boat than the solvents in standard teak cleaners which tend to eat away at the wood and to damage seam compounds. Avoid detergents that contain ammonia, sodium hypochlorite, chlorinated solvents (bleach), petroleum distillates and lye. (overhead 3) Collect all paint chips, dust, and residue. Dispose in regular trash. Share leftover paint and varnish. Use less toxic propylene glycol antifreeze. Avoid overkill. Select a bottom paint developed for the mid-Atlantic region.  Maintaining Vessels Mindfully C C C C  Recycling Regularly  (overhead 4) The amount of trash heading to the landfill can be greatly reduced by recycling certain materials. Also, recycling can provide uses for otherwise toxic waste such as used lead acid batteries, antifreeze, and oil. C Recycle used oil, oil filters, and antifreeze. C Bring used solvents and waste gasoline to local hazardous waste collection days. C Call 1-800-4-RECYCLE for locations of recycling centers and information about hazardous waste collection days. C Visit the Maryland Department of the Environment' web page at s www.mde.state.md.us/was/recycle for local recycling and hazardous waste contacts.  Being a Conscientious Consumer   C  C  (overhead 5) Read product labels. Labels convey information about the degree of hazard associated with a particular product. For example, DANGER equates to extremely flammable, corrosive or toxic; WARNING indicates that the material is moderately hazardous; and CAUTION signals a less hazardous product. Select products that contain no warnings or which merely CAUTION consumers. Be wary of unqualified general claims of environmental benefit, e.g., "" ozone friendly"" A . better, more meaningful label would read, "" This product is 95 percent less damaging to the ozone layer than past formulations that contained chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)."" For additional information about environmentally responsible products, contact Green Seal. Green Seal is an independent, nonprofit organization that sets environmental standards for consumer goods.

For example, if paint chips from a hull are not contained, they may end up in the water. The heavy metals in the paint chips may then be consumed by mussels, worms, and other bottom-dwelling creatures and passed up the food chain to fish, birds, and humans.  ingly because even nontoxic products can be harmful to wildlife. For example, detergents will destroy the natural oils on fish gills, limiting their ability to breathe. Wax your boat, if appropriate. A good coat of wax prevents surface dirt from becoming ingrained. Clean teak with a mild soap and abrasive pads or bronze wool. This method is safe for the environment and better for the boat than the solvents in standard teak cleaners which tend to eat away at the wood and to damage seam compounds. Avoid detergents that contain ammonia, sodium hypochlorite, chlorinated solvents (bleach), petroleum distillates, and lye. Try some of the alternative cleaning products listed on the reverse side of this page.  Avoid overkill. Select a bottom paint developed for the mid-Atlantic region.  Recycle Regularly      Clean Carefully     Recycle used oil, oil filters, and antifreeze.  Bring used solvents and waste gasoline to local hazardous waste collection days.  Call 1-800-4-RECYCLE for locations of recycling centers and information about hazardous waste collection days.  Visit the Maryland Department of the Environments web page at www.mde.state.md.us/was/ recycle/index.html for local recycling and hazardous waste contacts.   Wash frequently with a sponge or nonabrasive pad and plain water. This approach is very effective at removing salt. Additional elbow-grease is required to remove stains.  When detergents are necessary, use soaps that are phosphate-free, biodegradable, and non-toxic. Any soap should be used spar-  Maintain Mindfully   Collect all paint chips, dust, and residue. Dispose in regular trash.  Share leftover paint and varnish.  Use less toxic propylene glycol antifreeze.   Be a Conscientious Consumer  Read product labels. Labels convey information about the degree of hazard associated with a particular product. For example, DANGER equates to extremely flammable, corrosive or toxic; WARNING indicates that the material is moderately hazardous; and CAUTION signals a less hazardous product. Select products that contain no warnings or which merely CAUTION consumers. Alternatives to Toxic Products   Be wary of unqualified general claims of environmental benefit, e.g., ozone friendly. A better, more meaningful label would read, This product is 95 percent less damaging to the ozone layer than past formulations that contained chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).  For additional information about environmentally responsible products, contact Green Seal. Green Seal is an independent, nonprofit  organization that sets environmental standards for consumer goods. Products that meet their criteria are awarded a Green Seal of Approval. You may search Green Seals database of Green Seal-certified, environmentally responsible products at www.greenseal.org or call (202) 588-8400.  While baking soda, vinegar, lemon juice, and vegetable oils are far less harmful than bleaches, scouring powders or detergents, they are still toxic to marine life. Use cleaning products sparingly and minimize the amount discharged into the water. Never dispose of any cleaning products down the thru-hull drain; dispose of them on shore.

GX263-51-16223378	"MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING This Memorandum of Understanding is entered into this _____ day of __________ 2003 by and between the State of Hawaii and the North West CruiseShip Association, hereinafter referred to as NWCA, representing Carnival Cruise Lines, Celebrity Cruises, Crystal Cruises, Holland America Line, Norwegian Cruise Line, Princess Cruises, Royal Caribbean International, [World Explorer,] Radisson Seven Seas and [Seabourn] Silversea Cruises, as representatives of the Cruise Industry in Hawaii. Whereas the State of Hawaii is charged with the responsibility of protecting and conserving Hawaii's environmental resources in relation to the Cruise Industry's environmental practices in Hawaii; and Whereas, the NWCA is a non-profit entity organized for the purpose of representing member cruise lines which operate in and about Hawaii, whose current membership is identified in Appendix I; and Whereas, the NWCA has adopted the ""Cruise Industry Waste Management Practices and Procedures"" as promulgated by the Cruise Industry's trade association, the International Council of Cruise Lines, herein referred to as ICCL, which practices and procedures are attached hereto as Appendix II; and Whereas, NWCA cruise vessels operate in international waters and move passengers to destinations worldwide and, consequently, those cruise vessel waste management practices must take into account environmental laws and regulations in many jurisdictions and international treaties and conventions; and Whereas, the NWCA and the State of Hawaii have met to develop waste management practices that preserve a clean and healthy environment and demonstrate the Cruise Industry's commitment to be a steward of the environment; and Whereas, research is ongoing to establish the impact of ships' wastewater discharges on the ocean environment, and the results of this research will be taken into account in periodic review of the wastewater discharge practices described in this memorandum of understanding; and Whereas, the cruise industry recognizes Hawaii's fragile marine environment and is committed to help protect this environment by being proactive in other areas, including oil spill planning and response. It is recognized that all cruise ships have a Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plan (SOPEP) that meets the requirements of MARPOL for spill response world-wide. In support of their commitment, all cruise ships of the North West CruiseShip Association will have an appendix added to their SOPEP to list spill contractors and incident management team resources for response in waters near and around Hawaii.   Now therefore, based upon mutual understanding, the parties enter into this Memorandum of Understanding to implement the following environmental goals, policies and practices.  Definition of terms for the purpose of this agreement: ""air emissions"" refers to the airborne releases associated with the operation of the vessel; ""blackwater"" means waste from toilets, urinals, medical sinks and other similar facilities; ""cruise ship"" means any vessel that is owned or operated by a member of the NWCA; ""garbage"" means solid galley waste, paper, rags, plastics, glass, metal, bottles, crockery, junk or similar refuse; ""graywater"" includes drainage from dishwasher, shower, laundry, bath and washbasin drains; ""Hawaii marine areas"" means those waters between the shoreline of the Hawaiian Islands and any point 4 nautical miles beyond the 100 fathom contour line as illustrated in Appendix III; 1. The State of Hawaii accepts the ICCL Industry Standard E-0l -01, titled Cruise  Industry Waste Management Practices and Procedures (Appendix II) as ICCL member policy in the management of solid waste, hazardous wastes and wastewaters. In addition to the ICCL Practices, the members of NWCA operating in Hawaii agree to comply with the following unique practices among the Hawaiian Islands: Wastewater Management  1.1  In recognition of the sensitive nature of Hawaii's marine environment, the NWCA agrees to prohibit the discharge of untreated black water, treated black water or gray water within the Hawaii marine areas as defined above. (Appendix III). Exception from this prohibition is as follows: If the effluent from an advanced wastewater treatment system on board a ship meets standards for continuous discharge as set under federal Law - Title XIV Certain Alaskan Cruise Ship Operations, Section 1404 Limitations on Discharge of Treated Sewage or Graywater, Subsection (c) (1), (2), (3), (4) (Appendix VII), the effluent from such advanced wastewater treatment systems may be discharged in the Hawaii marine areas while the ship maintains a minimum speed of six knots and while the ship is more than one nautical mile from shore. Prior to the discharge of effluent by a ship utilizing an advanced treatment system in the situation described above, the cruise ship company must first provide to the  2   State of Hawaii test results as are required under the above referenced federal law to verify that the system meets or exceeds the federal law standards as described. The NWCA and the State of Hawaii will continue discussions to determine whether maintaining these restrictions on advanced wastewater treatment systems is consistent with best available scientific information on the environmental effects of the discharges. The NWCA member lines will maintain records of wastewater discharge in the Hawaiian marine areas. Upon any incident of non-compliance with the MOU, the member line will provide the State, within 10 working days, with a report to include copies of the related logbook records covering the period of operation in the Hawaiian marine areas. Reports will include the dates, times, locations and volume or flow rates of any discharge of wastewater, including treated and untreated blackwater and graywater, into the Hawaiian marine areas. In addition the member lines will respond within 21 working days to requests from the State Department of Health for further information regarding wastewater discharges. 1.2 Solid Waste, Hazardous Waste Management:  The NWCA has adopted the ICCL policy guidelines as stipulated above. NWCA Ships sailing in Hawaiian [waters] marine areas will comply with these policies and best practices as presented in these standards. (Appendix II) NWCA member ships operating in Hawaiian [waters] marine areas will eliminate, to the maximum extent possible, the disposal of wastes described under MARPOL Annex V into the marine environment through improved reuse and recycling opportunities. Where reuse and recycling are not feasible, waste will be discharged into the marine environment only if it has been properly processed and can be discharged in accordance with MARPOL, the ICCL best management practices, and other prevailing requirements. Whenever a member ship offloads solid waste in Hawaii, it shall ensure that such offloading be done in compliance with all state and local laws. 1.3 1.3.1 1.3.2 Air Emissions NWCA members agree that their ships will not use their incinerators in any Hawaiian ports for the combustion of any waste materials. NWCA members agree to limit visible emissions, excluding condensed water vapor, as follows: Ships will not exceed 20% opacity for periods of time exceeding 6 minutes in any 60-minute period (Continuous emission monitor or EPA Method 9) except for the following:  3   a. When the ship is maneuvering to or from the dock or anchor, b. In the event of a navigational or safety concern on the ship,  1  c. When an equipment failure occurs2. In the case of an equipment failure, the cruise line will upon request, provide information to the State that describes the subject equipment, the malfunction, the corrective actions taken and the start and end times of the malfunctioning period. Note: Depending on current, wind and port congestion, it may be necessary to have full engine capacity on standby to assure safe port navigation or compensate for equipment failure. In such cases of full engine deployment and low engine loads, higher than normal particulate emissions can result. 1.3.3 NWCA ships will have opacity-metering and recording capability and will continuously monitor the stack's visible emissions while sailing in Hawaiian waters. The State of Hawaii recognizes that, as of the execution of this memorandum, there are no Cruise Steamships plying the waters of Hawaii. Notwithstanding the foregoing, NWCA members agree that they shall not discharge soot within 1,000 yards of the Hawaii coastline. Cruise Steamships shall not cause or permit the discharge if it would have been practical to emit the discharge before or after leaving land or if an alternative method could have been employed. The NWCA member ships generally take on fuel in California, British Columbia, and Hawaii ports. The sulfur content of the fuel currently available at these locations is less than 2.8% by weight. It is the intent of the member cruise lines to continue to bunker their ships in these ports with fuel with a sulfur content of less than 2.8% by weight. If such fuel becomes unavailable in  1.3.4  1.3.5  Maneuvering is defined for the purpose of this MOU as: On departure from the dock or anchorage, maneuvering will commence with the startup of the additional engines required for safe ship handling on its departure from the dock or anchor. It will cease once the ship has established its course and speed towards the open sea and is clear of the last port navigational markers. On arrival, maneuvering will commence when the engine configuration for entering the port has been set by the Captain. It may call for additional engines to assure adequate power to allow for safe ship handling during docking procedures, or anchoring, and will cease when the ship is safely secured to the dock, or at anchor, and the additional engines are shut down. Equipment failure (for example  boiler, engine injector or turbo failure) can cause periodic excess particulate matter. Some discretion from the visual emission standards is allowed if the failure has occurred on the current or previous voyage, as long as the repairs are waiting for either technical support or a critical spare part. 2  1  4   those ports, or is unavailable for any NWCA ship coming to Hawaii from other ports, the ship will advise the State of Hawaii Department of Health in writing. 2. The State of Hawaii acknowledges that the waste management practices and procedures referenced and/or contained in section 1 above meet or exceed the standards set forth in Hawaii laws and applicable Hawaii regulations as pertaining to ship operations. The State of Hawaii and the NWCA understand that the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) has Federal jurisdiction over environmental matters in navigable waterways in the United States and conducts passenger ship examinations that include review of environmental systems, Safety Management System (SMS) documentation and such MARPOLmandated documents as the Oil Record Book and the Garbage Record Book. Additionally, NWCA member cruise vessels will integrate such industry standards into SMS documentation that ensure compliance through statutorily required internal and third party audits. The USCG has developed guidelines relating to the inspection of waste management practices and procedures, which have been adopted by the cruise industry. The State of Hawaii accepts the USCG Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular and Environmental Systems Checklist (Appendix IV), which will be incorporated into USCG 840 Guidebook as the procedure to conduct waste management inspections on board cruise vessels. [To reduce administrative burden on the cruise ship industry, the State of Hawaii agrees to first request from the USCG any records for cruise vessels entering Hawaii territorial waters. Should records described above not be made available by the USCG, the cruise ship will provide them to the State.] The ICCL in consultation with NWCA is working with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop a national practice for the assigning of an EPA Identification Number to the generator of hazardous wastes, which recognizes the multi-jurisdictional itineraries of a cruise vessel. Conceptually, the EPA has agreed that issuing a national identification number to cruise vessels operating in the U.S. is an acceptable procedure. EPA also proposes that the state where company offices are located may issue the national identification numbers provided the criteria and information submitted required for obtaining the number is standard for the United States. The State of Hawaii and NWCA agree to a uniform application procedure for the EPA national identification number in accordance with the Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA) (Appendix V). The State of Hawaii shall have the right to inspect all such records upon written request to the cruise vessel operator. The State of Hawaii recognizes that in some cases EPA Identification Numbers may not be required under federal law because of the small amounts of waste generated. The NWCA has adopted a uniform procedure for the application of RCRA to cruise vessels entering Hawaii (Appendix VI). The State of Hawaii accepts this procedure as the appropriate process for vendor selection and management of hazardous wastes in Hawaii. NWCA member lines agree to provide an annual report regarding the total hazardous waste offloaded in Hawaii by each cruise vessel.  3.  4.  5.  6.  5   7.  The State of Hawaii and NWCA agree that all records required by RCRA for cruise vessels entering Hawaii territorial waters shall be available to the State of Hawaii upon written request to the cruise vessel operator. The State of Hawaii recognizes that waste management practices are undergoing constant assessment and evaluation by cruise industry members. It is understood by the STATE OF HAWAII and the NWCA that the management of waste streams will be an ongoing process, which has as its stated objectives both waste minimization and pollution prevention. Consequently, all parties agree to continue to work with each other in good faith to achieve the stated objectives. This may require additional meetings with federal regulators to discuss specific issues applicable to the cruise industry in the U.S. The NWCA acknowledges that its operating practices are required to comply with the applicable provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Invasive Species Act. The NWCA member lines in support of a commitment to maintain high levels of readiness for response to ship casualties, including oil spills, will review their response procedures with the State. The NWCA will conduct regular spill response exercises in cooperation with the State and the US Coast Guard, actively participate in the Hawaii Area Committee3 and conduct a risk analysis in cooperation with the State to ensure that all parties are capable of adequately responding to an oil spill emergency. The State of Hawaii agrees that the performance required by the NWCA under the terms of this Memorandum of Understanding shall be directed only to its member cruise lines. The NWCA acknowledges that its members operate cruise vessels engaged in cruise itineraries greater than one day duration; and further that its members do not operate one-day attraction ships or casino gambling ships. All parties acknowledge that ongoing discussions of environmental goals are recognized as a necessary component to the successful implementation of management practices for waste minimization and reduction. All parties acknowledge that this MOU is not inclusive of all issues, rules or programs that may arise in the future. The State of Hawaii reserves the right to enter into additional MOU to address or refine such issues, or to pursue appropriate legislation. All parties agree to at least one annual meeting to review the effectiveness of the MOU. The State of Hawaii and NWCA reserve the right to cancel this MOU upon 90 days written notice.  8.  9. 10.  11.  12.  13.  3  The Hawaii Area Committee is spill preparedness and planning body made up of Industry, Federal, State, and local agency representatives.

GX263-78-9556526	"Cruising Toward a Cleaner Industry By Shari Currey, CZM  During a single voyage, a modern cruise ship can carry hundreds or even thousands of passengers and crew to exotic coastal locations around the world. All told, the entire global cruise fleet, comprised of over 223 ships, transports an estimated 9.5 million passengers each year. Although cruise lines offer service on every continent, more than half of the global fleet operates in the North American market, with the major U.S. ports of call located in Florida, Alaska, Texas, California, Louisiana, New York, Puerto Rico, and, somewhat surprisingly, Massachusetts. Here in the Bay State, large cr uise ships operate from the Black Falcon Cruise Terminal, located in the heart of Boston's Seaport District. Although the cruise industry in Massachusetts remained rather modest in size through the early 1980s, it has grown rapidly over the past two decades and currently represents the fastest growing segment of Boston's commercial port activity. In 1985, 13 ship calls brought a total of 11,723 visitors to Boston, but since then, Boston has become a premier destination for several major cr uise lines that link Ne w England to Canada, Europe, and the Caribbean. It has also become the homeport of Norwegian Majesty, a high-end cruise line that offers weekly service to Bermuda from April through  October. Due to the popularity of these cruise lines, Boston received 62 ship calls and 105,000 passengers in 1998, and 118 ship calls and 253,576 passengers in 2001. These numbers will probably continue to rise in the coming years, as the global cruise industry expands its fleet size and increases its overall passenger capacity. The growth of the cruise industry has had a significant economic impact throughout the United States, including the Commonwealth. According to the International Council of Cruise Lines (ICCL), in 2000, the cruise industry created approximately 170,000 jobs for U.S. citizens and contributed more than $11 billion to the economy by buying goods and services in all 50 states. In Massachusetts, the industry spent over $120 million in 1998 alone, with most revenue benefiting the manufacturing, transportation, communications, and utilities sectors. However, as the cruise industry has grown, so have concerns surrounding cruise-related marine pollution. According to the Bluewater Network, a national environmental group committed to protecting public waterways, cruise ships produce enormous amounts of hazardous and nonhazardous waste. When improperly disposed of, these substances adversely affect water quality,  the marine environment, and public health. Although several federal and state regulations address the disposal of waste produced by vessels such as cruise ships, many obstacles hinder effective enforcement by authorities such as the U.S. Coast Guard and state environmental police. In a report released by the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO), cruise ships were linked to 87 cases of illegal discharges in U.S. waters from 1993 to 1998. Many of these cases involved multiple infractions and the overall number of discharges numbered in the hundreds. Although cruise-related cases comprised only a small portion (about four percent) of confirmed illegal dumping in the United States during that six-year period, many of the incidents were highly publicized, particularly those entailing multiple violations, the deliberate bypassing of pollution control devices, and the falsification of records by cruise staff. Most of these cases were handled by the Coast Guard's civil and administrative penalty authorities, but the U.S. Department of Justice prosecuted 10 criminal cases against various cruise ship companies and levied fines ranging from $75,000 to $18 million. In addition to the 87 confirmed cases, 17 cases were referred to other countries for adjudication and an unknown number of incidents went undetected.  24   In March of 2000, the Bluewater Network responded to the GAO report by petitioning the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to investigate cruise ship pollution and, if necessary, to implement regulatory and policy changes to prevent cruise-related discharges from harming the marine environment. The EPA is currently studying both cruise ship discharges and waste management approaches, and in the meantime, has released a white paper on cruise ship pollution that examines several waste streams including wastewater discharge, solid and hazardous waste disposal, and oily bilge water release. Portions of the white paper are summarized in the Common Cruise Ship Waste Streams box on page 26, and the entire report is available online at www.epa.gov/ owow/oceans/cruise_ships/assess.html. Overall, the GAO report concluded that, although the cruise industr y has increased its compliance with current environmental legislation, there is a continued need for significant improvement. Specifically, the GAO recommended that the Coast Guard increase its use of aircraft sur veillance to monitor cruise ship activity and initiate discussions with the cruise industr y, government officials, and environmental groups regarding improved  standards for vessel discharge and discharge assume a more prominent role. By issuing monitoring. Similarly, the EPA has suggested more comprehensive regulations, encouraging that federal and state regulations governing public-private partnerships, and promoting cruise ship waste may not be completely voluntary compliance programs, these entities comprehensive or adequately enforced. To could enhance previous and on-going efforts to rectify this, the EPA plans to establish an improve the environmental performance of the interagency workgroup with the Coast Guard cruise industr y. Such actions are already that will study the volume, characteristics, taking place in states such as Florida and and environmental impacts of cruise-related Alaska, where collaborative efforts between waste, scrutinize the effectiveness of existing resource management agencies, industr y waste management programs (regulatory and officials, and environmental advocates have non-regulator y), and explore options for resulted in better waste management and improving overall environmental managedisposal practices. ment within the cr uise industr y.

Sewage discharge contributes to the degradation of the marine environment by introducing excessive nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and disease-causing microorganisms. Moreover, chemicals and deodorizers commonly used in marine sanitation devices (MSDs) often contain chlorine, quaternary ammonia, and formaldehyde, each of which is potentially harmful to marine organisms. Similarly, gray water often contains detergents, cleaners, oil, grease, metals, pesticides, and medical waste that can degrade water quality and harm aquatic life. Although section 312 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) regulates the discharge of wastewater, the Bluewater Network argues that the Coast Guard's methods of inspecting vessels and enforcing regulations are inadequate to ensure CWA compliance.  photo by Tom Skinner  Alaska has taken steps to control sewage discharge from cruise ships in state waters.  The cruise industr y is also directly improving its environmental and waste management practices in many ways. According to the GAO, several cruise lines have implemented comprehensive management plans to clarify environmental policies and enhance waste-handling procedures. They have upgraded waste-treatment equipment, improved employee training and monitoring, and increased both internal and external oversight of their environmental practices and waste management protocols. Finally, several cruise lines have been certified to be in compliance with the International Safety Management (ISM) Code. The ISM Code was established by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and sets international standards for vesselrelated safety and environmental protection. Massachusetts is fortunate in that, to date, no cruise-related illegal discharge cases have occurred in its state waters. However, given the increasing popularity and use of Boston as a port of call, the Commonwealth may one day play an impor tant role in ensuring that the growing cruise industry continues to operate in a manner that protects the integrity of New England's coastal waters.  Solid Waste: Solid waste is comprised of materials such as food waste, plastic, paper, wood, cardboard, cans, and glass. Although these materials are sometimes brought ashore for disposal or recycling, much of it is incinerated on board or dumped overboard, often without proper note in the ship's Garbage Record Book. This is particularly true of plastic, which accounts for most of the solid waste illegally dumped and which adversely affects a variety of marine animals including fish, mammals, turtles, and birds. Despite legislation such as the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA) and the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ship (APPS), solid waste disposal by cruise ships remains a serious problem. Hazardous Waste: Hazardous waste generated aboard cruise ships include an array of chemicals and metals used by onboard dry cleaning facilities, photo processing laboratories, and print shops, as well as paint waste, dirty solvents, and batteries. At this time, little reliable data exist on the quantity of these substances created during any given time. Consequently, it is uncertain what regulations apply to the management and disposal of these substances. The Bluewater Network suggests that the EPA clarify the regulations gover ning the use and disposal of these substances, both at sea and once offloaded.  From the Port Reporter, Vol. 3, February, 1949: ""Skillful cargo handling at the Port of Boston protects the shipper's investment and insures arrival of goods in excellent condition at destination.""  Oily Bilge Water: Bilge water often contains a volatile mix of fuel, oil, and wastewater from engines and other machinery found on ships. It may also contain solid wastes such as rags, metal shavings, glass, paint, and cleaning agents. These substances often poison fish and degrade overall water quality. The Oil Pollution Act (OPA) prohibits the discharge of oil and hazardous wastes in quantities that are harmful to U.S. navigable waters or the resources found in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). It also requires vessels to record oily discharges in an Oil Record Book. However, since at least one major cruise-related marine pollution case involved routine falsification of this record, the monitoring and enforcement of cruise ship bilge water disposal likely needs improvement.  26"
GX017-69-3828238	Text     only of letters sent from   the Commerce     Committee Democrats.                 January 21, 1999          The Honorable David Walker  Comptroller General  General Accounting Office  441 G Street, N.W.  Washington, D.C. 20548    Dear Mr. Walker:    Recent disclosures of widespread marine pollution by cruise ships that regularly call on U.S. ports are of deep concern to us ( see , for example, January 3, 1999,  New York Times  and  NBC News , January 11, 1999). The largest case, according to recent reports, involved a large cruise ship, the  Sovereign of the Seas , operated in the Caribbean by Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.  In late 1994, the Coast Guard caught the large ship dumping a large amount of oily residue into the ocean off Puerto Rico. As the Coast Guard investigated this incident, it discovered a much larger conspiracy involving other ships operated by the cruise line. Apparently, pollution control devices on many of the ships in the company = s fleet had been bypassed and records falsified in an attempt to hide the illegal discharges from the Coast Guard and other enforcement agencies. Finally, in mid-1998, the company pled guilty and paid a $9 million dollar fine. Similar incidents by other cruise lines have come to light as well. For example, last summer Holland America Line pled guilty and paid a $2 million fine for discharging oily waste in Alaska = s inside passage.    Illegal dumping by cruise ships is not a new problem, nor is it an isolated one. General Accounting Office (GAO) staff recently indicated that in previous efforts related to illegal ocean dumping by ships, they reviewed Coast Guard records that described other incidents by cruise ships. In addition to the oil discharge events described above, these incidents included the disposal of ship-generated trash at sea. In several of these cases, ship crews were literally dumping bags of trash overboard rather than waiting to properly dispose of the refuse at port. As an average cruise ship carrying 2,500 passengers can generate nearly 4 tons of trash each day, this type of dumping alone can have serious environmental consequences.     If left unchecked, these pollution incidents, including both the illegal dumping of oil and trash at sea, may result in long-term environmental damage in the Caribbean, the pristine waters off Alaska, and other U.S. coastal waters. Therefore, we are requesting that GAO conduct the following investigation:        (1) Please analyze existing relevant data and conduct interviews with key industry and   agency officials to determine the overall extent of cruise ship dumping. This should   include a review of the enforcement efforts in the U.S. to comply with all existing U.S.   and international pollution-related laws, treaties, and agreements. Specifically, we would   like to know the actions being taken by the Coast Guard and the Department of Justice to   detect and prevent illegal ocean dumping and the efforts expended to investigate suspected   violators and prosecute offenders when warranted.     (2) Please also provide a review of all detected incidents of illegal dumping by cruise   ships during the past eight years. Please provide the name of the vessel in each incident,   the name of its operating company, and a brief description of the incident. Please also   provide a listing of both the company = s official   headquarters and where the vessel is officially flagged. Please review all closed   Department of Justice cases/investigations for this segment.     (3) For each cruise ship company involved in an act of illegal dumping, please   determine what measures (such as formal compliance plans) they have undertaken to prevent   such activities. Please interview key U.S. government officials to determine the   effectiveness of such plans and whether they believe they will prevent such illegal   activities.

Dingell Ranking Minority Member Committee on Commerce House of Representatives The Honorable Henry A. Waxman Ranking Minority Member Committee on Government Reform House of Representatives  Le er t  From 1993 through 1998-the most recent year for which data are available- cargo ships, tankers, cruise ships, and other commercial vessels registered, or ""flagged,"" in foreign countries have been involved in almost 2,400 confirmed cases of illegally discharging oil, garbage, and other harmful substances into U.S. coastal waters. Cruise ships, nearly all of which are flagged in foreign countries, accounted for about 4 percent of all confirmed illegal discharge cases by commercial foreign-flagged ships during this period. Although the more than 100 cruise ships operating in U.S. waters have been involved in a relatively small number of these pollution cases, several cruise ship cases have been widely publicized. For example, on a number of cruise ships operated by one cruise ship company, pollution control devices were deliberately bypassed and records were falsified, leading to criminal prosecution and an $18 million fine in 1999. Several other cruise ship companies have also received substantial criminal penalties, in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, for similar incidents. Given that cruise ship activity in North American ports increased by almost 50 percent from 1993 through 1998 and ships with thousands of passengers can generate large amounts of waste, the actions being taken by federal regulators and the cruise ship industry to prevent future illegal discharges are a matter of interest to the Congress. As agreed with your offices, we focused our work on the following specific questions:  What are the nature and extent of reported illegal discharge cases for foreign-flagged cruise ships from 1993 through 1998?  What efforts have relevant federal agencies made to prevent, detect, investigate, and prosecute illegal discharges from foreign-flagged cruise ships?  Page 3  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376   What actions have cruise ship companies with proven illegal discharge violations taken to prevent future illegal discharges?  What are the views of relevant federal agencies and third-party interest groups regarding the actions that cruise ship companies have taken, and what issues, if any, do they believe require further attention?  Results in Brief  Federal data indicate that foreign-flagged cruise ships were involved in 87 confirmed illegal discharge cases in U.S. waters from 1993 through 1998. Overall, the number of confirmed illegal discharge cases by cruise ships in U.S. waters generally declined during this period. Oil or related chemicals were discharged in 81 cases; 6 cases involved discharges of garbage or plastic. We determined that about three-fourths of these cases were accidental, resulting from human or mechanical error, while the remainder were either intentional or their cause could not be determined from the available information. A few of the 87 cases involved multiple illegal discharge incidents that, according to the Department of Justice, numbered in the hundreds over the 6-year period. In addition to the 87 confirmed cases, 17 other alleged incidents were referred to the countries where the cruise ships were registered because the incidents occurred outside U.S. waters or because jurisdiction could not be clearly ascertained. Both large and small cruise ship companies were involved in illegal discharge cases. The Coast Guard, the Department of Justice, and, to a lesser extent, other agencies undertake a variety of efforts to prevent, detect, investigate, or prosecute illegal marine discharges by foreign-flagged cruise ships. The Coast Guard inspects ships in port, watches them as part of aircraft surveillance in the open sea, investigates reported incidents, and if warranted, adjudicates cases under its civil penalty procedures. However, the Coast Guard's ability to detect and resolve violations is constrained by the narrow scope of its routine inspections, a significant reduction in aircraft surveillance for marine pollution purposes, and a breakdown of the process for identifying and resolving alleged violations referred to flag states. Both the Coast Guard and the Department of Justice have been involved in these pollution cases, with Justice prosecuting the most serious offenses. Civil penalties levied from 1993 through 1998 against cruise ship companies by the Coast Guard ranged from a warning with no penalty to a $17,500 penalty; Justice's criminal penalties against cruise ship companies ranged from $75,000 to $18 million. In addition, federal agencies have implemented or partially implemented a number of recommendations made by GAO and others to improve the coordination of enforcement, data sharing, and other efforts among relevant agencies.  Page 4  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376  We spoke with representatives from 9 cruise ship companies responsible for ships involved in nonaccidental pollution cases, as well as from 3 additional companies (involved in accidental cases) that represent a large segment of the cruise ship industry. These 12 companies have implemented new or updated environmental plans designed to enhance ship safety and prevent pollution. The plans, which were prepared pursuant to new international standards or were mandated by U.S. district courts after the companies pled guilty to pollution violations, call for such steps as regular third-party verification of ships' compliance with environmental procedures. Among the 12 companies, the 8 that operate relatively large fleets of ships have taken additional steps to reduce the amounts of plastics and other potential wastes brought onboard, as well as to install incinerators and additional equipment for treating or storing solid wastes, hazardous wastes, and oily bilgewater. Officials from the four smaller companies said they have not had to take these additional steps because their ships are away from port only 5 to 7 hours daily and have space onboard to store wastes until the ships return to port. Officials from the Coast Guard, the Department of Justice, and the Center for Marine Conservation (a nongovernmental, science-based advocacy, research, and public education organization that monitors marine pollution issues) said that cruise ship companies were making progress toward changing a maritime ""culture"" that once permitted discharges of garbage and oil from ships before international standards and U.S. laws to control such discharges were adopted. They pointed out, however, that cruise ship companies must demonstrate a sustained commitment to eliminate illegal discharges at sea. Some officials expressed concern about the large volume of wastewater from sinks, showers, drains, and sewage systems that cruise ships legally discharge at sea and the possible effects of these discharges on sensitive marine life.  Background  The worldwide cruise ship fleet includes more than 223 ships that carried an estimated 9.5 million passengers in 1998, according to industry sources. About one-half of the fleet was positioned in the North American market. Over a 6-year period (1993-98), cruise ship embarkations from North American ports increased by almost 50 percent, and by 2003, cruise ship companies plan to add 33 new and/or bigger cruise ships to this market, which will increase passenger capacity by about 35 percent. The major U.S. ports of call are located in Florida. A large number of passengers also embark from ports in Alaska, California, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New York, Puerto Rico, and Texas.  Page 5  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376  International safety and pollution standards for ships are set through the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a United Nations specialized agency. Pollution standards are addressed under IMO's International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL).1 The country where a ship is registered (the ""flag state"") is responsible for certifying the ship's compliance with pollution prevention standards, although many nations delegate this task to classification societies, which perform pollution prevention compliance (and other) inspections under contract.2 The country the ship visits (the ""port state"") can conduct its own examinations to verify the ship's compliance with international standards and can detain the ship if it finds significant noncompliance. The Coast Guard performs these examinations and enforces standards in U.S. ports.  1  MARPOL currently contains six annexes, four of which pertain to preventing pollution from vessels, including cruise ships. Annex I (prevention of pollution by oil) entered into force in 1983, and Annex V (prevention of pollution by garbage/plastics) entered into force in 1988. Neither Annex IV (prevention of pollution from sewage) nor Annex VI (prevention of air pollution from ships) has entered into force because they have not been ratified by the requisite number of nations. In 1995, GAO issued a report, Coast Guard: Enforcement Under MARPOL V Convention on Pollution Expanded, Although Problems Remain (GAO/RCED94-143, May 30, 1995), regarding the Coast Guard's efforts to enforce Annex V. 2  In addition to MARPOL, the United States is party to four other international conventions governing the safe operation of ships that, according to Coast Guard officials, protect both people and the environment. These conventions include the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea; the International Convention on Load Lines; the International Convention on Standards, Certification and Watchkeeping; and the International Labor Organization Convention No. 147, Concerning Minimum Standards on Merchant Ships. The Coast Guard's vessel examination program helps to ensure that foreign-flagged vessels comply with applicable U.S. and international regulations.  Page 6  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376  The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships3 and the Clean Water Act4 are the key domestic laws governing the discharge of materials into U.S. waters. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships incorporates the provisions of MARPOL into U.S. law. The Clean Water Act generally prohibits the discharge of any pollutant within 3 nautical miles of the United States and of oil and hazardous substances within 12 nautical miles of the United States. It also requires those who discharge oil to immediately report the spill to the appropriate federal agency. These U.S. laws apply to foreignflagged ships while they are in U.S. waters.5 If violations of U.S. law occur, the Coast Guard can levy administrative civil penalties up to $25,000 per violation. The Coast Guard refers more serious cases to the Department of Justice (Justice) for possible criminal prosecution. MARPOL requires parties to adopt specific standards governing the design, construction, and operation of ships and their equipment and places restrictions on the discharge of certain substances, such as oil, hazardous substances, garbage, and plastics from ships. These restrictions generally relate to the type, size, and/or quantity of the substance and the location of the discharge. All ships of signatory countries are subject to MARPOL's requirements regardless of where they are operating.6 Typically, according to Coast Guard officials, the United States has taken direct action against foreign-flagged ships when incidents have occurred within U.S. jurisdiction and has referred cases to flag states in accordance with MARPOL's provisions when incidents have occurred outside U.S. jurisdiction or jurisdiction could not be determined. Under this process, information regarding suspected cases is transferred from local Coast Guard units to Coast Guard headquarters for review. If Coast Guard headquarters personnel believe sufficient information is available to pursue a flag state case, they send the case to the U.S. Department of State. The case is then forwarded to the cognizant flag state for further investigation and action,  3  33 U.S.C. 1901-1911. 33 U.S.C. 1319, 1321, 1322.  4  5  Depending on the severity of the pollution and the type of incident (i.e., oil, garbage, etc.), U.S. criminal jurisdiction ranges from 3 to 200 nautical miles. Inside 3 nautical miles, the United States has complete jurisdiction except on foreign vessels in ""innocent passage."" (A vessel is in innocent passage when it is passing through a nation's territorial sea without intending to stop or conduct certain operations within that territorial sea.) The MARPOL Convention does not apply to warships, naval auxiliary, and other government ships used only for noncommercial service.  6  Page 7  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376  according to a State Department official in the Office of Oceans Affairs. Under the MARPOL convention, the coastal state--upon detecting an alleged violation--is required to either take action on the violation under its own laws or forward the case to the flag state for its consideration. The flag state is required to promptly inform the party referring the case of the action it has taken. In addition to the protections and sanctions provided under MARPOL and U.S. law, an updated international standard became effective for passenger and other ships on July 31, 1998. This new standard, referred to as the International Safety Management (ISM) Code, requires cruise ship owners and operators to establish a safety management system. The system should include an environmental protection policy, instructions and procedures for pollution prevention, defined lines of authority, internal and management reviews, and a written plan for both shore and shipboard personnel to follow. Cruise ship companies are required to have their systems and plans certified as in compliance with the ISM Code by the flag state or an authorized agent of the flag state. Ships without proof of a certified plan could be denied insurance coverage or entry into the world's major seaports.  Illegal Discharge Incidents Are Declining in Number but Involve Many Companies  The number of confirmed pollution cases involving foreign-flagged cruise ships has declined since 1993. These cases, which have involved mostly oil, have involved both large and small cruise ship companies.  Page 8  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376  Fewer Illegal Discharge Cases Have Been Confirmed in Recent Years  According to federal data, foreign-flagged cruise ships were responsible for 87 confirmed illegal discharge cases in U.S. waters from 1993 through 1998.7 (See app. I for detailed information on each case.) This represents about 4 percent of the 2,395 confirmed illegal discharge cases for this period by all types of foreign-registered ships entering U.S. ports. In addition to the 87 cases, 17 other alleged discharge cases were referred to the countries where the cruise ships were registered because the discharges occurred outside U.S. waters or jurisdiction could not be clearly ascertained.8 As shown in table 1, the total number of confirmed illegal discharge cases in U.S. waters and referrals to flag states attributed to foreign-flagged cruise ships generally declined from 1993 through 1998. For example, the number of illegal discharge cases in U.S. waters by these cruise ships declined from 24 in 1994 to 9 in 1998. Similarly, in the last 3 years for which data were available, there were no referrals to flag states for alleged discharges by cruise ships.  Table 1: Illegal Discharge Cases in the United States and Alleged Discharge Cases Referred to Flag States for Foreign-Flagged Cruise Ships, 1993-98 Year 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 Total Illegal discharge cases in U.S. waters 16 24 17 13 8 9 87 Cases referred to flag states 9 4 4 0 0 0 17 Total 25 28 21 13 8 9 104  Source: GAO's presentation of data from the Coast Guard and the State Depar tment.  7  An illegal discharge case can be adjudicated through administrative, civil, or criminal procedures, depending on the circumstances of the discharge. We separated the flag state cases from other violations because these cases are referred outside the U.S. administrative and judicial processes and we have little indication that the flag states have affirmed or denied the alleged incidents. In contrast, the civil penalty and criminal cases are all proven violations.  8  Page 9  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376  The general decline in discharge cases by foreign-flagged cruise ships is consistent with the general decline in discharge cases by all types of foreign-flagged ships. For example, in 1993, the Coast Guard documented 412 illegal discharge cases in U.S. waters for all foreign-flagged ships. In 1995, illegal discharge cases peaked for the 6-year period at 488, and in 1998, the number of cases dropped to 236. The total number of referrals to flag states by the United States has dropped off more dramatically. Coast Guard officials could not explain the sudden drop-off in these referrals. Justice officials told us that some of the cases they prosecuted involved multiple discharge incidents; thus, while there were 87 proven cases of pollution from cruise ships, the Justice cases included many more separate discharge incidents over the period from 1993 through 1998. For example, in a plea agreement with Justice, one large company admitted to falsifying its oil record books and acknowledged ""regular and routine"" illegal discharges of ""harmful quantities of oil-contaminated bilge waste and other pollutants"" in numerous jurisdictions, including Florida, New York, California, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. According to a Justice official familiar with the case, at least eight of the company's ships were involved in hundreds of separate illegal discharge incidents in 1994 and 1995; one of the company's ships continued the illegal discharges into 1998.  Nature of Discharges Varied  Eighty-one of the 87 cruise ship cases (93 percent) involving incidents in U.S. waters were for illegal discharges of oil or oil-based products, while the remaining 6 cases involved discharges of garbage or plastic. Of the 17 referrals to flag states for alleged illegal discharges, 10 involved oil and 7 involved garbage. The volume of discharged material associated with these cases varied widely, from hundreds of gallons of oil to drops of oil-based paint that spilled into the water during painting of a ship's hull. The volume of garbage discharged also varied. In one case, investigators determined that a cruise ship had illegally discharged garbage after more than 30 plastic bags of garbage were found floating offshore and investigators were able to link the garbage to a particular ship. In another case, a few bottles containing plastic pieces washed up on shore with information that linked them to a cruise ship that had recently passed through the area. The circumstances surrounding the discharge cases also varied. On the basis of our analysis of case files for all 87 cases, we judged that 72 percent of the illegal discharge cases occurring in U.S. waters (63 cases) were accidental (i.e., associated with mechanical or human error). (See fig. 1.)  Page 10  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376  For example, many of the oil-related discharge cases involved ships loading fuel in port. Our analysis showed that some spills occurred because crew members were inattentive, while others occurred because equipment failed. In contrast to these accidental cases, we judged 13 percent of the cases (11 cases) to be intentional (i.e., a ship's crew was actively discharging illegal quantities or types of oil or garbage). For another 15 percent (13 cases), we could not determine from the available information whether the incidents were intentional or accidental.  Figure 1: Characteristics of Discharge Cases in U.S. Waters by Foreign-Flagged Cruise Ships, 1993-98 Accidental or intentional? 100 Type of discharge?  13%  Cannot determine (13) 80  15%  Intentional (11)  60  40  72%  Accidental (63)  20  0 Oil Garbage Cannot determine International Accidental  Source: GAO's analysis of the Coast Guard's marine violation data.  Of the 17 discharge cases referred to other countries, we judged 9 to be intentional, all involving alleged illegal discharges of garbage. We could not determine the causes of the other eight cases from the information available; all involved the alleged illegal discharge of oil.  Page 11  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376  Many Companies Were Involved in Incidents  In total, the 87 confirmed illegal discharge cases by foreign-flagged cruise ships in U.S. waters and 17 cases referred to other countries involved 69 ships associated with 42 different cruise ship companies. However, only 18 companies were involved in discharges that we judged to be intentional or whose cause could not be determined. We contacted nine of these companies for additional follow-up.9 We also contacted three other companies that were involved in accidental cases and represented a significant segment of the cruise ship industry. (Apps. I, II, and III also provide information on the ships and companies involved in illegal discharge cases and referrals to other countries.) The 12 companies we contacted varied in size, in the types of cruises they conducted, and in the sizes of the ships involved in the incidents. Eight of the companies were large, operating 5 to 16 ships in multiple U.S. and international ports, and four of the companies were small, operating 1 ship to and from a U.S. home port. The ships ranged from small ships providing gambling day trips for 350 to 800 passengers to megaliners that provided overnight accommodations for up to 2,700 passengers for multiday cruises.  Federal Agencies Have Taken Action to Identify and Prosecute Illegal Discharge Cases, but Other Areas May Need Increased Attention  The Coast Guard, Justice, and, to a lesser extent, other agencies undertake a variety of efforts to prevent, detect, investigate, or prosecute illegal marine discharges by foreign-flagged cruise ships. However, the Coast Guard's ability to detect and resolve violations is constrained by the limited depth and scope of its inspections, a significant reduction in aircraft surveillance for marine pollution purposes, and a breakdown of the flagstate referral process, both within the Coast Guard and by flag states. In addition, federal agencies have implemented a number of recommendations made by GAO and marine environmental experts to improve the coordination of enforcement, data sharing, and other efforts among relevant agencies.  Coast Guard Is Responsible for Most Vessel Oversight Efforts  The Coast Guard is the main federal agency involved in preventing, detecting, and investigating discharges. Most illegal discharges are addressed through the Coast Guard's civil penalty process.  9  Of the 18 companies, 4 went out of business or could not be located, 3 merged or were acquired by other companies, and 2 contracted with a service company to operate and manage their vessels for them.  Page 12  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376  Prevention and Detection Efforts  The Coast Guard uses four main methods to prevent or detect illegal discharges from cruise ships--passenger vessel inspections, aircraft surveillance, third-party reports, and self-reports. 10 Under the passenger vessel inspection program, which serves as both a prevention and a detection measure, cruise ships that operate in U.S. waters are to be examined quarterly. Coast Guard inspectors use inspection books with written policies to guide their examinations. The primary purpose of these inspections is to check for safety issues; pollution prevention issues are also addressed to a more limited degree. On a typical inspection, a Coast Guard team of two to four people spends 4 to 6 hours aboard a cruise ship performing tasks such as fire drills, life-boat launchings, fire door inspections, and record checks. A number of factors limit the ability of Coast Guard inspectors to detect illegal discharges or violations of environmental laws and regulations. The inspectors' focus on safety, coupled with the large size of a cruise ship, the limited time for inspection, and limited staff resources, make it very difficult to perform detailed examinations of environmental functions, according to the inspectors we interviewed. Moreover, the element of surprise is missing. Company officials and crew members are notified of these inspections weeks, or even months, in advance of their occurrence and often know their nature and scope. According to Coast Guard officials, inspections are scheduled in advance to accommodate ships' sailing schedules and to ensure that key documents and personnel are available for the inspection. They said that cruise ships usually are in port for less than 10 hours and inspections must be accomplished during this time.  10  Federal law requires persons in charge of vessels or certain facilities that have spilled oil to report their spills or face additional penalties. As a result, we identified cases in which a vessel operator or another involved party reported a spill as a self-report. A third-party report is typically provided by an uninvolved party who has come upon an incident.  Page 13  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376  Coast Guard officials in Miami said that during three of the four inspections they perform on each cruise ship each year, they limit pollution prevention checks primarily to inspections of documents. The Coast Guard inspectors we interviewed who conduct cruise ship inspections said they rarely have time to closely examine pollution prevention equipment and would have, for example, little time to lift floor plates and closely examine the piping for the oily water separator11 to ensure that it is properly routed. Coast Guard officials estimated that they spend about 16 to 20 hours a year inspecting each cruise ship, allowing about half an hour of each 4- to 6-hour inspection for environmental compliance issues and pollution prevention equipment, unless a problem or suspected violations cause them to look further. While acknowledging the limited scope of their routine environmental oversight aboard cruise ships, Coast Guard inspectors explained that they have latitude to pursue in more detail any item that raises their attention during an inspection. For example, after a Coast Guard aircraft observed a foreign-flagged cruise ship discharging oil near Puerto Rico several years ago, Coast Guard inspectors boarded the ship in Puerto Rico and examined the engine room. Having too little time to finish the investigation before the ship left port for Miami, the inspectors videotaped the ship's engine room. When the ship reached Miami, another inspection team continued the investigation and also videotaped the engine room. A later comparison of the two videotapes revealed that between the two videotapings, inappropriately installed piping had been removed in an attempt to hide the crew's practice of bypassing the oily water separator and illegally discharging untreated oily water at sea. While the incident in Puerto Rico illustrates the Coast Guard's successful detection of a serious pollution violation, it also reveals shortcomings in the ability of the agency's inspection program--as currently structured--to detect illegal discharges from cruise ships. In this case, for example, if a Coast Guard aircraft had not observed the cruise ship illegally discharging oil, Coast Guard inspectors would probably not have boarded the ship in Puerto Rico or discovered through subsequent routine inspections that piping had been altered to bypass the oily water separator. According to marine inspectors in Miami, inspectors typically do not examine such  11  Oily waste from a vessel's engines and water in the engine room are collected and pumped through an oily water separator that removes most of the oil; the cleansed water can then be legally discharged at sea if its oil content is less than 15 parts of oil per 1 million parts of water.  Page 14  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376  piping during their inspections unless they have cause for concern. Moreover, this case led to a larger criminal investigation by Justice, and in its plea agreement with Justice, the cruise ship company admitted that it had falsified its oil record books and routinely bypassed the oily water separators on eight of its ships--as recently as 1998 on one ship. A cognizant Justice official said the Coast Guard and classification society inspectors alike performed dozens of inspections of these ships during this period and did not detect the oily water separator bypasses. Crew members on some of these ships admitted to Justice investigators that they knew when inspectors were coming aboard and were able to disconnect bypass piping to make the operation of the equipment appear normal while the inspectors were onboard. The Coast Guard also uses its aircraft to detect illegal pollution discharges. Coast Guard investigators and aircraft personnel said that aircraft surveillance of cruise ships is important both in detecting pollution from these ships and in deterring future illegal discharges. Investigators told us that overflights of shipping lanes where cruise ships travel are particularly helpful because, when aircraft observe illegal discharges, they videotape the incidents to provide clear documentation for prosecution actions. Coast Guard officials explained, however, that aircraft personnel--while they routinely watch for such discharges while flying missions--are usually focused much more on their other primary missions, such as drug enforcement or migrant interdiction. The amount of time that Coast Guard aircraft spend patrolling shipping lanes and watching for pollution from ships is unclear. The Coast Guard's operational data do not accurately document this information because aircraft personnel do not regularly record information relevant to a mission's secondary purpose. For example, according to the Coast Guard's data, one air station near Miami recorded 58 aircraft mission hours for all marine environmental protection activities in 1998. This was less than 1 percent of the total aircraft mission hours for the station. Yet air station officials believe the recorded mission data understate their attention to these activities because they look for pollution incidents while on missions with a different principal purpose. Other missions, such as drug enforcement, migrant interdiction, and search and rescue accounted for over 9,000 hours for this air station. The aircraft hours devoted to marine environmental protection appear to be relatively low throughout the Coast Guard's District 7, which includes most of Florida and has the highest concentration of cruise ships embarking from U.S. ports. Moreover, according to the Coast Guard's data,  Page 15  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376  Coast Guard aircraft assigned to District 7 spent fewer than half as many documented hours for marine environmental compliance in 1998 (283 hours) as they did in 1993 (578 hours). Coast Guard officials attributed this decline to (1) the loss of two key aircraft, which devoted a significant number of hours to marine environmental protection in 1993 and 1994, and (2) a surge in aircraft hours associated with specific environmental protection initiatives in 1993 and 1994. Coast Guard officials in District 7 indicated that they are looking into ways to better deploy their existing aircraft to improve their oversight of offshore vessel traffic. They told us that closer coordination between the air stations and the marine safety offices to monitor the offshore shipping lanes used by cruise and other ships may improve environmental surveillance by better combining multiple missions. For example, an aircraft heading to its assigned area for a drug-related patrol may be able to take a water route that coincides more closely with the paths of offshore ships. Coast Guard officials in Miami told us that the Marine Safety Office (MSO) and the air station had collaborated recently on efforts to choose flight paths over water rather than land, where possible, when aircraft are traveling to and from other missions, such as drug enforcement or migrant interdiction. Coast Guard officials in Miami believed that collaborative efforts like this between MSOs and air stations could increase the time spent on environmental overflights without detracting from other missions. Officials from the Coast Guard's District 7 said they are developing an agreement among their units to maximize the time spent over water routes when flying to and from air stations for other primary missions. Most of the illegal discharges handled by the Coast Guard were reported by third parties or were self-reported (i.e. by cruise ship companies) and were not identified through Coast Guard overflights, inspections, or other agency activities. Of the 87 cases involving incidents in U.S. waters, 26, or about 30 percent, were reported by third parties, and 32, or about 37 percent, were self-reported. (See fig. 2.) A third-party report usually involves a person who witnesses an incident or its effects and then reports the incident to the Coast Guard. Such a person could be, for example, a passerby, a passenger, or a representative of a government agency who notices a discharge in the water. Upon receiving a third-party report, Coast Guard officials said, they typically refer it to the appropriate local Coast Guard unit for follow-up.

By contrast, Coast Guard aircraft overflights did detect the majority of cases that were referred to flag states. Of the 17 cases referred to other countries, 10 were detected by Coast Guard aircraft. Often in these cases, aircraft personnel observed what appeared to be a discharge of oil at night, using the aircraft's infrared equipment to detect a sheen trailing the cruise ship. On several occasions, the aircraft videotaped the incident and the videotape was later forwarded to the ship's flag state. The remaining 7 cases were third-party reports by passengers aboard the cruise ships. For example, in a 1995 incident, passengers reported witnessing the ship's crew dump garbage into the ocean over several hours. In some cases, passengers photographed or videotaped crew members throwing plastic bags of garbage overboard, and the evidence was forwarded to the appropriate flag state.  Investigation and Case Resolution  A Coast Guard investigation is the key link between detecting an illegal discharge and resolving it. Coast Guard officials said they conduct a followup investigation to review more closely the issues raised by a detection report and develop a case against a ship, if warranted. The Coast Guard typically interviews the ship's crew members or other witnesses, reviews key documents maintained onboard (such as a garbage log or an oil record  Page 17  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376  book), and takes samples of discharged materials found onboard. For example, cruise ships were linked to a ship by an confirmed a match between the spilled ship's tank.  material, if available, to test against several oil discharge cases against oil ""fingerprinting"" process that oil and a sample of oil taken from a  The Coast Guard resolved the incidents included in our review by levying fines under its administrative civil penalty processes, referring incidents to ships' flag states, or referring incidents to Justice for criminal prosecution. We discuss these three processes in more detail below. The nature of the case, determined by the information collected during the investigation, typically dictated which strategy was followed.  Administrative Civil Penalty Processes  The Coast Guard adjudicates the majority of illegal discharge cases that occur in U.S. waters through two administrative processes-a civil penalty hearing program and a ticket program. Under the civil penalty hearing program, a Coast Guard hearing officer reviews information provided in the Coast Guard unit's investigation report and information provided by the alleged violator. On the basis of the evidence presented, the hearing officer determines whether a violation occurred and, if so, how much the penalty should be. The amount of the penalty typically depends on the severity of the incident and other extenuating or mitigating factors, such as whether the same ship or company has had previous violations, according to Coast Guard guidance. Initiated in 1994, the ticket program is a simplified alternative to the civil penalty hearing process; it is limited to oil spills of less than 100 gallons that, according to Coast Guard guidance, involve ""no significant gravity or culpability."" Of the 87 illegal marine discharge cases occurring in U.S. waters, the Coast Guard reviewed 54 under its civil penalty hearing program and 26 under the ticket program.12 The penalties ranged from a warning (with no monetary penalty) for a spill of 1 gallon of lube oil after a piece of equipment broke, to a $17,500 penalty for a discharge of about 150 gallons of oil after a ship discharged water contaminated by oil when it emptied its ballast tanks. The average civil penalty for the 54 cases handled under the hearing process was $2,713; the average penalty for the 26 ticket cases was $444.  12  The remaining 7 (of the 87) cases were prosecuted by Justice. Two of the seven cases also received a civil penalty under the hearing program but were referred for criminal matters.  Page 18  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376  Referrals to Flag States  From 1993 through 1999, the Coast Guard forwarded 17 cruise-ship-related pollution cases to the State Department for referral to flag states for further investigation and action because the alleged incidents occurred outside U.S. jurisdiction or jurisdiction could not be clearly ascertained. All of these cases occurred from 1993 through about mid-1995. Only one cruiseship-related referral occurred from June 1995 through November 1999, the most recent month for which data were available. In fact, referrals to flag states for cases related to all types of vessels virtually stopped in mid-1995. From 1993 through 1995, for example, the Coast Guard sent about 163 cases (related to all types of vessels) to the State Department for referral to the appropriate countries. For the 4-year period from 1996 through November 1999, the Coast Guard forwarded only three cases for referral to flag states. Coast Guard officials could not fully explain the dramatic decline in referrals to flag states but suggested that reduced oil pollution from vessels worldwide accounted for much of the decline. While reduced oil pollution could have contributed to the decline in referrals to flag states to some extent, it would have been unlikely to cause referrals to stop so abruptly. The fact that the referrals ceased so quickly and almost completely in mid1995 indicates that other, more substantive factors came into play. Moreover, if reduced pollution worldwide had been a major factor contributing to the decline in flag-state referrals, one would expect the Coast Guard's data on marine violation cases (including ticket cases) to show a similar decline. However, the Coast Guard's data show that marine violation cases actually rose above 1993 levels through 1996. In 1997, marine violation cases fell slightly below 1993 levels, and in 1998, they fell further but still represented a significant number of cases. One explanation for at least part of the decline in referrals to flag states may lie with changes in the Coast Guard's organization that occurred in the mid-1990s. During this time, the Coast Guard began streamlining its organization, including its marine environmental protection functions. According to Coast Guard officials, responsibilities for processing flagstate referrals received from the agency's MSOs in the field became more fragmented, and headquarters stopped maintaining separate files of submissions from MSOs or documentation about the disposition of these cases. We did not survey all MSOs about the flag-state referral cases they submitted since mid-1995; however, investigators in Miami told us they had submitted two flag-state referral cases to headquarters in the last year. According to the investigators, headquarters informed them about the disposition of one case, but they heard nothing further from headquarters  Page 19  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376  about the other case. Since headquarters officials do not maintain flagstate-referral files and did not document the disposition of these referrals, they could not tell us what happened with these cases. Even when referrals have been made, the response rate from flag states has been poor. The final resolution of most of the 17 cases involving cruise ships remains unknown. Case files maintained at the Department of State contained no information from the flag states on how 11 of the 17 cases were resolved. State Department and Coast Guard officials said the flag states did not provide information for these cases, and although neither the Coast Guard nor the State Department routinely follows up on cases referred to flag states, the officials generally believe no action was taken against the ships. For the remaining six cases, one ship was fined an unknown sum, and one ship was to be ""surveyed,"" even though the flag state indicated that it had ""reasonable doubt"" about the incident. For the four other cases, the flag state reported that it would take no action because it had reasonable doubt or insufficient evidence or believed that the charge was not proved. (See app. II for information about each flagstate referral case.) This low response rate from flag states for alleged violations by cruise ships mirrors a situation that has existed for years for all types of vessels. In 1992, for example, the State Department analyzed responses from flag states for alleged MARPOL V violations (dumping of garbage and/or plastics at sea). The study showed that of the 111 cases referred by the agency to flag states from January 1989 through June 1992, the flag states did not respond to or took no action on 99 cases (89 percent) and assessed small fines for only 2 of the remaining 12 cases. On the basis of this study, the United States changed its enforcement policy for MARPOL V violations in 1992. According to a document provided by the State Department, the United States, under the new policy, would take direct enforcement action against vessels for MARPOL V violations occurring between 3 and 200 nautical miles from the United States rather than referring such violations to the flag states. Under MARPOL, flag states are supposed to respond promptly to port states, as well as to IMO, about the disposition of cases referred to them. A cognizant IMO official told us that IMO only monitors the reported data and has no authority to follow-up when flag states do not report the actions they have taken. However, efforts by IMO suggest that it is aware of the difficulties in getting flag states to act. In 1992, IMO developed a new subcommittee to encourage flag states to respond to issues raised by port  Page 20  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376  states. A Justice official and a State Department official responsible for forwarding referrals to other countries told us that if the United States hopes to improve flag states' response rates through increased efforts at IMO, the Coast Guard should continue to forward to the State Department allegations of ship pollution violations occurring outside U.S. jurisdiction. By taking this action, the officials said, the Coast Guard would have a legitimate basis for raising the issue at IMO and pressing other countries to respond to flag-state referral cases.  Referrals to the Department of Justice  The Coast Guard referred 12 cases to Justice for criminal prosecution. Of these, nine were for incidents that occurred in U.S. waters, and three were for incidents that had been referred to flag states for action.13 The next section describes what happened in these cases.  13  Under international law, the United States, as a coastal state, can institute proceedings against a vessel it believes has committed a violation of international pollution standards inside its 200-mile exclusive economic zone. However, these proceedings will be suspended if the flag state decides to bring similar proceedings against the vessel within 6 months of the date that the coastal state's proceedings began. Two exceptions allow the coastal state to continue its proceedings: if there is major damage to the coastal state or if the flag state has repeatedly disregarded its obligations as a flag state to enforce MARPOL.  Page 21  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376  Department of Justice Leads Criminal Prosecution Efforts  Justice has prosecuted 10 of the 12 cases referred to it by the Coast Guard.14 (See app. III for detailed information about each case.) The financial penalties for prosecuted cases ranged from $75,000 to $18 million. Three of the 10 prosecuted cases had been referred to flag states that took no known action against the ships. For these three cases, Justice's actions resulted in criminal penalties that ranged from $75,000 to $1 million. In addition to the financial penalties, most of the companies were also required to take additional actions, such as developing an environmental compliance plan, submitting to independent audits of their environmental practices, or purchasing new equipment. While the cases stemmed initially from discharge incidents, Justice's actions and further investigations developed some of the cases to include broader and more serious charges that resulted in significantly higher fines. For example, in one civil penalty case, the cruise company was assessed a $4,000 penalty for an illegal discharge by one ship. However, the criminal case that stemmed from it involved five of the company's cruise ships, included several felony counts, and resulted in multiple probation requirements and an $8 million fine.15 Justice officials said that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has provided valuable assistance in investigating many of the criminal cases against cruise ship companies. The prosecution of criminal cases against cruise ship companies can have an effect beyond the individual cases. The large penalties, media attention, and probationary requirements may have a deterrent effect that Justice officials say is part of the Department's purpose in pursuing environmental crime cases. Industry and government officials also told us that the recent high penalties for cruise ship pollution cases are likely to deter future illegal discharges. Probationary requirements, such as those compelling companies to have annual third-party audits of their environmental practices, could also be a deterrent. These audits have the potential to provide detection information to the various government agencies and company managers receiving the reports, adding further assurance that future illegal behavior will be identified.  14  Justice officials explained that most maritime environmental statutes contain both civil and criminal remedies; however, all of the 10 cases discussed in this report were referred to Justice for criminal prosecution and were prosecuted as criminal offenses. 15  The felony counts included conspiracy to discharge harmful quantities of oil into U.S. waters, obstruction of justice, willful false statements to the Coast Guard, and violations of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990.  Page 22  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376  Besides prosecuting specific marine pollution cases, Justice has sponsored workshops, bringing in representatives from the Coast Guard, EPA, and FBI to discuss procedures for investigating environmental crime. According to Justice officials, federal agencies such as Justice, the Coast Guard, EPA, and FBI are making efforts to coordinate their investigations.  Other Federal Agencies Play Limited Roles  Several other agencies-including EPA, FBI, the Department of State, the Department of Agriculture's Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-are involved in illegal discharge issues to a limited degree.  EPA strives to prevent illegal discharges through educational efforts- such as marine debris workshops and an Internet posting of ""no discharge zones""-and responses to industry inquiries. EPA has also worked with other federal agencies, such as Justice and the Coast Guard, to investigate recent criminal cases against cruise ship companies. In addition, EPA-in cooperation with NOAA, the Coast Guard, and other federal partners-designed the National Marine Debris Monitoring Program to identify sources of marine debris and determine whether the amount of debris on U.S. shorelines is increasing or decreasing. The program is in the initial stages of implementation and requires 5 years of national data from 180 sites throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. EPA currently provides funding for this program.  FBI is involved in investigating environmental crimes, including illegal discharges from cruise ships. In recent years, FBI has investigated nearly a dozen criminal cases involving pollution from cruise ships. FBI has developed working relationships with many other federal, state, and local agencies by participating in 34 task forces on environmental crimes across the United States. According to FBI, its special agents bring to these task forces their interviewing skills and familiarity with sophisticated surveillance techniques. FBI legal attaches stationed around the world have located and interviewed foreign witnesses and suspects in cruise ship pollution cases. In addition, FBI's laboratory has provided hazardous materials response personnel, aircraft, forensic computer analysis, and handwriting and document analysis capabilities to assist in the investigation and prosecution of these cases.  The Department of State has served mainly as a diplomatic liaison between the Coast Guard and flag states, helping to ensure that flagstate referrals are forwarded to the appropriate representatives. In  Page 23  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376  addition, Department officials attend IMO meetings with Coast Guard officials to help address U.S. maritime concerns.  APHIS sets certain food waste disposal standards and regularly boards cruise ships to ensure that these standards are being met. Onboard, APHIS inspectors can both prevent and detect problems as they review certain garbage disposal procedures and documents. According to agency officials, they notify the Coast Guard if irregularities are found during their inspections so that the Coast Guard can follow up.  NOAA has no current long-term role in monitoring marine debris pollution on U.S. shores. However, from 1988 through 1996, NOAA--in cooperation with EPA and other federal partners--provided support for interagency, public, and private efforts to design a national marine debris pilot study program. According to agency officials, the efforts of this program led to the creation of the National Marine Debris Monitoring Program, which is coordinated by the Center for Marine Conservation, funded by EPA, and based on the use of data collected by dedicated volunteers.  Federal Agencies Have Implemented Some Recommendations for Improving Their Oversight of Marine Pollution  We identified 43 recommendations from nine studies and articles on marine pollution oversight conducted from 1990 through 1998 by GAO, the National Research Council, and others. (See app. IV for a list of the studies and app. V for a complete list of the recommendations and their current status.) The recommendations fell into three main categories:  Clarifying enforcement requirements and coordinating enforcement actions. Examples include determining the adequacy of commercial waste-handling capacity at ports that receive garbage from ships, matching port receipts for garbage to ships' garbage logs for inconsistencies, and developing standards for compacted waste.  Improving the reporting and sharing of enforcement information. Examples include directing the Coast Guard to issue periodic reports listing enforcement actions and assistance to other U.S. enforcement agencies and drawing attention to the need for an international data collection and reporting effort to highlight detected MARPOL violations and improve the responsiveness of individual flag states.  Improving data on marine debris and improving treatment technology. Examples include research and development to identify efficient and affordable onboard garbage treatment; technical support to commercial and U.S. fleets on waste treatment methods; and long-term monitoring programs to gather data on the trend, movement, and impact of marine debris on wildlife.  Page 24  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376  Federal agencies and IMO have implemented or partially implemented 30 of these recommendations, according to knowledgeable agency officials who reviewed the list.  Cruise Ship Companies Have Improved Waste Management and Environmental Procedures  All 12 companies we reviewed have taken actions to prevent future illegal marine discharges.16 (See app. VI for a list of the 12 cruise ship companies we reviewed.) These companies included eight larger companies--those with 5 to 16 ships sailing on multiple-day cruises--and four smaller companies--those with 1 or 2 ships sailing only on day cruises (no overnight stay aboard ship). The companies' actions involved similar themes and included three basic measures: developing enhanced waste management plans to emphasize the companies' environmental policies and highlight proper waste-handling procedures; increasing internal and third-party audit oversight of environmental procedures to prevent illegal discharges; and improving waste management and equipment to reduce or better treat waste items. Many of these actions were taken in response to new international standards or were mandated by U.S. district courts after several cruise ship companies pled guilty to illegal discharge incidents.  All Companies Reviewed Have Written Waste Management Plans  Each of the 12 companies we reviewed reported improving its waste management by developing and implementing an environmental compliance and waste management plan that has been certified as in compliance with IMO's International Safety management (ISM) Code.17 The ISM Code sets the international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for pollution prevention, and it requires companies and operators of vessels to organize their safety management activities both ashore and onboard to ensure that standards for safety and environmental protection are maintained. We verified that all 12 companies and their cruise ships had received ISM Code certification by July 1998.  16  To gather detailed information on cruise ship companies' actions to prevent future illegal marine discharges, we concentrated on 12 companies. Some of these companies were responsible for incidents that we judged to be intentional acts or whose cause we could not clearly ascertain; others were large companies representing a significant segment of the cruise ship industry that were involved in accidental cases. 17  In Nov. 1993, IMO adopted Resolution A.741 (18), entitled ""International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships (International Safety Management [ISM] Code).""  Page 25  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376  The ISM Code plan goes beyond the companies' previous efforts to address environmental issues, according to company officials. Representatives of each of the 12 companies told us their company had written environmental plans in place before the current ISM Code plan. Most of these plans dated back to the early 1990s. However, while some representatives said the early plans were comparable to the plan required under the ISM Code, others said the early plans were more limited in scope and included various plans addressing single issues, such as how to respond to an oil pollution incident or how to operate and maintain certain equipment associated with waste treatment or discharge. Industry officials generally agreed that the plans modeled after the ISM Code go farther than these earlier efforts and have had a positive effect in enhancing ships' safety and environmental protection. For example, one company official said the ISM plan emphasizes the company's commitment to protecting the environment and stresses the need for training, recycling, producing less waste, and reducing discharges of waste at sea. Besides preparing an environmental plan under the ISM Code, three companies have prepared additional environmental compliance plans mandated by U.S. district courts after the companies pled guilty to marine discharge violations that occurred from 1993 through 1998. The courts of jurisdiction approved these plans after finding that they met the conditions set forth in the plea agreements. The plans generally address the violations cited in the plea agreements and prescribe remedies ranging from specific procedures covering a single component of waste management (such as oily bilgewater management) to a more comprehensive set of procedures addressing systemwide components of waste management.  New Audits Companies' Procedures Implemente  of Cruise Ship Environmental Have Been d  Cruise ship companies and their ships are subject to new audits of their environmental procedures and operations, both by third parties and by company auditors. The new audits resulted largely from the ISM Code, which required external audits as part of the ISM Code certification process. These ISM certification audits, which must be paid for by cruise ship companies, are performed primarily by the authorized maritime organization within the ship's flag state or by a classification society such as Lloyd's Register of Shipping. The 12 companies also reported conducting numerous internal audits or using checklists to evaluate their ships' environmental operations. Some of these audits and evaluations included weekly spot-checks of environmental and waste management equipment operations, quarterly departmental  Page 26  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376  audits of equipment and procedural compliance by ships' officers, and annual shipwide audits of environmental compliance performed by shoreside managers. Officials of all 12 companies said the results of both internal and external audits are sent to top managers to keep them aware of how ships' crews are managing environmental and waste management programs. Like the Coast Guard's ship inspections, the new ISM-related audits are scheduled in advance, and the companies and ships' crews know when the auditors are onboard and generally what they are reviewing. Also, a sizeable portion of these audits focus on reviewing paperwork and processes. A representative of a major classification society said that close examinations of hardware, such as oily water separators and associated piping, cannot be accomplished in the time allotted for these audits. We did not accompany third-party or company auditors on any cruise ship inspections, although cruise ship company officials told us that their auditors do more than just ""paper checks"" when they are onboard. Other types of oversight also take place. Cruise ships continue to undergo the annual and quarterly Coast Guard inspections described earlier. The three companies that are operating under court-ordered compliance plans are also subject to independent audits and quarterly reports on their implementation of the compliance plans. They are required to forward copies of these audit reports to the court and to selected federal enforcement agencies for review. Completed court-required reports and internal audit reports for two cruise ship companies disclosed that these companies had a number of administrative and operational practices that needed improvement. Here are examples:  A review of logbooks showed that on two separate occasions, a ship's captain gave permission to discharge wastewater while the ship was within 12 miles of shore. The company's standard, which is more strict than U.S. and international laws, calls for discharging wastewater only beyond 12 miles. This permission could have led to wastewater discharges that did not comply with the company's standards, according to the audit report.  A ship's garbage record book was not completed and presented to the ship's captain in a timely fashion.  Page 27  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376   Plastic items flushed down ships' toilets by passengers could have been discharged along with untreated sewage, which would be in violation of U.S. and international laws that prohibit the discharge of plastics at sea. The findings of the reports we reviewed indicate that at least for some companies, the new processes and practices set forth in the plans are not yet fully proven and systematized throughout each company's fleet. However, the audits are identifying variances and deficiencies, and the results are being reported to enforcement authorities and the audited companies.  Larger Companies Have Adopted New Waste Management and Treatment Practices  While all 12 companies have taken steps to improve waste management and treatment aboard their cruise ships, the 8 large companies appear to have put more effort into implementing these practices than the 4 smaller companies. The large companies' efforts are dictated, in large part, by the size of the ships they sail. Many of these ships are small cities of 2,000 to 3,000 passengers and crew members that generate waste 24 hours a day, and their itineraries sometimes keep them away from port for days. Therefore, these ships have an incentive to adopt improved practices for dealing with the large volumes of waste generated. Moreover, because all of these companies have adopted new or more stringent environmental standards in recent years, they have also had to invest in equipment to reduce or better treat all the waste streams on their ships. An official for one large company estimates an investment of $5 million to $6 million to install the most up-to-date pollution control technology on the new cruise ships coming on line and as much as $1.3 million to refit each existing ship with newer pollution control equipment. Cruise ship companies have waste management systems for solid waste, oily bilgewater, wastewater from drains and kitchen areas, sewage, and hazardous chemicals. Our review focused on three major waste streams: solids (i.e., paper, food, cans, glass, and plastic); oily bilgewater generated from the day-to-day operation and cleaning of engines and equipment; and hazardous chemicals used in dry-cleaning, photo-processing, painting, and other operations aboard ship. The eight larger companies were better able than the four smaller companies to point to recent changes to reduce discharges of all three types of wastes. The smaller companies, which mostly operate day cruises, can store wastes onboard until their ships return to port.  Page 28  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376  Solid Waste  All eight large companies told us that they have a policy goal of ""zero discharge"" for solid waste at sea. To reach this goal, they first tried to reduce the amount of waste coming onboard by, for example,  replacing disposable plastic and Styrofoam cups and plastic stir sticks with reusable/washable plastic cups and wood stir sticks that can be burned,  using less paper and plastic wrapping for some food items,  replacing individual plastic condiment packages with bulk dispensers, and  eliminating the use of plastic bags to line garbage containers. In addition, the large companies have introduced new equipment to eliminate or recycle solid waste. For example, incinerators are now common on new cruise ships. Some of these incinerators are capable of burning paper, plastic, and de-watered food wastes. The ash is either returned to port or discharged at sea in accordance with U.S. and international standards, according to company officials. Other equipment includes glass crushers and can compactors that can help prepare waste for recycling when a ship returns to port. All but one of the eight larger companies said they have a waste separation and recycling program aboard each ship calling on U.S. ports. Recycled items include aluminum cans, glass, batteries, fluorescent tubes, metal cans, and cardboard. We accompanied Coast Guard inspectors and/or cruise ship company officials aboard five cruise ships (representing five of the eight large companies) in Miami, Florida; Seattle, Washington; and Vancouver, British Columbia (Canada), to observe firsthand the waste-handling procedures and equipment aboard ship. While aboard, we (1) saw various types of equipment for handling solid waste, including glass crushers, metal can compactors, shredders, and incinerators; (2) reviewed practices and procedures for solid waste management; and (3) in some instances, observed crew members performing waste management procedures, including separating solid waste and storing recyclable material for offloading in port.  Oily Bilgewater  Oily waste is generated onboard a cruise ship through normal engine and machine operations. The oily waste is collected along with freshwater and seawater in the bilge at the lowest part of the ship. While all cruise ships are required to have a system for separating the oil from bilgewater before it is discharged, newer cruise ships generally have redundant systems. Officials of some cruise ship companies told us that many older ships were  Page 29  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376  being fitted with backup systems as well. In addition, we were advised that innovative treatment technology is being developed that will improve the performance and reliability of existing oily water separators. MARPOL's standards allow for discharges of no more than 15 parts of oil per 1 million parts of water. Company officials believe that new technology and multiple systems will help ensure that standards are met--or even surpassed-and will prevent accidental discharges if one system breaks down. For example, officials of one large cruise ship company told us they had dual oily water separator systems aboard all their cruise ships. These systems, they said, were capable of treating oily bilgewater to 5 parts per million-- the level adopted as the companywide standard. While onboard the five cruise ships we visited, we saw the oily water separator systems and the meters for measuring discharge levels, and we reviewed oily water discharge practices and procedures with company officials.  Hazardous Waste  For hazardous waste, as for solid waste, some of the larger companies reported taking actions to reduce the amounts onboard. They reported replacing hazardous chemicals with nonhazardous ones and implementing procedures to improve the collection and disposal of waste from hazardous materials that cannot be replaced and must still be used. For example, at least one company has replaced harmful cleaning solvents with more environmentally friendly material, according to company officials. Equipment has also been installed on many ships to recover silver from used photo-processing chemicals and to collect harmful dry-cleaning chemicals. Hazardous waste from photo laboratories, dry-cleaning operations, and other sources are collected, stored in separate locked rooms, and off-loaded in port, according to company officials. While onboard four of the five cruise ships we visited, we saw locked storage areas for hazardous chemicals, reviewed procedures for handling hazardous waste, and in some instances observed the equipment for collecting hazardous waste from photo-processing and dry-cleaning operations.  Smaller Companies Have Made Fewer Changes  The four smaller companies have not had to take major steps to manage and treat wastes because their ships are away from port only 5-7 hours daily and have space onboard to store wastes until the ships return to port. This is particularly true for solid wastes, such as paper, food, cans, glass, and plastics. All four companies said they have a ""zero discharge"" policy for solid waste; all solid waste is returned to port, and taken to a landfill. Only two of the companies said they had attempted to reduce the amount of waste brought onboard by purchasing items with less packaging and less  Page 30  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376  plastic. In addition, only one company said it had made any effort to sort solid waste for recycling, and none reported investing in new solid waste treatment equipment. Three of the four companies said they have oily water separators and meters on their ships to measure the oil content of the wastewater discharged at sea. An official from the company that did not report having an oily water separator onboard said the oily bilge waste is stored onboard and transferred to waste handlers in port.  According to Relevant Federal Agencies and Others, Progress Has Been Made, but Important Concerns Remain Officials' Views on Actions Taken by Cruise Ship Companies  Officials from the Coast Guard, Justice, and the Center for Marine Conservation (CMC) acknowledged that the cruise ship industry has made progress in addressing illegal discharge issues. However, they expressed concern about emerging issues, most of which are related to the purity of wastewater discharged from these ships.  While officials from the Coast Guard, Justice, and CMC acknowledged the progress that cruise ship companies have made toward improving environmental compliance, they pointed out that these companies have not yet demonstrated that they can sustain their efforts and prevent pollution incidents from occurring.18 They also noted that willful incidents, especially by individuals, and accidents are still possible. These officials agreed that changing the views or ""culture"" of ships' crews and cruise ship company officials on waste disposal is critical in ensuring the effectiveness of companies' environmental programs. They told us that before the adoption of MARPOL and applicable U.S. laws, ships' crews could legally discharge oil, garbage, and other potentially harmful wastes, and the crews viewed such practices as a way of life at sea. Even though fewer illegal discharge cases by cruise ships have been reported over the last 6 years, the admission by one large company of continued illegal oil discharges occurring as recently as 1998 suggests that not everyone's views have completely changed.19  18  Justice officials' comments focused on cruise ship companies that had been prosecuted for criminal violations, while the Coast Guard and CMC officials focused more generally on the cruise ship industry.  Page 31  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376  Coast Guard officials expressed optimism that the steps the cruise ship industry has taken would address illegal discharges. The officials said the ISM Code, which all cruise ship companies were required to adopt as of July 1998, would likely result in a more systematic and comprehensive approach to stemming marine environmental pollution. In a larger sense, they said, they were not as concerned about pollution by the cruise ship industry as they were about pollution from other parts of the maritime industry, such as cargo ships and tankers. Similarly, a CMC official said that while CMC is critical of past illegal discharges by cruise ship companies, it has been supportive of the cruise ship industry's voluntary actions, including efforts to reduce the volume of plastics and other eventual waste items brought onboard and to recycle glass, aluminum, and other types of waste. Justice officials said the cruise industry needed to create a culture of compliance. In their view, environmental compliance plans, such as those required under their plea agreements, can help create such a culture. They also said that to be effective, a plan must have the right elements, the company must take it seriously by encouraging compliance and the selfreporting of violations, and people must be designated who will ensure that the plan is implemented. Otherwise, the plan is just a document. They further noted that having an environmental compliance plan, agreeing to outside audits of the plan's implementation, and sharing the results are not only good business practices but can also be mitigating factors under Justice's sentencing guidelines. While having an environmental compliance plan, based on the ISM Code or other standards, does not guarantee the elimination of future marine pollution incidents, Justice officials said a company that adopts a plan--as a valued aspect of its corporate activity-- is much less likely to see environmental problems recur.  Concerns About Emerging Issues and the Quality of Federal Oversight  Justice and CMC officials raised concerns about several issues that are emerging for certain types of wastes generated by cruise ships and need further attention. Justice also identified several areas that may warrant increased scrutiny by the Coast Guard and other cognizant agencies.  19  Justice officials told us that their policy does not allow them to discuss ongoing investigations. As a result, we do not know whether any illegal discharge incidents by cruise ships are currently under investigation.  Page 32  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376  Justice's Concerns About Emerging Issues and Federal Oversight  One area that Justice officials believe should receive increased scrutiny by the Coast Guard and other cognizant agencies in future cruise ship pollution cases is the discharge of ""gray water,"" which is untreated water from showers, sinks, kitchen and laundry drains, dishwashers, and other areas of a ship. Each year, cruise ships legally discharge millions of gallons of gray water into both U.S. and international waters. Justice recently prosecuted a large cruise ship company that was found to be improperly disposing of printing shop, dry-cleaning, and photo lab wastes into its gray water system. These wastes, which included potentially harmful chemicals and toxic silver, were discharged into the sea along with the gray water. According to Justice officials, apart from the potential criminal violations related to toxic substances in gray water discharges, there may be a need for the Coast Guard to review the regulatory definition of gray water to evaluate whether the current regulations adequately address the potential environmental hazards to marine life from gray water discharges. Justice officials believe that a more comprehensive or explicit definition of gray water may be needed that recognizes changes in the industry since the regulations were written. Industry representatives for the larger cruise ship companies told us they are addressing gray water issues in a number of ways. Officials said they have taken steps to identify and segregate hazardous materials to prevent them from entering the gray water system. For example, they said that photo-processing and dry-cleaning chemical wastes are collected and offloaded onshore and noted that the cleaning chemicals used in kitchens and bathrooms are not caustic in their diluted forms. In addition, they recently adopted a policy not to discharge gray water while ships are in port and are exploring new technologies for treating gray water, including the use of more sophisticated gray water filtration systems aboard ships. However, the effectiveness of these efforts is unknown because there is virtually no monitoring of gray water quality by any independent oversight agency or organization before the water is discharged from cruise ships. Justice officials are also concerned about three additional areas where they say increased federal oversight of cruise ships by the Coast Guard and other cognizant agencies may be warranted.  Maintaining and operating pollution prevention equipment. According to Justice officials, several cases have involved ships that, despite periodic inspections, were determined to have chronically malfunctioning or inoperable oily water separators that owners and operators failed to  Page 33  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376  maintain. This suggests, according to Justice officials, that future inspections and investigations concerning this equipment should probe more thoroughly into its condition and evaluate the adequacy of equipment maintenance procedures.  Falsifying oil record books. According to Justice officials, a number of cases suggest that owners or operators have routinely fabricated entries in their ship's oil record book to create the appearance of full compliance with MARPOL's discharge limitations. Justice officials believe that enhanced scrutiny of these logbooks on a periodic basis may be warranted and may also help encourage broader compliance.  Recording shoreside disposal of garbage and sludge. Recent case experience has revealed that some ships were unable to produce any records documenting what should be periodic off-loadings and disposal of plastics and oily sludge from the ships to onshore disposal facilities, according to Justice officials. They believe that more frequent reviews and analysis of these records may identify violators and also deter other unlawful discharges.  Center for Marine Conservation's Concerns About Wastewater Discharges  A CMC official also expressed concern about gray water and black water discharges. ""Black water"" is the effluent wastewater from a vessel's onboard sewage system. CMC officials said that the annual discharge of millions of gallons of gray water and black water may harm ecologically sensitive areas, affecting such things as the long-term vitality of coral reefs. Reports from recent third-party audits involving five ships of a large cruise ship company support the CMC official's concerns about black water. These reports noted that plastics from personal hygiene and other products (e.g., toothbrushes, plastic bottles, disposable razors, feminine hygiene products, etc.) were being flushed down toilets by passengers and entering the black water system. Once in the system, the plastics could be discharged into the sea with the black water because the ships' approved toilet vacuum system did not have screening devices to remove debris, according to the audit reports. The company involved is currently installing special filters to prevent plastics and other solid materials from being discharged into the sea, according to company officials. The audit reports also noted that untreated sewage was discharged at sea when onboard sewage systems were down for maintenance. Like gray water effluent, there is little, if any, oversight over the contents of black water before it is discharged into the ocean, according to Coast Guard officials. Coast Guard inspectors we talked with said they rarely have time during scheduled ship examinations to inspect sewage treatment equipment or filter systems to  Page 34  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376  see if they are working properly and filtering out potentially harmful contaminants.  Conclusions  In recent years, both federal agencies and cruise ship companies have taken positive steps to develop plans, approaches, and/or hardware solutions to improve environmental compliance. Yet even with the progress that has been made so far, there are a number of areas where oversight could be improved. Concerns related to marine pollution are emerging that may have a significant impact on the environment and may require further attention by both the cruise ship companies and federal oversight agencies. A key issue is the purity of gray and black water, which is particularly relevant for larger cruise ships, given the large volumes of this type of water they discharge at sea. The process for referring to other countries alleged discharge incidents occurring outside U.S. jurisdiction (flag-state referrals) does not appear to be working either within the Coast Guard or internationally. As evidenced by the abrupt halt in flag-state referrals in 1995, the Coast Guard appears to have given up efforts to develop these cases, perhaps because the response rate from flag states has been so poor. However, the agency is obligated under MARPOL to take action on these cases when they occur. In addition, the relatively poor response rate from other countries on alleged discharge incidents is not in conformance with international agreements facilitated by IMO and undermines efforts to stem pollution of the world's oceans. The Coast Guard may be able to improve its detection of illegal marine pollution incidents by modifying its aircraft surveillance, flying over water rather than land, where possible, when traveling to and from other primary missions. This change could provide more coverage of shipping lanes frequented by cruise ships and other commercial vessels and could strengthen the deterrent effect of this detection method. Such initiatives are being studied in one Coast Guard district, but formal action has not yet been taken.  Recommendations  To improve oversight of the cruise ship industry, we recommend that the Secretary of Transportation direct the Commandant of the Coast Guard to take the following steps:  Page 35  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376   Initiate discussions with the cruise ship industry, other federal and state agencies, and environmental groups, as appropriate, on the need for improved water quality standards for gray water and black water discharged from cruise ships and other vessels and assess the need to periodically monitor the water quality of these discharges.  In its capacity as a lead agency for the United States at the International Maritime Organization, the Coast Guard should work vigorously within the organization, using whatever means are available, to encourage the member countries to comply with procedures requiring flag states to respond when pollution cases are referred to them. To effectively accomplish this, the Coast Guard needs to renew efforts to develop and refer to the State Department alleged pollution cases occurring outside U.S. jurisdiction and make greater efforts to periodically follow up on these alleged cases.  Reexamine ways--within existing resources and without detracting from other primary missions--to provide more effective aircraft surveillance of cruise ships and other commercial vessels.  Agency Comments  We provided a draft of this report to the Coast Guard, the Department of Justice, EPA, the Department of State, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Commerce, the International Council of Cruise Lines, and the Center for Marine Conservation for their review and comment. All of these agencies and organizations generally concurred with the facts presented in the draft report. The Coast Guard, the Department of Justice, the Department of State, the International Council of Cruise Lines, and the Center for Marine Conservation specifically commented on and agreed with the draft report's conclusions and recommendations. The Department of Commerce, EPA, and the Department of Agriculture did not specifically comment on the draft report's conclusions and recommendations. Written comments from the Department of Commerce, the Department of Justice, and the Center for Marine Conservation are in appendixes VIII through X. Several agencies provided other information to supplement the facts presented in the draft report. In commenting on the draft report, EPA maintained that the draft report downplayed EPA's leadership in the field of marine debris. We added and modified information in the report to clarify EPA's role in the marine debris area. The Department of Justice, the Department of State, and the Center for Marine Conservation also advised us about the importance of ensuring that the Coast Guard has adequate resources to fulfill its oversight responsibilities. Justice and the Center expressed concern that the Coast Guard's existing resources may not be  Page 36  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   B-282376  adequate to provide improved oversight of marine pollution. The State Department noted that budget cuts over the past 3 to 5 years have reduced the Coast Guard's resources to such extent that it is now extremely difficult for the Coast Guard to perform its marine environmental protection mission as efficiently as it once did. In addition, Justice and the Center raised concerns that insufficient Coast Guard resources could be associated with the decline in reported discharge incidents. While we regard resource constraints as a valid reason for a decline in reported incidents, there are likely to be many possible reasons for the decline. Such possible reasons include better compliance by ships' owners and operators and improvements in technology that could decrease the likelihood of discharge incidents. Largely because of constraints on our time, data, and resources for performing this type of analysis, we did not include such an analysis in our review. The Center also emphasized that sedimentation pollution caused by the drafts of larger ships stirring up bottom sediment can be harmful to the marine environment. The Center added that U.S. government ships should not be exempt from MARPOL's standards, that fines and penalties for marine pollution incidents were too low to be effective, and that a review of the strategies for imposing fines is needed. While these all may be valid issues, they were beyond the scope of this review. These agencies and organizations all provided technical clarifications to the draft report, which were incorporated as appropriate.  We conducted our work from March 1999 through January 2000 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Appendix VII contains details of the scope and methodology of our review.

The source is referenced after each recommendation.  Recommended action/source U.S. Coast Guard Require vessels lacking comprehensive onboard garbage management systems to off-load garbage at each U.S. por t of call. (Source: App. IV - 5)  Type of action Clarifying requirements  Status of action reported by the agency Par tially implemented. 33 C.F.R. 151 requires U.S.-flagged commercial vessels over 40 feet, and Annex V of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) requires foreign-flagged vessels of 400 gross tons or carr ying 15 passengers or more, to have an onboard garbage management plan and discharge records. The Coast Guard (Captain of the Por t) can compel any noncompliant vessel to off-load in por t and/or detain the vessel until a satisfactory garbage plan is implemented. Implemented. Routine Coast Guard por t state control examinations include checks of documents, cer tificates, manuals, and pollution prevention systems (including garbage logs). The Coast Guard's marine safety manual and instructions specify that the scope of these exams can be expanded if there are clear grounds for suspecting MARPOL noncompliance. An examination book was published with checklists on MARPOL inspection items. Par tially implemented. The United States ""encourages"" U.S.flagged vessels--as specified by IMO--to repor t inadequate por t reception facilities, and the Coast Guard is changing its regulations to require that por t reception facilities post signs providing instructions and local Coast Guard phone numbers to call for repor ting inadequate facilities. The United States also played an active role in an IMO working group that redesigned IMO's form for repor ting inadequate reception facilities. Par tially implemented. The Coast Guard does not perform a detailed inspection of a vessel's garbage log during por t state control examinations. However, if there are clear grounds to believe that a vessel does not comply with MARPOL Annex V during a por t state control examination, the Coast Guard boarding officer may expand the scope and depth of the examination to verify garbage logs. Not implemented. The Coast Guard does not enforce state requirements. Its current regulations require consultation with EPA before a cer tification of adequacy is issued. If EPA notifies the Coast Guard that an applicant is not in compliance, a cer tification will not be granted.  Examine garbage logs and onboard garbage handling and treatment technologies during routine inspections. (Source: App. IV - 2,5)  Clarifying requirements  Require vessel operators to repor t inadequate por t reception facilities (using IMO forms) and follow up to ensure that changes are made. (Source: App. IV - 5)  Clarifying requirements  Match por t receipts for garbage discharged to vessel garbage logs for inconsistencies. (Source: App. IV - 5)  Clarifying requirements  Require por ts to have the necessar y state permits as a condition of granting a cer tification of adequacy and require por t reception facilities to meet the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) standards.

The Coast Guard's regulations specify which por ts must provide reception facilities and which must have cer tifications of adequacy. The application for the cer tification includes calculations for determining wastehandling capacity, and Coast Guard personnel inspect reception facilities for compliance. The Coast Guard is also active in an IMO working group that is developing international guidelines for determining capacity, as well as related por t reception parameters. Implemented. MARPOL V requires garbage logs on foreignflagged vessels of at least 400 gross tons or carr ying 15 or more persons. Implemented. The Notice of Violation (ticket) program is no longer a pilot project. Regulations have been published, and the program is currently being used to process small oil pollution and cer tain oil and sewage pollution prevention civil penalty cases. Implemented. The Coast Guard coordinates por t enforcement and response activities with other federal, state, and local authorities. The Sea Par tners Campaign has been established to develop community awareness of maritime pollution and to improve compliance with marine environmental protection regulations.  Determine how much waste-handling Clarifying requirements capacity is adequate at par ticular por ts and mandate waste-handling capacity sufficient to meet the needs of all vessels expected to call.

(Source: App. IV - 5) Enlist the assistance of the National Marine Improving repor ting Fisheries Ser vice, the Mineral Mining Ser vice, and state marine police in repor ting MARPOL marine discharge violations, and encourage repor ts of violations by the public. (Source: App. IV - 5) Work with the Depar tments of State and Justice to enforce MARPOL aggressively against foreign-flag violators and pursue inter national resolution of any ambiguities concerning the rights of por t states to control pollution from vessels. (Source: App. IV - 5) Coordinating enforcement  Par tially implemented. The Coast Guard has two manuals that provide field guidance on the enforcement of environmental statutes and describe the agency's relationships with the Depar tments of State and Justice. All civil case referrals of MARPOL violations outside U.S. jurisdiction are promptly forwarded to the flag states (through the Depar tment of State) for investigation and resolution. IMO is developing a new edition of the MARPOL compliance and enforcement manual to assist other por t states with their responsibility to control pollution from users. Not applicable. The Coast Guard does not have the authority to delegate MARPOL enforcement authority to another federal or state agency. The Coast Guard has worked with APHIS inspectors to include a section on MARPOL V garbage handling in APHIS inspections, and inspections indicating noncompliance with garbage-handling procedures are turned over to the Coast Guard for enforcement. Continued from Previous Page  Delegate Marine Plastic Pollution Research Coordinating and Control Act's inspection authority to enforcement state marine patrols and other federal agencies, such as the Depar tment of Agriculture's Animal Plant Health Inspection Ser vice (APHIS).

(Source: App. IV - 5)  Type of action Sharing information  Status of action reported by the agency Par tially implemented. The Coast Guard and APHIS share information as necessary. Coast Guard officials do not believe that developing a shared database would help reduce illegal marine discharges by cruise line companies, and they repor t that resources are not available to accomplish this task.  Review companies' internal audit repor ts as Clarifying requirements par t of vessel examinations. (Source: Interviews)  Not implemented. The Coast Guard has deter mined that companies' inter nal audit repor ts should not be reviewed as a detection tool. Coast Guard officials believe the internal audits are to promote self-discovery and correction of noncompliance, and companies would be less inclined to repor t nonconformance if they knew internal audit repor ts would be used to discover violations. Par tially implemented. The Coast Guard collects and analyzes MARPOL data to gauge its success in meeting the agency's business plan goal to reduce the amount of vessel-generated plastics and garbage. Coast Guard officials do not believe that publishing repor ts on enforcement actions or assistance would help reduce illegal marine discharges by cruise line companies; and they repor t that resources are not available to accomplish this task. Implemented. A standardized examination book (CG-840) to assist Coast Guard boarding officers was published with helpful checklists on MARPOL inspection items. Implemented. Actions taken by the Coast Guard's civil penalty hearing officers are documented in the Coast Guard's centralized Marine Safety Information System (MSIS), providing immediate feedback to local units on the status of cases entered into the system. Cases that are forwarded with insufficient evidence are immediately returned to the district/unit that referred them, and all cases are retur ned after penalties have been addressed and collected.  Issue periodic repor ts listing enforcement actions, assistance provided by other agencies, and analysis of data. (Source: App. IV - 5)  Sharing information  Standardize MARPOL inspection checklist.

(Source: App. IV - 4, 5) Require cruise ships without incinerators rated to burn food waste to off-load APHISregulated waste at U.S. por ts of call. (Source: App. IV - 5) Clarifying requirements Implemented. APHIS' ship-boarding repor t form was amended to include MARPOL V garbage-/waste-handling procedures. Instances of identified noncompliance are referred to the Coast Guard for enforcement. Feedback from the Coast Guard to APHIS on actions taken is poor. Not implemented. APHIS' regulations do not require garbage to be off-loaded. APHIS' legal authorities are to prevent the introduction of plant and animal diseases. If waste is handled properly onboard a vessel, there is no risk of introducing a plant or animal disease. There are specific requirements for handling and disposing of contaminated waste (if off-loaded), namely incineration or sterilization with burial. Continued from Previous Page  Page 56  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   Appendix V Status of Recommendations, Cited in Studies and Articles, to Strengthen U.S. Enforcement Efforts or Discourage Illegal Discharges  Recommended action/source Develop standards for compacted waste. (Source: App. IV - 5)  Type of action Clarifying requirements  Status of action reported by the agency Implemented. APHIS has requirements for compacted waste. Clean waste (i.e., waste that is not contaminated by plant or animal matter) may be off-loaded without restriction. Contaminated materials may be off-loaded if they have been sterilized or incinerated. Implemented. Justice has jurisdiction for illegal discharges and prosecutes to the maximum extent per mitted by law. Its jurisdiction for oil and hazardous waste reaches no far ther than the exclusive economic zone for foreign-flagged ships depar ting U.S. por ts. Its jurisdiction for discharges caused by U.S. ships is worldwide. Implemented. Justice has sought the imposition of appropriate penalties in all vessel cases and, where warranted, has requested the imposition of criminal fines calculated pursuant to the loss- or gain-doubling provisions of the Alternative Fines Act. Where appropriate, Justice will continue to request criminal fines that seek to remove the economic advantage achieved through unlawful conduct. Implemented. Through extensive training and coordination, Justice has developed linkages with the Coast Guard, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and EPA.  Depar tment of Justice Take action under U.S. law to prosecute Clarifying requirements MARPOL including violations that occur outside U.S. territorial waters if there is clear evidence of a discharge.

NOAA and EPA, from 1988 to 1996, coordinated the effor t to develop and initiate an interagency public/private marine debris pilot study program. The effor ts of this program contributed to the creation in 1996 of the National Marine Debris Monitoring Program, a statistically valid marine debrismonitoring program. The program is in the initial stages of implementation and is funded by EPA, coordinated by the Center for Marine Conservation, and based on the use of data collected by dedicated volunteers. This program will collect information over a 5-year period on the types and amounts of debris found at 180 sites in the coastal United States, including Alaska and Hawaii, Puer to Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. NOAA has no current role in monitoring marine debris.

(Source: App. IV - 5)  Type of action Coordinating enforcement  Status of action reported by the agency Par tially implemented. Under the Resource Conser vation and Recovery Act (RCRA), EPA established regulations in 1979 (updated in 1991) to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste. These regulations apply to the disposal of garbage that is offloaded from vessels in U.S. por ts. The regulations are selfimplementing (i.e., implemented by states that can demonstrate to EPA that they have permit programs to ensure disposal facilities' compliance with the regulations). As of June 1999, 48 states and territories had EPA-approved permit programs. RCRA authorizes the states, regional solid waste authorities, and local governments to regulate other aspects of solid waste management (e.g., collection and storage). While RCRA provides that EPA could develop nonbinding technical guidance for vessel garbage management, this is not a priority, and EPA has no plans to prepare such guidance. Par tially implemented. EPA issued regulations in 1979 that provide guidelines to assist states in the development of solid waste management plans. States that submitted their plans to EPA for approval or received approval from EPA would be eligible for financial assistance to prepare or implement their plans. Funds for financial assistance have not been appropriated since fiscal year 1981, and there is no incentive for states to submit their plans for review. Not implemented. Other than for the disposal of solid waste, EPA does not have the authority to establish regulations that would require por ts to manage solid waste in a par ticular manner. RCRA gives that authority to the states and regional/local authorities. While EPA could issue nonbinding guidance that might or might not be followed, it currently has no plans to issue such guidance. Not implemented.

In addition, IMO's Technical Cooperation Division is coordinating effor ts to improve reception facilities in the wider Caribbean region. The wider Caribbean has been designated as a special area under MARPOL V, but the designation is not in effect because the region does not have enough reception facilities. When more such facilities become available, the designation will take effect, and it will be unlawful to discharge any ship-generated garbage into the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. U.S. officials have worked closely with the World Bank to ensure the availability of loans/grants to construct such facilities. However, some cruise lines oppose the fees necessary to keep the reception facilities operational. Par tially implemented. IMO collects such repor ts, as required by MARPOL, and includes them in its annual repor t. However, not all flag states have been submitting their repor ts to IMO.

To identify the nature and scope of reported illegal discharge cases for foreign-flagged cruise ships, we obtained data from the Coast Guard's Marine Safety Information System (MSIS) and from records at the Departments of State and Justice on illegal marine discharge cases identified from 1993 through 1998. We eliminated all MSIS cases that did not involve a cruise ship, were not proven, or were closed for lack of evidence or for administrative purposes (i.e., duplicate cases). We reviewed the State Department's records to exclude cases that were not linked to passenger/cruise ships, and we compared the records from MSIS, State, and Justice to account for overlap among the records. We obtained additional details on the cases from MSIS to ensure that we had sufficient information to describe the nature of each incident. We obtained additional information about the ships and companies involved in the incidents from various sources, including interviews with company officials, Internet sources, and cruise industry publications. We also contacted the Coast Guard's hearing office for information on how the MSIS cases were resolved through the agency's civil penalty process. To determine what actions the Coast Guard and other agencies have taken to prevent, detect, investigate, and prosecute illegal discharges from foreign-flagged cruise ships, we contacted officials from the Coast Guard, Justice (including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami), the State Department, the Animal Plant Health Inspection Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Military Sealift Command, and the U.S. Public Health Service. We asked agency officials about the role their agency might play in the detection, prevention, investigation and prosecution of illegal marine discharge cases. From these discussions, we summarized the character of and efforts expended by the agencies to address illegal marine discharge issues. To find published recommendations that could strengthen U.S. enforcement efforts over illegal marine discharges and /or discourage such activities in the future, we conducted a literature search to identify reports, studies, and journal articles written in the last 9 years. We then identified relevant recommendations from these studies and had experts from the Center for Marine Conservation review the recommendations for relevance and comprehensiveness. We distributed a list of recommendations to federal  Page 63  GAO/RCED-00-48 Marine Pollution   Appendix VII Objectives, Scope and Methodology  and other officials who would recommendations and sought recommendations.

We then analyzed each illegal discharge incident by these ships to determine whether it appeared to be accidental or intentional.1 Initially, we identified 18 companies with incidents that we judged to be intentional or of indeterminate cause. However, we did not contact 7 of these 18 companies because 4 are no longer operating and 3 were acquired by or merged with another company already identified on our list. We eliminated two other companies because they no longer operate vessels themselves but instead contract with another company (already on our list) for the management of their vessel operations. Finally, we added three companies to our follow-up list. While they did not meet the criteria for our original list of 18, they were large companies that had experienced accidental discharges and represented a significant segment of the cruise ship industry. In total, we identified 12 cruise ship companies, both large and small. After identifying these 12 companies, we interviewed officials from them in person or by telephone. We visited the corporate offices of four cruise ship companies and observed environmental compliance practices and procedures aboard three cruise ships operated by three of these companies. We also observed environmental compliance practices and procedures aboard two cruise ships operated by two other companies. In addition, we met with and interviewed officials from the International Council of Cruise Lines, the trade association that represents the interests of 17 of the largest cruise lines in the North American market. Finally, we discussed the steps being taken by the companies with officials from the  1  Our analysis of intentional and accidental cases was made solely to establish a basis for determining which cruise ship companies we should contact for follow up about the actions they have taken to reduce illegal discharges. The analysis was not intended to be an evaluation of the appropriateness of these cases for prosecution.

Executive Summary    Section 301 of Executive Order (EO) 13101, Greening the Government Through Waste Prevention, Recycling, and Federal Acquisition, requires that the Task Force on Greening the Government Through Waste Prevention and Recycling (the ""Task Force"") develop a government-wide Strategic Plan (Plan) to implement the Order.  Beyond merely fulfilling the paperwork requirements to do a strategic plan, the Task Force recognizes its responsibilities to Federal agencies, the public, and other stakeholders to clearly articulate why ""greening"" the Federal government is important and what we  together  need to do to accomplish that objective.    Development of a strategic plan is a tool to think through where the Federal government is, where it needs to be at a certain point in the future, and what steps and resources are required to get there.  It should be useful to all who are participating in implementation of the Executive Order.    This Plan provides a vision and a roadmap for future waste prevention, recycling, and Federal acquisition initiatives across the government.  The Plan describes strategies and actions to achieve the goal and identifies the stakeholders and the performance measures that will be utilized to measure agency progress.  An implementation schedule with specific milestones is also contained within the Plan.    There is one major goal which defines the Plan: to improve waste prevention, recycling and the purchase and use of recycled content and environmentally preferable products and services in the Federal government.    This Plan further defines the course the Task Force and its Chair have charted to meet the challenges of implementing the stated goal.    Through implementation of the Plan, Federal agencies will:        Prevent and reduce the generation of non-hazardous waste.     Create and strengthen markets for recovered materials and recycled content and environmentally preferable products and services.     Spur competition.     Create business and employment opportunities for green industries.     Strengthen the economy at the local, state, regional, and national level.     Improve and enhance the environment.     Transfer successful affirmative procurement and environmentally preferable purchasing techniques between the Federal, state and local governments, and industry.     Set an example for other governments, individuals, and the private sector.      A clearly defined goal and a plan for waste prevention, recycling, and acquiring recycled content or environmentally preferable products and services can create a government that not only works better and costs less, but also improves the environment for all of us.  The Task Force will provide leadership in implementing the strategies and actions outlined in this plan and work actively with agencies to find common solutions to accomplish the goal.  Lessons learned from implementing the Strategic Plan will form the basis for updating and expanding future commitments, strategies, actions, and milestones.    The Plan was prepared by the Task Force in collaboration with an interagency work group consisting of representatives from various Federal agencies.     The Plan can be found on the Web at  http://www.ofee.gov      II. Vision, Mission, and Goal    Vision     By promoting efficient use of our natural resources and protecting the environment for ourselves and future generations, the Federal government will be recognized as a world leader in waste prevention, recycling, and acquisition of recycled content and environmentally preferable products and services.    Mission    The mission is to increase (1) waste prevention, (2) recycling, and (3) the acquisition of recycled content and environmentally preferable products and services for the benefit of the American people.    Background    Legislation and Presidential direction requiring the purchase of recycled content products has been evolving since 1976, when Congress established a buy-recycled law.  In Section 6002 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Congress directed government agencies to promote recycling by increasing their purchases of products containing recovered materials.    Since 1989, executive orders have sought to stimulate Federal progress in these areas.  For example, Executive Order 12873, Federal Acquisition, Recycling, and Waste Prevention, issued in October, 1993, was designed to foster and strengthen Federal response to existing RCRA mandates to reduce solid waste, build markets for recycled content products, encourage new technologies, and protect the environment by increasing purchases of recycled content products.  On September 14, 1998, Executive Order 13101, Greening the Government Through Waste Prevention, Recycling, and Federal Acquisition, was signed by the President.  The new EO is designed to further expand and strengthen the Federal government's commitment to recycling and buying recycled content and environmentally preferable products, (including biobased products).  Since the signing of EO 12873, the Federal government has more than quadrupled its purchases of recycled content paper and increased purchases of other recycled content products having moved from 39 percent in fiscal year (FY94)  to 50 percent in FY96.  EO 13101 will take the Federal government to the next level.    EO 12873 created the position of the Federal Environmental Executive (FEE).  The FEE is designated by the President to take all actions necessary to ensure that agencies comply with the requirements of the EO. Under EO 13101, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) chartered the Task Force, with the FEE as its chair.  The Task Force is directed by a Steering Committee comprised of the FEE, the Chair of the CEQ, and the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).    The purpose of the Task Force is to advise and assist the Steering Committee and the Federal agencies, make recommendations concerning policy, facilitate implementation, provide a centralized focal point for assistance and direction, and communicate and enhance knowledge of the provisions of EO 13101.    In addition, there are other related activities such as pollution prevention, energy-efficient products and services, and climate change initiatives that are directly and indirectly related to, but not a part of, the immediate mission of the Task Force.  The Task Force will coordinate, as appropriate, with other organizations and CEQ chartered Task Forces with respect to other Greening the Government activities.    Participation by all Federal agencies will be necessary in order to accomplish the mission set forth in EO 13101.  Requirements of EO 13101 do not apply to facilities and posts abroad except for purchases made in the United States for shipments overseas.    To accomplish the mission, a wide range of expertise and skills need to be involved:         Agency Environmental Executives (AEEs) are essential because they provide the direction, integration, and coordination of the EO requirements in their agencies.  EO 13101 recognizes the importance of the AEEs by requiring the head of each major procuring agency to designate an AEE at a level no lower than the Assistant Secretary level or equivalent.  The EO specifically directs the AEEs to: (1) translate this Government-wide Strategic Plan into specific agency and service plans; (2) implement their specific agency and service plans; (3) report to the FEE on the progress of plan implementation; (4) work with the FEE and the Task Force on furthering implementation of the EO; (5) track agencies' purchases of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-designated guideline items and report agencies' purchases to the FEE; and (6) one year after a product is placed on the Department of Agriculture (USDA) Biobased Products List, estimate their agency's purchases of products on the list and report them to the Secretary of Agriculture.     Facility managers are involved because they can promote aggressively the use of a larger array of recycled content and environmentally preferable  products and services in their facilities. This will help them effectively carry out their basic mission and reach their environmental goals at the same time.     Contracting and supply personnel -- including everyone involved in all aspects of acquisition -- are important to accomplish the mission because the $200 billion/year purchasing power of the Federal government can create and stimulate markets and promote technologies for recycled content and environmentally preferable products and services.     Agency contractors, (e.g., technical support, management and operating, and support services contractors), also are affected by EO 13101.  Contracts that provide for contractor operation of a Government-owned or leased facility and/or contracts that provide for contractor or other support services at Government-owned or operated facilities awarded by Federal agencies shall include provisions that obligate contractors to comply with the requirements of the EO.     Program/project personnel are critical to accomplish the mission because they are the end users of the products and services acquired by contracting and supply offices.  Furthermore, by incorporating the use of recycled content products when developing specifications and requirements, and by using their credit cards to procure recycled content and environmentally preferable products and services, program/project personnel are critical to creating and stimulating markets.      Recycling coordinators are important because they can identify commodities suffering from limited markets and can expand collection of commodities that experience an increase in demand. They are also instrumental in creating a ""clean"" supply of raw materials to facilitate cost-effective manufacturing from recovered materials.      Goal    The primary goal is to improve waste prevention, recycling, and the purchase and use of recycled content and environmentally preferable products and services in the Federal government.     In order to meet the primary goal, Federal agencies must:        Improve and expand diversion of solid waste through waste prevention, reuse, and recycling.     Facilitate the development and expansion of markets for recycled content and environmentally preferable products through greater Federal government acquisition and use of these products and services, research and development programs, assistance programs, and other appropriate programs.     Facilitate the development and expansion of technology for waste prevention, recycling (including design for disassembly), and manufacture of recycled content and environmentally preferable products.     Expand waste prevention and recycling in the daily operation of the Federal government.     Implement cost-effective procurement programs favoring the purchase of environmentally preferable products and services.      The following sections discuss various strategies and actions the Federal Environmental Executive, the Task Force, and Federal agencies will take to achieve the goal and the objectives of EO 13101.      III. Strategies     All Federal agencies have primary responsibility for:        Improving acquisition planning by (1) revising product standards and specifications to reflect RCRA section 6002 and EO 13101 requirements; (2) including consideration of waste prevention; product or materials reuse; and recycling; and (3) the implementation of affirmative procurement programs to increase the use and purchase of recycled content and environmentally preferable products and services.     Developing and implementing new technologies that improve Federal recycling and waste prevention programs, or facilitate the manufacturing or remanufacturing of recycled content or environmentally preferable products.     Developing tracking and monitoring systems to demonstrate compliance with section 6002 of RCRA.     Establishing quantitative goals, to be achieved by the end of FY 2000, 2005, and 2010, and beyond, for waste prevention, recycling or solid waste diversion; affirmative procurement of products made with recovered materials; and procurement of environmentally preferable products and services for which agencies have completed pilot programs.     Identifying opportunities to establish model facilities and promote their success.     Implementing cost-effective waste prevention and recycling programs at all Federal facilities, including retention and use of recycling revenues.     Procuring printing and writing paper containing no less than 30 percent postconsumer fiber.     Developing an internal agency-wide awards program as appropriate to reward its most innovative waste prevention, recycling, and affirmative procurement efforts.       The Task Force, in consultation with the Federal agencies, has responsibility for:        Developing streamlined reporting requirements that reflect progress in attaining goals.         Preparing biennial ""Greening the Government"" reports to the President on actions taken by agencies to comply with EO 13101 and other applicable environmental EOs.      Updating the Strategic Plan as appropriate.        The Task Force and the Federal agencies are responsible for:         Developing outreach and training on acquisition of recycled content and environmentally preferable products for agency procurement officials, program management, and requesting activities; the public and private sectors; and states and local governments.       USDA, in consultation with the EPA and the FEE, is responsible for:        Publishing a Biobased Products List with biannual updates, ensuring that listed products provide environmental benefits.        EPA, in consultation with the FEE, is responsible for:         Developing Federal facility inspection guidance for use in determining compliance with section 6002 of RCRA.     Publishing final guidance on purchasing environmentally preferable products and services.     Assisting Federal agencies in designing, implementing, and documenting the results of pilot projects to purchase environmentally preferable products and services, which will be used to update the guidance.        Section IV of the Strategic Plan discusses the specific actions that can be undertaken to implement these strategies.  The actions are organized by action categories.  The following matrix identifies the action categories applicable to each strategy.    ACTIONS FOR EACH STRATEGY IN THE EO 13101 STRATEGIC PLAN           A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H   I   J   K   L   M   N   O   P     ACTION CATEGORIES     Improving and Expanding Waste Prevention and Recycling Programs              X            X               Identifying Recycled Content and Environmentally Preferable Products (EPP)                         X       X       X         Implementing Acquisition Planning and Affirmative Procurement    X      X          X          X           X     Ensuring Federal Facility Compliance and Establishing Tracking Mechanisms        X              X    X    X        X         Identifying Model Facilities           X             X               Developing and Enhancing Technologies for Waste Prevention, Recycling, and Recycled Content and Environmentally Preferable Products        X                      X               Developing and Promoting Outreach and Training Programs                       X   X             Establishing Goals for Waste Prevention, Recycling, and Affirmative Procurement           X                 X               Sponsoring Awards Programs                 X       X                  IV.  Actions     EO 13101 establishes multiple tasks and objectives.  Given the diversity of Federal agencies' size and missions, a variety of strategies and actions should be used to meet these tasks and objectives.  The Task Force intends that these strategies and actions provide a flexible framework to encourage Federal agencies to apply their uniqueness and strengths to achieving the goals of the EO.     Actions have been developed to help agencies overcome barriers and obstacles to implementation identified over the years.  Following is a list of possible barriers and obstacles to implementation, but are by no means the entire roster and are not listed in any prioritized order:         Resistance to culture change within agencies, offices, facilities, and suppliers.         Lack of awareness, training, and education in the Federal workforce.         Lack of integration, involvement, and coordination across agency programs (procurement, technical, regulatory, etc.).         Competing budgetary and program priorities.         Lack of information on product price, performance, and availability.        As new barriers are identified, additional targeted actions to address them will be included in future revisions to the Plan.     With the implementation of the following actions, the Federal agencies and offices are expected to budget the necessary resources including personnel, funding, and other policy and programmatic support in order to achieve the desired goals of EO 13101.  For agencies not already doing so, these resources and funding requests should be set forth in the agencies' submission of their annual budgetary request to OMB, beginning with the FY01 budget call.    Improving and Expanding Waste Prevention and Recycling Programs     Action 1 Waste Prevention Work Group    The Task Force will convene an interagency work group to identify waste prevention practices and procedures that can be disseminated to other Federal agencies, such as expanded usage of electronic communication, electronic commerce, and double-sided copying.  The work group will also assess the need for development of waste prevention policies.    Action 2 On-site Recycling Programs, including Designation of Recycling Coordinators     While the EO recognizes that it is critical to have recycling coordinators at each Federal facility, this requirement may not be feasible for very small or remote facilities.  It is recommended that agencies explore the utilization of Regional/Geographic Recycling Coordinators to oversee and assist these very small or remote facilities.  Based on the tasks and objectives of the EO, a substantial portion of the recycling coordinator's time should be devoted to waste prevention and recycling activities.  In multi-tenant buildings, each agency must designate a recycling coordinator.  The facility recycling coordinator, while employed by the agency or primary agencies housed in the facility, will coordinate with the General Services Administration (GSA), the facility owner or manager or whomever has primary responsibility for waste removal.    In coordination with the Task Force, AEEs of major procuring agencies and heads of other agencies who have not done so, should create agency web sites and list servers to facilitate discussion and information sharing by agency recycling coordinators.    Implementation of EO 13101 will require the active participation of many  personnel from different agency management areas.  It is recommended that each agency create an agency environmental coordinating council to assist the heads of installations/bureaus with the implementation of the EO.  The agency environmental coordinating council could consist of procurement, environmental, energy, real property/engineering personnel, and recycling coordinators.    The Task Force and the Federal agencies will work to improve training courses that are available to recycling coordinators.     Action 3 Recycling in Federally Owned and Leased Buildings      The Task Force will convene an interagency work group to identify the different ways in which recycling occurs in Federally owned and leased buildings.  Opportunities to collect data on recycling in these buildings will also be examined.     Identifying Recycled Content and Environmentally Preferable Products (EPP)     Designation of Recycled Content Products     Action 1 Additions to Comprehensive Procurement Guideline (CPG)     EPA will complete the designation of recycled content products in CPG 3 and designate additional products, including products containing plastics and materials recovered from construction and demolition debris, in CPG 4.  Thereafter, EPA will designate additional recycled content products at least every other year.    EPA will maintain a list of the designated products and related technical,  performance, and source information on the CPG web pages within the EPA web site.  EPA also will periodically publish fact sheets discussing the designated products and lists of suppliers of those products.  The Task Force will provide a link to the CPG web pages from the FEE web page and the Acquisition Reform Network.     Where practicable, GSA and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) will review their current vendors and products offered in all new and proposed CPG product categories and distinguish which of these vendors and products are compliant with EPA's recommended recovered materials content standards.  All schedules and sales venues will clearly identify which product brands are compliant and which product brands are not compliant.  This review should be completed within 90 days of EPA's designation of a new CPG item.     Where practicable, all agencies establishing new electronic catalogs should incorporate mechanisms for identifying CPG items as   catalogs are developed.      Action 2 Review of CPG Designation Criteria     The buy-recycled requirement of RCRA Section 6002 applies to all Federal agencies, the Government Printing Office (GPO), state and local agencies using Federal funds, and government contractors.  Therefore, EPA has designated products such as paper that are purchased directly by Federal agencies and products such as concrete that are purchased primarily by recipients of assistance funding (e.g., Federal Highway Trust Fund monies) and their contractors.  However, only direct purchases are tracked and reported to OFPP for inclusion in the biennial report to Congress.  EPA, the Task Force and members of the Executive Order Inter-agency Advisory Group (EOIAG) will meet to discuss plans for future CPG designations and ways to foster compliance by contractors and recipients of assistance funding.     Acquisition of Environmentally Preferable Products and Services     Action 1 Purchasing Guidance     EO 13101 directs EPA to develop guidance on purchasing environmentally preferable products and services.  The Task Force will coordinate with EPA to ensure that the EPA guidance on environmentally preferable purchasing: (i) is developed and made available to agencies, (ii) applies government-wide, (iii) targets products and services that have the most effect on the environment, and (iv) describes the training necessary for each user to understand and carry out the guidance.  The guidance will be incorporated by each agency into its affirmative procurement plan.  This guidance will be updated at least every two years to reflect the experience from EPP pilots, identification of preferable items, and/or life-cycle analyses.     Action 2 Database for EPP Pilot Projects     EPA will develop and maintain a database of the EPP pilot projects; their office of origin and/or implementation (including where additional information may be found); the EPP criteria to be tested; the project schedule; and the results of the pilot project.  This database will be available to add value to any best practices guide that is developed, to allow identification of projects for other agencies to consider, and to identify new environmentally preferable products, services, or processes.  The Task Force will provide a link to the EPP pilot projects web pages from the FEE web page.     Action 3 Other Information Sources     In order to provide information to government purchasers, the Task Force will work with the Small Business Administration (SBA), GSA, DLA, and other applicable agencies to identify companies selling or providing environmentally preferable products and services.    Designation of Biobased Items     Action 1 Development of Biobased Products List     USDA's Biobased Products Coordination Council (BPCC), in consultation with EPA and the FEE, will draft a list of biobased products for promotion under the EO.  The draft list of biobased products will be coordinated through the Task Force with the EOIAG for comment.     The draft list of biobased products will be published in the Federal Register with an explanation and a request for comments from public and private sectors.  After the draft list of biobased products has been circulated for comment, the BPCC will finalize the list and publish it as a final list in the Federal Register.  This will not be published as a final USDA rule but as a working tool.  Reconsideration of the list will then occur on a biannual basis as the need arises to add to or revise the list.  The USDA Internet will be expanded to incorporate new products as they are reviewed.      Implementing Acquisition Planning and Affirmative Procurement     Acquisition Planning    Action 1 Federal Acquisition Regulation Revisions    The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) was amended (62 FR 44809, August 22, 1997) to implement the requirements of section 6002 of RCRA and the directives of EO 12873.  If necessary, Federal agencies will initiate additional revisions to the FAR and agency supplements to the FAR, as appropriate, to implement the waste prevention, recycling, and affirmative procurement directives of EO 13101.  The Task Force will coordinate and work with the FAR Council to ensure that appropriate language is developed for publication in the FAR.     Action 2 Model Language     The Task Force will convene a working group to identify points of contact for standards and specifications, provide model language on products containing recovered materials for incorporation into agency standards and specifications, and identify model contracts/specifications that have government-wide utility.  Such contracts may include such examples as a model contract for green building custodial operations or a model contract for waste collection and disposal services.  Federal  agencies are encouraged to then incorporate the model language into their standards and specifications wherever appropriate.     Action 3 Additional Procurement Tools     The Task force, in consultation with USDA, will disseminate information to the agencies regarding the price preference and set-aside tools found in 7 U.S.C. 5909 and used by USDA to develop markets for biobased products.  To the extent permitted by law and in keeping with good business practices, agencies will use these tools in acquisitions of recycled content and environmentally preferable products and services.     Action 4 Federal Agency Policy/Procedure Enhancements     The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) and the Task Force will, in coordination with agency representatives, review language in acquisition plans to identify model language valuable to all sectors of the government and identify acquisition language needed for agency implementation.  Pilot projects, best practices, EPP guidance, statutory changes, and listings of recycled content, or biobased products will be continually monitored by the Task Force to ensure that the policy and regulatory language are current and accurate.    Federal agencies will develop internal procurement and supply procedures, such as agency directives and revisions to agency contracts and grants manuals, if necessary, to provide assistance and direction in achieving the goals of EO 13101 and RCRA section 6002.     Action 5 Real Property Acquisition and Management     The Task Force will work with GSA's Public Building Service and the Federal agencies to identify tools for incorporating the EO directives into real property acquisition and management (i.e., Federal owned/leased space, government owned/contractor operated space, contractor owned/contractor operated space, tenant-maintained space, rehabilitation, renovation and maintenance, and new construction).  The Task Force will work with GSA and the agencies to provide these tools to agency real property acquisition and management programs.      Affirmative Procurement     Action 1 Revision to Affirmative Procurement Programs     In accordance with RCRA section 6002 and EO 13101, within one year after EPA designates additional recycled content products in the CPG, Federal agencies shall revise their affirmative procurement programs to incorporate the newly designated products.  Such revisions shall include amendments to applicable standards, specifications, and product solicitation documents to allow the purchase of products containing the highest levels of recovered materials practicable.     Action 2 Pilot Projects     The EPP principles and guidance developed by EPA should be tested by Federal agencies through pilot acquisitions of products or services.  Similarly, Federal agencies can use pilot acquisitions of EPA-designated recycled content products as well as recycled content products not yet designated by EPA.  Each major procuring agency should engage in a pilot project, alone or in cooperation with other agencies.  Each AEE will be asked by the Task Force to carry out one or more pilot projects illustrating the EPP requirements of the EO.  As appropriate, these pilot projects can be used to test product performance, innovative contracting strategies, or internal models to follow in meeting the agency's EPP purchasing goals. The results of these pilot projects will be used to provide practical information for further updating of the EPP guidance as directed by the EO.       It is anticipated that state and local government agencies or private sector purchasers interested in purchasing environmentally preferable products or services also will conduct pilot acquisitions.  In addition, third-party certification organizations are developing criteria for certifying products as ""environmentally preferable.""  EPA, in conjunction with the Task Force, will facilitate the coordination with state and local governments, third-party certification organizations, and private industry to test and evaluate EPP principles.     Action 3 Substitution Policies    To meet the EO 12873 directive to purchase paper containing 20% postconsumer fiber, Federal agencies successfully used a strategy of requesting that GSA substitute recycled content copier paper when orders for virgin copier paper were submitted.  Federal agencies will identify additional EPA-designated recycled content products for which substitution strategies may be appropriate and request that GSA, DLA, or their local procurement office substitute a recycled content product when a virgin product is ordered.    The Departments of Justice (DOJ) and the Interior (DOI) have requested that DLA substitute re-refined lubricating oil when orders for virgin oil are submitted by Justice or Interior fleets.  The Task Force will encourage other Federal agencies to follow the lead of DOJ and DOI in instituting re-refined oil substitution programs.    Action 4 Biobased Oils Assessment     DoD and USDA should continue to assess the viability of adding biobased lubricating oils to DoD's lubricating oil program.  After determining that biobased lubricating oils satisfy applicable commercial or military lubricating oil specifications and warranty certifications and are available, DLA should solicit for these oils in keeping with good business practices.      Action 5 Expansion of Retread Tire Program     GSA's Federal Tire Program provided specifications, qualification testing, and schedules for retread tires for trucks, buses, light trucks, and passenger vehicles.  The U.S. Army's Tank-automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM) now manages the Federal tire program and is currently offering retread tires for trucks.  The Task Force will work with TACOM to expand the scope of the retread tire program to non-tactical vehicular tires, including light truck and passenger vehicle tires.    Ensuring Federal Facility Compliance and Establishing Tracking Mechanisms     Federal Facility Compliance     Action 1 Federal Facility Compliance Inspection Guidance     In order to assure Federal facility compliance with the buy-recycled requirements of section 6002 of RCRA, EO 13101 directs EPA to prepare guidance for use by Federal inspectors in determining Federal facility compliance with section 6002.  The EO further states that EPA should encourage states that are authorized to administer the RCRA provisions to use the guidance during RCRA compliance inspections at Federal facilities.     EPA, in consultation with the FEE, will prepare guidance for use by EPA and state inspectors in determining Federal facility compliance with section 6002 of RCRA and the related requirements of EO 13101.  EPA will report the results annually to the FEE not later than February 1st for those inspections conducted during the previous fiscal year.     Action 2 Compliance Budgets     In accordance with EO 12088,  Federal Compliance with Pollution Control Standards, and EO 12856,Federal Compliance with Right-to-Know  Laws and Pollution Prevention Requirements, Federal agencies will place a high priority on obtaining and obligating funding and resources needed to implement all aspects of EO 13101.  Agencies must make funding requests through the program planning process under EO 12088 and through agency or program budget requests.     Action 3 Monitoring of Recycled Paper Purchasing Data     The Task Force will continue monitoring data received from GSA,  GPO, and the agencies regarding agency purchases of printing and writing paper containing 30% post-consumer fiber.  The Task Force will use the data to disseminate success stories and to educate agencies with unsatisfactory purchasing records about the EO recycled paper purchasing provisions.     Action 4 Re-refined Oil      In order to comply with the RCRA section 6002 and EO 13101 requirements to purchase re-refined lubricating oils, Federal agencies and their contractors with internal vehicle maintenance operations will implement policies of acquiring and using re-refined lubricating oils or DLA's re-refined oil closed-loop contracts.  Agencies that contract for vehicle maintenance will require contractors to supply re-refined lubricating oils.  Agencies that have or enter into vehicle leases, where the lease provides for vehicle maintenance, will require contractors to supply re-refined lubricating oils during vehicle maintenance.  Agencies also will educate credit card holders about the requirements to use re-refined lubricating oil.     Tracking Mechanisms     Action 1 Acquisition Tracking Mechanisms      Section 6002 of RCRA requires OFPP to report to Congress every two years on the actions taken by Federal agencies to implement the statute.  In addition, EO 13101 requires that the FEE submit biennial Greening the Government reports to the President.  To provide input to both the RCRA Report to Congress and the Greening the Government Reports, Federal agencies shall track their purchases of designated EPA guideline items and report on them.  GSA and DLA will report to the FEE and all Federal agencies annually on the purchasing of EPA-designated items through their agencies.  For any given CPG commodity, agencies will then have data on compliance for those purchases that were made through GSA and DLA.  OFPP and the FEE will issue calls for data for the previous fiscal year by December of each year.  Agencies will provide the data no later than the following April.     EO 13101 directs the establishment of a working group to develop recommendations for tracking and reporting requirements.  The primary emphasis of this working group will be to develop recommendations for establishing a cost-effective reporting system for procurement of recycled content products.     The working group will evaluate options and alternatives for retrieving data and  streamlining and simplifying reporting and tracking while at the same time meeting the requirements of the law and the EO.      The working group will attempt to reduce manual reporting.  Reporting will be automated to the extent practicable and whenever cost effective.  Existing agency systems, such as those used by the Department of Energy (DOE) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), will be closely evaluated for government-wide use.     The working group will examine the feasibility of whether information on purchases of recycled content products can be obtained from credit card reports.  Discussions will be held with OMB, GSA, and various bankcard companies to ascertain whether data on these purchases can be obtained now or in the future with some revisions.     The working group will review commercial and  state and local  reporting practices that could be emulated by the Federal government.     Action 2 Waste Diversion Measurement     The Recycling Task Force will convene a working group to investigate the feasibility of establishing a cost-effective reporting system for waste diversion (waste prevention and recycling).  The Department of Defense (DoD) automated system for waste diversion will be closely examined for possible application to other agencies.         Identifying Model Facilities     Action 1 Model Facility Demonstration Programs     The Task Force will issue a report identifying model facility programs.  Existing model facility programs at agencies like the Tennessee Valley Authority, DoD, and the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) will serve as examples and will be publicized to other agencies.     AEEs of major procuring agencies and heads of other agencies will be strongly encouraged to add model facilities as a category in internal agency award programs.    AEEs of major procuring agencies and heads of other agencies will be encouraged to increase information sharing concerning their model facility demonstration programs.  An area will be added to the FEE web site where information on model facility programs can be communicated.     The EOIAG will identify industry model facilities that can be showcased so that the Federal government can identify additional improvements or practices that could be added to their model facility programs.     Developing and Enhancing Technologies for Waste Prevention, Recycling, and Recycled Content and Environmentally Preferable Products     Action 1 Agency Programs/Centers     AEEs of major procuring agencies and heads of other agencies will identify specific assistance programs that could be targeted to develop or improve recycling technologies.  The Task Force will look into the feasibility of coordinating the various agency technology programs in respect to recycling technology and encourage the development and dissemination of new technologies through the use of:         Agency-specific Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) programs.       The National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) Advanced Technology Program.     Intra-governmental as well as public-private partnerships.       In addition, Federal agencies will access government centers (e.g., Electronic Commerce Resource Centers (ECRCs), NIST manufacturing centers, SBA centers, GSA commodity centers) for promotion of new technologies.     Action 2 Financing     Federal agencies will identify and advocate existing and new financing options, such as grants and loans, for manufacturers of recycled content and environmentally preferable products.  Such mechanisms as targeting funding within various assistance, demonstration, and research and development programs could be explored.         Developing and Promoting Outreach and Training Programs     Action 1 Agency Environmental Executives and Executive Order Inter-Agency Advisory Group     The FEE will convene the AEEs at least biannually to identify proposed improvements, enhance visibility of waste prevention, recycling, and purchasing of recycled content and environmentally preferable products and services, clarify roles and responsibilities, assess and improve accountability, assess goal progress, and share best practices.  The FEE will prepare, with the input of the AEEs, a calendar of events through which publicity can be offered to further the goals of EO 13101.     Under EO 12873, the FEE convened monthly meetings of representatives of Federal agencies, known as the Executive Order Inter-agency Advisory Group, to discuss issues and share information pertaining to implementation of the EO.  The FEE will continue to convene monthly meetings of the EOIAG to facilitate implementation of EO 13101.  One or more meetings of the EOIAG will be dedicated to sharing communications tools and strategies.  Examples of successful tools and strategies will be included in the Greening of the Government Report required by EO 13101.    Action 2 Communication Tools     The FEE web site, www.ofee.gov, will be maintained to disseminate information pertinent to implementation of EO 13101, including the Greening the Government publication, the Recycling for the Future: Consider the Benefits publication, the Recycling for the Future: It's Everybody's Business publication, Closing the Circle News, agency success stories, links to related web sites, and upcoming events.  The Task Force will provide links from the FEE web page to appropriate agency and other web sites.     The Task Force will develop articles on waste prevention, recycling, and affirmative procurement of recycled content and environmentally preferable products and services.  The Task Force also will publicize achievements and progress in recycling in five major newspapers and magazines in addition to Trade Publications by 2000.     The Task Force will request that publishers of commercial calendars mark America Recycles Day along with holidays and other special events.     The Task Force, in conjunction with an inter-agency steering committee, will continue to sponsor Federal agency sessions on waste prevention, recycling, affirmative procurement, and other EO-related topics to be presented during the annual National Recycling Congress (i.e., the NRC-FEE Confluence sessions).     The Task Force and the EOIAG will identify other appropriate conferences and seek opportunities to present sessions to target Federal audiences.  The Task Force will convene a work group on an annual basis to explore (1) an appropriate series of informational and educational sessions, in addition to the annual NRC-FEE Confluence; and (2) a theme or otherwise coordinated series of exhibition floor presentations to optimally present to Federal, state, and local governmental officials the ""state of the Order"".  These talks, speakers, booth assets, and concepts will be made available for presentation at other events.     The Task Force will sponsor a traveling exhibit on recycled content and environmentally preferable products and services and offer the exhibit to Federal agencies on a temporary basis for use at conferences to uniformly promote and advertise products and activities related to EO 13101.    The Task Force, in consultation and collaboration with Federal agencies, will conduct educational sessions on the attainment of goals, success stories, and lessons learned.  The Task Force also will publicize success stories on agencies that have aggressive goals, i.e., USPS and DoD, to other Federal agencies.  These success stories will be disseminated via the Internet, newsletters, conferences, seminars, and educational and training sessions.    The Task Force will periodically sponsor a meeting for the purpose of evaluating progress on the implementation of EO 13101 and recommending changes to this Plan.       The Task Force will work with GSA and GPO to obtain data on performance testing of paper containing 30% postconsumer fiber.  The Task Force will educate agencies about performance and availability through outreach and education programs.    In addition to DLA's current advertising processes, and through sessions developed for conferences and events promoting other aspects of EO 13101, the Task Force will, in coordination with DLA, continue to promote the availability and use of re-refined oils.       TACOM  will prepare and disseminate information on its retread tire program.  The Task Force will help TACOM to publicize its retread tire activities.  Presentations will be made by TACOM representatives at conferences, seminars, and events such as the Federal sessions during the National Recycling Congress.     EPA will post information about the EPP pilot projects and their goals, along with periodic progress updates, on the Internet to make the information available to the widest possible audience.  Presentations, project videos, or project tours, as appropriate, will be offered at conferences and events during the year in order to disseminate information about the pilots to other Federal agencies.  The Task Force will disseminate information about the pilot projects through such mechanisms as the ""Closing the Circle"" Newsletter and the Internet in order to recognize the most effective/progressive/innovative projects.     USDA will work with the Task Force to conduct workshops to educate the Federal community on the benefits of using and purchasing biobased products,  including educational sessions, conferences, seminars, and events such as the annual Federal sessions during the National Recycling Congress.    Action 3 Agency Communication Initiatives     The key to the development and subsequent implementation of improved affirmative procurement programs for recycled content and environmentally preferable products and services is through comprehensive awareness and training provided to acquisition and procurement personnel as well as program personnel.  The Federal community must be made aware that it is the responsibility of both entities to ensure the success of an affirmative procurement program.       AEEs of major procuring agencies and heads of other agencies will ensure that their agencies develop and implement internal/external communication programs to educate agency personnel and contractors about complying with EO 13101.  Agencies must use one or more of the following tools, and others, as appropriate:         Electronic broadcast messages.        Articles in agency newsletters.    Upgrade and improve agencies' main web sites to provide information and notices on waste prevention, recycling, and affirmative procurement of recycled content and environmentally preferable products and services.      Publications, speeches, commitments, and presentations in association with agency and national events such as ""America Recycles Day"" and the ""National Recycling Challenge.""     Educational and outreach sessions at conferences and seminars, such as the annual NRC-FEE Confluence sessions, the annual DoD and DOE Pollution Prevention (P2) conferences, and the Department of Veterans Affairs Acquisition conference.  The topics will include the environmental and economic benefits of waste prevention, recycling, and affirmative procurement of recycled content and environmentally preferable products and services.      Best Practices Guides.       Action 4  Training     Acquisition, procurement, supply, and program personnel receive training from various sources, specifically, the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI), the Defense Acquisition University (DAU), and in general, through agency provided training programs.  The Task Force will work with FAI and DAU to develop or modify courses to reflect EO 13101 and other environmentally-related EO directives.  The Task Force will:          Develop curriculum required to satisfy Section 801 of EO 13101.   Review, analyze, and evaluate the existing training courses and materials from each training facility.  Emphasis shall be placed on those courses deemed appropriate for immediate modification in order to satisfy the requirements of the curriculum developed.    Identify courses for modification.     Evaluate course content as it relates to the established curriculum.         Submit recommendations for curriculum changes.       The Task Force, when invited, will train contracting officers in the DoD Contracting 301 Course starting in January 1999.     Each agency will use training to educate the relevant program and acquisition personnel such as credit card holders about the requirements  of EO 13101 and section 6002 of RCRA.  Training can consist of agency-sponsored workshops, electronic training, manuals, contracting officer warrant maintenance programs, or training offered by FAI, DAU, or other organizations.    The Task Force will coordinate with the FAI and the DAU to incorporate the buy-recycled requirements and the EPP guidance into the training plans for buyers, supply/logistics personnel, and program managers responsible for activities which use or incorporate EPA-designated recycled content products and services and products and services targeted by the EPP guidance.  The training will include use of EPA's recycled content product procurement guidelines, EPA's EPP guidance, and acquisition of products and services labeled by self-certification or third-party certification organizations as environmentally preferable products or services.     The Task Force, in consultation and collaboration with Federal agencies, will prepare training materials for credit card holders concerning the requirements of EO 13101 and section 6002 of RCRA.  The Task Force will publicize success stories and lessons learned associated with credit card holders and their purchases of recycled and environmentally preferable products and services.       Additionally, the Task Force will work with GSA and TACOM to develop for agency fleet managers detailed guidance on the acceptability and availability of re-refined oils, biobased oils, and retread tires.  Presentations will be made at conferences, seminars, and meetings aimed at fleet managers such as GSA's Fedfleet and events such as the Federal sessions during the NRC-FEE Confluence, the DOE and DoD P2 conferences, and meetings of the National Defense Industries Association.     Action 5  Summits     Under EO 12873, the FEE sponsored recycled paper summits to disseminate information about the performance, price, and availability of copier paper containing 20% postconsumer fiber.  The FEE also sponsored a re-refined lubricating oils summit, which helped to dispel myths about re-refined oil performance, including the belief that use of re-refined oil would void engine warranties.  The summits resulted in Federal agency usage of tools, such as substitution policies, that greatly increase compliance with EO 12873.  The Task Force will identify the need for additional paper summits to address specific issues associated with the EO 13101 directive to purchase paper containing 30% postconsumer fiber (i.e., progress in production and sales or declines in sales).  The Task Force, in consultation with the EOIAG, will identify additional recycled content or environmentally preferable product areas for which summits will be useful in providing performance, availability, and other pertinent information.     Action 6 Partnering      The Task Force will partner with industry and non-governmental organizations to identify and examine additional way to achieve the goals of EO 13101.           Establishing Goals for Waste Prevention, Recycling, and Affirmative Procurement     Action 1 Agency Goals     Federal agencies will establish specific goals for (1) waste prevention and recycling or solid waste diversion, (2) affirmative procurement of products that are made with recovered materials, and (3) procurement of environmentally preferable products and services for which a pilot project has been successfully completed.  On an annual basis,  agencies will evaluate their progress toward attaining these goals.       Progress on attaining goals will be reported by the Federal agencies to the FEE  for incorporation into the Greening of the Government Report required by EO 13101.     The Task Force will publicize agency goals and progress.  Agency goals should be incorporated into each agency's strategic plan.     Action 2 Government Performance and Results Act Goals     Federal agencies are strongly encouraged to incorporate these goals into their Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) plans.  The Task Force will develop model language on GPRA goals that will be disseminated to the Federal agencies to use as deemed appropriate.      Sponsoring Awards Programs     Action 1 Agency Awards Programs     Federal agencies will have internal awards programs as appropriate to reward/recognize progress in implementing the provisions of EO 13101.     Federal agencies will publicize examples of established agency award programs.     Action 2 White House Closing the Circle Awards     The Task Force will maintain the White House Closing the Circle Awards Program established under EO 12873.  The Program was developed to recognize federal employees and their facilities for efforts which resulted in significant contributions to, or have made a significant impact on, the environment in specific categories.  The categories are: waste prevention, environmental preferability, recycling, model facility demonstrations, affirmative procurement, and sowing the seeds for change.  The Task Force is assessing the expansion of an additional category to address outreach programs/activities by Federal facilities (i.e., Earth Day, America Recycles Day).  The White House Closing the Circle Awards Program also recognizes individual awards for outstanding recycling practices under EO 12856, Federal Compliance with Right-to-Know Laws and Pollution Prevention Requirements.      Action 3 Other Awards/Recognition     As appropriate, the FEE will recognize individuals or organizations that contribute to achieving the goals of EO 13101.       V. Stakeholders     For the purposes of the Strategic Plan, stakeholders are those individuals or groups interested or who should be interested in the issues of waste prevention, recycling, and Federal acquisition of recycled content products and services and environmentally preferable products and services.  Stakeholders include:  Federal agencies, including relevant supporting contractors; state and local governments; Congress; the public; environmental non-governmental organizations; manufacturers and vendors; farmers and ranchers; and the recovered materials collection, processing, and manufacturing industries.      Federal agencies, including support contractors, are responsible for complying with the EO.  This Administration has committed to lead by example in maximizing waste reduction, improving recycling practices, and increasing the procurement of recycled content and environmentally preferable products and services.    State and local governments are faced with many of the same opportunities and challenges that the Federal government encounters in the areas of waste prevention, recycling, and acquisition of recycled content and environmentally preferable products and services.  State and local governments are looking for strong and pro-active Federal leadership and outreach in these areas.  In addition, state and local government agencies that receive appropriated Federal funds and use those funds to purchase EPA-designated recycled content products, are required by RCRA section 6002 to purchase recycled content products.     The Congress authorizes and appropriates funds, and provides oversight for Federal programs.  The Congress also is responsible for authoring and approving RCRA, the legislation which establishes the framework for the Federal buy-recycled program.      The public is the ultimate beneficiary of EO 13101.  The EO outlines ways in which Federal agencies will take important steps to protect the environment through the purchase of recycled content and other green products and services and prevent pollution.  These activities develop and stimulate markets thus creating jobs and providing a positive impact on local and regional economies.     Environmental non-governmental organizations are affected because their objectives are furthered by the work performed in the areas of waste prevention, recycling, and acquisition of recycled content and environmentally preferable products and services.       Manufacturers and vendors of recycled content and environmentally preferable products, including Federal service contractors, will see a positive effect in the marketplace through the creation of new manufacturing jobs, increased opportunities, and expanded competition.     Farmers and ranchers who provide the raw material for biobased industrial products are stakeholders. Creating new markets for industrial (non-food, non-feed) uses of agricultural raw materials has the desired effect of stabilizing sometimes volatile commodity prices.  By adding new industrial crops to the raw materials mix, new business opportunities for farmers and ranchers are also created well beyond the cultivation of conventional crops.     The recovered materials collection, processing, and manufacturing industries, including municipalities, waste haulers, processors, and brokers are affected because more value is added to the commodities they collect.  Higher value for recovered materials will ultimately creates profitable recycling programs.  Consequently, to generate more revenue, there is an impetus to further expand the recycling infrastructure and increase collection efforts to recover more materials.       There is a need to initiate and cultivate strong relationships with stakeholders to facilitate and maximize the implementation of the EO through the Strategic Plan and achieve the goals associated with waste prevention, recycling, and  acquisition of recycled content and environmentally preferable products and services, including biobased products.       VI. Performance Measures    Performance measures assess the progress made toward achieving established goals. These outcome-based performance measures are to be achieved over roughly a five year period.  The following performance measures specifically and quantitatively define the level of performance to be achieved in accomplishing the strategies and actions discussed in this  Strategic Plan to implement EO 13101.  Since many of the performance measures reflect several strategies and actions, there is no one-to-one correlation.          In accordance with the EPA National Goal, the National Recycling Goal for the federal government is 35% waste diversion by 2005 by increased recycling and waste prevention efforts.  All Federal  agencies are expected to advance the attainment of this national goal with their respective waste diversion rates.       A.  All Federal agencies are expected to demonstrate significant increases in procurement of recycled content products from each preceding year through 2005.     B. By the end of FY99, all Federal agencies will revise their agency  policies and procedures to require, during acquisition planning, consideration of waste prevention; reuse; recycling; and the use of recycled content and environmentally preferable products including biobased products.  In addition, agencies will have six months to implement changes to their acquisition supplements pursuant to the government-wide final FAR revisions.     C. All Federal agencies will establish and meet agency goals for affirmative procurement of recycled content products, including the following measures:       Paper (EO 13101, section 505)      100% procurement of printing and writing paper products containing the required postconsumer content levels beginning January 1, 1999.       Procurement Guideline Items (40 CFR part 247 and EO 13101, sections 402 and 507)      Demonstrate full compliance with procurement of products meeting EPA's recovered materials content recommendations by the end of FY99, considering product performance, price, and availability.     D. By the end of FY99, all Federal agencies will implement recycling programs at all Federal facilities.  This will include programs to recycle, reuse, or refurbish pallets; collect toner cartridges for manufacturing; and reduce or recycle, as appropriate, batteries, scrap metal, and fluorescent lamps and ballasts.  By the end of FY99, each Federal facility shall consider and implement five agency-wide waste prevention strategies, including two-sided copying and increased usage of electronic messaging.     E. By the end of FY99, all Federal agencies will have developed an awards program as appropriate to recognize its most innovative waste prevention, recycling, and affirmative procurement efforts.     F. Within 90 days after EPA issues the final guidance on environmentally preferable products and services, all Federal agencies should begin implementation of environmentally preferable products pilot projects.     G. By the end of FY99, all Federal agencies will contribute to three Greening the Government outreach programs, such as America Recycles Day and the NRC-FEE Confluence, that include the private sector, states, and local governments.     H. By the end of FY99, all Federal agencies will have revised their internal environmental compliance assessment programs to include RCRA 6002 compliance review protocols.    I. The Task Force, in consultation with all Federal agencies, will define the requirements for a cost-effective reporting system for procurement of recycled content products by the end of FY00; make recommendations for a cost-effective reporting system for waste diversion or waste prevention and recycling by the end of FY01; and examine the feasibility of reporting on procurement of biobased products.     J. The Task Force, in consultation with all Federal agencies, will produce a Biennial Greening the Government Report in 2000, including data from all major procuring agencies and information from other applicable EOs.     K. The Task Force, in consultation with all Federal agencies, will publish a report identifying the model facility demonstration programs at each agency by the end of FY00.     L. The Task Force, in consultation with all Federal agencies, will coordinate the research and development of 25 new or modified environmentally significant technologies to reduce waste, allow reuse of products, facilitate materials collection and processing, and facilitate the manufacture of products using recovered materials.     M. The Task Force and all Federal agencies will identify  appropriate training courses to include EO 13101 requirements by the end of FY99.  Modifications shall be completed by the end of FY00.     N. By the end of FY00, the Task Force and all Federal agencies will have begun to train procurement officials, credit card holders, program management, facility/maintenance, and supply/logistics personnel and requesting activities, as needed with regard to the requirements of EO 13101 and related agency policies and revisions to the FAR.     O. USDA, in consultation with the FEE and EPA, will publish a Biobased Products List by the end of the second quarter of FY99, produce semi-annual updates to the Biobased Products List, and maintain a website to provide immediate updates on new products.    P. In the first half of FY99, EPA, in consultation with the FEE, will publish guidance on acquisition of environmentally preferable products and services.    Q. In FY99, EPA, in consultation with the FEE, will develop Federal Facility guidance on RCRA inspections and compliance with RCRA Section 6002.  EPA will include RCRA section 6002 requirements in all RCRA multimedia inspections conducted at Federal facilities.     R. In FY99, EPA, in consultation with the FEE, will begin assisting agencies to design, implement, and document pilot acquisitions of environmentally preferable products and services.     S. By the end of FY99, EPA will designate additional recycled content products and, thereafter, additional products as appropriate.     T. On an annual basis or other appropriate time frame, agencies that manage specifications shall revise 35% of their specifications for  EPA designated items to reflect RCRA Section 6002 and EO 13101. requirements.     Performance measures generate data for program assessment and evaluation.  These measures will be analyzed, evaluated, and incorporated into the biennial Greening the Government Report to the President and the RCRA Report to Congress.       VII.

The high cost and dangers to those exposed have prompted widespread public concern about mercury. As these stories became more widely known, the incidents prompted the Michigan Legislators to take action.         According to   Public Act 376  of 2000 (Enrolled  Senate Bill #1262 ), Michigan schools must phase out mercury use in the classroom and in the health (nurse’s) office.    This law applies to liquid (free flowing) elemental mercury, as well as, mercury-containing instruments such as thermometers, barometers, manometers, and sphygmomanometers (blood pressure gauges). Schools have until 2004 to complete this process. The step-by-step  Mercury Elimination Guidelines for Michigan Schools   (pdf file)   has helpful information for completing this process.         Other mercury uses potentially found in the building such as in thermostats, light switches, relays or fluorescent lights, are  not  impacted by this legislation.

GX230-19-6058008	Completed Pollution Prevention Project Case Study United States Department of Energy Vacuum Pump Recycling Office of Environmental Management Fact Sheet Los Alamos National Laboratory  Original Problem Old vacuum pumps and other unusable metal equipment items were being stored in various locations at LANSCE. The items were taking up valuable space, but disposing of all the equipment as suspect low level or mixed low level waste was going to be very expensive.  The Project Solution An intensive recycling effort was undertaken. Over 100 vacuum pumps were collected from TA-53, and all of the usable pumps and parts were salvaged. All oil, liquids, and RCRA components, such as mercury switches, were removed from the pumps. Then the pumps were sent to the GTS Duratek metal melt facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee where they could be melted and formed into shielding blocks for use by DOE facilities. The success of the vacuum pump recycling prompted LANSCE to recycle other unusable metal-containing items as well.  Value of Improvement Lots of old vacuum pumps and other metal items were removed from TA-53. Recycling some of the equipment instead of treating all of it as suspect low level or mixed low level waste saved about $265,000 and 865 cubic feet of low level waste landfill space at TA-54.  DOE Monetary Benefits Total Project Cost Lifecycle Savings Return on Investment  NA $265,000 NA  Benefits At-A-Glance    Usable vacuum pumps and parts were identified and salvaged, and TA-53 storage areas were cleaned. Removing RCRA components from the metal equipment allowed the metal to be recycled into shielding blocks.

GX245-98-9890213	"Site Navigation              Testimony of James M. Seif    Secretary of the    Department of Environmental Protection    before the    Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Hearing   May 2, 2000              Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am Jim Seif, Secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.  Pennsylvania is pleased to appear before you today to discuss some of the innovative environmental programs that we and other states have developed.      When he took office, Governor Tom Ridge committed to make Pennsylvania a leader among states and a competitor among nations.  He has pursued that commitment by cutting taxes, promoting exports, and making Pennsylvania a ""high-tech"" state through the introduction of new electronic commerce and electronic government tools.  Another important part of the Governor’s plan was restoring and protecting Pennsylvania’s environment by cleaning up old industrial sites – ""brownfields"" – and returning them to productive use.    Complicated federal remedies of the late 1970’s and 80’s such as RCRA and Superfund have, at best, a mixed record in addressing the legacy of old industrial sites left from years of being the world’s industrial leader.  The unworkable liability scheme of Superfund often produced litigation instead of cleanups.  Requirements that contaminated sites be returned to pristine condition – a standard that was financially and sometimes technologically prohibitive – left once-productive sites in many communities permanently off the tax roles and off-limits to renewal and reuse.    Governor Ridge, and the leaders of the Pennsylvania General Assembly, recognized that we needed a different approach to cleaning up contaminated sites.  The passage of Acts 2, 3 and 4, the three acts establishing Pennsylvania’s Land Recycling Program, provided the environmental platform to allow us to tear down the fences around these sites, to begin to restore our communities, and to turn our manufacturing heritage back into an asset.    Pennsylvania on May 2, 2000 is a much different place than it was five years ago on May 19, 1995, the day that Governor Ridge signed the Land Recycling Program into law.  Had you been with us that rainy day in Western Pennsylvania at the site of the former U. S. Steel National Tube Works, you would have seen an environmental scene that could have been in Anytown, U.S.A. -- a rusted hulk that resulted from the battles and success of our first industrial revolution.   The Lands Recycling Program is an innovative solution that evolved from concept to reality so successfully that Governor Ridge has described the program as ""simply a case of government making sense.""   This common sense approach provides a statutory liability release, standardized procedures, realistic goals, cleanup options and funding assistance.  These features destroyed the barriers that stood in the way of the federal and early state remediation programs.    Don’t think that the Land Recycling Program uses lax environmental standards.  On the contrary, the program used sound science to establish cleanup standards that protect public health and the environment.  The difference is that these standards are realistic enough to promote the reuse of contaminated sites.    The program’s four cornerstones – uniform cleanup standards, standardized review procedures, release from liability, and financial assistance – all address crucial business issues.    Uniform standards, under four cleanup options, give communities the flexibility they need to attack this nationwide problem.  Total costs and project time are also easier to establish.  Agreements to protect buyers’ rights and the financial viability of owners of multiple contaminated sites are available to business.    Standardized review procedures provide a uniform statewide process for cleanups.  A technical guidance manual was published, in plain language, to help people use the program.  The program imposed review time limits and guarantees a reply to applications within 60 days.    Releases from liability take the risk out of remediation.  Anyone who cleans up a site to the new standards is released from any additional cleanup of the old contamination.  This liability travels with the property and can extend to financial institutions, economic development agencies, and local authorities.  It essentially puts the site back into the stream of commerce.    While the program has attracted millions of dollars of private sector investment in cleanup, funding assistance is also available to help reach sites that might not otherwise get addressed.  The Industrial Sites Cleanup Fund, initially stocked with $15 million, makes grants and low-interest loans available to cover up to 75 percent of the cost of site assessment and remediation.  Pennsylvania’s Department of Community and Economic Development has already provided in excess of 20 million dollars in grants and loans to assist land recyclers.    The results speak for themselves.  Since the inception of our Land Recycling Program, more than 700 sites have been remediated and hundreds more are in various stages of cleanup – compared to Superfund, in which only 16 of 112 sites on Pennsylvania’s NPL have been delisted.  Many of these brownfields properties are now back on the tax roles, and more than 17,000 people now have jobs on these redevelopment sites.      As David Gergen from U.S. News and World Report has pointed out, ""These results are impressive.  Pennsylvania has created strong incentives for businesses to clean up and revitalize abandoned urban sites, while preserving farms and undeveloped land in the process.""    Our program is not only producing environmental protection and economic development gains at individuals sites, but also is an effective strategy to accomplish broader policy goals such as reversing urban blight and developing a sustainable future.  Working with redevelopment authorities, local government, lending institutions and the private sector, we are creating jobs, increasing tax revenues, improving transportation infrastructure, revitalizing urban areas, and preserving open space.    Let me go beyond basic statistics though, to give you a flavor of how Pennsylvania’s brownfields program has affected and influenced ""real people.""       A particularly noteworthy Land Recycling Project is the site of Bethlehem Steel Corporation’s original steel-making facility in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.  This represents the largest brownfield project currently being undertaken in the nation (nearly 2000 acres).  This site, which once supported heavy industrial processes, is being converted into a recreational, educational, cultural and entertainment center of regional, if not statewide, significance.  The Smithsonian Institution will occupy a key location there to house and display artifacts of our nation’s industrial heritage.         Several other examples include a large industrial complex, the Transit America facility, in North Philadelphia that is being remediated and returned to open space use as an 18 hole public golf course.  In West Chester, a turn of the century Laundromat has been converted into a fitness center.  And in Mckeesport, in the Mon Valley, a steel mill site has been converted into the eastern headquarters of Echostar Corporation and will house more than 2000 customer service representatives.         Our partners in redeveloping these sites have been most generous in their praise.  A few quotes illustrate how successful the program has been.  Michael Theisen of Woodmont Corporation, which turned an auto wrecking yard into a shopping center pointed out, ""It would have been impossible to acquire tenants or the financing needed to make such a center feasible, particularly one located downstream from a Superfund site, without the support and assurances provided [by the Land Recycling Program].  Perhaps the success of our program is most easily summed up by Lou Marseglia of Grundy Recreation who said ""If it wasn’t’ for the [Land Recycling Program], we couldn’t have built it"" in reference to the recreation center built on the site of a former carpet mill.         Further, our program has been recognized as an ""Innovations in American Government Award Winner"" and a 1997 ""Ford Foundation Award Winner.""         People in other nations have noted our success and looked at us as a model for programs of their own.  The Scottish Environmental Industries Association invited us to share our experience at the Contaminated Lands Forum in Scotland.  We have also gotten inquires from Brazil and Eastern Europe on our program.         The flexibility offered by Pennsylvania’s Land Recycling Program has allowed us to be innovative in our approaches to cleaning up sites.  We have entered into a multi-site agreement with the U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy and Defense Logistics Agency to facilitate the cleanup of all sites used previously for military purposes and to prepare them for reuse a decade earlier than originally scheduled.  This was a landmark agreement that will have tremendous economic development benefits for the Commonwealth and has formalized a plan of action for resolving federal liabilities at 1,260 sites in 26 counties.  This agreement was only possible because of the flexibility afforded by the state laws establishing the Land Recycling Program and clearly can be a model for other States to follow.    As often happens, one successful innovation points the way to others.  To raise awareness of the availability of sites for redevelopment, DEP created the Brownfields Inventory Grant (BIG) Program, which provides grants to local governments, economic development agencies and other qualifying agencies to inventory the brownfields properties in their area.  Sites that are identified are added to the Pennsylvania Brownfields Directory on our Department’s website, so that parties interested in developing sites will know that they are available.  This database currently lists over 130 sites.    As a further inducement for the revitalization of communities, Governor Ridge signed legislation creating Keystone Opportunity Zones, in which tax abatement is offered to businesses locating in economically depressed areas.      The unrealistic standards and open-ended liability of Superfund have often been strong deterrents to the use of new technologies at environmental cleanups.  The cleanup options available to voluntary parties under our program are more conducive to the use of new technologies.  Promoting the use of new technologies is another state success story that is shared by many states.  States are working together to improve state permitting processes and to speed deployment of technologies by using the Interstate Technology and Regulatory Cooperation Work Group, or ITRC, which is an organization affiliated with ECOS.  The ITRC is a state-led, national coalition of regulators working with industry and stakeholders to improve state permitting processes and to speed deployment of technologies through interstate and regulatory collaboration.     Currently, 31 states actively participate in ITRC activities and additional states are indirectly involved through participation in training events and technical work team activities. Other participants include the Departments of Energy and Defense, and the Environmental Protection Agency.  The ITRC can document success stories in all 50 states, through the use of ITRC products or examples of institutional change.     These innovations, taken together, have made the efficient re-use of industrial land far more attractive in Pennsylvania, and have reduced the pressure on undeveloped ""Greenfield"" areas.    We believe that we have gotten the fundamentals right.  Now it is time to make it even easier for these sites to be cleaned up and returned to productive use.  The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection in collaboration with a number of other state agencies has launched additional new initiatives to do just that.       Financial Resources for the Environment is one of two initiatives of its kind in the nation in which public sector entities are working together with lenders, utilities and corporations to develop a financing vehicle to provide funding for brownfields redevelopment.  In many cases private financing for brownfields projects is difficult to obtain.  This project will fill in that gap and promote more redevelopment without the necessity for increased public funding.         We are developing a request for proposals to offer a Commonwealth-wide insurance policy that can protect owners and developers from the uncertain liabilities associated with conducting cleanups.  By purchasing coverage under this – umbrella policy -- owners and developers will receive coverage more affordably than seeking it alone and can even be insured against actions taken by our Department.  This will provide even more confidence for individuals seeking to sell and buy brownfield sites.      Many other states have also attacked the problem of brownfields with innovative programs of their own.  At least 35 states have voluntary cleanup programs, and, while many share common elements, each is tailored to the particular needs of the state.  Thousands of sites around the country have been cleaned up under these programs.    In short, Pennsylvania and the other states have figured it out.  Brownfield redevelopment is becoming a common and natural aspect of real estate development and sound land use planning in our Commonwealth and across the nation.  There are some legislative steps that can be taken to accelerate the pace at which these programs can restore our environment and revitalize our communities.    I encourage the Senate to consider passing brownfield legislation based upon the model developed and supported by many states.  The key elements of such legislation are: (1) a release of federal liability at state land recycling sites, (2) a waiver of federal permitting requirements at state land recycling sites, and (3) Governors concurrence on proposed NPL listings.   A federal release of liability will heighten developer confidence that EPA will not take judicial or administrative action should EPA decide to second-guess a state’s decision regarding a clean up.  Second, there needs to be a waiver of federal permitting requirements at land recycling sites being addressed under a state voluntary cleanup program.  In Pennsylvania, our General Assembly gave DEP the authority to waive state permits at sites being handled by our land recycling program, but only Congress can waive the requirement to obtain federal permits.  These are the same permitting requirements that EPA has the authority to waive at sites in the Superfund program.  In asking for this waiver, be assured that discharges to the air and water are fully regulated by our state regulatory programs, and persons cleaning up sites in our state system have to meet all of our applicable emission and discharge limitations, both during cleanup an thereafter.  In addition, Congress should reinstate the opportunity for Governors to concur on proposed Superfund listings.  Governors can best decide whether sites have the potential to be redeveloped and, therefore, moved through a state land-recycling program as opposed to being relegated to the NPL.   We are very proud of what we have achieved in Pennsylvania.  Our Land Recycling Program has preserved open space, revitalized town and urban centers and made people feel better about their communities and the government’s role in them.  We believe our Program can serve as a national model and I thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today.   Thank you.                    Site Navigation"
GX245-96-4758969	"Site Navigation               Is Pennsylvania's Recycling Program in Danger?     By     Sandra L. Strauss   Executive Director  Public Recycling Officials of Pennsylvania     James M. Seif   Secretary  Department of Environmental Protection    Pennsylvania's Recycling Program has been an overwhelming success.   Over 9 million people participate in curbside and drop-off recycling programs in 1,355 communities, the largest recycling program in the nation.   We now recycle over 20 percent of our municipal waste -- more than 2 million tons a year. We recycled just 2 percent of our waste in 1988 when the program was created.   Ninety-eight percent of local recycling programs collect  more  than the minimum three materials required and many collect all eight materials named in our state recycling laws, plus leaf waste. More than half of the 1,355 communities with recycling succeed as voluntary, not mandatory, programs.   Fourteen of our 67 counties now recycle more than 25 percent of their municipal waste. All counties have plans to assure long-term disposal capacity for municipal waste generated within their borders and update them regularly.   Eighty-five Pennsylvania companies now manufacture products with recycled content making up 4 percent of all manufacturing jobs in the Commonwealth.   More than $32.5 million in grants and low-interest loans went to support companies and local government efforts to expand recycling markets and create economic opportunity.   The recycling program has provided over $183 million in grants to support county and local waste planning and recycling efforts since 1988.   Because of the program, businesses, individuals and government have changed their buying habits to buy products with recycled content. State government alone spent more than $84 million in 1995 to buy recycled content products.   With all these programs and activities, Pennsylvania is closing the recycling loop of -- (1) collecting materials, (2) processing them, and (3) creating new products.   So why would a program with this kind of success be in trouble?   The fee used to support recycling is due to expire.   Pennsylvania's Recycling Program is supported by a $2 per ton Recycling Fee on every ton of municipal waste disposed in the state.   In 1988 when the Recycling Program was created, the General Assembly inserted an automatic provision in the law that had the Recycling Fee expire after ten years. It also requires DEP to recommend whether the fee should be extended the year before it is set to expire.    -- more --    DEP has made an unqualified recommendation that the General Assembly permanently extend the Recycling Fee so the Recycling Program's success can continue.   Extension of the fee is supported by a cross-section of public and private groups.   Last year a stakeholders group on recycling and municipal waste made up of representatives of local governments, counties, environmental groups and the waste industry called the program ""fundamentally sound"" and overwhelmingly recommended the Recycling Fee be renewed.   They even recommended the Recycling Fee be extended to include commercial, construction and other wastes.   The Public Recycling Officials of Pennsylvania were proud to be part of this process and support these recommendations.   It is also important for you to know Pennsylvania receives no money from EPA or the federal government to support this program. This is truly a unique state initiative.   You should also know that based on current waste generation levels, this amounts to less than $2 per person per year.   In 1988, most recycling was ""catch as catch can"" at drop off centers staffed by Saturday morning volunteers.   Now, thanks to Pennsylvania's Recycling Program, the fundamental behavior of millions of Pennsylvanians has changed to benefit the environment and recycling businesses have become significant job generators.   Local recycling programs have enjoyed broad public support and have grown steadily since 1988.   We are encouraging the General Assembly to act this year to extend the Recycling Fee so local governments, counties and companies involved in recycling can be assured the program will continue.   We hope you will join us in expressing your support for the extension of the Recycling Fee.

We have done this for basic economics, as well          as environmental reasons. Just recently we have started to capture the          true results of our efforts. When we constructed the Boeing Headquarters,          we diligently tracked our recycling efforts. We recycled nearly 6,560          tons of clearing debris, concrete, asphalt, wood, metal, aluminum, cardboard          and paper. Not only did we save hundreds of thousands of dollars in dump          fees; we reduced the waste stream from our project by 97%.          Next time you see our ""We Reduce,          Reuse and Recycle"" project signs remember the magnitude we're talking          about - 97%.            Baugh          Construction recycled a very respectable 97% of its materials in its Boeing          Commercial Airplane Group Headquarters building project. Getting to the          high recycling rate took planning from beginning to end, and their success          is testament that hard work pays off. Baugh's commitment to waste prevention          and recycling is built into its business: a recycling plan defines goals,          objectives, and the company's commitment. Frequent meetings keep all on-site          personnel current with the plan and its practices. Sub-contractors stay          in the loop through meetings and the establishment of on-site standards.                   Recycling Baugh showed its          recycling savvy while building the Boeing Commerical Airplane Group Headquarters,          a new office building in Renton. Following its plan, the builder achieved          an amazing 97 % recycling rate. Baugh Construction recycled wood, drywall,          concrete, asphalt, metals, cardboard, and landclearing debris. They recycled          on-site concrete and asphalt, breaking it down for roadbeds and building          pads. The 1-1/8th form plywood from a previous project got new life at          Boeing, and all wood from the site-clearing operation was chipped and          used in non-structural applications.          Recycled Products For Baugh          Construction, full-scale recycling means giving materials a round-trip          ticket. Baugh used many innovative recycled-content materials at the Boeing          site: the receptionist's counter-top is recycled newsprint, remanufactured          scrap steel supports the structure; and the parking lot curbs and landscaping          headers are recycled plastic.

The U.S. panicked and, in response, the National Defense Education Act of 1960 granted billions of dollars to schools for science education. High school chemistry teachers purchased equipment and laboratory chemicals to prepare American students for the space race. Many of these chemicals are still sitting on the shelves of secondary schools. This is a problem because a) Many chemicals and their containers degrade over time, and b) Many of these chemicals - degraded or not - pose risks to teachers, students and the environment.        Starting in 1998, a Hazardous Waste program called ""Rehab the Lab"" began dealing with this quietly mounting problem by conducting 577 site visits to 297 King County schools. Of the 8,625 pounds of high-risk chemicals found, 7,150 pounds (83 percent) were shipped for disposal, including 600 pounds of mercury compounds. Overall, Rehab the Lab arranged for disposal of 35.5 tons of hazardous chemicals. Over 200 teachers attended 11 Rehab the Lab workshops.        Rehab the Lab helps schools deal with chemicals        Rehab the Lab is a project funded through the Local Hazardous Waste Management Program at King County to improve management of chemicals in King County schools. Rehab the Lab grew out of a local high school's 1998 request for help in managing their old chemicals. Among the chemicals found at the school was an unlabeled cylinder later found to contain poisonous chlorine gas. The school agreed that many of their hazardous chemicals needed disposal, but it lacked the funds to pay the high disposal costs.        Since then, staff have met with science teachers and inspected secondary schools around the County. In addition to eliminating the chemical stockpiles to protect kids, teachers and the environment, Rehab the Lab seeks to reduce the generation of chemical waste and to improve long-term chemical management.  The project is geared to involve the entire school, not just the science labs.        Project nuts and bolts        Trained hazardous waste investigators conducted on-site audits of science lab stockrooms to help teachers identify hazardous compounds and insure they were marked for disposal. King County covered all disposal costs. But every school was required to sign a pollution prevention pledge committing them to proper disposal of hazardous waste and safe storage of hazardous chemicals.  Waste disposal costs for old chemicals were available only after the pledge was signed.         Chemicals found in schools        During site visits, investigators found that schools commonly - and improperly - disposed of hazardous wastes down the drain or in the trash. Storage of incompatible hazardous chemicals side by side was also common. Large numbers of chemical containers, often over 2,000 per school lab (and in poor condition), were found at the schools.        Potentially unstable, highly reactive chemicals were found at 44 schools. These ultimately required stabilization by chemical explosive specialists. Investigators found 8,625 pounds of high-risk compounds, including 690 pounds of toxic mercury and mercury compounds, as well as explosives, carcinogens and poisonous gases. Teachers were often unaware of the hazards posed by these nearby chemicals, many of which were older than they were. Many containers were mislabeled. One, for example, labeled ""Sugar"", actually contained water-reactive metallic sodium. When the science teacher chose to rinse it out with water, the bottle exploded, injuring the teacher and releasing corrosive fumes.        Rehab the Lab has served as a catalyst for several other states to begin focusing on one of Sputnik's most lasting, and in many cases, dangerous legacies. As a result of its efforts, Rehab the Lab won the 2001 Governor's Award for Pollution Prevention and Sustainable Practices.        King County Rehab the Lab staff is available to answer chemical management questions from schools.

Fifth Ave.  Ann Arbor, MI 48107  (313) 994-6581     In fiscal year 1996, Ann Arbor (pop. 112,000) achieved a 52% recovery rate of residential waste through curbside recycling, yard trimmings collection and composting, and the state's bottle return law. Recycle Ann Arbor (RAA), a non-profit organization, runs the city's recycling program. City crews provide yard trimmings collection and composting services. RAA picks up 23 different recyclable materials weekly on the same day the city collects trash. RAA also runs a drop-off station. City crews collect curbside grass, leaves and brush, which have been banned from the landfill, April 1 through November as well as collecting Christmas trees in January. The city-owned compost site generates $40,000 per year from the sale of compost and mulch. Closing the loop, the Ann Arbor has adopted policies to encourage the use and purchase of recycled content products.

The following year the city restructured trash fees to provide an incentive to lower disposal levels. Residents have responded to the incentive programs so that in 1996, 62% of served households subscribed to trash service of one 30-gallon can or less of trash per week. Bellevue residents recovered 60% of their discards through recycling and composting in 1996 (26% through recycling and 34% through composting). A contractor provides trash, recycling, and composting services. Residents receive weekly curbside collection of recyclable materials and year-round collection of yard debris.         BERGEN COUNTY, NEW JERSEY  Contact: Nina Herman Seiden  Recycling Program Manager  Bergen County Utilities Authority  Department of Solid Waste Planning and Development  P.O.

The area is largely suburban and home to many individuals who commute to New York City. Each community in Bergen County administers its own waste management program. The Bergen County Utilities Authority provides technical assistance, educational programs, financial assistance, and promotional materials to support the communities with their efforts. Areas of assistance include backyard composting, vermicomposting, waste reduction, household hazardous waste collection, marketing assistance, and business waste audits. Bergen County's reported municipal solid waste recycling/composting rate for 1995, the most recent year for which data are available, was 62%.         BLUEWATER RECYCLING ASSOCIATION, ONTARIO  Contact: Francis Veilleux, Director  Bluewater Recycling Association  P.O. Box 547  Huron Park, Ontario N0M 1Y0  (519) 228-6678     The Bluewater Recycling Association is a non-profit organization serving more than 125,000 people in some 60 municipalities in Southwestern Ontario. The Association offers several services to its members including an expanded blue box curbside recycling program, backyard composter sales and troubleshooting support, educational curriculum, household hazardous waste days, promotional materials, processing at its 43,000 square feet Material Recovery Facility, and the latest co-collection program serving 19 communities. The co-collection program utilizes a three compartment vehicle designed by the Association where waste is kept separate from paper fibers and mixed containers. The Association has achieved a diversion rate as high as 73.8% in some of its 28 communities on “user pay.”         BOWDOINHAM, MAINE  Contact: David Berry  Solid Waste Manager  PO Box 85  Bowdoinham, ME 04008  (207) 666-3228     In 1996, Bowdoinham (pop. 2,192) recovered 62% of its municipal solid waste. Recycling participation is voluntary but a volume-based fee is charged for waste disposal. Trash disposed at the Bowdoinham landfill dropped by 50% in the first six months after introducing the volume-based fees in 1989. Bowdoinham introduced municipally contracted curbside recycling and trash collection in 1994. Material for recycling is also collected at the town's drop-off center. Materials accepted include food discards, newspaper, cardboard, magazines, glass, aluminum and ferrous cans, and all plastic resins. An area of the recycling center is also used to display reusable materials, such as furniture, books, and clothing, available free to residents. Leaves, grass clippings, wood waste, and brush are collected free of charge at the town landfill.         CHATHAM, NEW JERSEY  Contact: Henry M. Underhill  Administrator/Clerk  Borough of Chatham  54 Fairmount Avenue  Chatham, NJ 07928  (201) 635-0674 x108     Chatham (pop. 8,289) residents achieved a 65% recovery rate in 1996. Chatham charges a base rate of $75 per household per year for solid waste and recycling services. The borough imposes an additional charge of $1.45 for a 30-gallon bag or $0.75 for a 15-gallon bag for trash collection. The change to a per bag charge was a hard sell for town officials but the program has worked well. The Chatham recycling program accepts a wide range of materials including cereal boxes, paper juice and milk cartons, metal clothing hangers, aerosol cans, and mixed paper. Leaves, brush, and other yard debris are diverted through composting and account for 66% of the material Chatham residents divert.         CLIFTON, NEW JERSEY  Contact: Al DuBois  Recycling Coordinator  City of Clifton  Department of Public Works  307 East 7th Street  Clifton, NJ 07011  (201) 470-2237 fax (201) 340-7049     Through Clifton's mandatory recycling programs for residents and businesses, the city (pop. 71,742) diverted from disposal 56% of its municipal solid waste in 1996. Residents are offered curbside collection of old newspapers, magazines, mixed paper, glass, aluminum cans, and steel cans once every three weeks. Residents must segregate and place each type of material in a separate container at the curb. Even glass is sorted by color. This method allows Clifton to deliver materials directly to market without having to pay an intermediate processor. Clifton's drop-off recycling center accepts additional materials such as cardboard, #1 and #2 plastic bottles, and aluminum plates and trays. Grass clippings, leaves, brush, and other yard and garden debris are collected seasonally curbside and account for 32% of total materials recovery. Businesses are required to recycle and are provided technical assistance by the Recycling Coordinator. Small businesses are eligible to receive city trash and recycling services, but large businesses privately contract.         CROCKETT, TEXAS  Contact: Buddy Robinson  Solid Waste Director  City of Crockett  200 North Fifth  Crockett, TX 75835  (409) 544-5156 fax (409) 544-4976     Prior to 1992, Crockett contracted with a private company to collect and dispose of all waste generated in the city. No materials were recovered for recycling or composting. The city took over trash management in 1992 in the belief that it could provide trash, recycling, and composting services at a lower cost than it had been paying for trash collection and disposal. In 1996, Crockett recycled 20% and composted 32% of its residential waste stream. Crockett's mandatory, weekly curbside recycling and composting programs and the use of clear bags for trash, composting, and recycling have contributed to the city's high diversion level. Through a local ordinance, Crockett requires all residents to recycle 22 categories of materials and collect four others for composting. All residents have weekly, year-round collection service for recyclables and yard debris. The use of clear bags allows city staff to readily identify improperly prepared materials for recovery or trash containing recyclables. City staff will not collect improperly set out materials.         DOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE  Contact: Jeffrey Pratt  Recycling Coordinator  Solid Waste and Recycling Division  City of Dover  288 Central Avenue  Dover, NH 03820  (603) 743-6073 fax (603) 743-6096     Dover (pop. 27,000) offered its residents no recycling program until 1990 when it opened a drop-off recycling center. The next year it started curbside recycling and a month later a pay-as-you-throw system for trash collection. Before the beginning of these programs, Dover's residents disposed approximately 11,000 tons of solid waste. In 1996, only 4,500 tons of residential waste were disposed. This strictly voluntary recycling program and the pay-as-you-throw trash system resulted in the town's residents recycling 52% of their residential solid waste in 1996. Dover residents are offered the opportunity to recycle mixed paper, HDPE, PET, glass beverage containers, corrugated cardboard, used motor oil, tires, batteries, aluminum and steel cans, and aseptic packaging. Leaves, clean wood, and yard trimmings are collected for composting at Dover's drop-off recycling station.

The city began collecting dry waste November 1995, and wet waste February 1996. Approximately 55 to 60% of the dry waste is diverted from disposal; 60 to 65% of the wet waste is diverted.          LEBANON COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA  Contact: Amy Mazzella di Bosco  Lebanon County Recycling Coordinator  Greater Lebanon Refuse Authority  1610 Russell Road  Lebanon, PA 17046  (717) 867-5790, ext. 307   fax (717) 867-5798     With 13 curbside collection programs and seven drop-off centers in its 26 municipalities, Lebanon County (pop. 116,789) recycled 51% of its solid waste in 1995. The county accepts newspaper; corrugated cardboard; aluminum and bimetal cans; glass; plastic milk, soda, and detergent bottles; phone books; magazines; office paper; metals; car batteries; tires; and yard trimmings. In 1995, the county recycled over 43,000 tons of material. Of the 13 municipalities with curbside collection, five have mandatory recycling while eight have voluntary programs. County officials credit its high recovery rate to waste haulers' cooperation in picking up recyclables on their routes, voluntary recycling coordinators in each community, and public and private organizations and citizens who have all enthusiastically embraced recycling.         LEVERETT, MASSACHUSETTS  Contact: Richard A. Drury  Recycling Coordinator  Town of Leverett  Town Hall  Leverett, MA 01054  (413) 367-9683 fax (413) 367-9683     Leverett, a rural town (pop. 1,965) in western Massachusetts, has achieved a 56% recovery rate through reuse, recycling, composting, and deposit container redemption.

Among the materials accepted for recycling and composting are: aluminum cans, steel cans, glass containers, mixed paper, paperboard, textiles, auto and button batteries, plastics, scrap metal, waste oil, tires, paint, egg crates, leaves, and other yard debris. Leverett has an active swap shop, called ""Take it or Leave it,"" where residents can leave and/or take reusable items such as books, clothes, and bed frames. Residents pay a flat fee for recycling and a per bag fee for trash pick-up. The town sells home composters and reports that almost everyone composts on their own. Leverett's total solid waste management budget has decreased as a result of its waste reduction programs. The total waste stream has also decreased.         LOVELAND, COLORADO  Contact: Bruce Philbrick  Solid Waste Superintendent  City of Loveland  Solid Waste Division  500 E. Third Street  Loveland, CO 80537  (970) 962-2609 fax (970) 663-8047     In 1996, Loveland residents (pop. 46,940) diverted 56% of their residential solid waste from the landfill. Loveland offers residential curbside recycling coupled with a volume-based rate for trash disposal. April through November the community collects yard trimmings from residents for a nominal fee. Since the initiation of these programs, per household waste generation has dropped and much of the material is now captured for recycling and composting. In 1996, per household disposal levels were less than half of the 1989 levels. The city's waste diversion program, carried out through dual-collection of recyclables and trash, saves it more than $100,000 per year in avoided capital and operating costs.         MADISON, WISCONSIN  Contact: George Dreckmann  Recycling Coordinator  City of Madison  1501 W. Badger Road  Madison, WI 53705-1423  (608) 226-4681     The curbside recycling program in Madison (pop. 200,814) collects glass, metal cans, #1 and #2 plastics, glossy magazines, newspapers, corrugated cardboard, brush, leaves, large items such as tires and white goods, and phone books. Residents pay a flat fee for waste management, except for appliance pick-up for which residents must purchase a sticker. In 1996, the city recovered 49% of its residential waste (32.6% through composting and 16.6% through recycling). In 1992 the city began a home composting program and distributed composting bins to residents at no charge. Since then, the city has sold almost 5,000 bins to residents at or below cost. The city's goal is to have one-third of residents in single-family homes composting their food discards.         MORRIS COUNTY, NEW JERSEY  Contact: Kathleen Pelak  Recycling Specialist  Municipal Utilities Authority  County of Morris  P.O. Box 370  Morris Plains, NJ 07945-0370  (973) 285-8392 fax (973) 285-8397     In 1995, Morris County (1995 pop. est. 444,990) surpassed New Jersey's statewide recycling goal of 60%, by recycling 63% of its total solid waste. Morris County mandates 15 materials to be source separated and recycled by the residential, commercial, and institutional sectors. The list of materials includes mixed paper, yard debris, tires, batteries, white goods and stumps in additional to the ""traditional"" recyclables. The county offers a curbside recycling collection program to municipalities for a cost of $0.85 per household per pick-up. Small businesses pay $5.00 per pick-up for ""back door"" service. Currently 12 of 39 municipalities and approximately 70 small businesses in the county subscribe to these services. Morris County also operates a recycling consolidation center for materials. This center accepts source-separated materials from municipalities, recycling collectors, and small businesses and processes the material for market. Most municipalities operate both a curbside recycling program and their own drop-off site. Drop-off is free. Four times each year, the county sponsors Household Hazardous Waste Disposal Days and collects items such as paints, pesticides, antifreeze, and asbestos. The county promotes a Cut It and Leave It program for grass clippings and backyard composting for other vegetative waste. Many of its municipalities likewise promote these programs and, as a result, some are eliminating curbside collection of yard debris.         NORTHUMBERLAND COUNTY, ONTARIO  Contact: Pam Russell, Director  Northumberland County Waste Management  860 William Street  Cobourg, Ontario K9A 3A9  (905) 372-3329 fax (905) 372-1696     April 1996, Northumberland County (pop. 75,000) implemented a wet/dry curbside collection program in its 15 municipalities. Collection costs have been cut in half and the county is diverting more material. The county uses 10 split dual-collection compactors. The trucks keep bags of wet discards separated from bags of dry discards. Currently the dry waste is sorted at a materials recovery facility (MRF), while the wet waste is landfilled. Plans are in the works to also process the wet waste for composting. About 43% of the residential waste stream arrives at the MRF as dry waste. Of this, 80% is captured and recycled. Four municipalities have implemented variable rates for discard collection. About 60% of their residential waste is coming in as dry waste.         PASSAIC COUNTY, NEW JERSEY  Contact: B.

The diversion level for single-family households was 55%. The city contracts with two private companies (the GreenTeam of San Jose and Western/USA Waste) to provide residential trash and recycling services on a weekly basis to 186,000 single-family dwellings and 79,000 multi-family dwellings. Single-family households pay volume-based rates for trash service. Two other contractors collect yard trimmings once a week on the same day as trash and recycling pick-up. In all, the city collects more than 24 different categories of materials for recycling and composting. The city encourages waste reduction in the commercial/institutional sector by assessing fees on trash collection but not on recycling or composting collection. This provides a direct economic incentive for businesses to recycle and reduce their solid waste.

The city continues to lead in waste diversion and has provided its residents with a convenient recycling system and a financial incentive to use it. City contractors provide residential curbside recycling and yard trimmings collection (by subscription). Seattle's multi-family recycling program serves 60% of households in this sector. Businesses contract privately for their trash and recycling services. Businesses and residents can also choose to self-haul trash, recyclables, and yard trimmings to city-owned transfer stations. Seattle set a goal of recovering 60% of its municipal solid waste stream by 1998 as an alternative to building an incinerator. No other large U.S. city has centered its waste management approach on material recovery, rejecting traditional disposal facilities in its long-term planning. In 1996, waste diversion levels in Seattle were 47% in the residential sector, 49% in the commercial sector, and 17% of self-haul materials. The city's total waste diversion level was 44%.

Government Facilities       GEORGIA DIAGNOSTIC AND CLASSIFICATION CENTER  JACKSON, GA  Contact: Boyd Leake  Vice President  Community Environmental Management, Inc.  770 Wesley Drive, NW  Atlanta, GA 30305  (404) 355-8770 fax (404) 355-8799     The Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Center, a 1,600-inmate facility, was chosen as a solid waste management pilot project for the Georgia Department of Corrections in 1992. The facility implemented a combination of recycling and composting in order to reduce the waste it sent to the landfill. The compost program combines food scraps from the prison kitchen with local yard trimmings and cardboard. The compost is then used to enhance soil at Corrections farm operations. Monthly trips to the landfill have been reduced from 13 to 3 and waste costs at the facility have dropped 63%. Because the pilot project at this facility has been so successful, the Georgia Department of Corrections has expanded the program to other correctional facilities.         NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS  Contact: Jim Marion  New York State Eastern Correctional Facility  Sullivan, NY  (914) 647-1653     The Department of Corrections began its composting project in 1990.

BENEFITS  OF CONSTRUCTION  WASTE MANAGEMENT   Recycling and reuse of materials have long been associated with wise  construction practices. Experienced contractors are now reaping the economic  advantages of Construction Waste Management. Communities are also seeing the  side benefits as listed below.   A. Trim Costs.    Recycling, reusing, and salvaging construction waste can save money.  Many of the contractors that have embraced Construction Waste Management have  made changes to their operations and practices to take advantage of reduced  waste disposal costs and revenues derived from recycle, reuse and salvage  materials. Utilizing reuse and salvage methods on site reduce the need for new  materials, reduces materials that end up in the landfill, creates a cleaner and  safer project site, and improves community relations.    B. Establish a Market Advantage.    A companys experience in waste prevention and recycling is a  valuable marketing tool for bidding on projects in response to customer interest  in Construction Waste Management. Efforts to prevent waste, to recycle, and to  use recycled-content materials on a project can help the project team earn  points towards qualifying for LEED and other local and national programs.   C. Create Environmental Benefits.    Environmental benefits also result from recycling and waste  prevention programs. In the long run, preventing waste reduces dependence on  natural resources such as trees, oil, and minerals plus creates less pollution  by reducing manufacturing and transportation related emissions. Reduction of the  energy and water required to produce building supplies from virgin materials  contributes to reduced greenhouse gasses related to the manufacturing and  transportation of those materials.   D. Help the Economy.    Recycling and reuse of construction waste can also help the economy  through the creation of jobs related to salvaging and recycling of construction  waste. New products create jobs through the manufacture of recycled content  materials.    II.  PREVENT WASTE  IN THE FIRST PLACE    The following considerations can minimize waste impacts on any size project.  From the broad influences of design to the specific methods used on the  job-site, all play a roll in the prevention of waste.   A. Design to Prevent Waste.        Design with standard sizes for building materials.      Specify materials and assemblies that can be easily disassembled at the    end of their useful life.      Design precast concrete members for concrete (Tilt-up) construction.      Choose durable non-toxic interior finishes or materials.      Design spaces to be flexible for changing uses.      Consider reusing materials (on-site) or installing salvaged materials from    off-site sources.     B. Plan for Waste Prevention.        Target specific waste producing practices for waste prevention.      Include waste prevention measures in a Waste Management Plan. See Waste    Management Plan and Reporting Form.      Communicate your waste management plan at meetings, post it on-line, and    promote the result.     C. Use Construction Methods that Prevent Waste.        For wood construction, use advanced framing techniques (e.g. 24""    on-center, and insulated headers), trusses for roof or floor framing,    finger-jointed studs and trim, and engineered wood products.      Consider using wood frame wall panels prefabricated off-site.      D. Practice Job-Site Waste Prevention Methods.        Set up central cutting areas for wood and other materials.      Reuse concrete forms or choose reusable metal or fiberglass forms.      Clearly mark areas key to waste prevention, such as the material storage,    central cutting, and recycling stations.      Practice material storage and handling procedures to prevent loss or    damage.      E. Purchase to Prevent Waste.        Purchase salvaged, recycled, or recycled-content materials and equipment.        Check to ensure the correct amount of each material is delivered to site.        Maintain an up-to-date material ordering and delivery schedule to minimize    the amount of time that materials are on-site and reduce the chance of damage.        Replace toxic materials with less toxic or non-toxic products to reduce    hazardous packaging.      Choose products with minimal or no packaging.      Ask suppliers to deliver supplies using sturdy, returnable pallets and    containers. Have suppliers pick up pallets and empty containers.      Require suppliers to take back or buy-back substandard, rejected, or    unused items.      III.  SALVAGE , REUSE, AND RECYCLE   There are many methods used to reduce waste and increase profits through  salvage, reuse, and the recycling of construction waste. In the industry,  salvage and reuse are terms that are often used interchangeably. For the purpose  of this Guide, the term reuse denotes the materials that remain on the  construction site to be used in their original form or converted to another use.  Salvage, typically in its original form, are items that are removed from the  site.   A. Survey the Site Before Demolition or  Deconstruction.        Identify salvage and reuse items.      Identify recyclable materials.      Identify hazardous materials for special handling.     B. Develop a Construction Waste Management Plan.        List items being reused on-site.      List items for salvage, both resale and donation.      Plan for protecting, dismantling, handling, storing, and transporting    items.      Schedule for the removal of salvage and recycle materials.      Consider using deconstruction.     C. Identify Reusable or Salvageable Items.          Identify material that can be removed and separated without undue damage.        Identify material of unique or antique feature that would make it worth    saving.      Identify material with high resale value such as old true divided windows.        Identify material new enough to be reused easily.      Discuss reuse ideas and the project timeline with the owner and the    designer.      Discuss reuse ideas with building departments if there are structural    applications.     D. Select Salvage Removal Alternatives.          Train your own or hire a deconstruction crew.      Contact a salvage company to come on-site to remove valuable materials.        Take materials to a salvage center in the area.      List the items in a materials exchange or advertise in the newspaper.      Conduct a yard sale at edge of the job-site to sell salvaged items.      Allow workers to remove salvageable items for their own use.      Ask subcontractors to reuse or recycle their materials.      E. Plan for Recyclable Materials        Investigate removal and separation techniques.      Select material with high resale value such as copper wire and HVAC coils.        Plan for collection procedures and allocate space on site.     F. Question Salvage and Recycle Companies:          What items or materials do they accept?      Will they accept drop-offs at their location?      Will they provide drop boxes?      Will they come to the site to remove the items or materials?      When can they come and how long will removal take?      Will they visit the site and place a bid?      Will they pay for the items or materials?      What are the charges/payments for pick ups or drop-offs?      Can the company provide a receipt for tax deduction of donated items?      G. Estimate the Costs and Savings.        What disposal costs are avoided?      What hauling costs are eliminated?      What revenue is generated?      H. Consider other Project Costs and Savings.          Compare the costs of reusing materials and salvaged items to purchasing    new.      Compare costs to reuse materials and salvaged items (transportation,    reconfiguration of equipment, storage, etc.) on-site.      What is the functional or aesthetic value of having reused material    on-site?      What are the marketing and public relations benefits to reuse and salvage?        What is the tax benefit to donating items to charities?      I. Identify Hazardous Waste Considerations.          Some building materials may be contaminated with hazardous materials.      Hazardous products include lead paint, asbestos, fluorescent lamps and PCB    ballast, Freon, and Halon.      Special attention must be taken when handling hazardous wastes.      Qualified professionals may be needed for proper handling and disposal.        Hazardous materials must be disposed of at a hazardous waste facility or    recycled.      Some materials can be recaptured. Freon and Halon have a market value for    reuse.                                Check this List of Reuse or        Salvage Items         At the start of a project, evaluate whether these        materials can be salvaged, donated, or sold locally. Reused items can have        functional or aesthetic features of importance. Salvaged woods can be of        qualities or varieties hard to find today.                                                   Appliances              Bathroom Fixtures              Bricks              Cabinets              Carpeting              Ceiling Tiles              Dimensional Lumber              Doors                                                                  Ductwork              Flooring              Insulation              Landscaping Materials              Lighting Fixtures              Marble              Metal Framing              Paneling                                                                  Pipes              OSB & Plywood              Siding              Tile              Trim/Antique Moldings              Windows              Wood Beams and Posts                                                                        Check this List of          Recyclable Building Material         When opportunities for  reuse or salvage  are        exhausted, recycling is the next level. Deconstruction and construction        waste materials that can be recycled include:                                                   Acoustical ceiling tiles              Asphalt              Asphalt Shingles              Cardboard              Carpet and carpet pad              Concrete              Drywall                                                                  Fluorescent lights and ballast              Land clearing debris (vegetation, stumpage, dirt)              Metals              Paint (use a hazardous waste outlet)              Plastic film (sheeting, shrink wrap, packaging)              Window glass              Wood                                          IV.   DESIGN  A WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN   Successful and profitable job-site recycling begins with a Waste Management  Plan. This section will help you through the process of developing a Waste  Management Plan.    A. Make a Waste Management Plan. (See   Planning &  Reporting Form )        Identify materials to be salvaged, reused, recycled, and disposed of    including materials subcontractors will be responsible for.      Outline procedures, expectations, and results for monitoring, collecting    and promoting waste management planning.      Designate a coordinator responsible for implementing the plan.      Set waste management goals, such as Reuse or recycle 75% of project    wastes.      Define types of wastes.      Estimate the amounts.      Indicate the disposal method for each material reused in place, reused    on-site, salvaged, recycled, or landfilled.      Include handling procedures for removal, separation, storage, and/or    transportation.      Communicate the plan to all crew members.      Document waste management requirements on project documents, including    subcontracts and specifications.      Communicate the results.     B. Researching Recycling Options.        Contact recyclers and haulers using the Yellow Pages or Recycling    Directories.      Use 1-800-RECYCLE (1-800-732-9253) or       http://1800recycle.wa.gov/index.html        What materials are accepted?      What are the specific guidelines for each material? For example, do they    accept forming plywood in clean wood?      Decide which materials are co-mingled and which need to be source    separated and the costs.      Are drop boxes and pick-up service available?      What are the collection options: call for service; monitored drop boxes;    or, scheduled pick-ups?      What are the charges for services including drop box rental, hauling, and    tipping fees/revenues?      Is there help to set up the program and provide training for the crew?        Are receipts provided for tracking types and quantities of recyclables    collected?      C. Decide Which Materials to Recycle        Determine potential recyclable materials and the recycling method.      Select what to recycle.      Determine cost and revenues for recycling different construction wastes    (source separated and co-mingled).      Determine costs for disposing of wastes.      Calculate potential costs and savings for recycling on a project.      Identify, based on calculations, the materials to be recycled most    cost-effectively.      Be creative in rural areas. Partner with local businesses, community    groups, and others to determine if there is local interest in using    construction waste materials.      V. PUT THE WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN INTO  ACTION   A well developed Construction Waste Management Plan combines good  communication with attention to details. Effective implementation will foster  employee pride and elevate the corporate image. This will ensure success,  maximize the benefits, and provide a marketing edge.   A. Educate Everyone About the Waste Management  Program.        Share the formalized plan with everyone involved in the project    administration.      Discuss waste handling requirements with crew and subcontractors.      Share procedures for checking bin status and the system for notifying    haulers for extra containers or pick-ups.      Post easy to read signs with written information about the recycling    program.      Continue education by making recycling updates part of your safety    program.      Clearly label the recycling drop boxes. Post lists of what is and what is    not recyclable and use pictures for quick identification.     B. Find the Space        Place garbage bins and recycling drop boxes close to the point of waste    generation, but out of the traffic pattern.      Choose smaller containers and more frequent collection. There are a    variety of container sizes and service options available from recycling    services or haulers.      Use smaller containers to dump into large containers at the end of the    day.      Ask recycling service providers about containers with multiple    compartments to minimize the number of containers on site.      Rent a trailer for the major recyclable material generated in the first    phase of construction and haul directly to the recycler.      If self-hauling, build custom containers to fit the space requirements    using scrap or damaged plywood, concrete forms, or barrier fencing.      Use trash cans to collect recyclables generated in smaller amounts.     C. Make it Convenient        Place the recycling dumpsters as close to the work as possible.      Always provide a container for trash near the recycling containers.      Consider co-mingling small quantities of wood, cardboard, and metals to    make one larger load of recyclables.      Provide maps of the job-site to haulers for dumpster placement and pickup.     D. Promote and Educate        Treat waste management like a safety program. Integrate recycle training    into the safety education, or design a separate recycling education program.        Create a name or slogan for the recycling program.      Provide incentives to make the plan work.      Use signage and simple clear instructions to communicate.      Be positive! When the crew and subcontractors are motivated and understand    the goals, they will figure out creative ways to work efficiently.      Include everyone in the process. Encourage suggestions on more efficient    methods, or additional materials that can be recycled.      E. Prevent Contamination        Clearly label the recycling bins. Post lists with pictures of what is    recyclable.      Provide trash bins to collect non-recyclable items. Have them emptied    regularly so the overflow does not end up in the recycling bin.      Conduct regular site visits to verify that bins are not contaminated.      Consider bins with lids or locating bins in a locked or supervised area to    discourage contamination.      Dump out contaminated loads and have the subcontractors and/or crew pull    out the contaminants themselves.      Regularly check the wastes in the garbage dumpsters for recyclables.      Call the recycler before drop boxes are full to arrange for pick-up.     F. Track Your Success        Once construction has started, keep the receipts from recycling and    garbage disposal for planning estimates in future waste management budgets.    See Sample Tracking Form.      Use Worksheets to report the results and cost savings from recycling on    your project. See Construction Waste Management Plan and Reporting Form.      Tracking the quantities and cost savings of diverted materials is required    for BUILT GREEN and LEED certification.      Share the success by posting the volumes of materials reused or recycled.        VI. USE  RECYCLED -CONTENT  BUILDING MATERIALS   An important part of the cycle of reclaiming materials is the reuse of those  materials. Buying recycled-content building materials supports efficient use of  our natural resources without compromising building standards.   A. Identify Recycled-Content Building Materials.    Recycled-content building materials are durable and quality products,  competitively priced with conventional materials, and they help conserve natural  resources such as timber and oil. Many common building products like Homasote  paneling and blown-in cellulose insulation, made from reclaimed newspapers, have  been used for years. New products using recycled materials, such as carpet and  plastic lumber, are being developed every day.    B. Know the Types of Recycled-Content Materials:        Materials can be post-consumer, made from materials after a first use.        Materials can be pre-consumer, created from waste materials as a byproduct    of manufacturing and used in another product.      Buying either type of recycled-content building materials supports    efficient use of our natural resources without compromising building    standards.     C. Discover How to Buy Recycled.        Obtain information on recycled products. Contact suppliers and    manufacturers for product specifications and samples.      Consistently communicate your interest in recycled-content building    materials in your specifications, policies, and in your job-site meetings.        Look for products with the highest recycled-content available, especially    post-consumer content that meets your strength and durability specifications.        Look for recycled-content products for your office or job shack. Copy    paper, toner cartridges, and desk supplies are readily available with    recycled-content.                               RECYCLED-CONTENT BUILDING        PRODUCTS                     Building        Materials         Site Work                                                   Carpet              Cellulose Insulation              Ceiling Tile              Ceramic/Porcelain Tile              Concrete Masonry Units              Countertop              Dock Bumpers              Ductwork              Exterior Sheathing              Fences/Posts              Fiberboard              Fiberglass Insulation                                                                  Floor Joists              Floor Mats              Flooring              Lumber              Paint              Pilings              Plastic Lumber              Recycling Containers              Roofing              Structural Steel              Underlayment              Wallboard                                                                 Asphalt              Base Coarse              Compost and Soil Amendments              Concrete              Drainage or Backfill aggregate              Ecology Blocks              Fill Material              Ground colored glass pipe bedding              Glassphalt              Parking Stops                                          VII.  GLOSSARY  OF TERMS   DECONSTRUCTION  is the systematic  disassembly of buildings in order to salvage as much material as possible. A  complement to demolition, it allows crews to enter a building and take it apart,  from appliances to floorboards, stair treads, roof joists, and down to the  bricks. The recovered materials are then resold for use in new construction and  renovation projects, or for remanufacture (i.e., turning wood framing into  fireplace mantles).   LEED  is the Leadership in Energy and  Environmental Design rating criteria developed by the US Green Building Council.  The LEED Rating System is recognized nationally and internationally as the Green  Building design standard.   MATERIAL RECOVERY FACILITY (MRF)  is a  general term used to describe a waste-sorting facility. Mechanical,  hand-separation, or a combination of both procedures are used to recover  recyclable materials from other waste.   POST-CONSUMER  recycled-content products  contain materials that have been used by consumers and collected for  reprocessing.   PRE-CONSUMER  or post-industrial  recycled-content products contain waste materials created as a byproduct of  manufacturing that are and re-incorporated into the manufactured product.   RECYCLE  is the separation of construction  waste materials for remanufacturing or reprocessing into usable or marketable  materials. Examples of recycling include separating wood off-cuts for recycling  by a wood processor into paper pulp, or taking soil to a topsoil facility for  reprocessing into topsoil.   CO-MINGLED  recycling service allows  contractors to put select recyclables such as wood, cardboard, and metals in one  container that may result in less container space. The recycling company takes  the materials to a MRF where the materials are separated for recycling.  Co-mingled recycling is cheaper than garbage disposal but more expensive than  source-separated recycling. It may be difficult to receive accurate recycling  and disposal figures from this method due to the varied condition of the  materials to be recycled and the current recycle markets.   SOURCE SEPARATED  recycling service  involves collecting recyclables in separate containers as they are generated.  The recycling hauler takes the materials directly to a recycler or a transfer  site. This method requires more individualized containers but makes accounting  of materials easier and safeguards material quality. Items such as concrete,  drywall, carpet, film plastic, and ceiling tiles may need to be source separated  for recycling.    REUSE  is to use a construction or  demolition waste material again on-site. Examples include grinding concrete for  re-use on-site and reusing lumber for constructing forms.   SALVAGE  of construction or demolition  waste material is to remove it from an existing building for reuse in the same  form. Examples of salvage include removing lumber, doors, trim, plumbing  fixtures, or brick.                                   Introduction  |                  Guidelines  |                   Case Studies  |  Tools  |                  Resources  |                    Contact"

GX244-82-15223015	"CT Municipal Recycling Honor Roll   Starting in December 2002, and continued annually thereafter as part of the celebration of America Recycles Day, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection recycling office has selected towns and cities to be formally recognized for their outstanding recycling/source reduction programs.       These towns are doing a great job of reducing the amount of trash requiring disposal, which is especially critical as Connecticut faces future trash disposal capacity issues. Effective municipal recycling/source reduction programs result in the conservation of natural resources; conservation of energy; reduction of greenhouse gas emissions; reduction of pollution emissions; and reduction of water use. In addition, a recent national study has shown that “by converting wastes into valuable raw material recycling creates jobs, builds more competitive manufacturing industries, and adds significantly to the U.S. economy” at  www.epa.gov/jtr/econ/rei-rw/rei-rw.htm     These towns think globally and act locally.    In 2002, ten towns were selected to receive municipal recycling awards: Cornwall, Manchester, Mansfield, Middletown, New Britain, Norwalk, Portland, Redding, Somers and Stonington.  In the following year ( 2003), five additional towns received recycling awards: i.e. Granby, Litchfield, Salisbury, Sharon, and Windsor Locks.    These fifteen towns make up Connecticut’s current Municipal Recycling Honor Roll (MRHR) and they deserve applause and recognition for their outstanding recycling efforts.     But the MRHR is not just a list, nor is it static – hopefully new towns will be identified and added to the list on an annual basis.  In addition to honoring the towns listed, the MRHR is also meant to be a resource for other Connecticut cities and towns striving to improve their own municipal recycling programs. Hopefully, reading through the list will inspire other municipalities to contact MRHR towns for more information regarding recycling efforts that work. MRHR towns are eager to share their success stories.       If you are aware of other exemplary municipal recycling programs which are not listed on the Municipal Recycling Honor Roll but would be excellent recycling models for other cities and towns  –   Please let us know!   Contact Judy Belaval or Carey Hurlburt at the CT DEP Recycling Office at (860) 424-3237  judy.belaval@po.state.ct.us  or (860) 424-3248   carey.hurlburt@po.state.ct.us   - and  Don't Forget To:                 Connecticut Municipal Recycling Honor Roll – January 2004                               Town                           Contact  Information                            Recycling/Source         Reduction           Above & Beyond Requirements                                     Cornwall                     Steven O'Neil        Recycling Coordinator        Phone:  (860) 672-6230         soneil01@snet.net                                 Reuse programs that are operated with the           assistance of local non-profit groups.

The City has organized a number of reduced price composting bin       distributions which have included educational workshops for residents.                                 The town purchases recycled copy paper and has also purchased retread       tires for some city vehicles.                                 The City is just beginning a large-scale vermicomposting project which       will take food waste from a local institution and use red wiggler worms to       covert what was once a waste material into high quality compost.

New Britain has a budget dedicated to recycling education which is used       to produce brochures, T.V. spots, ads, targeted mailings, etc.        Materials are produced in a multi-lingual format to meet the needs of the       diverse population of New Britain.                                New Britain promotes composting by providing free recycling bins and an       annual education program at the local organic farm.                                 In addition to the mandated items, New Britain collects magazines,       plastics #1 and #2 and aseptic packages curbside.                                 Rechargeable batteries are collected through a drop off program at both       the town hall and landfill.

The city's program includes commercial pick up (for local businesses) of       corrugated cardboard, mixed paper and newspapers.                                 Norwalk also provides curbside pick up of yard wastes from April through       December.                                 Norwalk collects antifreeze from residents, in addition to batteries and       waste oil.

Portland’s white office paper program is especially noteworthy.        They allow small businesses and private residents, including people from       other communities to drop off high-grade white office paper and cardboard.                                 As an added incentive to participate Portland gives a free ream of new       recycled content paper to participants.                                 Portland has implemented unit-pricing for residents who utilize the       transfer station for trash disposal option.                                  The town has a designated composting area and has distributed over 300       compost bins to residents. Literature is distributed through the transfer       station but is also available on their website.

Redding has a drop-off area for residents for compostable materials and       invite residents to come back for finished compost.                                 The town sells compost bins and other products that are made from the       mixed plastic collected in their town.                                 Redding places frequent ads in the local paper, which provide great       detail on what is recycled and how to prepare it.  They also send out       an annual flyer to residents with similar information.                                 The town works with local hauler to issue tickets to people who are not       recycling.                                               Salisbury        Sharon                     Val P.

In addition to the mandated recyclables the transfer station provides the       opportunity to recycle clothing and shoes; computers and televisions;       office paper and mixed paper; and Christmas trees.                                 The transfer station/recycling center contains a swap shop for used paint       and stain                                 The TS also has a swap area for books and other reusable items which do       not require repair.                                 The TS has worked with Taylor Recycling in NY to recycle some of the       C&D material.                                 In April 2003 the TS started collecting paints and stains and will be       recycling the Benjamin Moore latex paint through the Benjamin Moore       product stewardship program.                                 A computer reuse program was started by two volunteers and has been       successful in putting computers into the hands of people who otherwise       might not have had the opportunity to own a computer.                                 The towns have also worked with Old Farms Nursery to get the wholesaler       to take back all plant containers – removing thousands of such       containers from the MSW stream.

The town has a ""Blue Light Building"" which is an unused       temporary classroom which houses a reuse program for still usable toys,       furniture, appliances, dishes and books.                                 Residents are able to pick up free wood chips made from the grinding of       brush and logs.                                 Transfer station operators check incoming loads.  If       materials are not properly separated they are rejected.                                 The town has a local ordinance that requires haulers to report the       ultimate destination of collected trash and recyclables to the town.                                 Most of the education of both businesses and residents is done at the       transfer station, which is utilized by over 50% of the residents for       self-hauling of trash, although almost all residents have a permit and       utilize the transfer station at least occasionally.                                 Somers has a recycling rate of about 30%, well above the state average.

The town recycles many non-mandated items such as plastic #1& #2,       polycoated drink containers, junk mail, cereal/cookie boxes & old       clothes.                                 Reuse options are also an important part of Stonington's program which       includes a reuse shed at the transfer station for book, toys and household       items and the town has produced a ""Use It Again Stonington""       booklet to promote the reuse and repair of various items.                                  The new residents packet contains brochures on recycling, composting and           grasscycling.                                  The town works cooperatively with the local nature center to sell compost       bins to residents at cost.                                 Stonington is currently participating in a pilot program together with       the town of Groton to compost source separated commercial food waste       (restaurants, grocery stores, schools, nursing homes etc.).  Visit       the DEP website at  www.dep.state.ct.us/wst/compost/grotonpilot.htm        for more info.

The town trash hauler works       closely with the town to assure that non-recyclers to achieve compliance.        Unannounced recycling “spot checks” are conducted at businesses and       recycling success is assured through diplomacy and education.                                 Windsor Locks promotes backyard composting and grasscycling through an       ongoing campaign of mailings in the spring and fall and the promotion of       composting demonstrations conducted at Northwest Park in Windsor.        The town recycling coordinator has gone door-to-door to promote       composting.                                Four of Windsor Locks public schools have an aggressive program to       recycle their milk cartons (aseptic containers) and they are looking at       adding food scrap composting at the schools as well.

Fallon, Director  State House  Room 20  (401) 222-2457       Burrillville receives $4,042.86 recycling award       BURRILLVILLE -- Sorting out all the bottles and cans, breaking down all the cardboard boxes and hauling it all out to the pickup site on recycle day has certainly proved beneficial to the town, and in more ways than merely environmental.    The Town of Burrillville is receiving a $4,042.86 check from Rhode Island Resource Recovery Corporation, its cut of the $200,000 being distributed to recycling municipalities -- a rebate/reward, of sorts, presented by the board to compliment the success of the state's and communities' recycling efforts.    The $4,000 ""award"" was announced by Rep. Robert B. Lowe (D-Dist. 61) of Burrillville and North Smithfield, and a member of the Resource Recovery Commission.    ""The success of our state's recycling program has always been measured in terms of its environmental good, as it should be,"" said Representative Lowe. ""The program has truly had an impact in our state, not only in terms of the volume of what once was waste and is now recoverable material, but also in terms of the environmental-consciousness of our residents.""    ""Now, because of the cooperation of our citizens and the vast success of the program, RI Resource Recovery is able to make a financial return to the communities which have done their part in recycling,""  he said. ""Not only does this grant acknowledge the town's involvement in our recycling effort, it also is meant to serve as an incentive to communities to join in that effort.""    The $4,000 headed to Burrillville can be used at the town's discretion.     ""Like all communities in Rhode Island facing budget preparations for the new year, I'm sure the community will have many possible wise uses for these funds,"" said Representative Lowe. Although it could most logically be tied to the community's public works department budget, RI Resource Recovery put no strings on the money. ""It's simply the board's way of showing its gratitude to communities for joining the recycling program.""    The funds for the community grants are part of RI Resource Recovery's operating budget. In addition to this outright grant to the municipalities, cities and towns which have signed recycling agreements with the corporation receive annual, pro-rata distributions based on the sale of recovered material.

Unaware of the hazards, the fragile necklaces are       brought in by students. Once broken, the amount of mercury spilled can warrant a       hazardous cleanup response and evacuation.  Whether at school or       home, mercury spills from       broken necklaces left unattended may pose a health threat.  To raise       awareness, the Washington State       Department of Health compiled the following       resources on health effects, spill cleanup, and safe disposal of mercury       necklaces.                                                                                                   What do the           necklaces look           like?                         The necklaces are often a beaded chain, cord, or           leather strand with a glass pendant that contains mercury.  The mercury appears as a silvery clump of liquid that           rolls around in the hollow glass pendant.  The glass pendant may           also be filled with brightly colored liquid - red, green, blue, yellow           - along with the mercury.  Pendants can come in various shapes           such as hearts, bottles, balls, saber teeth, and chili peppers.              What is the           concern?             Mercury is released when the glass is           broken or when it leaks around the pendant's cord anchor.  Once           mercury spills, it breaks into tiny beads that can roll into cracks in           floor coverings or walls, or become trapped in carpet.  If           spilled in or around heating ducts, mercury can quickly vaporize and           possibly spread           throughout the building or home.  Without proper cleanup, people may           be exposed to           hazardous mercury vapors.                                             How do mercury vapors   affect my health?         Very small amounts of liquid mercury,       just a few drops, can vaporize and reach levels that may       be harmful to   health.  At high levels, mercury vapors may cause effects such as       respiratory difficulties (shortness of breath, pain and tightness in the       chest, and coughing), nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, increases in blood       pressure or heart rate, skin rashes, and eye irritation.  Exposure to       mercury vapors can also lead to damage of the central nervous       system.  The severity of harm depends on the level of mercury you are       exposed to, the length       of your exposure, and your individual sensitivity.  Central nervous system effects may       include irritability, shyness, tremors, changes in vision or hearing, and       memory problems.  Developing fetuses and young children are particularly       vulnerable to the health effects of mercury.            Who do I contact about   a mercury spill ?               Do  not  attempt to   cleanup a mercury spill.  Especially, do  not  use a vacuum cleaner to cleanup         a spill.  A vacuum cleaner will spread mercury vapors   into the air and increase the exposure.             Contact your           Washington Poison Center at             1-800-732-6985                     Washington State Department of Ecology        Spill Response (24 hours)                                               SW             Regional Office (Olympia)             (360)             407-6300                                 NW             Regional Office (Bellevue)             (425)             649-7000                                 Central             Regional Office (Yakima)             (509)             575-2490                                 Eastern             Regional Office (Spokane)             (509)             456-2926                                 or             Ecology - Emergency Management             1-800-258-5990                                       Who do I contact on   proper disposal of mercury necklaces?

GX244-53-2752655	"Recycling in Colorado: What it Takes to be Successful                                                                  I.     Introduction The     creation of local recycling programs across the state of Colorado has been met with     overwhelming success in some communities and significant difficulties in others. A     recycling program within any community is dependent upon a variety of elements that work     together to ensure achievement and sustainability. In 1997 the Governor’s Office of     Energy Management and Conservation (OEMC) funded two studies that evaluated thriving Colorado recycling     programs and projects that have faced challenges to growth and sustainability. The purpose     of this report is to provide a summary of the findings from these studies, and to assist     programs in overcoming challenges and ensuring success.        The goals of the studies conducted in 1997 were     to identify elements that either served as components of an active recycling program or as     challenges to a program’s objectives. The programs that were the focus of the     research were operated by state or local government, and had all received grants from     OEMC to help implement or operate recycling services. Each program manager was surveyed, and     interviews were conducted on-site to glean additional information about the recycling     programs. The data was then analyzed to develop a list of elements that helped maintain or     hinder recycling programs. The results of these studies show that the achievements or     challenges of a recycling program is based on a combination of elements, and is not     usually dependent on only one or two. Based on survey data, the successful recycling     program elements include (see Diagram A):          support from political boards, top managers and         the community;          a program vision that was created through an         individual or group of individuals;          a paid program manager and labor force;          programs that set and implemented obtainable         goals;          a recycling budget to run and operate the program;                  efficient operations;          partnerships;          program convenience for users;          educational and public relations outreach;          high participation rates;          equipment that is owned and reliable; and         programs that demonstrate the ability to adapt to         circumstance and creatively solve problems.                                                      The survey data also     identified elements that surfaced as challenges to a program’s survival:         leadership;          community support;          political support;          partnerships with others;          program convenience for users;          participation;          securing funds; and          purchasing equipment.              This report highlights the top elements of a     successful program as well as those that serve as major obstacles to communities that are     struggling to create a local niche for recycling.                                                 II.     Successful Recycling Programs In     the first study that focused on recycling successes, information was gathered from the     following recycling program managers:         Bruce Philbrick and Mick Mercer, City of         Loveland          The City of Loveland has very efficient recycling operations, which include a multitude of         drop-off sites for a variety of materials.         T.J. Quirk, Colorado State University          CSU has achieved its goal of reducing the number of dumpsters on campus and improving the         aesthetics of its recycling program.         Kasey Geoghegan, Summit Recycling Project          The Summit Recycling Project has maximized partnerships to implement, grow and expand         recycling.         Nancy Andrews, City of Durango          The City of Durango’s new recycling facility and curbside collection program are very         efficient and convenient for its residents.         Joe Lippis, Colorado Department of Corrections,         Caon City          DOC achieved its goal of implementing prison recycling, and plans to expand recycling         within a 100-mile radius during the next four years.         Susan Koster, City of Lafayette          The City of Lafayette’s recycling program has strong political and community support.             Of the many elements that contribute to a     thriving recycling program, there is a majority that stand out as being critical to     long-term success and survival. These elements include:          strong political, community and top management         support;          program leadership and vision;          paid program manager and labor force;          obtainable goals;          partnerships;          program convenience for users; and          equipment that is owned and reliable.              The recycling coordinators interviewed in the     study stated that if any of these factors were not considered, then their programs would     probably not be in existence.       Support from political boards or top managers is     very important if a recycling program is to run smoothly and be sustainable. They     typically respond when there are requests for recycling changes or when monetary support     or other program-related resources are needed. The Summit Recycling Project is one example     of a program that receives much support from its board of directors. Kasey     Geoghegan,     executive director of the Summit Recycling Project, usually makes decisions independently,     but consults with the board members when major issues arise. The board members are     typically recruited by word of mouth or through local advertisements, which attracts     people who are interested in recycling and improving the program. When local funding is     needed, Geoghegan must meet with Summit County commissioners. The City of Lafayette has a     Waste Reduction Advisory Committee (WRAC) to help support its recycling program. WRAC is a     subcommittee of the City Council comprised of volunteers who make recycling     recommendations and advise the council on recycling issues. Since all committee members     volunteer their time, they have the freedom to decide what projects they want to develop.     The City Council in Durango has been supportive of the community’s recycling needs.     It recently approved funding and construction for a recycling facility that processes and     bales metals, plastics, papers and cardboard.                                                             Summit Recycling Project drop-off facility                     Community support is just as important as that     from managers and political boards. Without the support of communities, there would be     little participation in recycling programs, and ultimately political boards would not be     supportive. The Town of Frisco recently conducted a community survey, which confirmed     residents believe the Summit Recycling Project is the strongest program in the town and is     of high priority to them. Businesses and community members have showed their support at an     annual                      auction fund-raiser for     the program. The amount of money raised each year at the auction has steadily increased.     The composting program developed by the City of Durango has received much support from its     community. In 1995, 950 people participated in composting workshops and bought home     composting bins. The community also shows support for recycling by participating in the     curbside collections and drop-off centers.                             Joe Lippis       ""Anything that is usable should be used and all of our facilities and     departments should be doing all they can to recycle and reuse everything.""             Leadership and vision     are two other elements that contribute to the survival of recycling programs. Without     vision, recycling programs may never be formed, and without leadership, they may never be     sustained. According to Nancy Andrews, recycling coordinator for the City of Durango, the     entire community had a vision for a comprehensive recycling program when they became aware     that their local landfill was closing. Concerned citizens proposed curbside recycling to     the City Council as a means of reducing waste. Andrews prepared a curbside recycling     proposal that was implemented in 1990. Joe Lippis with the Colorado Department of     Corrections (DOC) in Caon City is the coordinator of its recycling program. Lippis was     instrumental in developing prison recycling, and his vision has expanded to include nine     Caon City correctional facilities, one Buena Vista correctional facility, the San Carlos     correctional facility, Pueblo Minimum Center, Colorado Mental Health Institute, Caon     City businesses, Fremont County School District and Social Services, and the Holy Cross     Abbey Monastery. With the exception of the     City of Lafayette, all of the programs evaluated possess paid recycling coordinators and     labor. This is almost essential to ensure that the daily responsibilities of operating a     recycling program are carried out effectively. The recycling coordinator with Colorado     State University (CSU) is a full-time state classified position,                      Chris Booth        (New CSU Director)      ""This program would not be where it is       today without student labor.  Their energy and enthusiasm has been instrumental in     the success we enjoy today.""             and the     responsibilities include administration, budgeting,  marketing, negotiation with     vendors and strategic planning.  CSU also employs 12 part-time students to pick up     recyclables at each building on campus. The Summit Recycling Project is managed by an     executive director whose main responsibilities are to keep the board of directors informed     of changes, obtain additional funding, oversee the drop-off sites, provide timely reports     and educate the community. In addition to the executive director, there are two full-time     operation managers and two adults and four youth that work part-time. The implementation of obtainable goals also is necessary     for a program to thrive. The City of Loveland initially wanted to create an effective     waste management program that encompassed recycling. The goal was to design a new     recycling program based on volume rates. Bruce Philbrick and Mick Mercer, recycling     coordinators with the City of Loveland, feel they have been successful in achieving their     goals. CSU has overall goals of reducing the number of dumpsters on campus, improving the     aesthetics of the recycling program and reducing injuries associated with solid waste.     Goals also are set by the number of tons collected each year. In 1996 CSU recycled 623     tons of material. The goal for 1998 is to recycle 1,100 tons of material. The Summit     Recycling Project has a strategic plan for 1997-2002 in which seven strategic goals and     objectives have been established. They include local market development, improved     operations, education, additional funding, incentives, precycling and national     recognition.                     Kasey Goeghegan       ""Partnerships we have developed in Summit County have been a key to our     development.  As a non profit we are dependent on community support -- a broad based     support from local government, business and individuals has enabled us to be     successful.""             The formation of     partnerships with other organizations or departments is another critical factor in the     overall success of a recycling program. Although the City of Loveland has its own solid     waste department, it relies on other departments within the city to make the program work.     For example, the utility department charges all citizens a flat rate fee for recycling,     solid waste and hazardous waste. New residents must contact the utility department, which     provides them with a recycling packet and explains the service. In addition, the City of     Loveland works with local grocery stores to sell trash stamps. The Summit Recycling     Project receives cooperation from volunteers, businesses and local government to make     recycling a success. It also relies on local government departments’ in-kind services     to help run the recycling program. The Public Works Department with the City of Durango     has developed interdepartmental and external partnerships to make its recycling program     work. City Market, a local grocery store, is utilized as a drop-off station. The     City’s Parks Department has donated land for a composting demonstration site, and La     Plata County has donated classroom space for conducting composting workshops. In order to have high participation rates, a recycling     program should be convenient for its users. All of the programs evaluated have     well-maintained drop-off centers that are almost always open. The City of Loveland and the     City of Durango both have curbside programs, which make recycling even more convenient for     residents.                                            City of Loveland curbside recycling program                               Owning reliable equipment for daily recycling     operations is necessary for any program to remain active. Summit Recycling Project, the     City of Durango, Colorado Department of Corrections, and the City of Lafayette own     recycling equipment. Loveland’s solid waste department leases its equipment from the     city’s vehicle maintenance, and Colorado State University’s recycling program     leases its equipment from the university motor pool. Without the proper equipment, a     program cannot expand or even provide basic recycling services.                                             Bruce Philbrick      ""The city of Loveland      attributes its success in residential solid was management to the following program     components: volume-based rates for solid waste collection and disposal; co-collection of     solid waste and recyclables; and aggressive efforts to recover to recover recyclables and     yard waste through curbside and drop-off programs.  As a rsult, the City is now     diverting more than 50% of its wastestream from landfill disposal.""                     III.     Recycling Programs with Challenges The     second study evaluated the challenges that have inhibited the growth of the following     community recycling programs:         Delta County         Eagle County         Gilpin County         Morgan County         Saguache County             The elements described in the previous section     are critical to the success of almost any recycling program. The study conducted on     recycling programs with challenges found that the lack of three of those elements -     leadership, community support and political support - were considered to be major     obstacles to implementing a recycling program within a community. Other challenges such as     management and labor, and program convenience have hindered the growth and sustainability     of some recycling programs.       Many of the programs evaluated reported that     leadership is a major challenge because of the lack of skills necessary to operate a     successful recycling program. Leadership skills include economic planning, strategic     planning and goal setting, communications, and education/outreach. When many of the     programs were first implemented, they had supportive environmental leaders; however, most     were volunteers who did not have sufficient experience in coordinating a recycling     program. Delta, Gilpin and Eagle counties all relied on volunteer leadership, and as a     result their programs did not last long. In Delta County, the volunteers who originally     led the program did not have clear goals and made decisions based on unrealistic costs.     Morgan County’s recycling program had strong leadership in the early 1990s because     the county manager supported recycling efforts. Despite their support for recycling, when     new county commissioners were elected in 1994, the county manager’s position was     eliminated.                      Alberta Nail       ""For a recycling program to be successful, leadership is essential coupled     witha depndable funding source.""             Another major challenge     for the programs evaluated in this study is the absence of strong community support. For     many of the programs, community support is often inconsistent and unreliable, which may be     due to the fact that recycling is not a high priority among residents. Because some of the     recycling programs are operated on such limited funds, they typically rely on volunteers     to help make them work. Unfortunately, some of the programs reported that volunteers are     often unreliable and there are high turnover rates.                                                     Saguache Count Landfill drop-off containers                                             Saguache County Landfill bailing operation                                 The strong need for political support was a     significant challenge for all of the programs being evaluated in this particular study.     Several elements were identified that contributed to the lack of support, including     financial support, the priority that a county gives recycling and the absence of     commitment to recycling sustainability. Morgan County commissioners have trouble     justifying the start-up costs (initial investments vs. long-term returns) for a recycling     program. As a result, funding that is necessary to run a program is usually not approved.     Gilpin County has seen a dramatic shift in priorities during the last 10 years as a result     of rapid development in the casino industry. This has significantly limited the priority     list due to serious growth issues; therefore, commissioners do not consider recycling an     urgent issue for the county, and only want to minimally invest in the program. Communities     in the San Luis Valley are concerned about recycling, but there has been isolated     political support necessary to sustain a recycling program, namely in Saguache County.     Despite many attempts by citizens in this area to include recycling in future solid waste     planning, the San Luis Valley commissioners have not rallied for recycling.                     Management and labor     are two other challenges that some recycling programs have faced. Some of the program     coordinators have many responsibilities, including collecting recyclables, operating the     program, tracking the budget, educating the public and finding end-markets. Delta     County’s recycling program manager works long hours, often 60 hours per week, but is     paid for a 30-hour workweek. In addition to management, forming a labor force to help run     the recycling services can be a major difficulty for any program on a limited budget. As     mentioned earlier, some of the programs use volunteers, which can sometimes prove to be     unreliable. Program convenience is     important in making a recycling program successful, and without it, the participation rate     decreases. In Morgan, Eagle, Gilpin and Saguache counties, there are no curbside recycling     services. Instead, each program uses a drop-off station that either has limited hours or     is not conveniently located. Morgan County utilizes six transfer stations to house the     recycling containers; however, the greatest challenge to the program’s convenience is     the limited hours the sites are open. In Saguache County, the closest drop-off center is     in Alamosa, 70 miles from Saguache. The recycling coordinator stated there could be 15     drop-off sites in the county that would make the program more convenient.                                                  V.     Conclusions The communities that     were evaluated in the two studies are diverse, and thus face strengths and weaknesses that     are unique to their individual recycling programs. Some communities are more isolated than     others, and may not have access to recycling facilities or end markets. Other communities     may have supportive environments that contribute needed funding and participation. Most     programs likely have a combination of challenges and achievements. The successful     recycling programs mentioned in this report still have obstacles to overcome, but they     have managed to gain the support of those involved, especially the community. They have     proven the ability to adapt to new circumstances - changes in operations, staff, funding,     equipment, etc. - and creatively solve problems.                                                  Acknowledgments The grants and studies that served as the basis for this     report were funded by the Governor’s Office of Energy Management and Conservation       (OEMC) and prepared     by Paula Volkin of Volkin and Associates.

By rising to the  Challenge , we can and will produce less waste, recycle more, buy more recycled content products, and conserve energy and our natural resources to benefit our children and future generations.    The goal of the  National Recycling Challenge  is to increase the national recycling rate from 27 percent to 35 percent.  Commitments are being made to make this goal a reality. These commitments span six action areas.  These action areas are:    Improve Efficiency In Recycling:    Reduce the cost of recycling for your organization or community.    Bolster Community and Economic Development Through Recycling:    Start or expand recycling-related jobs programs, re-use programs, and innovative recycling financing programs.    Bring Forward Innovations in Recycling Through New Technologies, Products, Policies or Building Practices:      Increase sales or production of a recycled content product, increase recycling rates for your community/organization, use recycled content for the new products for a building, or recycle your construction and demolition project materials.    Promote Designs for Recycling:    Design a product or process which increases recycling or product recyclability.    Close the Recycling Loop:    Buy recycled content products, manufacture recycled content products, or become a steward of your product.    Champion Outreach and Education for Recycling:    Conduct training on recycling and/or buying recycled to increase green purchasing.             Vice President Announces National Recycling Challenge   Monday, November 16, 1998      Washington, DC -- Vice President Gore today announced a major initiative to broaden the commitment to recycling in all sectors of the economy.    ""Americans across the country are increasingly concerned about the impacts that more landfills and waste hauling will have on their communities in the future,"" the Vice President said.  ""This means that recycling is everybody's business.""      ""Working together, Americans have increased recycling by nearly 70 percent in six years,"" Vice President Gore said.  ""Today, there is even more that we can do.  I am challenging everyone in our communities and all sectors of the economy to join with us in new partnerships to promote recycling and to buy and use recycled products.""    This initiative, the  National Recycling Challenge , was announced as part of America Recycles Day on November 15.  Through this challenge, the Clinton Administration will work with industry, businesses, universities, and other institutions to strengthen their commitment to a national recycling effort.    Vice President Gore was the Honorary Chair of this day's events, and the new initiative furthers an executive order that President Clinton issued this past September, directing Federal Agencies to strengthen and expand their recycling efforts.    Federal agencies will be among the first to meet the challenge with new commitments to the purchase of recycled products.  The Departments of Interior and Justice, for example, announced today that their entire vehicle fleets will now use only re-refined oil, reducing demands for oil as well as greenhouse gas emissions generated in the refining process.    ""I challenge every American to step forward and contribute to this important national effort,"" Vice President Gore said.  ""By bringing new partners to the recycling efforts of businesses and families across the Nation, we will better protect our natural resources, improve our quality of life, and strengthen our economy.""

Improve Efficiency In Recycling        In order for recycling to work, municipalities and companies must continually find ways to drive costs out of their systems and improve the quantity of recovered materials.  We must continually strive to improve the efficiency of all recycling operations.  Our goal is to make recycling even more economically and environmentally sound.    Another 1,000   Among other factors, the City of Ann Arbor's 91 percent participation rate in curbside recycling has led the City to achieve a 52 percent diversion rate.  The outstanding curbside recycling program collects 23 different commodities, including household batteries, used motor oil, oil filters, textiles, and pots and pans.  Ann Arbor's city-wide multi-family recycling collection covers 24,000 units, over half the city population. Furthermore, the City of Ann Arbor has developed state-of-the-art composting, material recovery, and transfer facilities, and exceeds Federal procurement guidelines for post consumer recycled paper.    The City of Ann Arbor commits to increase the amount of commercial recyclables collected by 50 tons, the amount of material collected at the drop-off station by 200 tons, the quantity of recyclables collected and the volume compostables processed by 500 tons, and the total amount of recyclables delivered to the Material Recovery Facility from all sources by 1,000 tons.      More, More, and More   The City of Burbank diverts 58.3 percent of its waste stream, achieving the State of California's mandated 50 percent waste reduction rate at least two years ahead of schedule. Its used oil center collects over 33,000 gallons of used oil and antifreeze a year. In addition to being recognized for outstanding achievement and innovation in resource conservation, best paper recycling award, best urban program, and other recycling achievements by state and national recycling organizations, the City of Burbank has also been the recipient of three national ""best education program"" awards.    For the Challenge, the City of Burbank has made three commitments to increase its efficiency in recycling.  The first is a commitment to increase the number of multi-family and small businesses recycling by 10 percent.  The second is a commitment to improve the quantity and quality of recyclable materials by maximizing trip loads and minimizing contamination. And the third is a commitment to add textiles to its drop-off program.    Pass the Antifreeze   The City of Dover, NH reduced residential trash generation from 10,500 tons to 4,100 tons in 1998 as a result of a commercial user fee program called ""Bag & Tag"".  Dover was able to collect nearly 3.5 tons of material from single- and multi-family residences in 1999.    The City of Dover will exchange 450 gallons of used antifreeze from residents for new recycled antifreeze, free of charge.  In addition, the City of Dover will collect 1,200 computer units for recycling and donate them to a local business for remanufacturing.  Dover also will introduce a food waste compost program that should divert up to 400 additional tons of recyclable material.  And, Dover plans to introduce recycling of gypsum wallboard and shingles.    Old Clothes/New Uses   The City of Falls Church, VA with a residential waste diversion rate of 67 percent, has been a national leader in recycling.  Falls Church reduced trash collection from twice to once weekly, cut the number of trash crew members from ten to seven, collects a wide variety of recyclable materials, and has year-round yard trimmings collection.  Use of Recycling Block Captains enhances community involvement.  This group, the cornerstone of the City's education program, has over 100 citizen volunteers.     In response to the National Recycling Challenge, the City of Falls Church has established semi-annual Clothing and Textiles Reuse/Recycling as part of its regular program.  Nationally, only 12 percent of used clothing and textiles find their way into reuse programs, with the other 88 percent ending up in incinerators and landfills.  The materials that are collected will be sold to a contractor primarily for reuse.  Materials that cannot be reused will be recycled into carpet backing, car seat and dashboard stuffing, and other useful products.  Expected annual revenues of $1,000 to $2,000 will be used to help defray the costs of publicity and to support other Falls Church City recycling projects.  In addition, as part of its OPERATION EarthWatch program, Falls Church will award 100 percent recycled tee-shirts to elementary students in recognition of their recycling, reuse, and conservation efforts.    Moving Toward Zero Waste   The Los Angeles City Facilities Recycling Program (CFRP) oversees recycling at 525 City-owned and City-leased facilities.  In 1996 and 1997, waste diversion increased by 32.7 percent  and 19 percent, respectively. Its network of 120 City Department Recycling Coordinators catalyzes employee participation from 36,000 City employees in all 525 City facilities. The City of Los Angeles not only diverts material from the waste stream, but also creates markets for recycled materials as well.      In 1997-1998, the City spent $34 million on a diverse list of recycled content products and  conducted 60 buy-recycled workshops citywide to raise awareness about the City's Recycled Products Purchasing Ordinance, the 10 percent Price Preference Ordinance, the Mayor's Buy Recycled Challenge, and the buy-recycled bid and contract language.  Closed loop purchasing of paper and plastic products -- like mail envelopes and recycling bins--is being implemented though a city policy requiring suppliers to source their recycled feedstock from city contract recyclers. The City of Los Angeles has won five state and national awards for its employee education and training, procurement, reuse, waste prevention, and recycling programs.    For the Challenge, the City of Los Angeles will adopt a Zero Waste policy.  A pilot program at a major City facility will be authorized to reduce trash by 10 tons per year, divert an additional seven tons from landfills, and redirect 650 custodial labor hours.  A net gain of $14,000 over the first year of implementation is expected.  The pilot program will expand to at least 40 similar high-rise multi-use facilities after the turn of the century.    Los Angeles also will incorporate recycling requirements into its special events permitting process.  Larger events are expected to collect up to 120 tons of recyclables.  In addition, the City will begin recycling in its Convention Center, which will divert an estimated 100 tons of recyclables from the waste stream each year.    Additionally, the City of Los Angeles will expand its program to recycle construction,  demolition and landclearing materials generated by all 500 City building projects and private sector developments. As part of this effort, 25 major developments (with more than 20,000 square feet of residential or commercial construction) will be identified and assisted in recycling CDL materials and using recycled-content products, per EPA and local procurement guidelines.    The Squeeze   Madison, WI became the first city to start curbside recycling when it began collecting newspapers in 1968.  Since then, the City of Madison has engaged over 97 percent of its residents to separate 18 items from their garbage and divert over 51 percent of its waste stream from the landfill.  In 1999, Madison's solid waste diversion rate was 52.3 percent.    As part of its Challenge commitment, Madison added five compacting recycling trucks to its fleet to improve collection efficiency.  The compacting trucks will remain on route all day, allowing the city to handle the projected population growth (600-800 households/year) through the year 2020 without expanding its fleet.  Madison plans to convert its entire fleet of 12 trucks to compacting trucks by 2004.    In 1999, Madison began collecting computer equipment for recycling.  After just one year of  Madison's ""Sustainable Lifestyle Campaign"", the City exceeded its goal to decrease waste generation by participating households by 25 percent in the first year of the program!  The participating households reduced their solid waste generation an average of  395 pounds, a 39 percent decrease.    Small Business, Big Numbers   The City and County of San Francisco, California have reduced their waste stream by more than one-third through recycling, including diverting more than 62,000 tons a year through a comprehensive curbside program which accepts more than 14 different kinds of recyclables.  The recycling program has awarded more than $10 million in grants to community based organizations and businesses for recycling, buying recycled, and waste prevention projects.    The City and County of San Francisco commit to add more than 6,600 small businesses to the small business curbside recycling program. In addition, the City and County of San Francisco commit to institute a mixed paper recycling program in 130 City facilities with approximately 17,000 employees, and implement comprehensive recycling and recycled product procurement programs for all 65 government departments.    5% Less Cost   The City of Bellevue, WA has achieved the State of Washington's highest single family recycling rate -- an astounding 61 percent.  Furthermore, 97 percent of multi-family residences in Bellevue recycle an average of 21.1 pounds of materials per unit each month, contributing to a 24 percent multi-family recycling rate -- one of the highest in the State.  In addition, the City of Bellevue has established an innovative Closed Loop Oil Recycling and Education Program (CLOREP) that facilitates private sector motor oil and oil filter collection from the general public, and promotes re-refined oil to retailers, the public, and fleets.  Bellevue's outstanding recycling program has been the recipient of state and national awards for recycling innovations, information and education programs, best government and volunteer recycling program, multi-family recycling, closed-loop recycling, and over-all solid waste program.    The City of Bellevue commits to reducing the cost of recycling for the community by lowering the monthly multi-family recycling service fee by 5 percent.  In addition to reducing costs, the City of Bellevue commits to increasing recovery rates by working to achieve a 65 percent single-family recycling rate by the end of 2000, and to increase the multi-family recycling rate to 25 percent by the end of 1999.    To the Max   Palo Alto, CA started recycling in 1971 and has received more than 15 state and national awards since 1983.  Today, Palo Alto's curbside recycling program collects 30 commodities, including oil filters, batteries, and used motor oil.  The City's 80 percent participation rate contributes to the City's outstanding 52 percent waste diversion rate.  The City has adopted several policies to support its recycling efforts.  A procurement policy favors recycled content products. Construction and demolition policies require asphalt and concrete to be recycled, while demolition project permits require the submission of waste management and recycling plans.  Composting in Palo Alto started as early as 1977 and today, its facility processes 17,000 tons of yard trimmings each year.  Palo Alto's recycling program also features school recycling programs, commercial recycling programs, and a variable rate waste collection fee structure.    In support of the National Recycling Challenge, the City of Palo Alto commits to maximize its recovery from the waste stream while minimizing operating costs.  In the year 2000, the City will expand its curbside collection program to a wider variety of paper and plastics and improve recycling at special City-side events..  The City will reduce the composting processing time for yard trimmings, upgrade recycling equipment, simplify collection by changing from source-separate to co-mingled collection where possible, and obtain local approval to add mixed paper and high density polyethylene (number 2) plastic to the residential curbside collection program.  The City's long range plans include studying ways to improve construction and demolition debris recycling, expand commercial composting, and create a recycling education center for the community.    A Green Lab   The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is achieving impressive recycling results, with thousands of tons of paper products and automotive materials recycled yearly.  Building on these accomplishments, DOE is striving to make more advances in the areas of pollution prevention, affirmative procurement, and recycling.    The Department's National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) will become a ""model"" site and share the lessons learned and best practices with others to further augment efficiency in recycling across federal government, industry, and local communities.  Using 14 recycling collection points on the campus, with designated recycling coordinators responsible for each of the collection points, NREL currently recycles paper, containers, and aluminum cans.   The NREL web site contains a ""Recycling"" home page to inform employees about recycling progress.  In addition, NREL currently purchases only recycled content paper and toner cartridges.      NREL commits to increasing the quantities and types of materials recycled, build on existing public/private partnerships, and furnish procurement representatives and suppliers with recycling vendor contact information.  On January 31, 2000, NREL convened ""NREL Sustainability Vision, Goals and Strategies,"" a one-day internal conference to establish future sustainability goals for each building.  Included agenda topics were capital requests, operating budgets for sustainability, energy use, recycling, and transportation.    Paperless   The National Science Foundation (NSF) has long been committed to recycling activities.  The agency purchases 30 percent recycled content copier paper.  Contract clauses instruct contractors to use two-sided copying.  The agency's internal web site provides information on recycling activities.     NSF's long-term Challenge commitment is to establish an efficient, streamlined  paperless environment. The agency plans to have a web-based proposal and award system fully implemented for all awards, from program announcement to award closeout, by October 2000.  This system will enable NSF to process competitive proposals submitted electronically through the entire proposal and award/declination process without generating paper within NSF.  NSF is well on the way to achieving this goal.  The agency set an interim goal of receiving 25 percent of contract proposals electronically for FY99 and far exceeded that goal by receiving 60 percent of proposals electronically during FY99.     Stepping up to the Challenge   The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) is achieving dramatic recycling success.  Early in 1995, an internal goal of increasing recycling by 50 percent was achieved several years early, when recycling increased by 59 percent.  In addition, the amount of solid waste disposed was decreased by 23 percent over the same time period.    Being a results oriented agency, DoD has stepped up to the plate for the Challenge and committed that by the end of FY05, the diversion rate for non-hazardous solid waste will be greater than 40 percent, while ensuring that integrated non-hazardous solid waste management programs provide an economic benefit when compared with disposal using landfilling and incineration alone.    DoD challenged all of its agencies to work toward this goal.  Due to expansion of the program to include construction and demolition debris, initial progress data are not yet in; however, DoD is very optimistic that good progress is being made toward the FY05 goal.    Using Local Resources   The Naval Security Group Activity Northwest has recycled more than 3 million pounds of material since 1990.  The program includes drop-off igloo containers in housing and barracks areas, curb-side collection of recyclables, recycling of expended brass shells from the base firing range, and recycling of other scrap metal.  The NSGA also purchases recycled content products.    In order to increase recycling efficiency, the recycling program was moved from the Supply Department into the Public Works Department, and recycling was privatized in late 1998.  The Southeastern Public Service Authority (SPSA) collects recyclables at curbside on the base as well as from the City of Chesapeake, VA, and take those recyclables directly to Tidewater Fiber, a local MRF with whom SPSA contracts.      Solid waste contracts require waste haulers to transport collected trash and recyclable materials to SPSA and the Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) Plant, where recyclables are separated from solid waste.  By using co-collection of trash and recyclables, the program increased its recycling potential from under 50 percent to close to 100 percent.  Additionally, the RDF Plant provides fuel to operate the Naval Shipyard Steam Power Plant.  This conserves valuable landfill space and enables the Navy to save $1 million in energy costs annually.     Partners and Integration   Since 1991, the recycling program at the University of Virginia (UVA) has steadily grown to divert 3,100 tons of material annually.  With a recycling rate of 30 percent and plans to increase to 50 percent, the University has increased the types of items collected and expanded operations while in the meantime providing ease and convenience for the University community.  The program has re-engineered systems to have better efficiencies and economies of scale.   Collection and processing has been automated to increase market value. UVA's reuse of medical supply program, MERC, has generated more than 100 tons of materials for third world countries and clinics.    In response to the National Recycling Challenge, the University of Virginia will establish working arrangements with other large institutions throughout the state (George Mason, Virginia Tech, James Madison, and Virginia Commonwealth) to integrate their systems to improve markets, standardize employee job functions and collection methods, and reduce costs.  In addition, UVA will implement a food waste composting program in conjunction with its leaf and yard trimmings composting and will develop an event recycling system for diverting waste from certain university ceremonies.    Small in Size Only   The College of Wooster, OH is a small liberal arts school of 1700 students but boasts one of the best recycling programs among small Ohio colleges.  The College's recycling program began in 1990 through student volunteer efforts as a result of a senior independent study project.  Today, 15 students and a full-time coordinator work for the program, collecting 22 items for recycling, including clothing and furniture for reuse.  In addition to traditional recyclables, the College collect such innovative items as computers, 6-pack rings, batteries, and 35 mm film canisters.  In the first 11 months of the 1999-00 school year alone, the program recycled more than 290,000 pounds of materials and generated more than $4,000 in revenue.  The College also makes use of the Resident Assistants and Resident Directors, offering them the opportunity to learn about recycling by volunteering for a recycling run.      The College of Wooster commits to expand its recycling program through innovative practices and policies. The College will expand its Resident Assistants program from 17 RAs to 30.  It partnered with Wayne County Environmental Services to provide local drop off locations within the City of Wooster, including an on-campus site, to provide local recycling opportunities.  This created an outlet for faculty, staff, and local residents to drop off their containers, magazines, newspapers, and corrugated.  The College recycling program also is assisting students at Ohio State University's Agricultural Technical Institute to gain approval of a campus recycling proposal and plans to partner with Wayne College on a recycling program, as well.    Increasing Efficiency   Berea College, KY has increased its recycling output by almost 400 percent since 1992 and today enjoys a 30 percent waste diversion rate. A recent waste audit helped waste management officials to identify opportunities to improve its recycling program.    Based on the audit results, Berea College commits to increase its recycling efficiency for the National Recycling Challenge. The Berea College will increase collection of recyclables by upgrading its solid waste and recycling equipment by July 1, 1999.  Electric Club-Cars to pick up recyclables from 50 campus facilities via sidewalks, and 1-2 bailers to increase the collection capacity for paper and cardboard will be the first investments. Berea College also commits to expand the current food waste composting program by 400 percent. In addition, Berea College commits to implement a campus paper reduction program, including a mass mailing policy that restricts the level of mass mailings, double-sided copying, and increased use of electronic communication. Berea College also commits to establishing a Construction and Demolition recycling and reuse program and installing more outdoor recycling receptacles.    More Recycling   Last year, Virginia Tech Recycling collected approximately 1,600 tons of recyclables, received more than $30,000 in revenues from these recyclables, and saved $35,000 in landfill disposal fees.  After close examination of in-house solid waste collection, Virginia Tech eliminated one solid waste collection route, at no loss of service to campus, and shifted two permanent staff positions to recycling, at an annual cost savings of $17,800.  A yard trimmings composting facility, established through cooperation between Virginia Tech Recycling and Virginia Tech Grounds Department, annually processes approximately 366 tons of leaves and brush, which are returned to campus as mulch or soil amendment.  Virginia Tech recycling has been instrumental to the planning for and continued success of the $3 million Montgomery Regional Solid Waste Authority's Recycling Center, the largest publically-owned facility in the Commonwealth of Virginia, which processes 5,600 tons of recyclables annually.    In response to the National Recycling Challenge, Virginia Tech Recycling has committed to improve collection totals for aluminum cans by 15 percent to 24 tons annually; 15 percent for sorted white ledger paper by 15 percent to 182 tons annually; and for corrugated cardboard by 20 percent to 255 tons annually.  In addition, Virginia Tech intends to increase its diversion rate by expanding and improving its yard trimmings composting facility to include an additional 1.5 acres for leaf and grass composting, purchasing self-propelled windrow turner, and expanding cooperation with local municipalities.    Virginia Tech Recycling also commits to increase the efficiency of both solid waste and corrugated cardboard routes through purchases of winch, rear load collection containers and a new paper truck.    New Business Recycling   Waste Cap of Massachusetts, a partnership between Massachusetts businesses and the Department of Environmental Protection, is a nonprofit organization created to help businesses in Massachusetts reduce and recycle non-hazardous solid waste.  Waste Cap has helped over 2,500 Massachusetts companies make waste reduction and recycling a regular part of their business practices.  In 1998, 22 office buildings competing in a Waste Cap sponsored contest recycled 2,236 tons of material in three months and achieved impressive recycling rates of up to 76 percent per building.  Waste Cap has also conducted 108 site visits to Massachusetts companies and institutions resulting in significant increases in types and quantities of materials recycled.    For the Challenge, Waste Cap commits to create recycling cooperatives to help small businesses find efficient and cost-effective recycling programs. In addition, Waste Cap commits to recruit 50 new businesses to start recycling through a recycling cooperative.    Electrifying Recycling   Southern California Edison is the second-largest electric utility in the U.S., with a total generating capacity of 14,000 megawatts and assets exceeding $18 billion.  It provides electricity to a 50,000 square-mile region covering central, coastal, and southern California and containing more than 11 million people.  Edison began it's Waste-Not recycling program in 1993 and recycles paper, toner cartridges, corrugated, aluminum, metal, wood, carpet, construction materials, glass, plastic and other materials. In 1999, Edison recycled 85 percent of all of the solid waste materials that it handled.  Edison also donated used office materials and furnishings to over 200 California charitable organizations and schools, offered significant consumer incentive programs to recycle old refrigerators and washing machines, built an artificial reef off the coast of California with recycled concrete, recycled green waste, and provided nursery stock to support forestlands in the Sierras.    For the National Recycling Challenge, Southern California Edison will work to improve the efficiency of its recycling programs by reducing the number of recycling methods used and developing a company recycling standard by the end of 2000.  Edison's goal is to improve it's recycling record, while reducing solid waste management expenses and providing accurate and timely reporting.  The new process may include information technology adaptations, physical facility and contractual process changes, strategic sourcing partner development, educational and employee developmental improvements, materials market development and budget/funding changes.  Edison will work through its public affairs managers to share the recycling model. It also plans to promote recycling by providing community and employee training about recycling."

From an initial list of five products in the 1980s, Federal agencies and government contractors now buy 54 different types of recycled content products daily, ranging from office supplies, to building materials, to re-refined oil and retread tires.  Government purchases in 1997 for certain Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designated recycled content products exceeded  $350 million  -- an increase of $112 million a year, or 30 percent over the 1992 level.  The most notable success for the program is in copier paper purchases.  The General Services Administration and the Government Printing Office, the two largest suppliers of copier paper, in just 18 months after the enactment of E.O.13101 in 1998, reported that agencies increased their purchases of compliant recycled content paper to 98 percent from 12 percent.    The Task Force has promoted new and innovative procurement practices, such as ""substitution policies,"" to increase Federal agencies' purchases of green products.  Agencies request that the supplying agency automatically substitute recycled content, environmentally preferable or energy efficient products in place of any orders for non-recycled content or non-compliant products.  Several of the agencies have begun to use this approach in filling orders for re-refined motor oil.  The results are astonishing; in FY 2000, 87 percent of all purchases of motor oil from Defense Supply Center Richmond, one of Federal government's largest suppliers of motor oil, was re-refined oil.    The Task Force promoted two additional mechanisms to increase agency purchases of green products: incentive contracts and closed loop contracts.  Incentive contracts provide financial incentives for identifying and using ""green"" products.  Closed loop contracts allow agencies to purchase certain products, such as oil, tires or toner cartridges, with the added benefit of having the contractor also pick-up any resulting waste for recycling.  This eliminates the administrative costs of disposal contracts and the environmental concerns surrounding disposal.    To continue promoting green purchasing, a new Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) rule was published on June 6, 2000 to incorporate the E.O. 13101 provisions.  The language is very strong and incorporates ""green"" considerations throughout the acquisition process, from pre-proposal design to proposal evaluation, to contract administration.  It specifically covers the President's directive to Federal agencies to use only recycled content copier paper.  It also specifies that RCRA section 6002 and the E.O. buy-recycled directives apply to micro-purchases (less than $2,500), retains provisions about affirmative procurement (buy recycled) programs, and retains the requirement that contractors provide documents printed or copied double-sided in order to save paper and energy.    The Task Force provided technical support in the drafting of two new Executive Orders on greening environmental management and fleet and transportation. Working in close coordination with CEQ,  OMB,  EPA, DOE and other agencies, the Task Force helped set a new course for the Federal government to enhance performance on environmental management, environmental compliance, community right-to-know, reduced petroleum consumption through improvements in fleet fuel efficiency and the use of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) and alternative fuels.  For example, agencies are required to revise their specifications and to purchase paper products using environmentally benign adhesives, thus removing a major contaminant in paper recycling efforts.  New directives strengthen agency purchases of re-refined motor vehicle lubricating oils, retread tires, and biobased motor vehicle products.     The Task Force has worked with GSA, JWOD and SBA to intensify the use of ""green.com"" sites, and modify existing electronic catalogs and  contract schedules to further promote use of  recycled content, environmentally preferable and bio-based products and services. Efforts include the greening of Pro-Net -- an electronic gateway of procurement information on more than 195,000 small, disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone, and women-owned businesses -- to allow small businesses that offer green products and services to be highlighted in the database.       Raising ""Green"" Awareness     The Task Force has been very successful in raising the awareness of greening practices and the need to procure green goods and services. Publications such as ""Recycling...for the Future - Consider the benefits"" and ""Recycling...for the future - It's everybody's business,"" prepared by the Task Force and EPA, document the environmental, economic and energy benefits of recycling, highlight success stories, and dispel misconceptions that recycling is not economically viable. The Task Force also issues a quarterly newsletter to 4,000 subscribers that provides the latest information pertaining to Federal acquisition, recycling, and waste prevention.     The Task Force prepared a practical guide, ""Greening the Government: A Guide to Implementing Executive Order 13101,"" in an effort to help Federal agencies further improve their environmental performance in this area and in other greening the government activities.  It is geared to help both beginners and experts and provides comprehensive guidance for implementing E.O. 13101, including examples of successful agency programs.    The Task Force also conducted high-level government summits and workshops to promote participation and support from senior level management in all sectors of the government and allow positive exchanges in addressing emerging environmental challenges.  For example, the Task Force sponsored a White House Workshop on Recycling with key industry, government, and non-governmental organizations, three White House Paper Summits, and two Re-refined Oil Summits.    With support from the Task Force, EPA launched a campaign to promote Federal agency participation in ""WasteWise,"" a voluntary partnership program designed to help organizations find practical and cost-effective methods for reducing municipal solid waste.  More than 900 companies and organizations from across the country participate in WasteWise, representing 50 industry sectors ranging from aerospace to utilities, governments, and institutions. The WasteWise expansion will help Federal agencies comply with the Greening the Government Executive Orders by helping them increase their waste prevention and recycling activities. Agency participation will also provide Federal facilities an important tool to measure and quantify their efforts.      Providing ""Green"" Training and Education     Education and training are key components to the overall success of Executive Order 13101.  The Task Force has conducted training on green purchasing for procurement personnel, engineers, and program personnel.  The Task Force worked with DoD to include training on RCRA and E.O. 13101 as part of the DOD Senior Contracting course for DoD and services contracting personnel.  The Task Force sponsored a workshop for Defense Acquisition University (DAU) staff and course directors to help them incorporate green purchasing information into the DAU curriculum. Work has also started with the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) to offer a free, web-based course for procurement and program personnel on E.O. implementation and green purchasing in general.    For the past five years, the Task Force has partnered with the National Recycling Coalition, a non-profit association committed to promoting recycling, to provide Federal educational sessions during the annual National Recycling Congress.   Topics range from basic information on recycling program design to affirmative procurement to cutting-edge issues that will shape recycling's future well into the new millennium.  Federal participation in the National Recycling Congress has increased significantly over the past five years.    The Task Force maintains a web site,  www.ofee.gov , to provide agencies and the public with access to information resources on environmental policies and practices, documented success stories, and available products and services to promote the greening of the government.      Praising Green Successes     The White House Closing the Circle Awards Program, started in 1995, recognizes Federal employees and their facilities for efforts which result in significant contributions to, or have made a significant impact on, recycling, waste prevention, and purchasing of recycled-content and environmentally preferable products.  To date, more than 120 programs have received White House Closing the Circle Awards in waste prevention, recycling, affirmative procurement, environmental preferability, model facilities, and advancing the objectives of Executive Order 13101.      Outreach Beyond the Federal Community     The Task Force has reached out - not just to the Federal sector - but to government at all levels, businesses, and consumers, to ensure that recycling is sustainable in the United States.  The Task Force is a founding sponsor of America Recycles Day (ARD), an annual celebration that brings together government officials, environmental organizations, and manufacturing industries with the shared objective of increasing recycling and the purchase of recycled content products.  This national event was launched as an effort to educate millions of Americans about the environmental and economic benefits of recycling and buying recycled content products.  ARD includes the participation of all 50 states and over 130 public and private organizations.    In 1998, the Office of the Vice President, with the support of the Task Force, issued the ""National Recycling Challenge"" to government agencies at all levels, American businesses and industries, colleges and universities, and others.  He challenged them to make a commitment to help make recycling more sustainable in the United States.  More than 70 organizations have made commitments - including Federal, state, and local government agencies, major businesses, and the steel, aluminum, paper, plastic, and remanufacturing industries.    In July 2000, the Task Force conducted a Government to Government: Smart Green Purchasing Meeting with representatives from state, county and local offices.  The meeting featured several breakout sessions which helped the group define the issues associated with purchasing environmentally preferable products, pool knowledge and experiences, identify fundamental problems, and come up with new ideas to take back to their respective jurisdictions.      Documenting Successes     The Task Force, in close coordination with OMB, prepares biennial reports to Congress in accordance with RCRA Section 6002, documenting the progress agencies have made in purchasing recycled content products and implementing other waste prevention initiatives. For example, from 1992 to 1997, major Federal procuring agencies, such as the Departments of Defense, Energy and Transportation, spent almost $2 billion on selected recycled content products.   Also, data reported by six Federal agencies (DOE, DOT, VA, NASA, GSA, and USPS) indicate that the dollar value of recyclables collected was approximately $5.8 million in 1996, almost doubling to $11 million in 1997.  Five agencies (DOE, DOT, VA, NASA, and GSA) reported that 100 percent of their offices operated active recycling programs in 1996.    The Task Force, in close cooperation with the Climate Change Task Force, EPA, DOE, and OMB, prepared the first ever ""Greening the Government: A Report to the President on Federal Leadership and Progress.""  The report, released by the Vice President on Earth Day 2000, documents the significant progress Federal agencies have made over the past decade in achieving energy efficiency, recycling, pollution prevention, and purchasing recycled content and environmentally preferable products and services.      Planning for a Greener Future     In March 1999, the Task Force published a government-wide Strategic Plan for waste prevention, recycling, and Federal acquisition to define the program goals and provide the road maps to reach these goals. One of the unique aspects of the Plan includes the establishment of a new and aggressive national recycling goal for the federal government of 35 percent waste diversion by 2005.  All Federal agencies are expected to advance toward this national goal with their respective waste diversion programs. The Plan also requires Federal agencies to demonstrate significant increases in the procurement of recycled content products from each preceding year through 2005.    One important and challenging area being examined is that of better tracking and reporting of Federal agencies' progress in meeting the buy-recycled and other green purchasing requirements.  The Office of Federal Procurement Policy of OMB and the Task Force formed a reporting workgroup composed of representatives from many government agencies to find new ways to streamline and automate reporting on purchases of recycled content products.  The work group achieved consensus on several methods to improve reporting and prepared recommendations to the Agency Environmental Executives and the White House Steering Committee to improve, streamline, and simplify reporting and tracking of agencies' purchases.  The report was submitted to the Steering Committee on November 22, 2000 after AEE concurrence.    The Task Force is facilitating an Electronics De-manufacturing Work Group  to pursue future common strategies for developing and implementing environmentally preferable and energy efficient practices and technologies throughout the life cycle of electronic equipment.  An MOU between several key Federal agencies is in the signature process.    EPA, in coordination with the Task Force, completed a guidance document to assist agencies in determining the environmental preferability of products and services.  Executive Order 13101 encourages agencies to test and evaluate the principles outlined in the guidance on products and services that have the greatest use within the Federal government.  To date, there are twenty six (26) active pilot projects.  The results of these test projects will help the government's future efforts to move into an even greater ""environmentally preferable"" direction.    The Task Force has also  been working with several agencies to develop markets for sustainable construction materials.  EPA has developed a common data base for green specifications and placed it on their web site. We worked with GSA to incorporate waste prevention, recycling, and green product clauses into building leases. We have also included construction as one of the topics in our training sessions.  The future focus is to provide additional planning tools to help construction designers and contractors include sustainable material in their buildings and develop a training module for acquisition professionals on the requirement to use sustainable construction materials.        Additional ""Green"" Accomplishments     Executive Order 13101 also addresses the purchase of biobased products to develop markets for these items.  Biobased products come from agricultural, marine, and  forestry resources and provide renewable raw materials for the processing and manufacturing of a broad range of non-food and non-feed products, such as chemicals, fibers, construction materials, and energy sources.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture, in conjunction with the Task Force,  published the process to be used to list biobased products for agency use. This notice includes an initial list of product categories and products that USDA is considering listing in a Biobased Products List.    Executive Order 13101directed EPA to add  buy-recycled requirements to the multi-media compliance audits of Federal facilities conducted under the Federal Facility Compliance Act.  EPA, in coordination with the Task Force, developed compliance inspection guidance and began inspecting Federal facility compliance with the buy-recycled requirements.  During the first year of implementation, compliance inspections focused primarily on awareness of the acquisition requirements and assessment of compliance assistance needs at the field level.    In 1993, the President announced the ""Greening of the White House"" initiative to cut waste, improve energy efficiency, increase recycling and the use of recycled content products, and save money.  The White House's running track, for example, is composed of rubber recovered from used tires and windshield wipers, the staff at the Executive Complex uses copier paper with at least 30 percent postconsumer content, and the President even changed the composition of his personal stationary to a 30 percent postconsumer cotton product."

""Recycling at Work"" is a program designed especially for people in charge of workplace recycling programs.   It provides all the necessary tools to make an office paper recycling program successful, including sample memos, motivational materials, step-by-step instructions for educating employees, and a guide for measure results.   Whether you're just beginning a recycling program, or you need to reinvigorate a program that's been in place for years, ""Recycling at Work"" is proven successful in increasing recycling rates in offices and office buildings both large and small.   When you join ""Recycling at Work,"" you participate with a national network of building managers and recycling coordinator who are committed to changing the environment at work.   Welcome!   ""As a recycling coordinator, quality promotional materials boost my inhouse recycling program.  And since I don't have access or the budge for an advertising agency, ""Recycling at Work"" solves the problem for me.""   Jonathan Bectel Fullertech Corporation   CHAPTER Two   Why Improve Recycling in your Building?   How times have changed!  As recently as two to three years ago, people embraced recycling with such zeal, that more paper was collected than we knew what to do with.  Today, the demand for recycled paper continues to grow, creating strong markets for recovered paper fiber.  If recycling is to continue, workers must recycle even more quantities of office paper in order to meet the project demands of paper mills who have invested billions of dollars into new equipment for manufacturing recycled products.   This is good for building managers and recycling coordinators who stand to gain enormous benefits from running efficient recycling programs.  Through increased promotion and education programs like ""Recycling at Work,"" building managers can earn rebates, avoid trash disposal costs, and provide the crucial supply of recovered fiber that mills need by collecting cleaner and more quantities of paper from existing recycling programs.   ""The ""Recycling at Work"" program helps building owners and managers with their bottom line, as well as with compliance of the city's commercial recycling ordinance.  Since the flexibility of the ordinance encourages competition among recycling service providers for the building's business, boosting employee participation helps hold costs down for everyone.""   - Paul Colgan, Public Affairs Director for the Building Owners and Managers Association of Chicago   CHAPTER Three   How to Begin recycling at work   Successful recycling requires a closed-loop collection and buy- recycled program.  Follow the steps below to implement your office building's recycling program.  Refer to the following pages for sample memos and worksheets to help kick-off the program and track your results.   The essential recycling at work checklist:   *    Figure out how much paper your organization or office building      generates      *    Pick a recycling service provider       *    Provide enough recycling bins for the building.    *    Create enough storage space to collect the paper.    *    Provide easy access for pick-ups by the recycling service      provider                              *    Write down the rules of your program, standardizing such      things as, ""what can and cannot be recycled,"" ""how to replace      lost recycling bins,"" and ""what to do with old phone books.""      *    Invite office managers, maintenance staff, and facilities      managers to a training session with the recycling service      provider.  Include those who purchase office products so they      learn which products can and cannot be recycled in the      building.                                                    *    Promote ""Recycling at Work"" materials throughout the building.       Hang banners in the lobby, place posters near recycling bins.       *    Circulate a ""how-to recycle"" memo to all employees in the      building.  Make on-going provisions for training new      employees.             *    Host a ""Recycling at Work"" kick-off event in the lobby.  Make      sure the event focuses on recycling in addition to games and      giveaways.  Take photos, and place with an article in the      company newsletter.         *    Track building's recycling activities, post the results.   *    Close the loop.  Encourage office managers to buy recycled      paper.  Purchase only recycled products for the building.    How much paper does your office or building generate for recycling?    A paper recycling program is designed around the type and volume of paper recovered in the office or building.  Recovered paper is divided into several grades of varying value to recyclers.  Before you pick a recycler, you will want to know approximately how much paper can be collected.  Most common programs divide grades by mixed office paper and by high-grade white.  Cardboard, newspaper, and file stock are collected too.   To make an approximation of how much paper your office or building generates, estimate this way:   # of employees in the building __________ X 1.36 lbs. office paper per day X 240 working days a year = amount of recovered fiber the building produces each year.   Another way to estimate paper recovery potential is to assume that 70% of everything thrown away in an office building is paper. Check current trash hauling records to see how much money the building spends on trash according to volume, weight, or number of pulls.  Multiply this amount by 70% to estimate how much paper can be recycled.  Adjust the percentage up or down depending on whether your building has more restaurants or insurance firms.   ""Recycling in a multi-tenant building can be complicated.  I wanted to make sure that I communicated effectively with the different types of tenants in order to meet their individual needs. ""Recycling at Work"" helps me organize a program where no-one is left out.""  - Juanita Stone   MJ Associates, Los Angeles   Questions you should ask the recycling service provider   *    What types of paper do they collect? cardboard? newspaper?      copier?  magazines?  *    What is considered a contaminant?  (envelopes? groundwood?      colored paper?)  *    How should the paper be prepared for pick-up?  *    Will pick-ups be scheduled regularly, or must a call be made      each time?  *    Will they service different floors, or a single site only?  *    Will the cost of recycling service remain fixed or fluctuate      with market prices?  *    Will they pay you for your paper?  How much?  *    Will the rebates depend on quantity or cleanliness?  *    Which is more economical, to collect less valuable but more      paper (as in a mixed office waste program), or to collect more      valuable, but less paper (as in a grade separation program)?      How about a wet/dry separation system for all recyclables?  *    Will recycling bins be provided?  How many?  How much will      they cost?  Can they be replaced?  How much space is needed?  *    How long is the recycling service contract for?  *    In many cases, your trash hauler and your recycling service      provider are one in the same.  Can the current trash contract      be re-negotiated to reflect a lower volume of trash?   ""Since paper typically makes up most of our waste stream, recycling the paper is economical for two reasons.  First, I save money throwing less into the dumpster.  Then, on top of the money I save, I receive a rebate from our recycling service provider because the paper is clean and a lot of it.""   - Stan Paley   Director of Facilities   Grand tower, Detroit   Sample Memo to Building Employees   Your office recycling program will have a great chance of succeeding if every building employee understands the recycling procedure and knows that the program has support from company management.  Start educating office workers by distributing a building-wide memo (either on recycled paper, or by e-mail) announcing the program kick-off date and location.  If possible, have upper management of principal tenants or the building owner sign the memo.  Of course you will have to adapt the sample memo to include specific instructions for your recycling program.  Don't forget to include the ""Recycling at Work"" logo on your memo!        Memo to:  Tenants, Office Managers, Employees, Maintenance      Staff           From:  Building Management               Re:  ""Recycling at Work"" program                Don't Trash this memo, Recycle it!  Today marks the first      day of our new building-wide recycling program called ""Recycle      at Work.""                ""Recycling at Work"" is an on-going recycling initiative      designed to increase recycling rates in office buildings such      as ours.  It has proven successful in office buildings across      the country, and I am convinced that implementing ""Recycling      at Work"" in our building will save money, promote      environmental stewardship, and create a sense of pride among      those of us who work here.  Please take a moment to notice the      recycling messages placed throughout the building.             Since our building houses _______ number of employees, we      generate a whopping _______ amount of paper each year that      will now be recycled into new products instead of ending up in      a landfill Clean and plentiful recovered fiber has substantial      value these days, therefore consider our recycling program      standard business practice in this building.             Please attend the ""Recycling at Work"" kick-off event      during the morning of ___________ in the lobby of the      building.  Refreshments will be served by (building vender)      and our recycling hauler will be on hand to answer questions.      Instructions for how to recycle at your desk are attached.  If      you need more information about ""Recycling at Work,"" contact      ____________.             As participants of ""Recycling at Work,"" this building is      linked to a national network of office workers who are      committed to changing the environment at work.  As the program      progresses, I will keep you all informed of the money we save      and the amount of resources we conserve by recycling.  Thanks      for participating!   CHAPTER Four   Promoting recycling at work in Your Building   On-going communications with employees in the building is the key to successful recycling.  Now that you have standardized the recycling procedure and have sent memos to all employees explaining how to participate, it is time to generate enthusiasm for your program.  Here are a few ideas to motivate employees as you set the stage for the ""Recycling at Work kick-off event.   Refer to page 12 for the ""Recycling at Work promotional materials.   *    Create awareness throughout your building before the kick-off      event with prominent recycling sinage.  Hang a ""Recycling at      Work"" banner in your lobby.  Place posters on every floor in      visible locations.  *    Display messages through the windows of the building.  Have      the building engineers or facility managers light certain      windows at night to form the recycling symbol or chasing      arrows.  *    Distribute ""I'm recycling at work"" stickers and/or t-shirts on      every employees chair the night before the program kick-off.      Ask workers to wear the shirts to the event.  *    Use the ""recycling at work"" logo slicks on all memorandum and      in the company newsletter.  *    Send a news release to the local media and invite them to      cover the kick-off event or the lighting display.  *    Create a recycling display alongside the banners in your lobby      which describes what paperscan be recycled versus which cannot      be recycled.  Ask your recycling service provider for props if      necessary.  *    Construct a ""Recycling Goal"" sign to leave in the lobby.  Fill      in the sign as you track your building's progress over the      months.  Include an incentive for employees to reach the goal      together.  *    Partner with a restaurant in your building, and ask the      manager to distribute recycling information at the tables, or      offer a free meal sweepstakes to participating employees.   Promotional Materials   The materials featured on this page are available by contacting the National Office Paper Recycling Project or referring to the enclosed order form.   Banners (6' x 8' horizontal)       Posters (20"" x 30"" horizontal)                       T-Shirts          Stickers (1 7/8"" x 2 1/4"")      Logo Slicks (8 1/2"" x 11"")        ""The materials are tasteful enough for the lobby, and the Earth Day event we held in the building was both fun for the tenants and educational.  I didn't have to re-invent the wheel or spend extra money creating materials that were already available to me.""         - Cindy O'Drobinak   Property Manager for the Santa Fe Building, Chicago, IL  Recycling Fact Sheet    As you begin your building recycling program, you'll probably be asked a number of questions.  Impress your questioners with a handful of the following recycling facts:   FACT:     More than 12 million tons of waste paper is generated           each year in the U.S. by office workers.  (National           office Paper Recycling Project)   FACT:     New York City is the largest generator of office waste           paper in the country, followed by Washington, D.C. (2nd),           and Chicago (3rd).  (National Office Paper Recycling           Project)   FACT:     While it's estimated that paper makes up an average of           37.5 percent of the waste stream, in offices the           percentage may be as high as 70 percent.  (Franklin           Associates)   FACT:     Recycling adds up quickly - a typical company with 65           employees (generating 1.35 lbs.  of waste paper per day)           could collect 500 lbs. of waste paper in less than six           working days.  (National Office Paper Recycling Project)   FACT:     American businesses throw away enough office waste paper           each year to fill nearly 20 Sears towers from top to           bottom.  (National Office Paper Recycling Project)   FACT:     Americans throw out 160 million tons of garbage each           year, enough to bury 27,000 football fields in layer of           garbage 10 feet deep.  (Waste Alternatives Magazine)   NOTE:  These facts are available in quiz form on the following page.  You can photocopy this quiz onto your building letterhead for distribution to employees.

""Stepping up communications with the tenants really makes a difference on our bottom line.  We're able to capture more paper, and because employees are educated, the loads are cleaner.""   - Jocelyn Bender   Building Manager   American Heritage Building                       FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE   Contact Building Manager                  ""Recycling at Work"" campaign launches                          at (building name)        Starting immediately, office workers at (building name or      address) will find it easier to recycle.  The (building      name/office has joined the ""Recycling at Work"" campaign to      make collecting recovered fiber as easy as possible.        Since (building) generates _____ amount of office paper each      year, ""Recycling at Work"" will help reduce our contribution to      the wastestream while supplying valuable fiber to paper mills      who need it to manufacture new products.        The program will be officially launched (date/time) when we      will host a kick-off event in our lobby.  Everyone in the      building is invited to participate.        (Building's name) new ""Recycling at Work"" program is part of      a nationwide effort to create a supply of paper for recycling      and to help develop markets for recycled paper fiber.  As      participants in the program, (building name) will track      results and promote the purchase of recycled paper products.        Keep your eyes open for the promotional materials throughout      the building, and remember to make ""Recycling at Work"" your      business.   CHAPTER Five                  recycling at work Kick-off Ideas   A great way to educate employees about ""Recycling at Work"" is to host a lobby kick-off event.  A morning event allows you to reach people on their way into work.  Invite the building owner, the maintenance staff, members from the local media, and the recycling service provider along with employees of the building.   Here are a few ideas that can be adapted to any budget.  As the program unfolds, you can host different events to keep awareness up for the program.  No matter which promotional idea you use to kick- off ""Recycling at Work,"" remember to use the event as a platform to instruct employees about recycling in the building.  (Employees may otherwise wind up eating free food without taking away the more important educational message!)  Distribute recycling instructions, pass out recycling stickers, introduce the recycling displays, let employees ask questions.   1)  3 Point Shoot-Out   Create a shooting contest in your building lobby with recyclable paper balls.  This activity adds a sense of fun to recycling and re-inforces the idea of throwing office paper in the proper bin. The event can be as simple as placing a recycling container in the middle of the lobby floor, or as elaborate as attaching a recycling bin to an actual basketball blackboard.  Divide office workers into teams to promote teamwork in the building.  Team members can be differentiated by ""Recycling at Work"" t-shirts.  Mark off the three-point line with tape on the floor.  Incorporate rules about the building's recycling program into the game rules, such as team members may only score if they answer a question about ""Recycling at Work"" correctly.   2)  Recycling Jeopardy   Have representatives from each office in the building sit on the panel of contestants.  The building manager acts as the host, giving ""the answer"" about the building's recycling program, while employees on the panel reply with the correct ""question.""  A sample ""answer"" might include:  Envelopes with cellophane windows, adhesive stickers, and goldenrod colored paper.  (The ""question"" could be:  What three things are not allowed to go into deskside recycling bins under any circumstances?)   3)  ""I'm Recycling at Work Pledge Card Drawing   Place a pledge card on each employee's chair along with a ""I'm Recycling at Work"" sticker for their desk or computer.  Place a recycling bin in your lobby and encourage people to ""recycle"" their pledge card and enter a drawing.  Filling out the card and dropping it in the lobby recycling bin reinforces employee commitment to the program.  After a set period, draw cards from the bin to award prizes.  Potential prizes could include:  lunch for the office, coffee and bagels for the office, time off, a box of recycled paper, a trip to the local recycling center, or other prizes donated by venders in the building.   4)  Recycled Paper Airplane Contest   Host a recycled paper airplane design contest.  all paper planes must be made of office waste paper.  Judging criteria for the winner includes overall design, style, hang-time, or accuracy.  The accuracy award can be given to the plan that comes closest to the recycling bin placed in the middle of the lobby floor.  If possible, use an upper floor that has access to a large atrium.   5)  Office Recycling Photo Exhibit   Turn you lobby into an photo exhibit with entries from office workers in the building.  Encourage employees to shoot photographs that answer a question such as, ""Why should we recycle at work?"" Prominently display all photographs in the lobby with descriptions of the employee and the office where he/she works.  Prize categories can be created so that every employee with a photo entry wins a prize.  Grand prizes could include a new camera, a trip, tickets to a sporting event, or a feature in the company newsletter.   6)  Clean Your Files Day   Announce Clean Your Files Day as a way for employees throughout the building to become familiar with the ""Recycling at Work"" program. Encourage office workers to dress down for the day and send the recycling rate for the building through the roof.  Create competition between tenants in the building by awarding prizes to the office that recycles the most paper.  Kick-off the ""Recycling at Work"" program by having a face-off between top managers from each of the major tenants.   Enlist the help of your recycling service provider to lend enough bins throughout the building and to track measurement.  Set a goal for the amount of paper collected from the entire building.  If the building hits its goal, celebrate by presenting a gift all can share.  Distribute instructions for Clean Your Files Day via e-mail or through a memo.  Invite members of the press to promote the idea to other buildings in the community.  Document the event by taking photos and reporting the results in the company newsletter.   Sample Vender Letter   Local restaurants, coffee shops, book, convenience, or office supply stores are likely candidates to partner with you to promote your recycling program.  You will probably have the greatest success with businesses frequented by employees working in your building.        (name)              (Company)           (Address)                                   Dear (name):            As the building manager for the (name of building), I am      seeking your support for a new building initiative called      ""Recycling at Work.""  This program is designed to reduce the      amount of paper in our waste stream by increasing awareness      for recycling.        To initiate the program in our building, we will be inviting      every employee to a kick-off event in the lobby on (date) to      promote recycling.  I would like to request that you provide      the refreshments for the event.  Or if you prefer, you could      participate by offering a prize to recycling contest winners.        I look forward to talking with you soon to see how we can work      together to promote recycling in our building.        Sincerely,   CHAPTER Six                            Tracking Your Results.                     How to Measure your Recycling Success   Tracking your monthly recycling activity is important to evaluate how well you are communicating with your tenants.  The cleaner the loads, and the more recyclables collected, the more money the building will save on hauling fees, or make in rebates.   Please record the information requested below monthly, beginning with a baseline before the program begins.

Refer to page 12 for materials.   CHAPTER Seven   Buying Recycled: How to Close the Loop   If you're not buying recycled, you're not recycling!  Unless we continue to support markets for recycled products, there will not be a reason to collect waste paper. Successful recycling means a commitment to purchasing recycled products as well as collecting.   Sample Memo to Office Managers and Purchasing Managers   Memo To:  Office Managers and Purchasing Managers    From:  Building Management                      Re:  Purchasing recycled products               As part of the ""Recycling at Work"" program currently underway in our building, it is important we support the markets that are created by collecting waste paper for recycling.   Collecting is only half of recycling; to close the loop we must buy recycled paper products too.  Please adjust your purchase orders to reflect a buildingwide commitment to purchase recycled office products only.  Let your suppliers know of your intentions to buy paper products containing post-consumer fiber.   So that we limit the amount of contaminants in our collection program, please make certain that the paper you order for use in the office is also acceptable in our recycling program.   Thank you for your cooperation on this matter.   ""Not only does this building collect a lot more paper for recycling, the office managers now make it a priority to buy recycled goods.  What goes into our bins, ends up back on our desks.""   -  Jesse Swope    Purchasing Manager    Rhee Consulting   List of Resources for Purchasing Recycled Products.   *Guide to Recycled Office and Business Paper Containing 20% Post- Consumer Fiber, The National Office Paper Recycling Project, May 1995 Phone #202-223-3088.   *  The Buy Recycled Training Manual, The Northeast Maryland Waste Disposal Authority, May, 1993 Phone #410-333-2730.   *  The Official Recycled Products Guide, American Market, Phone # 800-267-0707.   *  Office Paper Recycling Guide, How Your Office Can Complete the Recycling Loop.

The plan outlines possible strategies for state          and local governments to pursue in order to achieve increased manufacturer          responsibility for full life-cycle costs of pesticide products. The plan          was developed through consensus by a group of state and local government          officials. PSI and its coalition members intend to use this plan in developing          and implementing product stewardship initiatives for pesticides.                  Clean Sweep Programs           For the past 20 years, state and local governments have collected          and safely disposed of more than 24 million pounds of unwanted pesticides.                  These efforts, now commonly called “Clean Sweep programs,”          focus on agricultural pesticides but often include other pesticides,         such  as those used by homeowners, golf courses, or highway departments         along          their rights-of-way. As of 2000, there was some form of Clean Sweep program          in 46 states. There is no federal statutory requirement or mandate to                  conduct these collections; Clean Sweeps are state and local initiatives,          and the states have adopted a variety of approaches to finance and implement                  their programs. Funding for the programs most often comes from pesticide          registration fees collected from manufacturers for each pesticide product                  sold in the state. An EPA report describing the success of these programs          can be found online at  http://www.epa.gov/oppfead1/cb/csb_page/updates/cleansweep.pdf  (PDF).           An appendix to the report profiles the program in each state.                   Pesticide Collection in Vermont           The Vermont Department of Agriculture provides grants to help          counties and towns throughout the state fund pesticide collection events.          The pesticide collections are free events where homeowners, farmers, and          businesses can bring in old, unwanted, out-of-date, or unusable pesticides,          and drop them off for safe disposal.                    Pesticide Takeback in British Columbia          Residents of British Columbia can drop off old, unwanted, or out-of-date          pesticides at dozens of depots across the province. This takeback program                  is operated by  Product          Care ,            a  nonprofit industry-affiliated organization, which partners with local          governments, private industry, and nonprofit groups to offer the depot         collection system. The program is funded by an “eco-fee,”          collected from consumers at the point of sale. In 2001, the program collected          over 19,000 equivalent liter containers of pesticide, all of which were                  disposed of through treatment/incineration. Management of waste pesticides          is covered under BC’s Post-Consumer Residual Stewardship Program           Regulation (1997), which requires the producers and consumers of solvents/flammable                   liquids, domestic pesticides, gasoline, and pharmaceuticals to take responsibility           for the management of their leftovers or wastes.                   Paint         Benjamin Moore Paint Takeback Program           Paint manufacturer  Benjamin          Moore             has teamed up with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection          and the Product Stewardship Institute to collect and recycle surplus Benjamin          Moore brand paint. During an initial pilot project in 2001, collections          took place at permanent paint collection sites in five Massachusetts municipalities.          Each site stored collected paint in totes or drums. Benjamin Moore picked          up full totes and drums after delivering new paint to retail stores in          the area. Approximately 256 gallons of paint were collected, 240 gallons          of which were reprocessed back into paint. Based on the pilot project’s          success, Benjamin Moore has expanded the project to 16 permanent paint          collection sites in Massachusetts, as well as permanent paint collection          sites in New Hampshire and Connecticut.                   Illinois’s “Partners for Waste Paint Solutions”          Program           When the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) holds          household hazardous waste collections, about 50 percent of the waste collected          is paint. To address this large volume, the IEPA has initiated the  “Partners          for Waste Paint Solutions” program .            This partnership between the IEPA, local paint retailers, and other interested          parties allows consumers to bring both usable and unusable paint products          back to retailers, recycling centers, and other locations for reformulation          or disposal. Thus far, residents have brought in over 184,500 gallons          of leftover paint to the various partner locations. Partners can sell          or donate any reusable paint, and the IEPA assumes responsibility for          disposing of unusable paint in an environmentally sound manner.                   Paint Takeback and Recycling in Canada           Quebec launched a paint takeback program in 2000. Quebec requires          that all stain and paint manufacturers register with Eco-Peinture, a paint          stewardship council. Manufacturers pay Eco-Peinture 25 cents for each          unit of paint sold. Eco-Peinture uses the fees to support paint collection          for recycling into new paint.         In British Columbia, consumers pay for the province’s mandatory          paint takeback program through an eco-fee collected by retailers at         the          point of sale. The fee system began in 1994. More than 100 collection          stations accept old paint from citizens.  Product           Care ,            a nonprofit industry-affiliated organization, runs BC's program.         The Resource Recovery Fund Board of Nova Scotia works with the Department          of Environment and Labour and the paint manufacturing industry to produce          more than 350,000 liters of recycled paint a year. Recycled paint sales          support the collection of more old paint for recycling. The partnership          created new jobs at paint collection depots and recycling plants all over          the province.                   National Dialogue on Management of Surplus Paint            The  Product          Stewardship Institute (PSI) ,  a          nonprofit organization dedicated to spearheading product stewardship          initiatives in the United States, is convening a national dialogue to          discuss solutions to the problem of end-of-life paint management. The          dialogue will include representatives from government, the paint industry,          retailers, and other stakeholder groups. In preparation for the dialogue,          PSI is preparing a technical report on EOL paint management, along with          a product stewardship action plan for leftover paint. Check the PSI Website          for updates on the dialogue.                  Building Materials         Multi-Client Recycled Plastic Lumber Project           Started in 1995, the Multi-Client Recycled Plastic Lumber Project          brings industry together with a coalition of state agencies, federal research          laboratories, and universities to research and develop standards for recycled          plastic lumber. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop  ASTM          Standards             for recycled-content plastic lumber so that architects and engineers would          recognize recycled plastic lumber as a viable material to use in outdoor          commercial and residential decking as well as in waterfront applications.          Today, the project has grown with the joining of additional partners,          development of standards, database development, laboratory and field testing,          and several pilot projects across the country. As a founding partner in          the project, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources continues to use          and test recycled plastic lumber.                   Armstrong Ceiling Tile Recycling Program          Armstrong World Industries, a manufacturer of interior furnishings, has          initiated a Ceiling Recycling Program that allows building owners to recycle          old ceiling tiles rather than sending them to the landfill. As part of          the program, the company will pay the cost of shipping the old ceiling          tiles to its plant, where they will be used as raw materials in the manufacture          of new acoustical ceilings. Neither the old nor the new replacement ceilings          tiles need to be Armstrong products to qualify for the program, and Armstrong          offers information for building owners to verify that their ceiling tiles          can be recycled. For more information about the program, call 888-CEILINGS          (888 234-5464).                    Green Lumber           Home Depot and Lowe’s, two of the largest home improvement          retailers, have announced that they will buy wood products primarily from          forests certified to the management standards set by the  Forest          Stewardship Council             and will phase out wood products from environmentally sensitive areas.                   Purchasing Recycled Construction Products           The  “2000          Buy-Recycled Series: Construction Products” fact sheet  (PDF),          published by EPA's Comprehensive Procurement Guideline Program, provides          information and recommendations on purchasing recycled content construction          products, including floor tiles, fiberglass insulation, paint, and structural          fiberboard. The fact sheet also provides case studies highlighting agencies'          use of designated products.                  Radioactive Materials          National Dialogue on Stewardship of Products Containing Radioactive          Materials           The  Product          Stewardship Institute (PSI) ,            a nonprofit organization dedicated to spearheading product stewardship          initiatives in the United States, is convening a national dialogue to          discuss strategies for end-of-life management of certain products containing          radioactive materials. The dialogue will focus on two types of products:          tritium exit signs (which are used in many commercial and industrial buildings          to illuminate exit doors and paths) and nuclear fixed gauges (used in          some industries to monitor or control manufacturing processes). Both devices          contain radioisotopes that can pose a hazard to human health and the environment          if the product is broken or improperly disposed of. In addition, there          is growing concern that radioactive materials from these devices could          be used by terrorists in a “dirty bomb,” combining traditional          explosives with radioactive sources. Both tritium exit signs and nuclear          fixed gauges are regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which          requires users to have General Licenses for owning and operating the devices          and places strict limitations on legal disposal options.         Goals for the national dialogue include assessing the percentage of devices          that are improperly disposed of, determining the level of awareness among          end-users of takeback opportunities offered by manufacturers, and examining          alternative non-radioactive technologies. With funding from EPA, PSI has          already developed an extensive report evaluating the relevant product          stewardship issues associated with tritium exit signs and nuclear fixed          gauges. The report is intended to provide background information for the          dialogue, which will include representatives from manufacturers, industry          associations, distributors, government, environmental organizations, and          other groups. For more information on the dialogue and the report, visit          the PSI Website at  www.productstewardshipinstitute.org .                                      Manufacturers Offer Takeback Option for Tritium Exit Signs and          Nuclear Fixed Gauges           Many manufacturers of tritium exit signs and nuclear fixed gauges          are offering to take back their products at the end of the products’          useful life, according to research conducted by the Product Stewardship          Institute (PSI). Manufacturers of tritium exit signs often take back end-of-life          products free of charge when a new sign is purchased simultaneously. The          tritium in the signs is typically recycled for use in new products, and          the plastic and aluminum housing may also be recycled. Most manufacturers          of nuclear fixed gauges charge a fee for taking back end-of-life gauges;          in some cases, the fee can exceed the original cost of the gauge. Depending          on the type of radioactive material used in the gauge, the manufacturer          may recycle the material or consolidate it for disposal as low level radioactive          waste. According to PSI, only two facilities in the United States accept          tritium exit signs and nuclear fixed gauges for land disposal, and the          cost of disposing of a single sign or gauge can reach the thousands of          dollars.                  Propane Tanks and Gas Canisters         National Dialogue on End-of-Life Management of Non-Refillable          Gas Canisters           The  Product          Stewardship Institute (PSI)             has convened a national dialogue to address problems associated with the          end-of-life management of small, non-refillable gas canisters. These canisters,          containing gases such as propane, butane, and helium, are commonly used          as portable fuel sources for camping, hobbies, parties, and other activities.          The steel canisters are designed for single-use and cannot be safely refilled,          yet there are significant problems associated with other end-of-life management          options. When disposed of in the solid waste steam, the canisters can          pose a safety hazard, due to the possibility that leftover, unused gas          might explode or combust when a canister is handled or punctured by waste-processing          machinery. Many scrap metal dealers won’t accept the canisters for          recycling due to the same safety issues. Venting or recapturing residue          gas from tanks is a time-consuming activity that requires special equipment,          and venting can contribute to air quality problems.          To address these problems, PSI organized a series of multi-stakeholder          meetings that included representatives from canister manufacturers, government,          recyclers, and other stakeholder groups. The meetings, held in May and          June, 2003, focused on identifying preferable management options for non-refillable          canisters and barriers to canister recycling. The stakeholders also created          a draft set of recommendations for municipal and county officials who          are considering whether to develop a collection and handling program for          gas canisters. The goal of the dialogue is to create a product stewardship          action plan for these products. Check out the  PSI          Website             for updates on product stewardship initiatives for non-refillable gas          canisters.                   “Propane Summit” Results in Recommendations for Proper          Management of End-of-Life Propane Tanks           A group of representatives from manufacturers, gas suppliers,          retailers, recyclers, and government have developed recommendations for          proper management of end-of-life propane tanks. Millions of these tanks          are used in the United States as a fuel source for gas grills and other          appliances. The tanks are refillable and typically last for many years,          but are sometimes disposed of in the household waste stream, where they          can cause fires or explosions due to residual gas left in the tanks. This          problem has been exacerbated by a new law, passed in at least 27 states,          that requires all 20-pound propane tanks to be equipped with overflow          protection devices. The law has rendered million of tanks obsolete, and          has increased the number of tanks being disposed of in the household waste          stream, according to research conducted by the  Product          Stewardship Institute (PSI) .          To address this issue, PSI organized a multi-stakeholder meeting in May          2003 to discuss problems associated with the improper disposal of 20-pound          refillable propane tanks. The result of the meeting was a set of recommendations          for proper management of EOL tanks. Management options recommended by          the group include: 1) exchanging non-compliant tanks for new tanks at          exchange outlets (including grocery stores, hardware stores, and convenience          stores that offer this service); 2) paying a propane refiller station          to switch a non-compliant valve or tank for a compliant one; and 3) recycling          tanks through municipal recycling programs, where offered. These programs          typically send EOL tanks to a refurbisher or scrap metal dealer.                  Miscellaneous Products         Nike’s Reuse-a-Shoe Program           Nike’s  Reuse-a-Shoe          Program             collects used and defective athletic shoes, grinds them up, and uses the          resulting material (called Nike Grind) in making synthetic athletic surfaces.          Nike has established shoe collection programs across the United States          through cooperative agreements with retailers and organizations such as          the Institutional Recycling Network, which works with universities, colleges,          and other institutions to improve their recycling programs. The Reuse-a-Shoe          Program accepts athletic shoes of any brand, and Nike has a goal of recycling          2 million pairs of post-consumer and defective shoes each year. The company          produces three different types of material from the ground-up shoes:                    Rubber from the outsole, used in making synthetic soccer, football,            and baseball fields.                                 Foam from the midsole, used for synthetic basketball courts, tennis            courts, and playground surfacing tiles.                                 Fabric from the shoes’ upper, which becomes padding used under            hardwood basketball floors.                 Nike is also working on designing athletic footwear to be disassembled          and reused.                                                                                                                                                   EPA Home       |  Privacy      and Security Notice  |                   Contact Us

Community and economic development through recycling can and should be one engine of economic growth in our communities.   Our goal is to make recycling create more jobs in our communities and further strengthen our economy.     New Jobs from Old Wood     The Materials for the Future Foundation, with the Revolving Loan Fund, has loaned out over $1.8 million to 15 businesses, leveraged over $4 million in partner financing, created or retained over 450 jobs and diverted over 85,000 tons per year of materials.  The Materials for the Future Foundation is at work to do more in response to the National Recycling Challenge.    From a recently awarded grant of $500,000 from the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Community Services, the Foundation, partnering with national and local organizations, established an integrated reclaimed wood mill and retail yard in the San Francisco Bay Area.  The mill is supporting eight community-based, mostly nonprofit, deconstruction enterprises by purchasing reclaimed wood for remanufacturing and resale.  The mill will create jobs for 60-65 individuals and training for as many as 300 low-income individuals.  The jobs will offer an avenue into the relatively high-paying construction trades.  The mill is expected to strengthen local reclaimed wood markets and facilitate the development of enterprises that use reclaimed wood.    1,500 Jobs   The Sustainable Jobs Fund is a new community development venture capital fund developed with the assistance of the National Recycling Coalition.  The National Recycling Coalition is a 20-year old nonprofit trade association with over  4,500 members.  The Fund has raised $17 million in funds to date from MBNA America Bank (Delaware), Citibank, Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, First Union Corporation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Dakota Foundation, the U.S. Department of Treasury, and Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.  The Fund, in partnership with the National Recycling Coalition, had received grants from the First Union Regional, Citicorp, Z. Smith Reynolds, and Turner Foundations to support business outreach, research, and assistance services.    In association with the National Recycling Coalition, the Sustainable Jobs Fund's goal is the creation of more than 1,500 jobs as a result of its investments and additional capital leverage in growth enterprises that create quality jobs in economically distressed neighborhoods in the eastern United States. The strategic focus is on recycling, remanufacturing, and environmental industry sectors that are uniquely suited to generating employment for former welfare recipients and low-income individuals.  To date, SJF portfolio companies have committed to creating 629 new quality manufacturing jobs, along with retaining at least 502 jobs that might have been lost without SJF's investment. In addition, portfolio companies have agreed to provide health insurance benefits for employees.    New Opportunities for Chicagoans   Chicago's recycling success begins with programs, policies, and collection systems tailor-made for each component of a big-city waste stream.  As a result of its Blue Bag recycling program and the Commercial and High Density Residential Recycling Ordinance, Chicagoans recycled over 47 percent of their waste 1999.     As part of its commitment to the National Recycling Challenge, the City of Chicago doubled the Chicago Housing Authority Buy-Back program to include all 28 family developments and 50 senior centers.  The CHA Buy Back program is an economic development initiative that offers vouchers redeemable at local grocery stores in exchange for recyclables.    In addition to expanding its CHA Buy Back program, Chicago established recycling programs at each of its three airports, reaching over 80 million people annually.    Recycling Electronics and Creating Jobs   The U.S. Postal Service practices ""good earthkeeping"" in a number of ways.  In 1998, USPS recycled more than one million tons of wastepaper, corrugated, plastics, and other materials and generated more than $5 million in revenue from recycling.  USPS also closes the recycling loop by purchasing more than $160 million worth of recycled content products, including envelopes used for overnight mail and sold to retail customers, building construction products, and re-refined oil and retread tires for the fleet.  USPS also operates the nation's largest alternative fuel delivery fleet.     For the National Recycling Challenge, USPS committed to three projects to find recycling and reuse alternatives to landfilling used electronic equipment.  First, USPS and Per Scholas (a foundation committed to furnishing new and refurbished computers to schools) are collaborating on recycling computers in a computer demanufacturing facility in the South Bronx, New York.  USPS  will supply used computer equipment, and Per Scholas will train and employ dozens of unskilled workers.  Parts from the computers will be then be used to assemble new computers to be sold exclusively to schools and housing authorities.  The demanufacturing facility will open in January, 2000.    Second, USPS contracted with Goodwill Industries of Austin, TX to process 30,000 used terminals.  Over 95 percent of the terminals are saved for use, with the remaining terminals disassembled by Waste Management, Inc. for resource recycling.     Third, USPS is collaborating with Ryzex, Inc. of Bellingham, WA to sell 10,000 used bar code scanners, providing an economical alternative to landfilling the scanners.  Ryzex will refurbish and reprogram the scanners so they can be used for applications such as asset and file tracking.  USPS will arrange for special discounts to be offered to hospitals, schools, libraries, and other community organizations.    Jobs in Paper Recycling   American Fiber Resources (AFR) takes the Vice President's Challenge by bringing new life to an idle paper recycling mill.  Over 100 new jobs were created along with dozens of additional support related jobs within food services, construction, contractors, and trucking in the local community.  AFR restarted the Fairmont, West Virginia paper recycling mill, improving the efficiency, and diverting 900 metric tons per day of waste paper from going to landfills across the United States.  AFR receives recovered paper from several sources, such as the Northern West Virginia Recycling Cooperative, a organization which provides recovered paper from over 15 different counties in West Virginia.    AFR uses the recovered material to produce 600 metric tons per day of premium quality recycled pulp that is used in xerographic papers, forms, envelopes, and magazine-grade coated paper grades, and other paper grades.  As an added environmental benefit, the mill uses peroxide, rather than chlorine bleaching.  In addition, AFR is recovering material from its wastewater treatment system and turning it into 290 metric tons per day of beneficial residual material used for land reclamation projects in West Virginia.  AFR is committed to using unwanted material destined for landfills in a manner and means that is useful to the community and the country."
GX271-92-5210552	Iowa Department of Public Health Hazardous Substances Emergency Events Surveillance System  This fact sheet contains general information regarding liquid mercury and its risks as well as information about how people can protect themselves from exposure and adverse health effects. The fact sheet has been developed as part of a combined study between the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the Iowa Department of Public Health. The Hazardous Substances Emergency Events Surveillance (HSEES) System collects data on emergency hazardous substance releases. The system's purpose is to reduce the incidence of injury and death associated with the release of hazardous substances. A clear understanding of how and why liquid mercury releases occur and how to avoid them can assist in better training. It can also improve the safety of employees, emergency responders, and the general public. In Iowa, from January 1991 through June 2001 there were 23 mercury releases reported to the HSEES System. Seven events occurred in schools, seven were in resident's homes, six occurred in a factory or industry setting, two took place at medical facilities, and one event was the result of illegal dumping at a county park. An evacuation took place during seven of the events and one individual sought medical care after becoming ill after mercury exposure. What is Mercury? Although this fact sheet will focus on liquid mercury, there are hazards associated with other types of mercury. There are three types of mercury: Inorganic (e.g.,Mercuric or mercurous mercury)  This type of mercury is a naturally occurring element released when volcanoes erupt and rocks erode. The problem with the element arises when sources of this type of mercury, such as coal-burning power plants and mining ore deposits, release additional mercury into the air. Bacteria and other processes in lakes and rivers can convert inorganic mercury into methylmercury. Organic (e.g., Methylmercury)  When inorganic mercury is deposited into the water microorganisms help convert it to methylmercury, which is a more toxic form that accumulates in fish. Elemental (i.e., Liquid mercury)  Liquid mercury bulbs, and medical equipment such as instruments use liquid mercury in ethnic folk medicine and for pendant necklaces containing liquid mercury have is used in thermometers, fluorescent light that measure blood pressure. Some people religious practices. More recently, glass become popular among high school children.   How Can Liquid Mercury Affect My Health? The central nervous system is very sensitive to mercury vapors. Although liquid mercury is not directly toxic, the vapors from it are. Short-term or long-term exposures can lead to serious health problems. Exposure to high levels of liquid mercury vapors can permanently damage the brain, kidneys, and the developing fetus. Effects on the brain may result in irritability, shyness, tremors, changes in vision or hearing, and memory problems. Short-term exposure to liquid mercury may result in nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, increase in blood pressure or heart rate, skin and eye irritation and lung damage. How Can I Reduce the Risk of Exposure to Liquid Mercury? Avoid using products that contain liquid mercury. Properly dispose of all products that contain liquid mercury, such as thermometers or fluorescent light bulbs. Urge your local school system to stop conducting experiments in science classes that involve liquid mercury, to use less hazardous substances to demonstrate scientific principles, and to dispose of unnecessary hazardous chemicals in storage. If you must use a product containing liquid mercury, store it safely in a leak and shatter proof container and in a locked, secure place. When liquid mercury spills, it breaks into tiny beads. Those beads can roll into cracks in floors or walls, or may become trapped in carpet or upholstered furniture. Liquid mercury vaporizes and can rapidly spread throughout a room. If spilled near heating ducts, the vapor can spread throughout a home or building quicker. Without proper cleanup, people may be exposed to hazardous levels of liquid mercury vapors. What Should I Do If a Small Spill Occurs If you must use a product containing liquid mercury, a mercury spill kit should be kept on hand. If there is a minor release of mercury, such as from an oral or rectal thermometer, and a mercury spill kit is not available use the following steps: Wear rubber gloves (to be thrown away) Keep children and pets out of area during clean-up Use stiff paper or cardboard to gently sweep beads of mercury onto a dust pan or another piece of stiff paper or cardboard. Use a flashlight to help find any remaining particles. Duct tape, packing tape, or masking tape may be used to pick up small particles. Place mercury in wide mouth glass or plastic container and tape lid in place. Dispose of all items that may have touched the mercury in a plastic zip lock bag or sealed garbage bag. Contact the Regional Collection Center for Hazardous Household Materials in your area to set up a disposal appointment. For spills greater than the amount contained in a thermometer: Evacuate and secure the spill area. Before people leave, be sure shoes, clothing and other articles have not been exposed to mercury. Close all doors, windows, ducts and passageways that lead to other rooms. Ventilate the affected room by opening all windows and doors that open to the   outside. Call your local health department or the Statewide Poison Control Center (1-800352-2222) for instructions on safe clean up. DO NOT try to clean up liquid mercury without getting advice from a poison control center or your local health department. DO NOT sweep a liquid mercury spill with a broom. DO NOT vacuum a liquid mercury spill. Vacuuming will rapidly spread liquid mercury vapors into the air, increasing exposure and contaminating the vacuum. DO NOT pour mercury down a drain. It may lodge in the plumbing and cause future problems. DO NOT use household cleaning products to clean up a spill. These products may contain bleach or ammonia that can react violently with liquid mercury. The following items are examples of reported incidents involving liquid mercury.  In June 1996, liquid mercury was taken from a middle school and played with by a group of teenagers both inside and outside of the school building. Approximately 200 children were tested for mercury exposure, one child was hospitalized and another five underwent outpatient treatment. Twenty other children had mildly elevated mercury levels but not to levels that are known to affect health. In May 2000, a student spilled liquid mercury at a high school forcing the closure of the school while workers decontaminated the building. Approximately 50 students were evacuated from an Iowa college dormitory after someone dumped approximately a half cup of liquid mercury outside a shower stall. This allowed vapors to form and the mercury was subsequently spread throughout the dormitory. A student rolled a ball of liquid mercury down the aisle of a school bus, potentially exposing dozens of students. The student also shared the liquid mercury with three other students. The liquid mercury had been stolen from a science room. The ramifications of this act were thought to have lead to possible contamination of other schools, buses, vehicles and homes.

Employees and management working together as a team is critical for a successful pollution prevention strategy.                                                                       Governor George V. Voinovich                               The Governor's Awards for Outstanding Achievement in Pollution Prevention have been presented since 1986.  GE Superabrasives was one of five recipients to receive the Award in 1993.  Governor George V. Voinovich presented the seventh annual awards on December 9, 1993.  These awards recognize outstanding commitment to improve Ohio's environment through pollution prevention.  Evaluation criteria for the awards included: the overall effort to reduce waste at the source, recycle or recover materials, or conserve energy; soundness of approach; cost- effectiveness; ability of the program to serve as a model for others; and effectiveness in promoting prevention as the preferred long-term approach.    What is Pollution Prevention?    Pollution prevention is the use of source reduction techniques to reduce risk to public health, safety, welfare and the environment and, as a second preference, the use of environmentally sound recycling to achieve these same goals.  Pollution prevention avoids cross media transfers (of wastes and/or pollutants) and is multi-media in scope, addressing all waste and environmental releases to the air, water and land.    GE Superabrasives    The associates of GE Superabrasives, Worthington, Ohio, were recognized for their voluntary awareness, involvement and outstanding achievement in pollution prevention.  The plant's Pollution, Waste and Emissions Reductions (POWER) Team, accompanied by the support of all employees, has enabled GE Superabrasives to implement extensive pollution prevention activities.     In 1955, the GE ""Diamond Team"" made history by creating the first industrial diamonds, an achievement that established the company's technological excellence in the field of superabrasives.  Today, GE Superabrasives is the world's leading manufacturer of industrial superabrasive products such as:  industrial diamond for sawing, grinding and drilling; Borazon Cubic Boron Nitride (CBN) for the grinding of ferrous materials; and Polycrystalline for machining, drilling and turning.  GE Superabrasives is also a leading manufacturer of the Chemical Vapor Deposition Diamond, which is used in the electronics industry.     Pollution Prevention Activities    GE Superabrasives associates' commitment to the environment is demonstrated in the many pollution prevention, waste minimization and recycling activities they have voluntarily implemented.  Prescribing to the EPA preferred waste management hierarchy of source reduction, recycling, treatment and disposal, GE Superabrasives has successfully eliminated thousands of pounds of hazardous and non-hazardous waste from their waste stream and has also recycled thousands of pounds of solid waste.   GE formed a Waste Minimization Task Force and its POWER Team in 1989 and 1990, respectively.  Members of these groups were selected from all areas of the facility to assess pollution prevention opportunities.  Plant-wide participation is achieved through subcommittees, proper education and communication, well-marked recycling bins and an employee suggestion program.  The POWER task force conducts workshops with shop managers and process engineers to prepare annual mass balances for all shops.  Mass balances are a foundation of the plant's pollution prevention activities, permitting GE Superabrasives to focus on source reduction, set up programs and priorities and track successes.  The facility's solid waste stream has been reduced by 40% (10,926 tons to 6,256 tons), compared to 1988, saving the company over $350,000 since 1988. An average of 1,000 tons per year of material from 1990 to 1992 has been recycled, resulting in a savings of another $100,000 per year.      GE Superabrasives has accomplished the following pollution prevention successes:      Sara III total releases have been reduced by 56% in 1992 compared to the 1987 baseline.        Ethylene glycol was replaced by propylene glycol and a sedimentation recycle system was designed and installed to reuse the coolant.      Bromine (an extremely hazardous substance) was completely designed out of the manufacturing process.      A CFC Task Force, networking with other Ohio industries to locate water soluble cleaning agents, phased out the use of freon and trichloroethane by December 1993.      Nickel reportable releases were down 25% compared to 1987.  An 18 month, $1.3 million project built an on-site nickel recovery system.  A reduction in nickel releases of 85% is expected along with a 1100 ton reduction in filter cake landfilling.       Sulfuric acid has been separated from the waste stream and shipped offsite to another GE site that can use the spent sulfuric acid as an incoming raw material.      Looking Ahead    GE Superabrasives will continue the POWER Team and Pollution Prevention Teams in order to reduce SARA III emissions further by the end of 1994.  GE will attempt to maximize the utilization of acids, optimize the newly installed nickel recovery process, evaluate additional nickel bearing streams and perform additional stream separation on these nickel bearing streams.  The company also plans to reduce solid waste by recycling ceramic wastes.  GE also plans to develop programs to reduce or recycle copper coating solutions.         For More Information     Stephen J.

Whether theyre           creating a PowerPoint presentation to educate students about recycling           or tracking recyclables on a bar graph and displaying the results, the           class is using the schools recycling program to learn science, math           and computer skills and reach the Oregon Education Benchmarks at the           same time.             What           does a ""Rising Star"" do to earn its reward?                                           Houck               collects cardboard, magazines, aluminum and steel cans and milk               cartons for recycling, then charts the results and presents them               in a report to the school newsletter for semi-annual publication.                               Produced               an educational ""commercial"" about recycling for viewing               on the closed-circuit TV.                               Office               supplies and scrap paper are reused and the school buys products               in 100% recyclable packaging, whenever possible---Styrofoam is               avoided at all costs!                         But           theres a lot more to do. The class plans to create its own           recycling Web page and post weekly program results in an Excel           spreadsheet format. Students have determined, through waste analysis,           that nearly two-thirds of the schools daily trash is paper. An           increase in recycling promotion and education at school will focus on           paper recycling, targeting students and faculty. Moreover, a waste           reduction plan for the school is underway.             Additionally,           food waste is a daunting problem for Houck. Attempts to collect and           compost leftover fruit and vegetable scraps have hit several           obstacles. With the $500 award, the Environmental Responsibility Class           will purchase worm bins and start a vermiculture (worm composting)           program in conjunction with the science department. The class hopes to           market its services to the community and teach citizens how           vermiculture can work at home to turn leftovers into rich fertilizer           for the garden.                       Steele         Gale Martin Award:           Colton         Middle School           The Colton Clothes Closet is recognized as one of the most         generous school-run programs in the region. The Clothes Closet is a         program where the school receives donated clothing and accessories, then         offers them free to those in need. It is open 2:30 - 3 p.m. on         Wednesdays during the school year.            Approximately 120 families are helped each year through the         Clothes Closet, which teaches leadership skills to student participants         while helping members of the community.           Located in the upstairs of the middle school, the Clothes         Closet is set up like a store, complete with clothing racks and         carefully marked sizes,           childrens jackets,         purses and bags .           Unlike many other donation organizations, the items in the         Clothes Closet are free. People from all over the area stop in, most         come from Colton, Molalla, Canby and Woodburn, but it's open to anyone.            Besides students from the recycling committee, volunteers also         help with the project, helping mark sizes, organize clothing and point         shoppers to the clothes they need.           Theyll also take requests from people on items         they need, then run them in the school newspaper.   The program is funded by the recycling committees efforts in         collecting cans within the school, as well as recycling ink cartridges         from fax machines, copiers and printers. The money is used to buy         markers, plastic bags, and whatever needed to keep the program running.         The money is occasionally used to buy new socks and underwear for         people.  Besides helping with the Clothes Closet program, the         committee runs the schools weekly recycling program for paper,         cardboard, magazines, and cans. Each class is then assigned ratings for         the recycling efforts.                     The Steele Gale Martin Award was created         to honor the memory of the infant son of two members of the Association of Oregon         Recyclers. It is awarded each year to a young person, class or school for dedication and         exceptional effort to encourage waste reduction.                                 Elementary         School Award:           Lynch         Wood's Green Team             In           1989, students, staff and teachers at Lynch Wood Elementary in the           Centennial School District worked together to collect milk jugs for           recycling. The project was so successful, students decided to expand           their efforts to recycle the schools white and colored papers. From           these small steps, a recycling project grew into a long-term           commitment to reduce waste and recycle.              Not only is Lynch Wood a WRAP award winner, but they are also           one of the few ""Premier"" level Oregon Green Schools.             Lynch           Wood earns these honors by doing the following:                                           Every               classroom has a recycling container and purchase of               recycled-content products, whenever possible.                               Recycling               newspapers, tin, aluminum, glass bottles and jars, cardboard, soda               cans, crayons, magazines, batteries, greeting cards, cooking oil,               packing foam, cafeteria plates and sporks, milk and juice cartons               and plastics. Once a week, fourth, fifth and sixth-grade students               collect the materials from inside the building and store them in a               special outdoor container for pick up.                               Use               of bulk packaging in the cafeteria to reduce waste, for example,               dispensers for ketchup, mustard, salad dressing and syrup are the               rule, rather the exception.                               Large               mailing envelopes make return trips for interoffice communication.               Folders are reused and paper with a clean side, gets cut up and               used as scratch paper.                               Introduction               of a worm bin for the food scraps.                               Regular               progress reports and additional goal setting keeps Lynch Wood on               track!                         Lynch           Wood will use the WRAP award money to purchase worms for the worm bin           and to ""beef-up"" its recycling program with additional           containers so that students can bring in items from home to make           things more convenient.                       Secondary         School Award:           Dallas         High School             From           the cafeteria to the classroom, Dallas High School has turned waste           reduction into an art and a science. The schools environmental           club, Students Against Violating the Environment (SAVE), created           several programs that put the school way in front of many other Oregon           schools when it comes to waste reduction and recycling.              The first thing SAVE members pushed for was a class where           students earn credit for environmental activities.             Other           activities that made Dallas a winning school:                                           Provided               recycling containers in every classroom and office                               Produced               an educational recycling video that is shown on the school's               closed-circuit TV.                               Copy               machines are set to encourage less paper use, and paper with one               clean side is used again to make scratch pads.                               Materials               recycled include: paper, magazines, cardboard, tin and aluminum               cans, glass bottles and jars, plastics, batteries, ink jet and               toner cartridges, motor oil, metals and polystyrene foam lunch               trays. The kitchen staff even recycles the grease from the deep               fryers.                               Purchase of               recycled-content products as much as they can.                         What           more can they do?    Well,           the students from SAVE, who wrote the winning WRAP Award application,           already have plans for the $500 award. They crunched some numbers and           determined that if they could purchase two hand dryers, in just 15           weeks they could save enough money by not buying paper towels and in           avoided disposal costs to buy two more dryers  and save even more.           They also plan to turn cafeteria fruits and veggies into fertilizer           with help from a bunch of worms.                       [top of page]                           For   questions, comments, or further information please email  solwaste@deq.state.or.us    or contact the Department of Environmental Quality's Solid Waste Policy and   Program Development Section, 811 SW Sixth Avenue, Portland, OR 97204,   503-229-5913 or toll-free in Oregon, 1-800-452-4011.
