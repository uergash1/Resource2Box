STATUS:  Endangered; may be extinct or nearly so.    HABITAT:  Inhabits old-age forests of bottomlands and swamps with dead and dying trees that provide a food source and nest sites. Most birds live in virgin or primitive tree stands, but virgin forests may not be essential as long as there are large numbers of recently dead trees to supply wood-boring grubs and large nesting trees.    SPECIAL HABITAT REQUIREMENTS:  Continual supply of dead and dying trees.    NEST:  Excavates a new hole each nesting season, seldom in the same tree, in almost all tree species occurring within its range, and in trunks of living and dead trees.    FOOD:  Consumes a diet that is about one-third wood-boring larvae. Most abundant in areas where recently dead and dying trees are numerous because of flooding, fire, insect attacks, or storms; stays as long as abundant wood-boring larvae are present. (Wood-boring larvae begin to decline after trees have been dead 2 or 3 years.) Also eats other insects and fruits.

GX253-52-5076411	Ivory-billed Woodpecker Campephilus principalis vory-billed woodpeckers once inhabited the old-growth forests of southeastern North America and Cuba. As these forests were cleared late in the 19th century, the ivorybilled woodpecker began its decline toward extinction, a decline that was helped by hunters who relished the flavor of this birds meat. For years, ornithologists and other conservationists have hoped to discover ivory-billed woodpeckers in remote swamps and pine forests in South Florida, South Carolina, Louisiana, or Cuba. After several surveys in North America and Cuba failed to locate ivorybilled woodpeckers, this hope has diminished.  Federal Status: Critical Habitat: Florida Status:  Endangered (March 11, 1967) None Designated Endangered Not Applicable South Florida  I  Recovery Plan Status : Geographic Coverage:  Description The ivory-billed woodpecker is the largest woodpecker in North America. Its body-length averages about 50.8 cm. The wing length averages 237 to 264 mm (Short 1982). Jackson (1996) identified the only recorded weight as 453g. The ivory-billed woodpecker has glossy, black plumage with a purplish cast. A white stripe started on each cheek and continues down each side of their necks to their back, where the two stripes curved to meet in the middle of their backs. The outer halves of their secondaries are white, along with the ends of their inner, primary feathers. The white feathers on the trailing edge of their wings are visible even when their wings are folded. This white wing bar is the best characteristic for identifying the ivory-billed woodpecker in the field and distinguishing it from species like pileated woodpeckers. Male ivory-billed woodpeckers has a prominent, scarlet crest; the crest of female ivory-billed woodpeckers is completely black. Their bills are large and ivory-white.  Taxonomy The ivory-billed woodpecker (Campephilus principalis) is the northernmost of 11 species contained in the neotropical genus Campephilus. It is most closely related to the imperial woodpecker (C. imperialis), another endangered Page 4-465   IVORY-BILLED W OODPECKER  Multi-Species Reco ver y Plan f o r South Florida  woodpecker that occurs in the mountains of western Mexico. Two races of ivory-billed woodpeckers have been recognized: C. p. principalis of the U.S. and C. p. bairdi of Cuba (AOU 1983).  Distribution In the United States, the ivory-billed woodpecker occur in old-growth, lowland, deciduous forests and pinelands in eastern Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. In Cuba, the ivory-billed woodpecker occurred in lowland deciduous forests and montane pine forests. In Florida, the ivory-billed woodpecker occurred throughout the Florida peninsula and the Florida panhandle east of the Appalachicola River. In peninsular Florida, the ivory-billed woodpecker occurred in portions of the Upper St. Johns River, Kissimmee River, Peace River, Caloosahatchee River, and Big Cypress drainages. Highlands Hammock State Park is identified several times in the literature as having ivory-billed woodpeckers present in the 1960s and 1970s (Robertson and Woolfenden 1992, Jackson 1996).  Habitat The habitat of ivory-billed woodpeckers has been described as mature (oldgrowth), forested wetlands (Tanner 1942). However, Jackson (1996) argued that the ivory-billed woodpecker may have retreated to the swamps as mature, upland forests were destroyed. As evidence, he noted that in Cuba, ivory-billed woodpeckers retreated to montane pine forests as mature, low-elevation forests were destroyed. Nevertheless, Tanner s (1942) studies provide the most extensive information on the habitats used by the remnant populations of ivory-billed woodpecker in the U.S. In Florida, the ivory-billed woodpecker occurred in or adjacent to swamps and hardwood hammocks. In Florida, bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) dominated all of these habitats, but black gum (Nyssa sylvatica), red maple (Acer rubrum), red bay (Persea borbonia), sweet bay (Magnolia virginiana), laurel oak (Quercus laurifolia), American elm (Ulmus americana), and palmetto (Sabal palmetto) were associated species. Jackson (1996) and Tanner (1942) included longleaf (Pinus palustris) and slash pines (P. elliottii) to the list of ivory-billed woodpecker habitat. In addition to ivorybilled woodpeckers nesting in the pines, information indicates that the woodpeckers regularly fed on beetles from recently-dead pines (Jackson 1996). Ivory-billed woodpeckers require large tracts of undisturbed, mature forest. They need mature trees to excavate their cavities and a continuous supply of large, dead trees to provide the wood-boring beetles that form their primary food source.  Behavior The most comprehensive information on the distribution, biology, ecology, and behavior of the ivory-billed woodpecker is derived from the 1937-1939 study conducted by Tanner (1942). Additional, anecdotal information is presented in  Page  4-466   IVORY-BILLED W OODPECKER  Multi-Species Reco ver y Plan f o r South Florida  Howell (1932) and Sprunt (1954). Most of the information in the following treatment comes from Tanner s study. Foraging Ivory-billed woodpeckers feed mostly on wood-boring larvae burrowed between the bark and sapwood of dead trees; but fruits, nuts, and seeds were occasionally eaten. Most of these foraging trees were recently dead, so recently that the bark is still tight against the tree and light branches have not fallen. They feed on those portions of the trees that supported shallow-wood borers and moved from tree branches to tree trunks as borers attacked the dead tree. They feed primarily on the larger trees of a forest; 87 percent of the trees they forage have diameters greater than 30 centimeters (Tanner 1942). Ivory-billed woodpeckers scaled the bark of these trees loose with blows from their bills. When they dig into a tree, they chisel into the sap wood and heartwood like other woodpeckers. Most of the preferred larvae are larval ColeopteraScolytids, Buprestids, and Cerambycidswhich are the first species to attack a tree or tree-limb after the tree dies (Tanner 1942). Reproduction Ivory-billed woodpeckers are not social birds. They do not travel in flocks, although they remain as a family group between breeding seasons. The basic social organization of the ivory-billed woodpecker is the breeding pair, which is a strong, apparently monogamous, life-long pair-bond. The mated pair probably requires extensive stands of mature, lowland hardwood forest without disturbance from forestry practices. An area of 6.5 to 8 km2 has been estimated to be the minimum size for a home range for these birds. Ivory-billed woodpecker pairs travel together, following each other through the forest. If they are separated, they will call to one another; if the separation continues both birds will become nervous until they reunite. Ivory-billed woodpeckers usually nest at a distance from one another, although Tanner (1942) did not find them defending particular territories. Nevertheless, Tanner found several pairs of ivory-billed woodpeckers that used the same nesting area repeatedly; one pair used the same nesting area for 5 consecutive years, another pair used the same nesting area for 4 consecutive years. Ivory-billed woodpeckers initiate courtship at different times throughout their range. In Florida, they begin courtship in December and nest-building in late January. Generally, the breeding season extends from January to May. In Florida, ivory-billed woodpeckers built their nest cavities in living or dead bald cypresses. Elsewhere in their range, in the Mississippi River Delta for example, ivory-billed woodpeckers nest exclusively in hardwood trees. Occasionally, they nest in dead pines, bay, and cabbage palms. In Florida, ivory-billed woodpeckers excavate their nest cavities about 15 m from the ground; the lowest was 8 m, the highest was 20 m. The cavities ivory-billed woodpeckers excavate range between 50 and 70 cm in depth in dead or partially dead trees. Ivory-billed woodpeckers lay between one and four eggs, with an average of 2.9 eggs. The incubation period is uncertain, although Tanner (1942) believed they required about 20 days. Incubation, brooding, and feeding requirements are handled by both parents, with the males incubating or brooding at night. Page 4-467   IVORY-BILLED W OODPECKER  Multi-Species Reco ver y Plan f o r South Florida  Fledgling birds probably stay in the nest for five weeks, during which they are fed regularly by both parents. Male ivory-billed woodpeckers brood the young overnight and do most of the brooding during the daytime. Male ivorybilled woodpeckers also clean the nest. After they fledge, young birds are fed by their parents for 2 months or more. Sometimes, these birds will stay with their parents through their first summer and may remain with them until the following nesting season.  Relationship to Other Species The mature forests that provide habitat for the ivory-billed woodpecker support a large variety of other species. Many of those species, like their forests habitats, have become extinct; these include the Carolina parakeet (Conuropsis carolinensis, extinct in 1918) and Passenger pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius, extinct in 1914). Others, like the Florida panther (Puma (=Felis) concolor coryi) survive as endangered species on the federal list of threatened and endangered species.  Status and Trends Although they were once common in some geographic areas, ivory-billed woodpeckers began their decline toward extinction by the late 1800s (Jackson 1996, Tanner 1942). Ivory-billed woodpeckers were hunted for food and overhunting was responsible for the initial declines of this endangered bird. By the late 1880s, ornithologists raised concerns about the status and trends of the ivorybilled woodpecker (Howell 1932). The other major threat to this species was the destruction of mature (old growth) forests throughout the southeastern U.S. which continued until the 1920s. Chapman (1907) wrote that the range of the ivory-billed woodpecker had contracted to encompass the states bordering the Gulf of Mexico and the lower Mississippi River valley; even within this range, he wrote that it was only locally distributed. By 1913, the ivory-billed woodpecker had been extirpated from Indiana, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas (Hornaday 1913). The same report concluded that the ivory-billed woodpecker was threatened with extinction in Florida and Louisiana. By 1926, many thought the ivory-billed woodpecker was already extinct. Tanners studies between 1937 and 1939 demonstrated that the ivory-billed woodpecker still existed, but in only a fraction of its original range. By the time of Tanners study, the ivory-billed woodpecker only survived in the Madison Parish region of Louisiana, the Santee Swamp of South Carolina, and the Suwanee River and Big Cypress regions of Florida. The last verified observation of an ivory-billed woodpecker in the United States was in 1969. Jackson (1996) conducted an extensive survey of potential refugia for the ivory-billed woodpecker between 1987 and 1992. He discounted most reports as pileated or red-headed woodpeckers (Dryocopus pileatus and Melanerpes erythrocephalus, respectively); however, a sighting in Jonathan Dickinson State Park in 1985 seemed authentic. Overall, though, his surveys found no evidence of ivory-billed woodpeckers in the U.S. If ivory-billed woopeckers continue to exist in the U.S.,  Page  4-468   IVORY-BILLED W OODPECKER  Multi-Species Reco ver y Plan f o r South Florida  Jackson believes Florida is one of the most likely areas they may be found. The ivory-billed woodpecker may have survived in the lowland forests of Cuba (Jackson 1996). Most of the lowland, old-growth, deciduous forests in Cuba had been cleared by the beginning of the twentieth century, restricting the ivory-billed woodpecker to the pine forests in eastern Cuba. In 1948 and 1956, a population of ivory-billed woodpeckers remained in the Cuchillas de Moa mountain range. A proposal to protect the most threatened area of Cuba, Bandolero, near the lumber and mining town of Moa was made. However, after the Cuban revolution in 1959, most foreign contacts were broken off and the status of C. principalis in Cuba became unclear, as well as the status of the Bandolero area. The area was re-surveyed in 1985 (Lammertink 1995). The investigators did not observe woodpeckers, but they found fresh marks of a foraging ivorybilled woodpecker. Most of the forest that was surveyed in 1956 had been logged, except for portions of the Ojito de Agua region; a single ivory-billed woodpecker was seen in 1986 (Lammertink 1995). Three other ivory-billed woodpeckers were seen during the same year. The last, verified observation of an ivory-billed woodpecker in the region was in 1987. The region was resurveyed in 1988 and 1991, but researchers did not observe ivory-billed woodpeckers or signs of them; worse, these surveys did not locate suitable habitat that could support ivory-billed woodpeckers. All evidence leads to the conclusion that the ivory-billed woodpecker has been extirpated in the U.S. The failure of recent surveys in Cuba to locate either ivory-billed woodpeckers or suitable habitat strongly suggests that the ivory-billed woodpeckers has been extirpated there as well.  Management For many years, surveys have been the only management action that has been taken for the ivory-billed woodpecker. These surveys have focused on determining if the ivory-billed woodpecker still exists. Between 1987 and 1989, Jackson (1996) surveyed potential habitats in the southeastern U.S. in the hope of locating ivory-billed woodpeckers, to no avail. Similarly, surveys in Cuba between 1985 and 1991 failed to locate ivory-billed woodpeckers or suitable habitat for them. Although large tracts of land in areas formerly occupied by ivory-billed woodpeckers have been placed in public ownership, Jackson (1996) feels the efforts to conserve this species may be too little, too late. All of the available evidence suggests that the ivory-billed woodpecker has been extirpated from North America and probably has been extirpated in Cuba. If the latter is true, the ivory-billed woodpecker is extinct.  Page  4-469   IVORY-BILLED W OODPECKER  Multi-Species Reco ver y Plan f o r South Florida  Literature Cited  Agey, H.N. and G.M.

Unless new information demonstrates that ivory-billed woodpeckers persist in South Florida or that they could be re-introduced into South Florida, no recovery criteria will be developed or proposed.  Species-level Recovery Actions S1. Determine the distribution and status of the ivory-billed woodpecker in South Florida. S1.1. Conduct surveys for the ivory-billed woodpecker after identifying potentially suitable habitat. Surveys should focus on the Big Cypress Drainage in Collier and Monroe counties to determine if sufficient area with large enough trees exists in the region.  Page  4-471   Page  4-472

Fritzell, and Alan B. Sargeant       Abstract:  We used radio telemetry to determine the movements and habitat use patterns of adult Franklin's ground squirrels ( Spermophilus franklinii ) on a 152-ha Waterfowl Production Area (WPA) in central North Dakota. The squirrels were diurnal. Mean total distance traveled daily was 213 and 153 m for males and females, respectively. Movements of females decreased during gestation and lactation; those of both sexes decreased prior to immergence. Annual home ranges averaged 24.6 and 8.7 ha for males and females, respectively; biweekly home-range sizes exhibited seasonal patterns. Ground squirrels restricted their activities almost exclusively to the WPA. Use of blocks of herbaceous cover on the WPA could not be explained by vegetation height, density, or litter depth. Ground squirrel movements were influenced by locations of burrow systems and patchily distributed food resources. Periodic cultivation or removal of herbaceous vegetation may inhibit use of upland duck-nesting habitat by ground squirrels.

GX079-32-2300262	Causes Discovered for Amphibian Deformities in New York State  Courtesy of Eric A. Paul and Stanley K. Sessions   November 2, 2000       Researchers at Hartwick College working with the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) have discovered  what is causing deformed frogs in at least some ponds in New York State.  Deformed Leopard Frogs ( Rana pipiens )  with malformed limbs, including extra limbs, and missing limbs, were analyzed by Eric Paul, Fish and Wildlife Ecologist  for the DEC, in collaboration with Dr. Stanley K. Sessions, a developmental biologist, and his students at Hartwick  College.  The researchers experimentally demonstrated that malformed limbs and extra limbs were caused in some frogs  by cysts of a parasitic flatworm called a trematode.  This is the same parasite that has recently been shown to cause  the same kinds of abnormalities in California treefrogs.  This particular parasite, a trematode of the genus   Ribeiroia , is spread by birds and has a wide geographic distribution.  To test whether the parasite cysts  infecting the frogs were actually causing the deformities, Sessions and his students examined lab-raised Leopard Frog  tadpoles that were infected with the same trematode.  Their research showed that the parasite can  cause the same kinds  of deformities as seen in the frogs obtained from the wild.  This is the first experimental confirmation of parasites as  a cause of amphibian limb malformations in eastern North America.  But parasites are not the only cause of deformed frogs  in New York!  The researchers also analyzed samples of frogs with missing limbs, and instead of finding parasites they  found young tadpoles with their limbs obviously bitten off.  Raising tadpoles in the lab, the researchers found that the  tadpoles will chew each others' limbs off under crowded conditions, resulting in frogs with missing limbs just like those  found in the wild.  Thus the research points to two different kinds of deformities with two different causes: frogs with  malformed limbs including extra limbs, caused by parasites, and frogs with missing limbs caused by attempted predation.     Eric Paul is coordinating reports of deformed amphibians in New York State.  Any observations of deformed amphibians  (salamanders or frogs with obvious abnormalities) in New York State should be brought to the attention of Eric Paul at  the following address:   Eric Paul  NYS Coordinator for Amphibian Malformations  Rome Field Station  8314 Fish Hatchery Road  Rome, NY 13440  315-337-0910  eapaul@gw.dec.state.ny.us     For further information about current deformed amphibian research at Hartwick College, please visit our web site at:   www.hartwick.edu/biology/def_frogs/index.html         Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center   Home  |  Site Map  |  Biological Resources  |  Help & Feedback
