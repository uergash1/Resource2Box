In the  United States , a  do not resuscitate , or  DNR , order is a written order from a  doctor  that  resuscitation  should not be attempted if a person suffers  cardiac  or  respiratory arrest . Such an order may be instituted on the basis of an  advance directive  from a person, or from someone entitled to make decisions on their behalf, such as a  health care proxy ; in some jurisdictions, such orders can also be instituted on the basis of a physician's own initiative, usually when resuscitation would not alter the ultimate outcome of a disease, and is designed to prevent unnecessary suffering.   Any person who does not wish to undergo  lifesaving  treatment in the event of cardiac or respiratory arrest can get a DNR order, although DNR is more commonly done when a person who has an  terminal illness  wishes to have a more natural  death  without painful or invasive medical procedures.

DNR  (Do Not Resuscitate) is a common abbreviation in the United States and the United Kingdom. It may be clarified in some regions with the addition of  DNI  (Do Not Intubate), although in some hospitals  DNR  alone will imply no  intubation . Some areas of the United States and the United Kingdom include the letter A, as in  DNAR , to clarify ""Do Not  Attempt  Resuscitation."" This alteration is so that it is not presumed by the patient/family that an attempt at resuscitation will be successful. Since the term DNR implies the omission of action, and therefore ""giving up"", some have advocated for these orders to be retermed  Allow Natural Death [ 1 ] . New Zealand and Australia (and some hospitals in the UK) use the term  NFR  or  Not For Resuscitation . Typically, these abbreviations are written without periods between the letters, i.e.  AND/DNR  not  A.N.D./D.N.R. .   Until recently in the UK it was common to write ""Not for 222"" or conversationally, ""Not for twos."" This was implicitly a hospital DNR order, where 222 (or similar) is the hospital telephone number for the emergency resuscitation or crash team.     [ edit ]   United States   The DNR order came into being in the  U.S.  in the 1960s when  defibrillation  allowed the reversal of cardiac arrest, but this may prolong the life of the patient for only a short time.   In the U.S.,  cardiopulmonary resuscitation  (CPR) and  advanced cardiac life support  (ACLS) should not be performed if a valid written ""DNR"" order is present. In any cases of doubt,  emergency medical technicians ,  paramedics  and other  medical  workers will perform as if a DNR order did not exist, as is required by law.   For the DNR to be valid there may be rules such as the use of a special form and/or additional signatures of a doctor and/or witnesses, etc. The exact rules for obtaining a DNR order, and for emergency medical personnel to accept the validity of one, vary widely according to jurisdiction. For example, in the state of  Maryland , only state DNR orders are acceptable, and they require much verification, witnesses and doctor's signatures in order to be valid. In contrast, the state of  Virginia  allows patients to receive a DNR order with relative ease, and will accept them from most jurisdictions.   In many jurisdictions, medical professionals are ordered not to acknowledge DNR orders. This is especially common with  paramedics , who are often employed by private companies unwilling to fight a potential lawsuit.   A DNR order must be filed on a jurisdictionally recognized form. A doctor contemplating a DNR decision should make every reasonable effort to confirm a DNR status before deciding to withhold resuscitation. To be sure that their DNR request is honored, patients should make their wishes clearly known to their family, doctors, community hospitals, care homes and any other caregivers or health care providers who may be present should a cardiac arrest occur. Some jurisdictions provide for a legally sanctioned DNR notification that is clearly visible to all healthcare personnel, similar to a  MedicAlert bracelet .   A DNR order's specific effect depends on the hospital in which the incident occurs and the terms laid out in the DNR: neither cardiopulmonary resuscitation nor  intubation  will be performed, but treatment for infections or other treatable conditions, intravenous feeding and fluids, pain management and comfort care are generally continued.

Pertinent issues addressed include the rights of children, surrogate   decision-making, the process of informed consent, and the roles   of surgeons and anesthesiologists. The reevaluation process   of DNR orders called ""required reconsideration"" can be incorporated   into the process of informed consent for surgery and anesthesia.   Care should be taken to distinguish between goal-directed and   procedure-directed approaches to DNR orders. By giving parents   or other surrogates and clinicians the option of deciding from   among full resuscitation, limitations based on procedures, or   limitations based on goals, the child's needs are individualized   and better served.

Liaisons   Consultant   Staff   REFERENCES        In the 1970s, the Critical Care Committee at the Massachusetts   General Hospital developed the original do-not-resuscitate (DNR)   guidelines in response to nursing requests for clarification   of what should be done when cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)   was unwanted or believed to be unwarranted by a patient or surrogate. 1   DNR orders are clinically and ethically appropriate when the   burdens of resuscitation exceed the expected benefit. Currently,   all hospitals seeking accreditation from the Joint Commission   on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations are required to   have a DNR policy in place. 2 – 6  This policy should define   a DNR order and describe the guidelines for its inclusion on   a patient's medical record. A DNR order is a written order by   an attending physician and precludes resuscitative efforts being   undertaken in the event of cardiopulmonary arrest. DNR orders   should not have implications regarding the use of other therapeutic   interventions that may be appropriate for the patient, including   surgery and anesthesia. 7 , 8     The controversial topic of DNR orders for patients undergoing   surgery and anesthesia has received growing attention in the   medical literature since the early 1990s. However, the literature   does not specifically address the pediatric age group. For children,   DNR orders are written when (1) in the judgment of the treating   physician, an attempt to resuscitate the child would not benefit   the child and (2) the parent or surrogate decision-maker (with   the assent of an age-appropriate child) expresses his or her   preference that CPR be withheld in the event that the child   suffers a cardiopulmonary arrest, as long as this is in accordance   with the child's best interests. 7 , 9  DNR orders are written on   the assumption that cardiopulmonary arrest will be a spontaneous   event that is the culmination of the dying process of a child   who has a terminal illness or a poor quality of life. The dilemma   surgeons and anesthesiologists are confronted with regarding   children with DNR orders undergoing an operative procedure is   twofold: (1) anesthesia promotes some degree of hemodynamic   abnormality that may result in cardiopulmonary arrest, and (2)   many routine anesthetic manipulations can be classified as resuscitative   measures.     A number of hospitals across the nation still do not have a   policy that specifically addresses the extent to which DNR orders   apply in the operating room 2 , 5 , 10 , 11  or have a policy that mandates   suspension of DNR orders. 9  According to 1 study, surgical procedures   are performed in  15% of patients with DNR orders. 12  The American   Academy of Pediatrics and the American Society of Anesthesiologists   (ASA) have issued guidelines on forgoing life-sustaining medical   treatment, issues of informed consent, 13 , 14  and evaluation and   preparation of pediatric patients undergoing anesthesia. 15  None   of these policies address in detail the approach to be taken   when an operative procedure is considered for a child with an   existing DNR order. This encounter includes the dilemmas of   who should assume responsibility (ie, the primary care physician,   the surgeon, or the anesthesiologist) for discussing with the   parent or surrogate decision-maker the potential risks of cardiopulmonary   arrest during surgery and anesthesia, whether the DNR order   should be temporarily suspended during the procedure, and how   long a temporary suspension should last if this option is chosen.                 SURVEY OF SECTIONS ON SURGERY AND ANESTHESIA      TOP   ABSTRACT   CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN WITH...

Demographics of Respondents to Survey Regarding DNR Orders            For each group, surgeons and anesthesiologists, finite sample   confidence intervals for proportions were computed. 16  The finite   population correction factor was used for hypotheses testing   as needed. 16  Statistical software used included SPSS version   10 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL [2000]) and StatXact version 4 (Cytel   Software Inc, Cambridge, MA [2000]).     The majority of surgeons (88.8%) and anesthesiologists (86%)   had been asked to operate on or provide anesthesia to a child   with a DNR order in place at the time of surgery, and most indicated   that they would not refuse to provide these services. Most surgeons   (75.3%) and anesthesiologists (69.2%) would agree to honor a   DNR order during a palliative operative procedure, but smaller   percentages of surgeons (49.6%) and anesthesiologists (46.7%)   were willing to honor a DNR order during an elective operative   procedure. More than 95% of surgeons and anesthesiologists discuss   resuscitation issues before surgery with parents of children   who have standing DNR orders, and a majority of each group felt   that there should be a hospital policy for children with DNR   orders in the operating room. Only 50.5% of anesthesiologists   and 27.5% of surgeons stated that their hospital has such a   policy in place.     Surgeons and anesthesiologists then were asked which resuscitation   maneuvers should be withheld during intraoperative arrest in   a child with a DNR order.

The majority of anesthesiologists   (55.1%) felt that the perioperative period ended when the child   left the recovery room, with only 38.2% of surgeons agreeing   ( P  = .0037).

Liaisons   Consultant   Staff   REFERENCES        The medical literature contains some ambiguities on the scope   of a DNR order and the resuscitative interventions it prevents   during surgery and anesthesia. Resuscitative interventions may   be broadly defined as any maneuvers and techniques used to prevent   or reverse cardiopulmonary arrest. 17  However, this definition   is inappropriate in an operative setting, because anesthetic   agents routinely promote cardiovascular instability. 2 , 5 , 11 , 18   Perioperatively, resuscitative measures should only refer to   the measures undertaken to restore life once a cardiopulmonary   arrest has occurred. 8 , 19  Surveys of physicians and patients   with DNR orders confirm that clarification is needed on the   interpretation of a DNR order, especially its applicability   in the operating room. 12 , 20 – 22     Physicians caring for children have a duty to respect the wishes   of the child and family, to do good (beneficence), and to avoid   harm (nonmaleficence), which may lead to conflicting considerations   for a child with a DNR order. Some physicians believe that honoring   a DNR request harms a child by allowing a potentially reversible   death to occur. On the other hand, the child's welfare is best   served by not having a poor quality of life unnecessarily prolonged   and not having to endure ineffective therapy. 23  Older children   and adolescents should be included in the decision-making process   (patient assent) when their neurologic status, development,   and level of maturity allow. However, legally they require a   surrogate decision-maker to act on their behalf (surrogate or   parental permission). 14  A child's surrogate, usually a parent,   should be the person presumed to be the most appropriate and   capable to determine what actions would be in the best interest   of the child. Conflicts arise when the parent or other surrogate   and/or child and the physician fail to agree on what would be   optimal care under a given set of circumstances.      Informed Consent   To respect the child's and family's wishes, physicians must   obtain informed permission from a parent or surrogate before   a child can undergo any medical intervention including surgery   and resuscitation. Ordinarily, resuscitation efforts do not   require informed consent, because they are deemed emergency   interventions and consent is implied. However, terminally ill   or severely disabled children and their parents are often confronted   with the decision of whether resuscitation should be attempted   in the event the child's underlying disease results in cardiopulmonary   arrest.     Customarily, physicians will approach the parent or surrogate   about instituting a DNR order when it is felt that resuscitation   of the child would not be beneficial and would only prolong   the time to death. 22  When a parent or surrogate consents to   a DNR order, it is under the assumption that cardiopulmonary   arrest will be a direct consequence of the child's underlying   disease. Surgery and anesthesia constitute a change in the child's   medical status, because they introduce additional risks to the   patient. Because surgeons and anesthesiologists are rarely involved   in the original DNR decision, they cannot be certain that the   implications of the DNR status in the perioperative setting   were discussed with the patient's parent (or other surrogate). 3   Therefore, the parent or surrogate, the surgeon, and the anesthesiologist   should reevaluate the DNR order for a child who requires an   operative procedure. This reevaluation process has been called   ""required reconsideration"" 3  and should be incorporated into   the process of informed consent for surgery and anesthesia.   Discussions regarding consent under these circumstances should   be initiated by attending staff, particularly in hospitals with   residency teaching programs in which residents may be routinely   involved in the consent process.     The surgeon and anesthesiologist must approach the parents and   child with compassion. There is often no previous relationship   established between the patient, parents, and surgical team,   precluding a brief preoperative assessment. ""Active listening""   is essential. The parent or surrogate should be asked about   specific interventions and their understanding of the relative   merits of each of these interventions during resuscitation (Table   3 ). 15  Airway management should be determined by what is mandated   by the child's condition and the surgical procedure. Specific   prohibition of tracheal intubation is problematic, and beliefs   and concerns must be carefully elicited and discussed. Exceptions   to the injunctions against intervention should be specifically   noted in the patient's medical record. The parent may agree   to a temporary suspension of the DNR order during the perioperative   period. If so, the temporal end point to the DNR suspension   needs to be recorded as well. If an agreement cannot be obtained   after thorough discussion, the wishes of the informed parent   or surrogate must prevail. In some cases, the parents may feel   that the burden of a therapy is not worth the potential benefits   and decline the procedure. When an individual physician feels   that the parent's wishes are inconsistent with his or her medical,   ethical, or moral views, the physician should withdraw from   the case after ensuring continuity of care 13  and could consider   consulting the institutional ethics committee.            View this table:   [in this window]   [in a new window]       TABLE 3.  Potential Interventions During Resuscitation             Role of the Surgeon   The following are operative interventions that might be considered   for a pediatric patient with a DNR order:  Provision of a support   device that will enable the child to   be discharged from the   hospital (eg, gastrostomy tube or tracheostomy).      Urgent surgery   for a condition unrelated to the underlying chronic   problem   (eg, acute appendicitis in a terminal cancer patient).      Urgent   surgery for a condition related to the underlying chronic   problem   but not believed to be a terminal event (eg, a pathologic   fracture   or bowel obstruction).      A procedure to decrease pain.      A procedure   to provide vascular access.          It is the duty of the operating surgeon to discuss risks of   a procedure with the parent or other surrogate of any pediatric   patient, including how the patient's condition might influence   the risk of anesthesia. The American College of Surgeons (ACS)   issued a statement to guide surgeons in operating on patients   with an active DNR order. 24  The ACS statement does not make   specific reference to patient surrogates, although it is implied. 24   It is expected that the surgeon will advise parents or other   surrogates and the child (if developmentally appropriate) regarding   operative risks and benefits and advocate a policy of required   reconsideration of previous DNR orders. The results of all discussions   should be documented in the patient's medical record. The surgeon   should also ultimately convey the patient's wishes to the members   of the entire operating room team, help operating team members   understand the patient's or surrogate's wishes, and find alternate   team members to replace individuals who disagree with the patient's   or surrogate's wishes. With children, the difficulty arises   when there is no one who is willing to honor a family's wish   to continue the DNR status during the anesthesia and surgery.   Stalemates such as this should be referred to the ethics committee   of the institution.      Role of the Anesthesiologist   In 1994 and 1999, the ASA released recommendations on caring   for surgical patients with active DNR orders. 15  These guidelines   explicitly reject the practice of automatically rescinding the   DNR order before procedures involving the use of anesthesia,   because this practice ""may not sufficiently address a patient's   rights to self-determination in a responsible and ethical manner."" 15   The purpose of required reconsideration of DNR orders is to   determine what is best for the patient under the circumstances,   not to convince the patient and family to have the DNR order   suspended. The guidelines proposed by the ASA clearly recommend   that all physicians involved in the case (primary physician,   surgeon, and anesthesiologist) discuss together with the patient   (or other surrogate) the appropriateness of maintaining the   DNR order during the operation. The 1999 guidelines distinguish   between goal-directed and procedure-directed DNR orders. 15  Model   procedure-specific DNR documentation forms are published and   may be modified for individual hospital use. 9     A goal-directed approach focuses on the patient's goals, values,   and preferences rather than on individual procedures. The primary   goal is to do everything to prevent the need for resuscitation,   but if it occurs, this approach recognizes that patients are   often less concerned with technical details of the resuscitation   than with more subjective and personal issues regarding quality   of life before and after resuscitation. This model promulgates   an approach that honors the family's treatment goals while reflecting   the reality and unique aspects of the perioperative environment.   However, some anesthesiologists are uncomfortable with the indeterminate   nature of a goal-directed DNR order and have ethical or legal   concerns about having such crucial decisions rest solely on   their best judgment at the time of arrest.     Goal-directed DNR orders may be less feasible if the anesthesiologist   and surgeon caring for the child have not established a relationship   with the family before surgery. A procedure-directed approach   may be more appropriate in these circumstances, which involves   careful consideration of a series of specific interventions   that are likely to be used (Table  3 ). Each must be placed in   the context of the child's usual quality of life and likelihood   of the ability of the procedure to produce the desired effect,   given his or her unique physiology. This approach has limited   flexibility when an unexpected situation occurs. 9     Perioperative suspension of the DNR order is considered by some   anesthesiologists to be the ideal compromise, because it enables   the physician to act without restraint while providing the patient   with a realistic chance of achieving the operative goals. 10 , 25   Anesthetic agents and techniques may promote some degree of   hemodynamic and respiratory abnormality, especially in patients   with a deteriorated health condition. 2  The deliberate depression   of vital functions by the anesthetic may require resuscitative   measures to stabilize the patient. 11  Consequently, controversy   about the use of these interventions arises when the patient   has a written DNR order. Many of the routine anesthetic interventions   performed as part of operative maintenance are considered resuscitative   measures under different circumstances. These interventions   include the use of paralytic agents, vasoactive drugs, blood   products, and positive-pressure ventilation. This overlap in   terminology promotes confusion and inconsistencies among physicians   on the interpretation of a patient's DNR order and what it implies   in an operative setting. Keffer and Keffer 8 , 19  proposed that   resuscitation in the operating room be defined as ""those measures   undertaken to reestablish cardiac rhythm once a cardiac arrest   has occurred."" 8 (p644)  This definition establishes a simple end   point beyond which a patient's wish not to be resuscitated would   come into play.     The anesthesiologists' concern for patient comfort during the   procedure may support perioperative suspension of DNR orders.   An active DNR order restricts the physicians' ability to treat   any complications of their own procedure during anesthesia.   Faced with this dilemma, anesthesiologists are forced to decrease   the risk of cardiopulmonary arrest by increasing hemodynamic   stability through the use of less anesthetic. 2 , 11 , 26  For the   patient, this may potentially result in more discomfort and   suffering.     One reason to distinguish DNR in the operating room from DNR   in other settings is the difference in the success rate of CPR   administered for a spontaneous cardiopulmonary arrest versus   one that results from anesthesia. Anesthetic-related arrests   are believed to be more easily reversible because of the immediate   ability to respond and the controlled nature of the event. 3 , 19 , 26 , 27   One study of surgical patients suggested that when a cardiac   arrest was ascribed to anesthesia, 92% of the patients were   resuscitated successfully. 3 , 28  However, it is difficult to determine   how these statistics apply to terminally ill patients with a   DNR designation, because the survey was very broad and inclusive.   A more relevant survey was conducted on 4301 seriously ill adult   patients, and a few underwent an operative procedure and had   previously written DNR orders in their medical records. Only   3 of the 57 patients with DNR orders (5%) experienced an intraoperative   cardiopulmonary arrest, but all died within 5 days of operation. 29     Traditionally, CPR has been considered a success if the patient   survives the initial resuscitation effort. For patients with   DNR orders, the success of CPR may be better gauged on the length   of patient survival 7  and expected quality of life after resuscitation.   Using this definition, CPR may be inappropriate from the parent's   or surrogate's viewpoint if resuscitation has the overwhelming   probability of resulting in patient suffering and only prolonging   the time to death. 7  Anesthesiologists have the duty to inform   the parent or other surrogate of the risks and potential benefits   of intraoperative resuscitation. Required reconsideration as   part of the process of informed consent for anesthesia eliminates   ambiguities and misunderstandings associated with patients who   have DNR orders by providing anesthesiologists with the opportunity   to educate the parent (or other surrogate) to become familiar   with their values and perceptions of the child's quality of   life and together clarify how the child's DNR order should be   interpreted perioperatively. By giving parents or surrogates   and clinicians the option of deciding from among full resuscitation,   limitations based on procedures, or limitations based on goals,   the child's needs are individualized and better served. Regardless   of the decision made by the parent or other surrogate, the individual   acting on behalf of the child must be readily available for   consultation during the procedure. The ASA, like the ACS, advocates   that physicians withdraw from a case when they are unwilling   or unable to respect and implement a patient's (or other surrogate's)   decision to limit the use of resuscitation. 15 , 24      If DNR Orders Are Suspended: Qualification of Perioperative Interval   If the family or medical personnel involved in a child's care   choose to suspend DNR orders during anesthesia and surgery,   it is necessary to define the duration of suspension. 30  The   physiologic effects of anesthesia and surgery rarely terminate   at the end of the procedure, but the duration thereafter depends   on the anesthetic technique used and the type of surgical procedure   performed. The acute effects of most anesthetic medications   generally resolve within several hours or 1 day after surgery,   and most anesthesiologists visit the patient the day after a   surgical procedure and document recovery status in the patient   record. Recovery of respiratory function after surgery depends   on preoperative pulmonary function, chronicity of illness, and   length of the procedure. Some patients will experience cardiopulmonary   arrest during or immediately after surgery, which may be the   result of an acute and reversible complication. It is appropriate   to use mechanical ventilation after surgery as long as the patient   continues to show significant and sustained improvement in pulmonary   function. Once the patient ceases to recover or deteriorates,   withdrawal of ventilatory support should be considered. Generally   speaking, the suspension of DNR orders should continue until   the postanesthetic visit, until the patient has been weaned   from mechanical ventilation, or until the primary physician   involved in the patient's care and the family agree to reinstate   the DNR order.     The surgeon and anesthesiologist should feel comfortable, and   should be allowed, to reinstate a DNR order intraoperatively   through consultation with the family under certain conditions.   For example, if cardiac arrest occurs during surgery and it   is apparent that the arrest is the result of an irreversible   underlying disease or complication and that CPR would only allow   continued deterioration, the DNR order should be reinstated.   If resuscitation measures are withheld and intraoperative arrest   occurs, such a death should be classified as ""expected"" for   quality-assurance purposes rather than ""unexpected."" Expected   deaths do not require mandatory quality-assurance review. 18 , 31                 IMPLEMENTING ""REQUIRED RECONSIDERATION""      TOP   ABSTRACT   CONSIDERATIONS FOR CHILDREN WITH...

Liaisons   Consultant   Staff   REFERENCES        Hospitals are encouraged to develop and maintain written policies   permitting the forgoing of life-sustaining treatment of patients,   including children, in appropriate circumstances. 13  Once a DNR   order is in place according to accepted standards, it is important   that it be reviewed before surgery to determine applicability   in the operating room and the postoperative recovery period.   Hospitals wishing to develop a ""required reconsideration"" policy   (Table  4 ) may want to address the following elements:  Include   in the discussion with a child's parent or other surrogate   information   about the likelihood of requiring resuscitative   measures, a   description of these measures and their reversibility,   the chance   of success, and possible outcomes with and without   resuscitation.   Establish an agreement about what, if any, resuscitative   measures   will be instituted during the procedure.      Make the decision   to uphold or suspend a DNR order on the basis   of the planned   procedure, the anticipated benefit for the child,   and the likelihood   of patient compromise as a result of the   procedure.      Document   the salient features of the physician-family discussion   in the   medical record.      Communicate plans to honor an intraoperative   DNR order among   relevant staff.      Require any physician or other   health care professional who   is unwilling to honor a family's   refusal of resuscitation to   withdraw from the case and allow   others to assume care. The   withdrawing physician or health care   professional should make   a conscientious effort to identify   another physician who is   willing to honor the DNR request. 13      Recognize that a patient's or surrogate's decision to refuse   intraoperative resuscitation can be compatible with the provision   of therapeutic measures to treat conditions other than arrest.   This decision does not necessarily imply limits on other forms   of care such as intensive care.      If the family chooses to rescind   the DNR order in the operating   room and arrest occurs with resuscitation,   but the patient's   process of dying has only been prolonged,   make a provision to   discuss withdrawal of life support after   a determined amount   of time. 3 , 5 , 19                 View this table:   [in this window]   [in a new window]       TABLE 4.

Clinical trials are research programs conducted with human volunteers to evaluate a new medical treatment, drug or device. Alexian Brothers is currently engaged in over 120 such clinical trials. Those who participate in clinical trials are often the first ones to receive an investigational drug or gain access to new treatments before they are widely available. By participation, you also contribute to our growing body of medical knowledge.    There are benefits and risks involved in participating in a clinical trial. Talk to your Alexian physician before deciding to join a trial. An Institutional Review Board (IRB) reviews all Alexian clinical trials. An IRB is an independent body of medical, scientific, and community members who are responsible for ensuring the rights, safety, and well- being of human subjects involved in clinical trials.

clueweb09-enwp01-79-20486	"                     Do not resuscitate          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                    The examples and perspective in this article  may not represent a  worldwide view  of the subject . Please  improve this article  or discuss the issue on the  talk page .                 The  neutrality  of this article is  disputed .   Please see the discussion on the  talk page .  (February 2008)   Please do not remove this message until the  dispute is resolved.       In the  United States , a  Do Not Resuscitate , or  DNR  order is a written order from a  doctor  that  resuscitation  should not be attempted if a person suffers  cardiac  or  respiratory arrest . Such an order may be instituted on the basis of an  advance directive  from a person, or from someone entitled to make decisions on their behalf, such as a  health care proxy ; in some jurisdictions, such orders can also be instituted on the basis of a physician's own initiative, usually when resuscitation would not alter the ultimate outcome of a disease, and is designed to prevent unnecessary suffering.   Any person who does not wish to undergo  lifesaving  treatment in the event of cardiac or respiratory arrest can get a DNR order, although DNR is more commonly done when a person who has an  inevitably fatal illness  wishes to have a more natural  death  without painful or invasive medical procedures.           Contents       1   Alternative Names   2   United States   3   See also   4   References   5   External links               [ edit ]   Alternative Names   Alternative namings and abbreviations for this order are used depending on the geographic region.  DNR  (Do Not Resuscitate) is a common abbreviation in the United States and the United Kingdom. It may be clarified in some regions with the addition of  DNI  (Do Not Intubate), although in some hospitals  DNR  alone will imply no  intubation . Some areas of the United States and the United Kingdom include the letter A, as in  DNAR , to clarify ""Do Not  Attempt  Resuscitation."" This alteration is so that it is not presumed by the patient/family that an attempt at resuscitation will be successful. Since the term DNR implies the omission of action, and therefore 'giving up', some have advocated for these orders to be re-termed  Allow Natural Death [ 1 ] . New Zealand and Australia (and some hospitals in the UK) use the term  NFR  or  Not For Resuscitation . Typically these abbreviations are written without periods in between the letters, i.e.  AND/DNR  not  A.N.D./D.N.R.   Until recently in the UK it was common to write ""Not for 222"" or conversationally, ""Not for twos."" This was implicitly a hospital DNR order, where 222 (or similar) is the hospital telephone number for the emergency resuscitation or crash team.     [ edit ]   United States   The DNR order came into being in the  U.S.  in the 1960s when  defibrillation  allowed the reversal of cardiac arrest, but this may prolong the life of the patient for only a short time.   In the U.S.,  cardiopulmonary resuscitation  (CPR) and  advanced cardiac life support  (ACLS) should not be performed if a valid written ""DNR"" order is present. In any cases of doubt,  emergency medical technicians ,  paramedics  and other  medical  workers will perform as if a DNR order did not exist, as is required by law.   For the DNR to be valid there may be rules such as the use of a special form and/or additional signatures of a doctor and/or witnesses, etc. The exact rules for obtaining a DNR order, and for emergency medical personnel to accept the validity of one, vary widely according to jurisdiction. For example, in the state of  Maryland , only state DNR orders are acceptable, and they require much verification, witnesses and doctor's signatures in order to be valid. In contrast, the state of  Virginia  allows patients to receive a DNR order with relative ease, and will accept them from most jurisdictions.   In many jurisdictions, medical professionals are ordered not to acknowledge DNR orders. This is especially common with  paramedics , who are often employed by private companies unwilling to fight a potential lawsuit.   A DNR order must be filed on a jurisdictionally recognized form. A doctor contemplating a DNR decision should make every reasonable effort to confirm a DNR status before deciding to withhold resuscitation. To be sure that their DNR request is honored, patients should make their wishes clearly known to their family, doctors, community hospitals, care homes and any other caregivers or health care providers who may be present should a cardiac arrest occur. Some jurisdictions provide for a legally sanctioned DNR notification that is clearly visible to all healthcare personnel, similar to a  MedicAlert bracelet .   A DNR order's specific effect depends on the hospital in which the incident occurs and the terms laid out in the DNR: neither cardiopulmonary resuscitation nor  intubation  will be performed, but treatment for infections or other treatable conditions, intravenous feeding and fluids, pain management and comfort care are generally continued.

Why doesn't NCBDE provide review courses or publish a study guide?          Are there professional practice experiences that are not considered diabetes education?          Who is eligible for certification as a diabetes educator?          What is diabetes self-management education?          Is there a maximum number of hours per week that may be claimed as diabetes self-management education?          How long is certification valid?

Where  can I find information on the Board Certified-Advanced Diabetes Management  (""BC-ADM"") certification?                  Why  doesn't NCBDE provide review courses or publish a study guide?        As outlined in its Articles of Incorporation and  mission statement, NCBDE's responsibilities do not include the creation or  development of educational courses or materials. NCBDE believes that offering  preparation courses or study materials would constitute a conflict of interest  and could imply a guarantee of passing.             Are  there professional practice experiences that are not considered diabetes  education?        There are activities that are  not  considered diabetes education  employment for purposes of certification eligibility and should not be included  as part of Professional Practice Experience. While not an exhaustive list, the  following are examples of such activities:                diabetes  related functions performed as part of or in the course of other routine occupational  duties (e.g., routine nursing care, routine nutritional counseling, routine  pharmacy practice)              providing  continuing education to professionals (e.g., teaching nurses, physicians)              supervising  and managing other professionals              volunteer  activities, including diabetes camp              any  experience in a student capacity              membership  and committee work in professional organizations              providing  medical assessment, diagnosis, or treatment              conducting/participating  in research activities in which the individual is not involved in diabetes  self-management education             dispensing/prescribing  medications or diabetes supplies              promoting  or selling medications or diabetes supplies and products             employment by manufacturers of diabetes products and/or product services (e.g., insulin delivery devices)             having  diabetes or caring for a family member with diabetes              any  work or other experience prior to receipt of license, registration, or advanced  degree required for certification eligibility             any  work experience in practice settings outside the United States or its territories              any  work experience completed more than five years prior to the date of application              any  diabetes educator job in which diabetes self-management education is performed  less than 4 hours per week             employment  in one or more concurrent part-time diabetes educator jobs in which diabetes  self-management education is performed less than 4 hours per week in each job                                   Who  is eligible for certification as a diabetes educator?        The Examination is designed and intended for the  professional who has a defined role as a diabetes educator, not for those who  may perform some diabetes related functions as part of or in the course of  other routine occupational duties. Specific   eligibility  requirements  can be found in the Certification Handbook or on this site.             What  is diabetes self-management education?        Diabetes education, also referred to as diabetes self-management education or diabetes self-management training, is performed by health care professionals who have appropriate credentials and experience consistent with the particular profession's scope of practice. For purposes of this web site, diabetes self-management education (""DSME"") is used.             DSME is defined as the ongoing process of facilitating the knowledge, skill, and ability necessary for diabetes self-care. This process incorporates the needs, goals and life experiences of the person with diabetes and is guided by evidence-based standards. The overall objectives of DSME are to support informed decision-making, self-care behaviors, problem-solving and active collaboration with the health care team and to improve clinical outcomes, health status, and quality of life‡.         ‡National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management Education. American Diabetes Association. Diabetes Care, Vol. 30, No. 6, June, 2007.        Is  there a maximum number of hours per week that may be claimed as diabetes  self-management education?        Yes, NCBDE has determined that 40 is the maximum  number of hours per week in diabetes self-management education that may be  reported when applying for certification. However, regardless of the number of  hours per week worked, it is important that the diabetes educator claim only  time spent performing diabetes self-management education. As in any job, there  is a certain amount of time not dedicated to primary responsibilities. Teaching  other health care professionals, completing administrative duties, planning for  a class, conducting a community health fair screening, are a few examples of  other responsibilities that may be not be counted toward meeting professional  practice requirements. Other examples are identified under the following FAQ:  Are there professional practice experiences that are not  considered diabetes education?             How  long is certification valid?        NCBDE  requires all CDEs to renew certification every five (5) years. It is the  responsibility of the individual certificant to keep abreast of any changes in  certification and/or renewal requirements. Valid dates of the credential should  be monitored and applications for renewal submitted by published deadlines.  Extensions of certification are NOT granted.             When  will I hear about the status of my application for the Examination?        For 2008 Examinations, see  Exam Application Status page . Information on 2009 application process will be published as it becomes available.        Where  can I find information on the Board Certified-Advanced Diabetes Management  (""BC-ADM"") certification?        NCBDE does not administer or manage the BC-ADM  certification program. It is jointly sponsored by the American Association of  Diabetes Educators (“AADE”) and  the American Nurses Credentialing   Center.

Compared with standard physicals that typically only look at 20-40 biomarkers (proteins in the blood like glucose and cholesterol), Biophysical250 measures those same biomarkers, plus those used routinely by 12 different medical specialties, including cardiology, oncology and rheumatology, for a total of more than 250 different biomarkers.      With a blood sample of approximately two tablespoons, the Biophysical250 provides an assessment that can help indicate the presence of certain diseases and medical conditions at their earliest stages, often before symptoms appear.     ""Alexian Brothers is committed to providing extensive community health services and Biophysical is proud to be a part of their healthcare solution,"" said Dr. George Rodgers, president and chief medical officer with Biophysical Corporation. ""Biophysical250 will serve as an integral offering, and will enable Alexian Brothers' physicians and patients to better understand and manage their health in a much more comprehensive way.""     Patients will be able to provide a blood sample at the Alexian Medical Mall facility located in northwest suburban Schaumburg, while existing Alexian executive health program clients can opt to have the sample taken at their place of business. After receiving the Biophysical250 results, an Alexian Brothers physician will provide a personalized, comprehensive consultation explaining the report.      ""The leading causes of death and disability in this country are preventable. Millions of adults live with undetected illness. The Alexian Brothers Hospital Network in partnership with Biophysical Corporation will change the paradigm of healthcare,"" said Karen Giammicchio, director of Alexian's Center for Prevention and Early Detection, who believes that this advanced approach will serve patients and their desire to proactively monitor their health. ""Our goal at Alexian is to provide real immediate and long range impact on our patients' health and to empower them to make the right lifestyle changes to improve their health.""      The Alexian Brothers Center for Prevention and Early Detection offers an array of early detection screenings, including the BioAnalysis 360, a global approach to preventive medicine. The BioAnalysis 360 includes the Biophysical250 biomarker test, as well as a comprehensive personal and family health history, and a fully integrated professional team of healthcare providers and nurse navigators to guide patients through the process and results.    About Alexian Brothers Hospital Network     The Alexian Brothers Hospital Network (ABHN) is comprised of Alexian Brothers Medical Center in Elk Grove Village, St. Alexius Medical Center in Hoffman Estates, Alexian Brothers Behavioral Health Hospital in Hoffman Estates, and the Alexian Rehabilitation Hospital in Elk Grove Village.

Under the program, scheduled to begin this year, patients will be offered an Alexian Brothers Hospital Network On-Line Personal Health Record during their stay in the hospital. There is no cost to the patient for the service, and the PHR holds information for up to 10 members in the family. The account will be initially populated with the patient's discharge records, which will include information about prescribed medications as well as other ongoing care instructions. Patients could then use the Alexian Brothers Hospital Network On-Line service to store and manage personal health and medical records they receive from any of their physicians or other continuing care providers.    In addition to storing personal health and medical records, the service includes a suite of useful management tools such as the ability to set up a prescription database, as well as calendar reminders for doctor appointments, prescriptions and when to take medication.    ""The goal of the program is to help make patients more aware of, and take greater control of, their continued healthcare after they leave the hospital and to be better able to manage the healthcare of their entire family,"" said Dr. Anthony Cutilletta, Alexian Brothers Hospital Network Vice President of Medical Affairs. ""Alexian Brothers Hospital Network On-Line will help Alexian deliver the most comprehensive care to our patients, whether they are in or out of the hospital.""    The service also features a special log-in that allows an Emergency Room physician or Emergency Medical Technician to access the latest and most vital information about a user, such as medical history, recent test results, prescriptions and allergies, in the event of a medical emergency in which the user cannot communicate.    ""Alexian Brothers and  MyMedicalRecords.com  have been working together in response to the government's goal to have Personal Health Records for all Americans,"" said Robert H. Lorsch,  MyMedicalRecords.com  CEO. ""Alexian Brothers is leading the way in their community by providing information to their patients that assures the best of care in or out of the hospital. MyMedicalRecords.com is proud to partner with Alexian Brothers to bring this important service to their patients.""    A recent Mayo Clinic Study reported the fact that the vast majority of patients discharged from the hospital lack basic awareness of their health situation. The study, which looked at 43 patients discharged from a municipal teaching hospital, indicated that 62 percent of patients did not know the purpose of their medications, 86 percent did not know the common side effects of the drugs they take and 58 percent were unable to give their diagnosis.    Alexian Brothers Hospital Network On-Line users receive a personal telephone number, which can be used both for voice and fax messaging. Personal health and medical records can easily be faxed into the user's password secured account by their providers. The system then converts the fax into a PDF file which can be read with free Adobe ®  software. In addition, images such as x-rays, scans and ultrasounds can be uploaded directly from the PC desktop. Information then can be filed in any of 16 file folders. Because Alexian Brothers Hospital Network On-Line is a Web-based service, users can retrieve their records from any Internet-connected computer in the world.    The product also provides users with a personal, secure PIN protected voice mail box, which allows doctors to leave private messages.    Beyond storing and managing personal medical and health information, users can take advantage of a suite of useful tools including a database for recording prescription drugs, the ability to create and then print out a complete family medical history, as well as calendars with reminders for doctor appointments, prescription refills and when to take medications. Calendar reminders set up in Alexian Brothers Hospital Network On-Line seamlessly integrate with Microsoft Outlook ® .    The service is bilingual, English and Spanish, so it supports the needs of the larger community that accesses the Alexian Brothers Hospital Network.    Information sent in and out of user accounts is secured by 256-bit encryption technology. The MyMedicalRecords.com portal that receives voice and fax messages is the same that handles transactions for Fortune 500 financial and insurance companies. In addition, MMR maintains redundant data centers in different geographic locations, so that the system is available in the event of an outage.    ""We recognize that the safety and security of information is of paramount concern to users,"" said Lorsch, ""and we have taken the necessary steps to ensure that they can have confidence in the privacy of their data. In fact, while MMR is not a HIPAA covered entity, we believe we exceed HIPAA guidelines for security and privacy.""    In addition to offering Alexian Brothers Hospital Network On-Line for its discharged patients, the hospital system plans to offer the PHR as a complimentary benefit for its 5,000 employees. That program is expected to commence in September.

By recognizing select medical facilities for their advanced stroke care, the Joint Commission designation helps the public identify which hospitals offer the best possible outcomes for stroke patients.      ""As Certified Stroke Centers, the Alexian Brothers Hospital Network, demonstrated its ability to provide care from a multi-disciplinary team of neurologists, emergency department specialists, radiologists, nurses, therapists, pharmacists, and technicians, each working in a coordinated, collaborative system,"" said Wende Fedder RN, MBA, Administrative Director Alexian Brothers Hospital Network Stroke Program. ""To maintain its certification, the Stroke Centers must document and report its evidence-based patient outcomes.""      ""Stroke is one of the most preventable of all life-threatening health problems, yet each year, more than 750,000 people experience a stroke,"" said Phil Gorelick MD, MPH, Stroke Center Medical Director at Alexian Brothers Hospital Network. The Joint Commission's new initiative to certify disease specific units and programs at hospitals is a new trend in healthcare. ""We commend these organizations for seeking certification and serving as an example of standardization and, thereby, improving the care stroke patients receive. We look forward to other organizations joining them in making a public commitment to quality and safety,"" said Maureen Potter, executive director of the Disease Specific Care certification program at the Joint Commission.

clueweb09-enwp00-76-01081	"                     Do not resuscitate          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia        (Redirected from  Do not resuscitate order )            Jump to:  navigation ,  search                    The examples and perspective in this article  may not represent a  worldwide view  of the subject . Please  improve this article  or discuss the issue on the  talk page .                 The  neutrality  of this article is  disputed .   Please see the discussion on the  talk page .  (February 2008)   Please do not remove this message until the  dispute is resolved.       In the  United States , a  do not resuscitate , or  DNR , order is a written order from a  doctor  that  resuscitation  should not be attempted if a person suffers  cardiac  or  respiratory arrest . Such an order may be instituted on the basis of an  advance directive  from a person, or from someone entitled to make decisions on their behalf, such as a  health care proxy ; in some jurisdictions, such orders can also be instituted on the basis of a physician's own initiative, usually when resuscitation would not alter the ultimate outcome of a disease, and is designed to prevent unnecessary suffering.   Any person who does not wish to undergo  lifesaving  treatment in the event of cardiac or respiratory arrest can get a DNR order, although DNR is more commonly done when a person who has an  terminal illness  wishes to have a more natural  death  without painful or invasive medical procedures.           Contents       1   Alternative names   2   United States   3   See also   4   References   5   External links               [ edit ]   Alternative names   Alternative namings and abbreviations for this order are used depending on the geographic region.  DNR  (Do Not Resuscitate) is a common abbreviation in the United States and the United Kingdom. It may be clarified in some regions with the addition of  DNI  (Do Not Intubate), although in some hospitals  DNR  alone will imply no  intubation . Some areas of the United States and the United Kingdom include the letter A, as in  DNAR , to clarify ""Do Not  Attempt  Resuscitation."" This alteration is so that it is not presumed by the patient/family that an attempt at resuscitation will be successful. Since the term DNR implies the omission of action, and therefore ""giving up"", some have advocated for these orders to be retermed  Allow Natural Death [ 1 ] . New Zealand and Australia (and some hospitals in the UK) use the term  NFR  or  Not For Resuscitation . Typically, these abbreviations are written without periods between the letters, i.e.  AND/DNR  not  A.N.D./D.N.R. .   Until recently in the UK it was common to write ""Not for 222"" or conversationally, ""Not for twos."" This was implicitly a hospital DNR order, where 222 (or similar) is the hospital telephone number for the emergency resuscitation or crash team.     [ edit ]   United States   The DNR order came into being in the  U.S.  in the 1960s when  defibrillation  allowed the reversal of cardiac arrest, but this may prolong the life of the patient for only a short time.   In the U.S.,  cardiopulmonary resuscitation  (CPR) and  advanced cardiac life support  (ACLS) should not be performed if a valid written ""DNR"" order is present. In any cases of doubt,  emergency medical technicians ,  paramedics  and other  medical  workers will perform as if a DNR order did not exist, as is required by law.   For the DNR to be valid there may be rules such as the use of a special form and/or additional signatures of a doctor and/or witnesses, etc. The exact rules for obtaining a DNR order, and for emergency medical personnel to accept the validity of one, vary widely according to jurisdiction. For example, in the state of  Maryland , only state DNR orders are acceptable, and they require much verification, witnesses and doctor's signatures in order to be valid. In contrast, the state of  Virginia  allows patients to receive a DNR order with relative ease, and will accept them from most jurisdictions.   In many jurisdictions, medical professionals are ordered not to acknowledge DNR orders. This is especially common with  paramedics , who are often employed by private companies unwilling to fight a potential lawsuit.   A DNR order must be filed on a jurisdictionally recognized form. A doctor contemplating a DNR decision should make every reasonable effort to confirm a DNR status before deciding to withhold resuscitation. To be sure that their DNR request is honored, patients should make their wishes clearly known to their family, doctors, community hospitals, care homes and any other caregivers or health care providers who may be present should a cardiac arrest occur. Some jurisdictions provide for a legally sanctioned DNR notification that is clearly visible to all healthcare personnel, similar to a  MedicAlert bracelet .   A DNR order's specific effect depends on the hospital in which the incident occurs and the terms laid out in the DNR: neither cardiopulmonary resuscitation nor  intubation  will be performed, but treatment for infections or other treatable conditions, intravenous feeding and fluids, pain management and comfort care are generally continued.

clueweb09-en0000-33-16865	"                                                                               Health Professions         The Early History of Nursing Schools in St. Louis          A total of 24 training schools for nurses were established in Missouri during the latter decades of the 19th century. In addition to the 15 St. Louis schools listed below, 7 were founded in Kansas City and 2 in St. Joseph. By 1911, 47 nurse training schools were operating in Missouri, including 2 collegiate schools of nursing (the University of Missouri and Washington University). By 1921 the establishment of regulatory laws and standards both diminished the rate of increase of new schools and caused some schools, whose foundations were not substantial, to close. The economic pressures of the Depression further reduced the number of nurse training schools, forcing the closing of 16 training schools in Missouri.      The 19th Century      Only 10 years after the first school of nursing was established in the United States, a group of 20 educational, medical, legal and civic leaders in St. Louis convened an organizational meeting on December 7, 1883, establishing the  St. Louis Training School for Nurses . The eight woman executive committee chose Mrs. William H. Pulsifer, a non-practicing physician, as president of the organization. Mrs. Pulsifer had investigated conditions at the City Hospital regarding the care of the city’s sick, poor residents and was instrumental in interesting others in establishing a school of nursing.                                   Miss Emma L. Warr                                                                 The school opened in the spring of 1884 and was based at the St. Louis City Hospital. Students received a small monthly allowance from the city in return for working 12-hour days on the wards and attending lectures. The two-year course of study was under the direction of Miss  Emma L. Warr , a graduate of the New York Hospital School of Nursing. The first class of four students graduated in April 1886. By 1891 almost all of the St. Louis City Hospital’s nursing service supervision was provided by St. Louis Training School for Nurses graduates and students.                Nurses' Home, St. Louis Training School for Nurses, ca. 1906                          The St. Louis Training School for Nurses, in association with the St. Louis Provident Association, began the first visiting nurse program in the city in the autumn of 1895. Miss Elizabeth Brown, a graduate of the Training School, was the city’s first “district nurse.” Street-cars, and later a horse and buggy, transported the visiting nurses to the homes of the sick poor. The visiting nurses carried with them clean linen and a wash basin. The St. Louis Training School for Nurses may also be credited with the first informal courses in public nursing, as student nurses were assigned to assist the visiting nurses.                 St. Louis City Hospital, ca. 1910                       In 1895 Miss Warr requested that the course of study be extended to three years, but before any action had been taken, a tornado that swept through St. Louis on May 27, 1896 demolished the City Hospital. The curriculum was changed when the City Hospital was rebuilt and reopened in 1905. In 1915 the City of St. Louis Board of Alderman passed an ordinance providing for a municipal training school for nurses. In July of that year the St. Louis Training School for Nurses was transferred to the city and renamed the  St. Louis City Hospital Training School for Nurses .      By the end of the 19th century, several more training schools for nurses had opened in St. Louis.       St. Luke’s Hospital, established in 1865, began a training school for nurses in 1889. Under the supervision of Mrs. Mary J. Chambers, superintendent of the nurses at the hospital, the  St. Luke’s Training School for Nurses  enrolled its first class in March 1889. Seven students received diplomas in May 1892. The initial curriculum combined classroom instruction in the nursing arts and basic sciences with lectures given by the medical staff. In 1891 the school was made a permanent department of the hospital; by 1901 the course of study was expanded to three years.       The  Protestant Hospital Training School for Nurses  opened in October 1890, offering an eighteen-month course of study. The school, under superintendent of nurses, Miss Josephine B. Rice, closed in 1900. The Protestant Hospital itself closed in 1909.      The Evangelical Deaconess Hospital opened in August 1889 in an 11-room house, with a staff of four doctors and two deaconesses, Mrs. Katherine Haack and her adopted daughter Miss Lydia Daries. The  School for Deaconess Nurses  opened in 1891 and trained deaconess nurses only. Nursing education was of the apprenticeship type. Younger deaconesses learned to care for patients by following the instructions of older deaconesses. Lectures on anatomy and physiology were given twice a week by a physician. Though the hospital prospered and grew, the nursing school was slow in producing graduates. The first graduate was Sister Magdalene Gerhold in 1893. The next graduate was not consecrated until 1902. The school began to prosper during the early years of the 20th century, training Deaconess sisters who worked both in hospitals and as missionaries. In 1931 the institution became the Deaconess Hospital School of Nursing. The school began admitting lay students in 1943. Now known as the Deaconess College of Nursing, the institution now offers both a bachelor’s and associate’s degree in nursing.      The  St. Louis Baptist Hospital Training School for Nurses  opened in 1893 with a two-year course of training. The curriculum was expanded to three years in 1903, in keeping with the trend toward higher standards elsewhere. The St. Louis Baptist Hospital became a commercial enterprise in the early 1920s and the name changed to the Central Hospital. The Central Hospital Training School for Nurses continued until a last class was admitted in 1929, graduating in 1932.       The Rebekah Hospital and  Rebekah Hospital Training School for Nurses  opened concurrently in January 1893. In 1895 the Marion-Sims Medical College assumed control of the Rebekah Hospital Training School. Seventeen women were graduated from the Training School before its closing around the turn of the century.      The Women’s Hospital and the  Women’s Hospital Training School for Nurses  opened concurrently in 1894. The school was intended solely to provide training for its own personnel.                Mullanphy Hospital, early 1900s                          The Sisters of Charity founded the  Mullanphy Hospital Training School for Nurses  in 1894, offering a two-year course of instruction. The first students were on 24-hour duty, seven days a week, and quartered in the wards. The program was expanded to three years in 1900. By then students had their own quarters and duty was reduced to 12-hours per day, seven days a week.      The  Missouri Baptist Sanitarium Training School for Nurses  was organized in October 1895 and graduated its first four students in April 1897. Miss Sarah Whelpton, a graduate of the St. Louis Training School for Nurses, was appointed superintendent of nurses of the Sanitarium and given the task of organizing the training school.      The  Mayfield Sanitarium Training School for Nurses  began its program in 1896, though the first six graduates did not receive their diplomas until 1901. A total of 103 women graduated from the school before its closing in 1919.      The Bethesda Hospital and the  Bethesda Hospital Training School for Nurses  were incorporated in 1896. Miss Alice Funk, the first to enroll in the school and one of the first group of graduates, served as the first superintendent of the school. From 1898 until 1933 when the last class was graduated, a total of 178 nurses received diplomas from the school.                Lutheran Hospital, ca. 1900                          The Lutheran Hospital, founded in 1858, established a training school for nurses in 1898. The  Lutheran Hospital Training School for Nurses  was under the direction of Mrs. Louise Krauss, a graduate of the Rebekah Hospital Training School for Nurses. Mrs. Krauss served as director from 1898 until 1904, from 1908 to 1909, and finally from 1919 until 1933.      Provident Hospital, a small facility run by African-American physicians for their patients, opened a training program for African American nurses in 1899. Missouri’s first training school for African-American nurses, the  Provident Hospital Training School for Nurses , offered a two-year course of instruction, with lectures provided by the hospital’s medical and consulting staff.      St. Anthony’s Hospital and its nurses’ training school were established by a group of Franciscan Sisters in 1900. The  St. Anthony’s Hospital Training School for Nurses  trained only religious sisters; the last class graduated in 1929. Few of the 83 graduates took the Missouri state board examinations, principally because obstetrics was neither included in the curriculum nor allowed in the training experience.      The year 1900 also saw the opening of the Centenary Hospital and the  Centenary Hospital Training School for Nurses . Miss M. E. Hainsworth, a graduate of the St. Luke’s Hospital Training School for Nurses, was the principal of the school. Eight classes were graduated before the hospital and training school closed in 1911.           The 20th Century      The new century saw the establishment of not only more hospital-based schools of nursing but also the first collegiate schools of nursing in St. Louis and Missouri. The more successful hospital schools included the Jewish Hospital of St. Louis, St. John’s Hospital, St. Mary’s Hospital, and Homer G. Phillips Hospital. The University of Missouri established a three-year training school for nurses in 1901. Washington University opened its training school in 1905. In 1928 the St. Louis University School of Nursing was organized.                Jewish Hospital School of Nursing, 1950s                          The  Jewish Hospital Training School for Nurses  opened in 1902. The three-year diploma school graduated its first class in 1905. In 1925 the name was changed to the  Jewish Hospital School of Nursing . The three-year diploma program was replaced with a degree program in 1993 when the school was reorganized as the Jewish Hospital College of Nursing and Allied Health.       The Sisters of Mercy’s St. John’s Hospital, established in 1871, affiliated with the St. Louis University School of Medicine in 1903. Two years later the  St. John’s Hospital Training School for Nurses  was established with instruction provided by the medical staff and graduate lay nurse instructors. In 1928 the St. John’s Hospital School of Nursing joined St. Mary’s Hospital and Alexian Brothers Hospital as units of the St. Louis University School of Nursing. St. John’s discontinued its association with St. Louis University in 1937. The  Alexian Brothers Hospital School of Nursing  admitted only members of the Congregation of Alexian Brothers, the oldest order of men engaged in hospital work in the Roman Catholic Church. The school was short-lived – the school was accredited in 1928, separated from St. Louis University in 1934, and graduated its last students in 1952.      St. Mary’s Infirmary School of Nursing  opened with a three-year program in 1907 and at first offered instruction to the religious sisters (Sisters of St. Mary, the founders of the hospital) only. The school was opened to lay students in 1928. In 1933, the hospital and school were rededicated to the service of African-American patients and was entirely staffed by black doctors and nurses, excepting the Sisters themselves. The school admitted only African-American women until the mid-1950s. At that time the administrators of the school thought it better to close the school that to convert to a non-segregated institution. The school closed after the graduation of the class of 1958.      The  St. Louis University School of Nursing  was organized in 1928 with the integration of the existing schools of nursing at St. John’s Hospital and St. Mary’s Hospital with the founding a new school of nursing at the Alexian Brothers Hospital. The educational policy and administration of the three schools was placed under the authority of the University. A curriculum leading to a bachelor of science degree in nursing began in 1937, while the three-year certificate program was discontinued in 1939. By 1935 the school was known as the School of Nursing and Allied Health Professions, with a division of Nursing and a division of Health and Hospital Services. Each division became a separate school of the university in 1979.                First nursing graduates, St. Louis City Hospital No. 2, 1919                          The Homer G. Phillips Hospital opened in February 1937 as the successor to the St. Louis City Hospital No. 2 for Colored, which had opened in 1919. Until it was reclassified as a racially integrated institution in 1954, Homer G. Phillips Hospital was the world’s largest exclusively black municipally operated general hospital. The first graduates of the  St. Louis City Hospital No. 2 School of Nursing  were Miss Bessie Newsome Miss Beatrice Wilkerson, Miss Agnes Smith, and Miss Beatrice Hinch who were registered to practice nursing in 1922. In 1940 Mrs. Estelle Massey Riddle Osborne became the hospital’s first African-American superintendent of nurses. Beginning with the class of 1955, the  Homer G. Phillips Hospital School of Nursing  was desegregated. The Nursing School graduated its last class in 1968; the hospital closed in 1979.                Barnes Hospital School of Nursing, Class of 1959                          A latecomer to the field of hospital-sponsored schools of nursing was Barnes Hospital. The  Barnes Hospital School of Nursing  began its three-year diploma program in 1955.    In 1989 the Hospital restyled its nursing programs, phasing out the diploma program of the School of Nursing and offering a four-year bachelor’s degree through the newly launched Barnes College of Nursing.  In 1994, the Barnes College of Nursing merged with the University of Missouri - St. Louis, which at the time offered a program for registered nurses seeking bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees. The merged school, the Barnes College of Nursing at the University of Missouri – St. Louis, joined St. Louis University, Maryville University, and Deaconess College of Nursing in offering bachelor’s degrees in nursing in St. Louis.      Less successful schools of nursing in St. Louis in the early 20th century included:                Josephine Heitkamp Memorial Hospital                          The  Josephine Heitkamp Hospital Nurse Training School  was open from 1908 to 1932, a victim both of the Depression and problems with maintaining state accreditation. Another victim of the Depression was the  Christian Hospital Training School for Nurses . The first graduate received her diploma in 1909; the last class was graduated in 1935. The  People’s Hospital Training School for Negro Nurses  opened in 1919 and was plagued by inadequate facilities and accreditation woes during its 9 years of operation.       Financial difficulties also affected the  Liberty Hospital Training School for Nurses , which opened in 1921 with Miss Suzie Frazier, a graduate of the St. Louis Baptist Hospital Training School for Nurses, as principal. The hospital was reorganized and renamed Crenshaw General Hospital in 1926. The nursing school became known as the  Crenshaw General Hospital Training School for Nurses , but closed in 1927 when the hospital passed into the hands of a receiver.      The  Missouri Pacific Hospital Training School for Nurses  admitted 15 students, all daughters of railroad employees, in the fall of 1923. Though affiliated with St. Louis City Hospital and St. Louis University, the training school closed within a year when it was realized that the home hospital did not provide the required clinical services.

(February 2008)       In the  United States , a  do not resuscitate , or  DNR , order is a written order from a  doctor  that  resuscitation  should not be attempted if a person suffers  cardiac  or  respiratory arrest . Such an order may be instituted on the basis of an  advance directive  from a person, or from someone entitled to make decisions on their behalf, such as a  health care proxy ; in some jurisdictions, such orders can also be instituted on the basis of a physician's own initiative, usually when resuscitation would not alter the ultimate outcome of a disease, and is designed to prevent unnecessary suffering.   Any person who does not wish to undergo life sustaining treatment deemed medically inappropriate in the event of cardiac or respiratory arrest can get a DNR order, although DNR is more commonly done when a person who has an  terminal illness  wishes to have a more ""natural""  death  without painful or invasive medical procedures.           Contents       1   Alternative names   2   United States   3   See also   4   References   5   External links               [ edit ]   Alternative names   Alternative namings and abbreviations for this order are used depending on the geographic region.  DNR  (Do Not Resuscitate) is a common abbreviation in the United States and the United Kingdom. It may be clarified in some regions with the addition of  DNI  (Do Not Intubate), although in some hospitals  DNR  alone will imply no  intubation . Some areas of the United States and the United Kingdom include the letter A, as in  DNAR , to clarify ""Do Not  Attempt  Resuscitation."" This alteration is so that it is not presumed by the patient/family that an attempt at resuscitation will be successful. Since the term DNR implies the omission of action, and therefore ""giving up"", some have advocated for these orders to be retermed  Allow Natural Death [ 1 ] . New Zealand and Australia (and some hospitals in the UK) use the term  NFR  or  Not For Resuscitation . Typically, these abbreviations are written without periods between the letters, i.e.  AND/DNR  not  A.N.D./D.N.R. .   Until recently in the UK it was common to write ""Not for 222"" or conversationally, ""Not for twos."" This was implicitly a hospital DNR order, where 222 (or similar) is the hospital telephone number for the emergency resuscitation or crash team.     [ edit ]   United States   The DNR order came into being in the  U.S.  in the 1960s when  defibrillation  allowed the reversal of cardiac arrest, but this may prolong the life of the patient for only a short time.   In the U.S.,  cardiopulmonary resuscitation  (CPR) and  advanced cardiac life support  (ACLS) should not be performed if a valid written ""DNR"" order is present. In any cases of doubt,  emergency medical technicians ,  paramedics  and other  medical  workers will perform as if a DNR order did not exist, as is required by law.   For the DNR to be valid there may be rules such as the use of a special form and/or additional signatures of a doctor and/or witnesses, etc. The exact rules for obtaining a DNR order, and for emergency medical personnel to accept the validity of one, vary widely according to jurisdiction. For example, in the state of  Maryland , only state DNR orders are acceptable, and they require much verification, witnesses and doctor's signatures in order to be valid. In contrast, the state of  Virginia  allows patients to receive a DNR order with relative ease, and will accept them from most jurisdictions.   In many jurisdictions, medical professionals are ordered not to acknowledge DNR orders. This is especially common with  paramedics , who are often employed by private companies unwilling to fight a potential lawsuit.   A DNR order must be filed on a jurisdictionally recognized form. A doctor contemplating a DNR decision should make every reasonable effort to confirm a DNR status before deciding to withhold resuscitation. To be sure that their DNR request is honored, patients should make their wishes clearly known to their family, doctors, community hospitals, care homes and any other caregivers or health care providers who may be present should a cardiac arrest occur. Some jurisdictions provide for a legally sanctioned DNR notification that is clearly visible to all healthcare personnel, similar to a  MedicAlert bracelet .   A DNR order's specific effect depends on the hospital in which the incident occurs and the terms laid out in the DNR: neither cardiopulmonary resuscitation nor  intubation  will be performed, but treatment for infections or other treatable conditions, intravenous feeding and fluids, pain management and comfort care are generally continued.

Please  improve this article  or discuss the issue on the  talk page .                 The  neutrality  of this article is  disputed .   Please see the discussion on the  talk page .  (February 2008)   Please do not remove this message until the  dispute is resolved.       In the  United States , a  do not resuscitate , or  DNR , order is a written order from a  doctor  that  resuscitation  should not be attempted if a person suffers  cardiac  or  respiratory arrest . Such an order may be instituted on the basis of an  advance directive  from a person, or from someone entitled to make decisions on their behalf, such as a  health care proxy ; in some jurisdictions, such orders can also be instituted on the basis of a physician's own initiative, usually when resuscitation would not alter the ultimate outcome of a disease, and is designed to prevent unnecessary suffering.   Any person who does not wish to undergo  lifesaving  treatment in the event of cardiac or respiratory arrest can get a DNR order, although DNR is more commonly done when a person who has an  terminal illness  wishes to have a more natural  death  without painful or invasive medical procedures.           Contents       1   Alternative names   2   United States   3   See also   4   References   5   External links               [ edit ]   Alternative names   Alternative namings and abbreviations for this order are used depending on the geographic region.  DNR  (Do Not Resuscitate) is a common abbreviation in the United States and the United Kingdom. It may be clarified in some regions with the addition of  DNI  (Do Not Intubate), although in some hospitals  DNR  alone will imply no  intubation . Some areas of the United States and the United Kingdom include the letter A, as in  DNAR , to clarify ""Do Not  Attempt  Resuscitation."" This alteration is so that it is not presumed by the patient/family that an attempt at resuscitation will be successful. Since the term DNR implies the omission of action, and therefore ""giving up"", some have advocated for these orders to be retermed  Allow Natural Death [ 1 ] . New Zealand and Australia (and some hospitals in the UK) use the term  NFR  or  Not For Resuscitation . Typically, these abbreviations are written without periods between the letters, i.e.  AND/DNR  not  A.N.D./D.N.R. .   Until recently in the UK it was common to write ""Not for 222"" or conversationally, ""Not for twos."" This was implicitly a hospital DNR order, where 222 (or similar) is the hospital telephone number for the emergency resuscitation or crash team.     [ edit ]   United States   The DNR order came into being in the  U.S.  in the 1960s when  defibrillation  allowed the reversal of cardiac arrest, but this may prolong the life of the patient for only a short time.   In the U.S.,  cardiopulmonary resuscitation  (CPR) and  advanced cardiac life support  (ACLS) should not be performed if a valid written ""DNR"" order is present. In any cases of doubt,  emergency medical technicians ,  paramedics  and other  medical  workers will perform as if a DNR order did not exist, as is required by law.   For the DNR to be valid there may be rules such as the use of a special form and/or additional signatures of a doctor and/or witnesses, etc. The exact rules for obtaining a DNR order, and for emergency medical personnel to accept the validity of one, vary widely according to jurisdiction. For example, in the state of  Maryland , only state DNR orders are acceptable, and they require much verification, witnesses and doctor's signatures in order to be valid. In contrast, the state of  Virginia  allows patients to receive a DNR order with relative ease, and will accept them from most jurisdictions.   In many jurisdictions, medical professionals are ordered not to acknowledge DNR orders. This is especially common with  paramedics , who are often employed by private companies unwilling to fight a potential lawsuit.   A DNR order must be filed on a jurisdictionally recognized form. A doctor contemplating a DNR decision should make every reasonable effort to confirm a DNR status before deciding to withhold resuscitation. To be sure that their DNR request is honored, patients should make their wishes clearly known to their family, doctors, community hospitals, care homes and any other caregivers or health care providers who may be present should a cardiac arrest occur. Some jurisdictions provide for a legally sanctioned DNR notification that is clearly visible to all healthcare personnel, similar to a  MedicAlert bracelet .   A DNR order's specific effect depends on the hospital in which the incident occurs and the terms laid out in the DNR: neither cardiopulmonary resuscitation nor  intubation  will be performed, but treatment for infections or other treatable conditions, intravenous feeding and fluids, pain management and comfort care are generally continued.

In recognition of the achievement, The Joint Commission has awarded its Gold Seal of ApprovalTM for health-care quality to each of the programs. Alexian Brothers Behavioral Health Hospital in Hoffman Estates, Ill., became the first hospital in the nation to win certification in four separate psychiatric specialties: depression, chemical dependency, eating disorders and self injury.    Meanwhile, Alexian Brothers Medical Center in Elk Grove Village, Ill., and St.Alexius Medical Center in Hoffman Estates each earned certification for their congestive heart failure, joint replacement, oncology and bariatric surgery programs. The Joint Commission also certified Alexian Brothers Medical Center's acute myocardial infarction (heart-attack) program. Each of the disease management programs underwent an extensive, unannounced on-site evaluation by a team of reviewers from The Joint Commission, which announced the results early this year.    Two years ago, The Joint Commission certified the stroke programs at Alexian Brothers Medical Center and St.Alexius. The certifications mean that Alexian Brothers Hospital Network ""does the right things and does them well"" for patients in the certified disease management programs, says Jean E. Range, The Joint Commission's Executive Director, Disease-Specific Care Certification. Alexian Brothers Hospital Network voluntarily pursued the certifications ""to enhance the safety and quality of the care we provide,"" says Diana Woytko,Vice President, Patient Safety and Quality, for Alexian Brothers Hospital Network. ""We're proud to achieve this distinction. It makes a statement to the community that we take quality of care seriously."" More important, though, was the amount of learning that occurred as Alexian Brothers Hospital Network teams prepared their disease management programs for The Joint Commission's evaluations.    For about nine months, each team thoroughly examined its program's structure and processes, comparing them against best practices and identifying strengths and areas for improvement. This process increased interaction among Alexian Brothers Medical Center and St.Alexius teams examining the same disease management programs at their respective hospitals."" They were working together across both acute-care facilities, with learning from each facility to theother,"" says Woytko, who credits Barb Swanson, Alexian Brothers Hospital Network Director of Accreditation, for orchestrating the certification efforts. Examples of enhancements that resulted from these efforts include:      PET scans for all patients newly diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer."" Through this indicator,we can significantly improve the decision-making process for treatment for the patient and family,"" says Karen Munter, Oncology Project Manager.    New protocols that have enabled heart-attack victims requiring emergency angioplasty to receive the treatment faster than they did in the past at Alexian Brothers Medical Center.    Increased education and testing for nurses and patient-care technicians who care for bariatric-surgery patients,with certain staff members acting as resources on bariatric issues for their peers. In addition, all Alexian Brothers Medical Center and St. Alexius staff members must take an obesity-sensitivity class.    Improved educational materials for Alexian Brothers Behavioral Health Hospital patients with major depressive disorder.    Additional heart-failure education for nurses.      ""It was all about going through the process, ""Woytko says."" That's what impressed The Joint Commission - the facts and data that were gathered and analyzed and the actions that were taken."" The teams will continue to measure their programs' progress, relaying information about improvements to The Joint Commission one year after the programs' initial certifications.The programs must undergo an on-site review by The Joint Commission every two years to be considered for re-certification.

clueweb09-en0011-17-38786	"     Encyclopedia of Surgery: A Guide for Patients and Caregivers   ::  Ce-Fi          Do not resuscitate (DNR) order                  Definition   Do not resuscitate (DNR) order is a part of advanced medical directives allowed by federal law passed in 1991, expanding the notion of patient autonomy to situations in which they may not be able to make crucial medical decisions due to incapacitation. It instructs medical personnel not to perform life-saving  cardiopulmonary resuscitation  (CPR) or other procedures to restart the heart or breathing once they have ceased. By law, the DNR directive must be offered as an option to patients by health providers in, and in some states, out of a hospital setting. Once signed, the DNR directive must be placed in the in the patient's chart.           Purpose   With such advanced cardiopulmonary techniques as CPR, it is possible to keep almost any patient's heart and lungs functioning, independent of how terminal or hopeless their medical condition becomes. The DNR program is designed to help people in the final stages of a terminal illness or who have intractable pain the option for deciding against life-saving measures that may only prolong their pain and death. The option of deciding against life-saving measures is considered to be a formal part of patient autonomy and is respected as an ethical subset of medical  informed consent .           Description   DNR orders affect a small group of patients and are designed to avoid the suffering of a terminal illness or other serious conditions that are medically irreversible. The order actually authorizes medical treatment to be withheld. It is included with the medical orders in the medical chart, and with it, hospital and pre-hospital personnel are restricted from using CPR techniques and other measures to revive the patient.   Some states allow DNR orders only in hospital settings. Other states allow DNR orders to be honored by emergency responders working outside the hospital setting. Over half of the states in the United States have pre-hospital DNR orders. A physician must sign the pre-hospital DNR directives. The state's Emergency Medical Service (EMS) department or state medical association administers the programs. In some states, the DNR may be called a pre-hospital medical care directive or a comfort care only document.   A DNR order can be revoked at any time in any way that effectively communicates the patient's desire. It can come from the patient in the form of a letter or document. It can come from the patient telling an emergency provider to disregard the order. The revocation can be invoked by removing any bracelet or medallion that indicates DNR status. It can be communicated by the designated health agent or patient representative who has the power to express the patient's wishes to health providers. Some states maintain a registry for individuals with DNR orders. It is important to find out about a state's service for DNR and its particular legal forms and requirements. Many patients who die in a hospital have had a DNR order.           Preparation   Do not resuscitate orders are a part of advanced medical directives. This a legal document that places limits on medical treatment, guides medical providers on the wishes and options of the patient and helps family members and providers make decisions in accordance with the wishes of patients. Advanced directives are prepared in advance and may include a  living will  that lays out all of the patient's wishes should they become incapacitated. A DNR order is a very specific order that medical treatment be withheld, especially CPR. Finally, a health agent or a person with a durable medical  power of attorney  is usually appointed to carry out all wishes of the patient and to make sure that specific wishes, like DNR, are honored.   An advanced directive for resuscitation being withheld can be prepared by requesting a form from the physician, by writing down that wish, by having a lawyer draft a living will or by using computer software for legal documents. States differ in the respect of whether the documents must be cosigned or notarized. Crucial to the effort is that the physician be told of the wishes of the patient and discuss what occurs when the DNR order is carried out.           Normal results   DNR law varies from state to state but the common features include:     Formal documents that providers or responders can readily recognize in charts or on display in the home.   DNR bracelets or medallions that the patient wears and providers are trained to recognize.   DNR must be signed by a physician before responders or other providers may honor them.   Once in effect, DNR orders include only certain life-preserving procedures, like CPR. Comfort treatment is not withheld and the alleviation of pain is still pursued by providers.   Physicians or other providers who are unwilling to carry out the order (for moral or professional reasons) are required to transfer the care of the patient to another provider who will carry out the DNR order.

How to Create a Practical Diversity Plan                     by Wayne Boatwright                     Since starting in the position of Chief Diversity Officer                     for Saint Mary’s Health Care and Battle Creek Health                     System in 2002, and adding Mercy General Health Partners                     (Muskegon) in 2004, I have been flattered and surprised by                     the response of our communities and other health care organizations                     to our Diversity Action Plan. We have had over six hospital                     systems and seven private corporations request that we share                     our approach to the development of our Plan and how we have                   been able to create positive momentum and results.                     It is important to note that we have not accomplished all                     the goals we have established; however, we are very encouraged                     with our progress.                     My attempt through this writing is to outline our approach                     to formulating our Plan as well as select areas in our Plan                     that differentiate our Plan from others you may have reviewed.                     1. I determined, first of all, that Diversity is part of                     the overall strategic plan for Trinity Health as well as                     the member organizations (Saint Mary’s, Battle Creek                     and Mercy General). It is important that a diversity plan                     be a part of the overall strategic vision and not “something                     else”.                     2. For a plan to be successful, it must have two components;                     it must be measurable and there must be accountability. We                     have developed a score card that helps track our progress.                     I am also working with the HR department to create an area                     on management personnel’s evaluations to reflect our                     Diversity goals.                     3. I reviewed a lot of well written, professionally delivered                     plans prior to writing my own. In some cases these other                     plans were considered best practice. Unfortunately, in most                     cases the organizations did not show improvement in those                     areas that were identified on their report cards, (i.e. recruitment,                     retention, training and succession planning). It is important                     to determine the needs of your organization in the area of                     diversity. This can be done through facilitated discussions                     with your senior team and through Diversity assessments.                     4. If you do not intend to make Diversity your issue alone,                     it is important that you put together a Diversity team or                     council. Some experts say that more than 10 or 15 members                     can be counter productive. It is important to remember that                     inclusion is better than exclusion. Find a way for willing                     individuals to participate. It is important to create a broad                     base of participation. This should include executives, physicians,                     nurses, hourly employees and community leaders. We also defined                     Diversity through the team. Diversity is: The many ways we                     are all alike, and respect for the ways we are different.                     Diversity is more than race and gender and we wanted to create                     a definition that all employees could remember and recite.                     This is also a good place to emphasize that Diversity is                     not just important as a Social Imperative. The Business imperative                     is also critical and soon there will be a strong emphasis                     on Compliance. It is important that your Council understand                     the importance of Diversity from a business and compliance                     perspective.                     5. Support for the Diversity initiatives from all levels                     of the organization is important, but senior level support                     is critical. Both of our Diversity teams are co-chaired by                     the President and CEO’s of each organization. The first                     Diversity conference that I attended in my new position was                     also attended by Phil McCorkle, President and CEO of Saint                     Mary’s. One of our Diversity Champion’s at Saint                     Mary’s is David Baumgartner, MD, Vice President of                     Medical Affairs and Chief Technology Officer. Dr. Baumgartner                     facilitated my meeting with the Medical Executive Committee                     to discuss their role in the Diversity plan; he has also                     been a strong supporter with the senior leadership team.                     6. The length of the plan is also critical and although                     it is important to develop a plan that will provide long                     term sustainable change, it is also important to have some                     short term wins to create momentum. Our plan is designed                     for 12 to 18 months. We have created checkpoints quarterly                     for consistent follow-up.                     7. It is important to create plans for the overall organization;                     however, individuals need to understand their specific role                     in the success of the plan. I have started the Diversity                     objectives with the Board of Trustees and continued through                     the organization, indicating specific roles and tasks for                     each level of management. As an example, the Board had the                     specific responsibility of appointing an ethnic minority                     member to the board before January 2003, (which they accomplished).                     Another example is that the Board’s pre-meeting luncheons                     will be catered twice a year by a diverse restaurant. We                     started our Hispanic Month Celebration in October, by having                     the Board’s luncheon catered by a local Mexican restaurant.                     8. Setting appropriate goals for various managers should                     not be taken lightly. I have found that often individuals                     are not comfortable participating in or setting goals around                     diversity, because they have not had the experience. It was                     therefore important that in many instances I contacted diverse                     organizations, made introductions of our management and scheduled                     meetings for us to meet and share our diverse strategies                     with the community.                     9. Diversity training and education is critical for the                     success of our initiatives. We are in the process of developing                     a diversity curriculum for all of our employees. We (Education                     Department and Diversity Department) have developed a relationship                     with a local college to deliver some training. Our strategy                     is that during General Orientation all employees would view                     a 15 minute video on Diversity called “Patient Diversity:                     Beyond the Vital Signs,” with a 15 minute discussion                     afterwards. After employees complete their probation period,                     they would receive training called “Tolerating Intolerance”,                     which focuses on institutional racism. Selected employees                     in the future will attend “The Institute of Healing                     Racism”, and others will attend the Diversity Theatre.                     Management personnel may suggest other Diversity training,                     not included in the curriculum, for their employees. I suggest                     that you be very deliberate in the selection of training                     for your employees. All Diversity education will not meet                     your objectives and can often do more harm than good.                     10. As I stated earlier, it is important to make the plan                     broad based. We wanted to ensure that the plan was not just                     experienced and discussed by the management team. We have                     created diversity topics to be discussed quarterly during                     our department meetings. This ensures that we continually                     keep the topic of Diversity in front of our employees until                     it becomes the natural part of our organization that it should                     be.                     11. For any Diversity Plan to be successful, Diversity Champions                     must be recognized. One measure of success is the number                     of individuals who have seamlessly integrated the goals of                     the diversity plan into the work plan for their own departments/divisions.                     As these Champions emerge in greater numbers, the success                     of the diversity plan stabilizes and grows.

Our Hospitals realize that some patients may need help with their hospital bill. Recognizing that healthcare expenses can place a burden on patients and their families, we have financial assistance programs for which you may be eligible.    We believe that financial assistance programs do not eliminate a personal financial responsibility. Therefore, we will need your help in applying for state and federal assistance programs such as Medicaid or All Kids. In addition to these programs, our financial counselors can help determine if one of the Alexian Brothers Hospital Network financial assistance programs is appropriate. Our financial counselors can assist with the application process and arrange for payment plans and charity care for patients who meet the qualifications. These programs exclude physicians' bills. Please contact physicians directly.    It is important for patients to take an active role, inquire early about financial assistance, and follow through diligently.    Any patient seeking financial assistance will be asked to comply with the hospitals' requirements. The process includes completion of an application, producing necessary supporting financial information and copies of income-related documents, such as your W-2, bank statements and pay stubs.    For additional information on Alexian Brothers Hospital System financial assistance programs, please call Customer Service directly at 866-690-3370.     Or - email your questions to:  alexianassistance@alexian.net .

clueweb09-en0003-60-19607	  Deciding about CPR:   Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) Orders   A Guide for Patients and Families   Courtesy of NYS Department of Health      WHAT DO CPR AND DNR ORDERS MEAN ?          CPR - cardiopulmonary resuscitation - refers to the medical         procedures used to restart a patient's heart and breathing         when the patient suffers heart failure.  CPR may involve         simple efforts such as mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and         external chest compression.  Advanced CPR may involve         electric shock, insertion of a tube to open the patient's         airway, injection of medication into the heart and in extreme         cases, open chest heart massage.          A do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order tells medical professionals         not to perform CPR.  This means that doctors, nurses and         emergency medical personnel will not attempt emergency CPR if         the patient's breathing or heartbeat stops.          DNR orders may be written for patients in a hospital or         nursing home, or for patients at home.  Hospital DNR orders         tell the medical staff not to revive the patient if cardiac         arrest occurs.  If the patient is in a nursing home or at         home, a DNR order tells the staff and emergency medical         personnel not to perform emergency resuscitation and not to         transfer the patient to a hospital for CPR.     WHY ARE DNR ORDERS ISSUED ?          CPR, when successful, restores heartbeat and breathing and         allows patients to resume their previous lifestyle.  The         success of CPR depends on the patient's overall medical         condition.  Age alone does not determine whether CPR will be         successful, although illnesses and frailties that go along         with age often make CPR less successful.          When patients are seriously ill or terminally ill, CPR may         not work or may only partially work, leaving the patient         brain-damaged or in a worse medical state than before the         heart stopped.  In these cases, some patients prefer to be         cared for without aggressive efforts at resuscitation upon         their death.     CAN I REQUEST A DNR ORDER ?          Yes.  All adult patients can request a DNR order.  If you are         sick and unable to tell your doctor that you want a DNR order         written, a family member or close friend can decide for you.     IS MY RIGHT TO REQUEST OR RECEIVE OTHER TREATMENT AFFECTED BY A DNR       ORDER ?          No.  A DNR order is only a decision about CPR and does not         relate to any other treatment.      ARE DNR ORDERS ETHICALLY ACCEPTABLE ?          It is widely recognized by health care professionals, clergy,         lawyers and others that DNR orders are medically and         ethically appropriate under certain circumstances.  For some         patients, CPR offers more burdens than benefits, and may be         against the patient's wishes.     IS MY CONSENT REQUIRED FOR A DNR ORDER ?          Your doctor must speak to you before entering a DNR order if         you are able to decide, unless your doctor believes that         discussing CPR with you would cause you severe harm.  In an         emergency, it is assumed that all patients would consent to         CPR.  However, if a doctor decides that CPR will not work, it         is not provided.     HOW CAN I MAKE MY WISHES ABOUT DNR KNOWN ?          An adult patient may consent to a DNR order orally by         informing a physician, or in writing, such as a living will,         if two witnesses are present.  In addition, the Health Care         Proxy Law allows you to appoint someone you trust to make         decisions about CPR and other treatments if you become unable         to decide for yourself.          Before deciding about CPR, you should speak with your doctor         about your overall health and the benefits and burdens CPR         would provide for you.  A full and early discussion between         you and your doctor will assure that your wishes will be         known.     IF I REQUEST A DNR ORDER, MUST MY DOCTOR HONOR MY WISHES ?          If you don't want CPR and you request a DNR order, your         doctor must follow your wishes or:          - transfer your care to another doctor who will follow your           wishes; or          - begin a process to settle the dispute if you are in a           hospital or nursing home.          If the dispute is not resolved within 72 hours, your doctor         must enter the order or transfer you to the care of another         doctor.     IF I AM NOT ABLE TO DECIDE ABOUT CPR FOR MYSELF, WHO WILL DECIDE ?          First, two doctors must determine that you are unable to         decide about CPR.  You will be told of this determination and         have the right to object.          If you become unable to decide about CPR, and you did not         tell your doctor or others about your wishes in advance,         a DNR order can be written with the consent of someone chosen         by you, by a family member or by a close friend.  The person         highest on the following list will decide about CPR for you:          - the person chosen by you to make health care decisions           under New York's Health Care Proxy Law;          - a court appointed guardian (if there is one);          - your closest relative (spouse, child, parent, sibling);          - close friend.     HOW CAN I SELECT SOMEONE TO DECIDE FOR ME ?          The Health Care Proxy Law allows adults to select someone         they trust to make all health care decisions for them when         they are no longer able to do so themselves, including         decisions about CPR.  You can name someone by filling out a         health care proxy form, which you can get from your physician         or other health care professionals.     UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES CAN A FAMILY MEMBER OR CLOSE FRIEND DECIDE      THAT A DNR ORDER SHOULD BE WRITTEN ?          A family member or close friend can consent to a DNR order         only when you are unable to decide for yourself and you have         not appointed someone to decide for you.  Your family member         Or friend can consent to a DNR order when:          - you are terminally ill; or          - you are permanently unconscious; or          - CPR will not work (would be medically futile); or          - CPR would impose an extraordinary burden on you given your           medical condition and the expected outcome of CPR.          Anyone deciding for you must base the decision on your         wishes, including your religious and moral beliefs, or if         your wishes are not known, on your best interests.     WHAT IF MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY DISAGREE ?          In a hospital or nursing home, your family can ask that the         disagreement be mediated.  Your doctor can request mediation         if he or she is aware of any disagreement among your family         members.     WHAT IF I LOSE THE ABILITY TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT CPR AND DO NOT      HAVE ANYONE WHO CAN DECIDE FOR ME ?          A DNR order can be written if two doctors decide that CPR         would not work or if a court approves of the DNR order.         It would be best if you discussed your wishes about CPR with         your doctor in advance.     WHO CAN CONSENT TO A DNR ORDER FOR CHILDREN ?          A DNR order can be entered for a child with the consent of         the child's parent or guardian.  If the child is old enough         to understand and decide about CPR, the child's consent is         also required for a DNR order.     WHAT HAPPENS IF I CHANGE MY MIND AFTER A DNR ORDER HAS BEEN WRITTEN ?          You or anyone who consents to a DNR order for you can remove         the order by telling your doctor, nurses or others of the         decision.     WHAT HAPPENS TO A DNR ORDER IF I AM TRANSFERRED FROM A NURSING HOME      TO A HOSPITAL OR VICE VERSA ?          The DNR order will continue until a doctor examines you and         decides whether the order should remain or be canceled.  If         the doctor decides to cancel the DNR order, you or anyone who         decided for you will be told and can ask that the DNR order         be entered again.     IF I AM AT HOME WITH A DNR ORDER, WHAT HAPPENS IF A FAMILY MEMBER OR      FRIEND PANICS AND CALLS AN AMBULANCE TO RESUSCITATE ME ?          If you have a DNR order and family members show it to         emergency personnel, they will not try to resuscitate you or         take you to a hospital emergency room for CPR.     WHAT HAPPENS TO MY DNR ORDER IF I AM TRANSFERRED FROM A HOSPITAL OR      NURSING HOME TO HOME CARE ?          The order issued for you in a hospital or nursing home will         not apply at home.  You, your health care agent or family         member must specifically consent to a home DNR order.  If you         leave a hospital or nursing home without a home DNR order, a         DNR order can be issued by a doctor for you at home.      [Hospitals must provide to patients a brochure developed by the    State Health Department that describes the Do-Not-Resuscitate law.    The brochure must be furnished to the patient at or prior to the    time of admission.  It must also be furnished to each member of the    hospital's staff involved in the provision of medical care,and it    must be posted in a public place in each hospital.

The program allows          people to declare that certain resuscitative measures will not be used          on them. Those resuscitative measures specifically listed in the          OOH DNR legislation are cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), advanced          airway management, defibrillation, artificial ventilations and transcutaneous          cardiac pacing.           OOH DNR forms can be ordered from the          Texas Medical Association or  downloaded from the web .            You can contact TMA at:             Texas Medical Association             ATTN: DNR form             401 West 15th Street             Austin, Texas 78701-1680             (512) 370-1306 -- Recorded information concerning          the prices of the DNR form and bracelets.             Looking to order an OOH DNR identification          device?   After completing          the Texas OOH DNR Order form, the patient may obtain, at the patient's          expense, an optional means of identification. The OOH DNR ID device          may only be obtained  AFTER  fully executing the Texas OOH DNR Order          form. A recent amendment to 25 TAC 157.25 gives consumers greater          choice in Texas OOH DNR identification devices by allowing more businesses          to offer identification devices. The amendment now requires:         (1) An intact, unaltered, easily          identifiable  plastic  identification OOH DNR bracelet, with the          word ""Texas"" (or a representation of the geographical shape          of Texas and the word ""STOP"" imposed over the shape) and the          words ""Do Not Resuscitate"",  shall  be honored by qualified          EMS personnel in lieu of an original OOH DNR Order form.         OR         (2) An intact, unaltered, easily          identifiable  metal  bracelet or necklace inscribed with the words, ""Texas Do Not Resuscitate - OOH""  shall  be honored by          qualified EMS personnel in lieu of an OOH DNR Order form.                                 Approved              manufacturers for metal devices            (As of 2/22/01)                           Approved              manufacturers for vinyl bracelets                                  American Medical Identifications,              Inc.

clueweb09-en0006-70-16430	"     Encyclopedia of Death and Dying   ::  Da-Em          D O  N OT  R ESUSCITATE              Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders are medical directives to withhold efforts to revive a patient who has a cardiac or respiratory arrest. DNR orders came into use in the 1970s as a response to the widespread practice of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). CPR is an emergency intervention that uses a variety of techniques to restore the heartbeat and breathing. CPR includes such basic life support as external chest compression and mouth-to-mouth ventilation, as well as advanced cardiac life support such as electrical defibrillation and cardiac medications. A DNR order tells medical professionals not to perform CPR if the patient's heartbeat or breathing stops.   When it was first introduced in the early 1960s, CPR was a heroic, life-sustaining act. It was a technique used on only a select group of acutely ill but otherwise relatively healthy patients. By the end of the following decade, however, CPR had become a routine intervention for all patients facing imminent death. With this widespread use of CPR came a growing recognition that it was neither effective nor desirable for some patients. For example, patients with aggressive cancer or serious infection had almost no chance of recovery after CPR. Other patients who did survive after CPR often ended up with brain damage or permanent disabilities. At the same time that poor outcomes from CPR were being recognized, patients were demanding to be more involved in medical decisions. The result was the institution of DNR orders.       Participation in the DNR Decision   An ongoing debate about DNR has involved the extent to which patients or their surrogate decision makers must agree to such orders. Through the late 1970s and early 1980s, some hospitals routinely created DNR orders without any discussion with the patient or the patient's family, and they did not clearly document the DNR order in the patient's chart. But these practices were abandoned as the bioethics movement and the courts emphasized the right of patients or their surrogate decision makers to refuse medical treatment, including life-sustaining therapies such as CPR. Most health care providers and well-recognized health professional groups and accrediting bodies began to support DNR policies that require the patient to be informed of the risks and benefits of CPR and to give consent that CPR not be used. Some well-respected physician ethicists and medical groups, however, advocate that physicians should have the ability to write DNR orders without a patient's consent in situations in which it has been determined that CPR would have no medical benefit.       Communication and Knowledge about CPR and DNR Orders   Despite policies that require consent to a DNR order, informed discussions between patients and physicians about CPR and other life-sustaining treatments occur infrequently. Only about one patient in seven reports having discussed personal preferences for life-sustaining treatment with a physician. Even when patients have life-threatening illnesses such as AIDS, cancer, and congestive heart failure, such discussions occurred less than 40 percent of the time in some studies. In many cases, the decision about a DNR order is broached only after    extensive procedures have been attempted and at a time when patients are no longer capable of making an informed decision.   This lack of communication contributes to three concerns. First, many people have unrealistic expectations about the likely success of CPR. When CPR was first described in 1960, it referred to heart massage by the exertion of pressure on the chest. The success rate of 70 percent survival to hospital discharge was quite high, largely because it was applied to a small group of patients who experienced a cardiac arrest in the operating room or postoperative recovery rooms. By the early twenty-first century, CPR included not only heart compression and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation but also a host of advanced supports such as electrical defibrillation paddles, powerful drugs, and an assortment of mechanical breathing devices. This range of interventions is generally referred to as a ""code"" in which a special team responds to resuscitate a patient. But success rates are nowhere near those reported in original studies.   Research in the 1980s and 1990s showed that for all patients undergoing CPR in the hospital, just under one-half survived the code itself and one-third survived for twenty-four hours. Approximately 15 percent of patients undergoing CPR in the hospital survived to discharge. About 30 percent of those who survived suffered a significant increase in dependence and required extensive home care or institutionalization. Survival to discharge from the hospital was much poorer when certain diseases or conditions were present. In some studies, for example, no patients with metastatic cancer and only 3 percent of patients with sepsis (a widespread infection) survived to discharge. Outcomes in some studies of frail, elderly patients in long-term care facilities showed survival rates of 5 percent or less, prompting some health care providers to suggest that CPR should not even be offered to residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities.   The general public, however, often has an overly positive impression about the success rates of CPR. As portrayed on popular television medical shows, CPR is much more effective than in real life. According to one study, two-thirds of CPR patients survive on television, a much higher percentage than any published medical study. The same study reported that on television only 17 percent of patients getting CPR were elderly. In reality cardiac arrest is much more common in older people than in any other age group. Furthermore, three-quarters of cases of cardiac arrest on television resulted from accidents, stabbings, lightning strikes, and other injuries, whereas in the real world 75 percent or more of cardiac arrests were triggered by underlying heart disease.   Knowledge about the outcomes of CPR is especially important because it has been shown to affect preferences for care. Surveys have shown that as many as 90 percent of elderly outpatients and a range of 44 to 88 percent of hospitalized elderly desire to have CPR in the event of a cardiac arrest. Even when elderly patients were asked whether they wanted CPR if they had a serious disability, 20 to 45 percent said they would. Clinicians at one geriatric practice asked patients about their preferences for CPR if they were acutely ill and if they were chronically ill. These patients were then educated about the probability of surviving to discharge under these conditions. Once they were given prognostic information, preferences for CPR dropped nearly 50 percent.   A second area of concern is that the lack of communication about CPR results in common misunderstandings about DNR orders. Many patients believe incorrectly that having a living will or other type of written advance directive automatically means that a patient will have a DNR order written. Instead, while an advance directive may express a patient's desire to have a DNR order written under certain circumstances, DNR orders—like all medical orders—must be authorized by a physician who is treating the patient. Also, some patients assume that a DNR order directs that all medical treatments be stopped and only comfort care provided. In some circumstances, however, other aggressive therapies—including staying in an intensive care unit—are continued for patients with DNR orders.   Moreover, there are circumstances in which restricted or limited DNR orders are appropriate. For example, if it is determined that further attempts at CPR would not benefit a patient who is on a ventilator or a breathing machine, then an order might be written not to give cardioactive medications should a cardiac or pulmonary arrest    occur. On the other hand, it might also be determined that a patient would want cardioactive medications and chest compressions but would not want to be intubated and put on a breathing machine. Because there are multiple options, it is essential that physicians thoroughly discuss DNR options with patients or their surrogate decision makers and that decisions are carefully documented in the patient's medical record.   Third, the lack of genuine communication means that physicians are often unfamiliar with patients' preferences about CPR and must rely on family members to help decide whether a DNR order is appropriate. Family members, however, also are very poor predictors of what patients would actually want, answering wrongly up to 40 or 50 percent of the time in some scenarios. Uncertainty about patient wishes concerning CPR also means that decisions about DNR orders are often delayed until the patient is near death.   A major, multihospital, longitudinal study of these issues focusing on more than 9,000 patients— the Study to Understand Prognosis and Preferences for Outcomes and Treatment (SUPPORT) —discovered that 79 percent of the patients who died in the hospital had a DNR order but that almost half of these orders had been written in the last two days before death. Almost 40 percent of these patients had spent at least ten days in the intensive care unit, and, of those able to communicate, more than half were in moderate or severe pain at least half of the time in their final days. About one-third of the patients expressed a desire not to be resuscitated, but less than half of their physicians understood this desire.       Other Issues   An issue of special concern involves the patient with a DNR order who needs to have surgery or some other medical intervention that requires the use of anesthesia or other agents that affect resuscitation. At some hospitals, it is institutional policy to automatically suspend a DNR order while a patient is undergoing procedures that may require resuscitative measures. The rationale for such policies is that if the procedure requires a patient to be artificially resuscitated through the use of a ventilator or chemical agents, then a DNR order would be illogical. Some hospitals, however, forbid the practice of automatically suspending a DNR order during surgery. Rather, they require the need for resuscitative measures during surgery or other procedures be discussed with the patient and that agreed-upon circumstances for using or not using resuscitative measures be put in writing.   Some states have authorized the use of ""durable"" DNR orders. Such orders can travel with the patient and can be recognized by a wide range of health care personnel at different facilities and at the patient's home. Durable DNR orders eliminate the problem of patients needing to have a DNR order written each time they enter a health care facility and mean that patients at home can have their DNR wishes honored by emergency services personnel. Without a durable DNR order, emergency services personnel are required to resuscitate a patient at home, even if the patient had a DNR order recently written in the hospital.
