From Cape Town which is the southern                        tip of Africa where two great oceans meet, warm weather                        lasts most of the year and where the great adventure starts                        just beyond the city lights.                        Today, this country is the powerhouse of Africa, the most                        advanced, broad-based economy on the continent, with infrastructure                        to match any first-world nation.                         You can drive on wide, tarred highways all 1 600 kilometres                        from Messina at the very top of the country to Cape Town                        at the bottom, or join eight million passengers who disembark                        at our airports every year.                         Two-thirds of Africa's electricity is generated here. Forty                        percent of the phones are here. Twenty percent of the world's                        gold is mined here. And almost everyone who visits is astonished                        at how far a dollar will stretch. Welcome to the Republic                        of South Africa.                        There are 11 officially recognised languages, most of them                        indigenous to  South                        Africa . Forty percent of the population speak either                        Zulu or Xhosa. You don't speak either? Not to worry. Everywhere                        you go, you can expect to find people who speak or understand                        English. Road signs and official forms are in English. The                        President makes his speeches in English. At any hotel, the                        receptionists, waiters and porters will speak English. English                        is the language of the cities, of commerce and banking,                        government, road signs and official documents. Another major                        language is Afrikaans, a derivative of Dutch. Northern Europeans                        will find it surprisingly easy to follow Afrikaans.                                The Cape Floral Region, one of South Africa's eight World Heritage sites, comprises eight protected areas stretching from the Cape Peninsula to the Eastern Cape, cutting across spectacular mountain and ocean scenery and containing some of the richest plant biodiversity in the world.

On the West Coast of Barbados, coral shore beaches of fine white sand stretch along a blue-green sea. Coral reefs fringe the Barbados shoreline to provide excellent snorkeling and Scuba Diving. Along the East Coast a lively surf is blown briskly by the strong and constant trade winds and the waves pound against a rocky shore. The constant breeze of the trade winds give Barbados a mild and pleasant tropical climate.                                      Barbados is a very beautiful island, with lots of art, activities, night life, music, history and some of the best restaurants to be found anywhere. But what makes Barbados even more special, and the reason why so many visitors keep returning to the island year after year, is the people. Barbadians, called Bajans, are warm and friendly souls, always ready to greet you with a sincere smile. Barbadians make you feel welcome and special, in this lovely Caribbean Island. You'll feel its your home and you will want to come back again and again.

Its tourist-friendly with reasonable rates, although rooms could use some sprucing up.    Built in 1931 at the height of the art deco craze, the Edison still boasts a picturesque lobby with ornate ceiling decoration, glasswork, and industrial-themed paintings reminiscent of Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall (which, incidentally, was built the same year).     Upstairs, the rooms, though not particularly spacious, are blessedly straightforward and predictable. Furniture and dcor are all the way all-American with few surprises or fancy touches.     Next to the lobby, the Café Edison is one of the last remaining true diners in Times Square. Even if you dont spend the night in the hotel, you owe it to yourself to stop by for breakfast or at least a cup of coffee at the bar. Take advantage of this truly classic New York scene before it disappears.                                                              »    Tom Meyers                                                            More Information                            Contact Infomation           Address:           228 W. 47th St. (between Eighth Avenue and Broadway)           |             Map                       Midtown West & Times Square , New York                     More Information                     Amenities Hotel Airport Transportation Café Concierge/Booking Services Elevator Fitness Center Office Center Parking Reception: 24-Hour Restaurant Wi-Fi Connection Room Air conditioning Bathroom: Private Cable TV Handicap accessible roome Safe Telephone                                                          note            EuroCheapo did not charge this hotel for this listing.
