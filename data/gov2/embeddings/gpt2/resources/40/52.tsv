DENR desires its employees to become active ambassadors to support the increase of different groups that will call this State their home, as well, as strengthen the cultures that exist within DENR currently. The hallmark of the plan is its focus on building relationships and inclusion. This is expressed in several emergent themes, each with its set of priorities and other action ideas. These were further distilled to the ""Top Four"" priorities that DENR will place emphasis on, while simultaneously pursuing other initiatives expressed in the plan as resources allow. For the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, diversity compels a total-quality, progressive workplace to reflect the changing demography of our society, at all levels of our organization. As a result, we gain unique opportunities to broaden our understanding and respect for others, providing each of us and all of us with potential for personal and professional growth, as well, as a sense of fulfillment as we work together to preserve and enhance North Carolina's environment and natural resources. Strategic Goals Fully integrate diversity into the ""way we do business"" Align diversity initiatives with specific needs and expectations, internally and externally Build a common understanding of diversity throughout DENR at every level of the organization Communicate and reward diversity initiatives that lead to success, by acknowledging the contributions of others Tie accountability for diversity success to job performance and career development   Who is responsible? Senior Management : Participate, encourage and work with all employees throughout the organization to prioritize their action plans and to monitor progress of assigned initiatives. Managers/Supervisors : Are accountable for establishing and sustaining a high-performing workforce that values differences and contributes to day-to-day operations of the department. Employee : Are responsible for working effectively internally and externally to maximize performance and to embrace the department's diversity openly. Human Resources Department : Will partner with managers/supervisors and employees to help create and sustain a high-performing and diverse organization. Also responsible for providing metrics to evaluate overall success. Diversity Council : Will provide overall strategic direction for department diversity initiative and monitor progress of the department's diversity initiatives. As a proactive step in embracing diversity, the Council will recommend action to the Secretary on diverse issues and act as a conduit of information on diversity to and from the division. Diversity Council's Committees : Will function as the operational arm of the Diversity Council soliciting, implementing and providing input and suggestions from the entire Council, Senior Management and others within the department.   Issues of Focus Change management attitudes and beliefs in order for all employees to be fully utilized Ensure employees feel valued at every level Ensure that employee understand diversity Diversity brings about a great amount of fear Opinions are not always valued in the department Make employees aware of the many different cultures working in the Department Consider Diversity when hiring or making promotion decisions                         Diversity Initiative Plan's Key Features DENR's Diversity Initiative Plan has several key features that distinguish it from others. It employs an approach or methodology that is different from the usual plan to address diversity in that its processes are: Relational versus linear ""Action at every level of the organization"" Integrative of current activities and new initiatives versus an all-new program template It focuses on several emergent themes that support the purpose of the plan and the mission of the department     Emergent Theme 1 : Build a Pool of Prospective Diverse Applicants ( Making DENR the employee of choice). Recruit and Retain a Critical Mass of Diverse Employees. Emergent Theme 2 : Foster Strong Relationships With and Among all employees throughout the department (Training/Education and Special Enhancements). Emergent Theme 3 : Enhance Idea Exchange, Engagement and Range of Learning Experiences Through Outreach Relationships, Internally and Externally (Website Development/Maintenance (Director's Message, DENR's Newsletter). Culture Statement The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR)'s culture focuses on three critical statements: Led by People Driven by Performance to meet the strategic plan of the department Committed to Excellence, everyday and in everything that we do.    As PEOPLPE, states   ""People succeed because they...embrace Diversity.""   This, then, provides an important foundation for the Diversity initiative. It is, in fact, an integral part of the culture of this organization and is directly tied to the our success. Vision Statement DENR envisions an environment where all people are valued and respected. Our differences create a competitive advantage and a productive workplace for all. Mission Statement To enhance and foster a diverse organizational environment at all levels that embraces and promote inclusion and mutual respect. Value Statement We embrace the diversity of our workplace, marketplace, and communities. We believe no one is more important than another, each is important in a unique way, and we depend on each other to accomplish our mission. Diversity IS: A necessity for organizational success Enabling everyone to maximize his/her potential Creating an environment where co-workers respect each other Broadening the norms of acceptance; soliciting and listening to every employee's requests; opinion Helping individuals understand the needs of others Helping individuals communicate effectively with others Helping individuals recognize and capitalize on the value of a diverse workforce through implementing new ideas and perspectives Appreciating the importance of different views as part of our daily activities Embracing our diverse communities and endorsing minority supplier development through the Department of Administration, HUB Program Facilitating an understanding of and support for the variety of needs of our customers base   Diversity is NOT: Quotas Special treatment for selected individuals or groups A replacement or substitute for Affirmative Action Exclusionary of anyone or any group Special programs to make any group feel guilty A short-term strategy or option   Diversity is each of us and all of us!                               Visit the Employee Page       Sign in with your NCID and view upcoming Diversity events                               One North Carolina Naturally       North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources                     Disclaimer/Privacy  NCDENR, 1601 Mail Service Center, Raleigh, NC 27699-1601 919-733-4984   Fax  919-715-3060   Powered by IBEAM                     "

DEQ Budget Proposal: Restore Onsite Septic      System Program       Sewage from households and businesses is treated and      disposed of by connection to a sewer system or by installation      of an individual onsite (septic) system. More than a      million Oregonians rely on septic systems as a permanent      solution for treating and disposing of sewage and that number is      increasing. DEQ regulates the siting and inspections of      septic systems statewide.    The Onsite Program (septic system) last increased application fees  in 1998. Since that time, costs have increased approximately 3.4%/year. DEQ is requesting  approval to increase fee revenue by about $1 million/biennium  (or $500,000/year). The fee increases will be about 40-60% over current fees and take  into account rising program costs through the 2013-14 biennium. If approved, these fees would  become effective in early 2010. The fee increases will pay for existing technical staff  to process applications. With the exception of variance and product review applications  (which are statewide), the fees will only affect the public where DEQ administers the Onsite  Program (blue-color counties on this   Oregon County Map ).    If this package is not funded, 2.5 positions will be eliminated from the  program and the Baker City and the Warrenton offices will close.  In  addition, staff in the Grants Pass office will be reduced.

Our vision for Equality is based upon the findings of The Equalities Review: Fairness and Freedom. This is a national inquiry into the big challenges that face the UK in building a fairer society for all. Most importantly the review proposed a definition of Equality that we as a County Council are working to:  An equal society protects and promotes equal, real freedom and opportunity to live in the ways people value and would choose, so that everyone can flourish. An equal society recognises people different needs, situations and goals and removes the barriers that limit what people can do and can be. Equalities Review - Fairness and Freedom (PDF 1.24mb) To achieve this vision in Cumbria we need to make sure that: Public services are reaching out to everyone.   Elected Members and community leaders have equality as a central part of their role.   We are addressing inequalities people face from early years and education through to accessing services as older people.   That equality is at the heart of how we manage our staff.   Meet the Equalities and Cohesion Unit          Equality & Diversity                 •   information@cumbriacc.gov.uk     •   Email this to a friend    •     Printable version              Reviewed 25/11/08       Equality | Accessibility | Website Statistics | Privacy | Disclaimer | Copyright |                      eVisit Tracking                 eVisit section Tracking                      Tell us what you think about our site...

Equalities Review - Fairness and Freedom (PDF 1.24mb) To achieve this vision in Cumbria we need to make sure that: Public services are reaching out to everyone.   Elected Members and community leaders have equality as a central part of their role.   We are addressing inequalities people face from early years and education through to accessing services as older people.   That equality is at the heart of how we manage our staff.   Meet the Equalities and Cohesion Unit          Equality & Diversity                 •   information@cumbriacc.gov.uk     •   Email this to a friend    •     Printable version              Reviewed 25/11/08       Equality | Accessibility | Website Statistics | Privacy | Disclaimer | Copyright |                      eVisit Tracking                 eVisit section Tracking                      Tell us what you think about our site...

Many companies throughout the UK have already implemented successful diversity programmes and are enjoying dramatic improvements in performance and productivity. They are reaping the benefits of an expanded recruitment base and exploring the wealth of new markets.  What diversity means to your business   Implementing equality and diversity policies throughout your enterprise makes sound commercial sense. They can help you to increase profitability, deliver high standards of customer service and improve all-round performance.  The business case for diversity is all about making the most of the opportunities it offers. These include:          A wider choice of potential employees;        Access to a broader resource of skills and creativity;        Better understanding of your customers to help shape your marketing strategy;        An improved business reputation;        A proactive approach to legislative compliance.      Managing diversity, both as an employer and as a provider of goods and services, will let you respond effectively to the varying needs of your staff and customers.    Equality Matters in Business (EMB) is a pioneering two-year pilot project, aimed at working with Scottish businesses to highlight the benefits of equality and diversity.

clueweb09-enwp00-87-05431	"                     Government Equalities Office          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search          The  Government Equalities Office  ( GEO ) is a  United Kingdom government department . It was created in October 2007 when the Women and Equality Unit, based within the  Department for Communities and Local Government  was converted into an independent department.   It is headed by  Harriet Harman , as  Minister for Women and Equality  and  Lord Privy Seal , assisted by  Maria Eagle  as  Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State .   It has lead responsibility for  gender equality  within the UK government, together with a responsibility to provide advice on all other forms of equality (including age, race, sexual orientation and disability) to other UK government departments. The day to day responsibility for policy on these issues was not transferred to GEO when it was created.   The Equalities Office currently leads the Discrimination Law Review, which is developing the proposed  Single Equality Bill  to replace existing anti-discrimination legislation.

Officials in the federal government had long sought new and improved varieties of seeds, plants, and animals for importation to the United States. In 1836  Henry Leavitt Ellsworth , a Yale-educated attorney interested in improving agriculture, became  Commissioner of Patents , a position within the  Department of State . He soon began collecting and distributing new varieties of seeds and plants through members of the  Congress  and agricultural societies. In 1839 Congress established the  Agricultural Division  within the  Patent Office  and allotted $1,000 for ""the collection of agricultural statistics and other agricultural purposes.""   Ellsworth's interest in aiding agriculture was evident in his annual reports that called for a public depository to preserve and distribute the various new seeds and plants, a clerk to collect agricultural statistics, the preparation of statewide reports about crops in different regions, and the application of chemistry to agriculture. Henry Leavitt Ellsworth's agricultural focus earned him the  sobriquet  of ""The Father of the Department of Agriculture.""   In 1849 the Patent Office was transferred to the newly created  Department of the Interior . In the ensuing years, agitation for a separate bureau of agriculture within the department or a separate department devoted to agriculture kept recurring.   On May 15, 1862, President  Abraham Lincoln  established the independent  Department of Agriculture  to be headed by a Commissioner without Cabinet status. [ 1 ]  Lincoln called it the ""people's department."" In the 1880s, varied  interest groups  were lobbying for Cabinet representation. Business interests sought a  Department of Commerce and Industry . Farmers tried to raise the Department of Agriculture to Cabinet rank. In 1887, the  House of Representatives  and  Senate  passed bills giving Cabinet status to the Department of Agriculture and Labor, but farm interests objected to the addition of labor, and the bill was killed in  conference committee . Finally, on February 9, 1889, President  Grover Cleveland  signed a bill into law elevating the Department of Agriculture to Cabinet level.   In 1887, the  Hatch Act  provided for the federal funding of  agricultural experiment stations  in each state. The  Smith-Lever Act of 1914  then funded  cooperative extension services  in each state to teach agriculture, home economics and related subjects to the public. With these and similar provisions, the USDA reached out to every county of every state.   During the  Great Depression , farming remained a common way of life for millions of Americans. The Department of Agriculture was crucial to providing concerned persons with the assistance that they needed to make it through this difficult period, helping to ensure that food continued to be produced and distributed to those who needed it, assisting with loans for small landowners, and contributing to the education of the rural youth. In this way, the Department of Agriculture became a source of comfort as people struggled to survive in rural areas. Allegations have been made that throughout the agency's history it  discriminated  against  African-American  farmers, denying them  loans  and access to other programs well into the 1990s. [ 2 ]  In 1999, the USDA settled a class action lawsuit alleging discrimination against African-American farmers.   Today, many of the programs concerned with the distribution of food and nutrition to people of America and providing nourishment as well as nutrition education to those in need are run and operated under the USDA Food and Nutrition Service.   USDA also concerns itself with assisting farmers and food producers with the sale of crops and food on both a domestic and on the world market.   The USDA also plays an important role in overseas aid programs by providing surplus foods to developing countries. This aid can go through  USAID , foreign governments, international bodies such as  WFP , or approved non profit organizations. The  Agriculture Act of 1949 , section  416 (b)  and  Agricultural Development and Trade Act of 1954  (also known as Public Law 480 or just  PL 480 ) provides the legal basis of such actions.   The  United States Secretary of Agriculture  administers the USDA.   The USDA's  National Animal Identification System  assists large agri-business and  factory farms  track disease in herds, a necessary regulation for sale of meat overseas.

While many of the awards typically go towards more energy-efficient grain dryers, the USDA notes that a farm in  Iowa  will use its grant to replace a  propane  heating system with a  geothermal  heating system, while a firm in  Louisiana  will purchase energy-efficient  electric motors  for an  irrigation well . [ 4 ]   The grants and loans are awarded through the  Renewable Energy Systems and Energy Efficiency Improvements Program  of the  USDA Rural Development  office. The program was created by Section 9006 of the 2002  Farm Bill  and will be expanded next year under the 2008 Farm Bill.

It aims to meet the needs of  farmers  and  ranchers , promote agricultural  trade  and production, work to assure  food safety , protect  natural resources , foster  rural  communities and end  hunger  in the  United States  and abroad.   The head of the department is the  Secretary of Agriculture , who is a member of the  Cabinet . The current Secretary is  Tom Vilsack .

Officials in the federal government had long sought new and improved varieties of seeds, plants, and animals for importation to the United States. In 1836  Henry Leavitt Ellsworth , a Yale-educated attorney interested in improving agriculture, became  Commissioner of Patents , a position within the  Department of State . He soon began collecting and distributing new varieties of seeds and plants through members of the  Congress  and agricultural societies. In 1839 Congress established the  Agricultural Division  within the  Patent Office  and allotted $1,000 for ""the collection of agricultural statistics and other agricultural purposes.""   Ellsworth's interest in aiding agriculture was evident in his annual reports that called for a public depository to preserve and distribute the various new seeds and plants, a clerk to collect agricultural statistics, the preparation of statewide reports about crops in different regions, and the application of chemistry to agriculture. Henry Leavitt Ellsworth's agricultural focus earned him the  sobriquet  of ""The Father of the Department of Agriculture.""   In 1849 the Patent Office was transferred to the newly created  Department of the Interior . In the ensuing years, agitation for a separate bureau of agriculture within the department or a separate department devoted to agriculture kept recurring.   On May 15, 1862, President  Abraham Lincoln  established the independent  Department of Agriculture  to be headed by a Commissioner without Cabinet status. [ 1 ]  Lincoln called it the ""people's department."" In the 1880s, varied  interest groups  were lobbying for Cabinet representation. Business interests sought a  Department of Commerce and Industry . Farmers tried to raise the Department of Agriculture to Cabinet rank. In 1887, the  House of Representatives  and  Senate  passed bills giving Cabinet status to the Department of Agriculture and Labor, but farm interests objected to the addition of labor, and the bill was killed in  conference committee . Finally, on February 9, 1889, President  Grover Cleveland  signed a bill into law elevating the Department of Agriculture to Cabinet level.   In 1887, the  Hatch Act  provided for the federal funding of  agricultural experiment stations  in each state. The  Smith-Lever Act of 1914  then funded  cooperative extension services  in each state to teach agriculture, home economics and related subjects to the public. With these and similar provisions, the USDA reached out to every county of every state.   During the  Great Depression , farming remained a common way of life for millions of Americans. The Department of Agriculture was crucial to providing concerned persons with the assistance that they needed to make it through this difficult period, helping to ensure that food continued to be produced and distributed to those who needed it, assisting with loans for small landowners, and contributing to the education of the rural youth. In this way, the Department of Agriculture became a source of comfort as people struggled to survive in rural areas. Allegations have been made that throughout the agency's history it  discriminated  against  African-American  farmers, denying them  loans  and access to other programs well into the 1990s. [ 2 ]  In 1999, the USDA settled a class action lawsuit alleging discrimination against African-American farmers.   Today, many of the programs concerned with the distribution of food and nutrition to people of America and providing nourishment as well as nutrition education to those in need are run and operated under the USDA Food and Nutrition Service.   USDA also concerns itself with assisting farmers and food producers with the sale of crops and food on both a domestic and on the world market.   The USDA also plays an important role in overseas aid programs by providing surplus foods to developing countries. This aid can go through  USAID , foreign governments, international bodies such as  WFP , or approved non profit organizations. The  Agriculture Act of 1949 , section  416 (b)  and  Agricultural Development and Trade Act of 1954  (also known as Public Law 480 or just  PL 480 ) provides the legal basis of such actions.   The  United States Secretary of Agriculture  administers the USDA.   The USDA's  National Animal Identification System  assists large agri-business and  factory farms  track disease in herds, a necessary regulation for sale of meat overseas.

While many of the awards typically go towards more energy-efficient grain dryers, the USDA notes that a farm in  Iowa  will use its grant to replace a  propane  heating system with a  geothermal  heating system, while a firm in  Louisiana  will purchase energy-efficient  electric motors  for an  irrigation well . [ 4 ]   The grants and loans are awarded through the  Renewable Energy Systems and Energy Efficiency Improvements Program  of the  USDA Rural Development  office. The program was created by Section 9006 of the 2002  Farm Bill  and will be expanded next year under the 2008 Farm Bill.

It aims to meet the needs of  farmers  and  ranchers , promote agricultural  trade  and production, work to assure  food safety , protect  natural resources , foster  rural  communities and end  hunger  in the  United States  and abroad.   The head of the department is the  Secretary of Agriculture , who is a member of the  Cabinet . The current Secretary is  Tom Vilsack .

Officials in the federal government had long sought new and improved varieties of seeds, plants, and animals for importation to the United States. In 1836  Henry Leavitt Ellsworth , a Yale-educated attorney interested in improving agriculture, became  Commissioner of Patents , a position within the  Department of State . He soon began collecting and distributing new varieties of seeds and plants through members of the  Congress  and agricultural societies. In 1839 Congress established the  Agricultural Division  within the  Patent Office  and allotted $1,000 for ""the collection of agricultural statistics and other agricultural purposes.""   Ellsworth's interest in aiding agriculture was evident in his annual reports that called for a public depository to preserve and distribute the various new seeds and plants, a clerk to collect agricultural statistics, the preparation of statewide reports about crops in different regions, and the application of chemistry to agriculture. Henry Leavitt Ellsworth's agricultural focus earned him the  sobriquet  of ""The Father of the Department of Agriculture.""   In 1849 the Patent Office was transferred to the newly created  Department of the Interior . In the ensuing years, agitation for a separate bureau of agriculture within the department or a separate department devoted to agriculture kept recurring.   On May 15, 1862, President  Abraham Lincoln  established the independent  Department of Agriculture  to be headed by a Commissioner without Cabinet status. [ 1 ]  Lincoln called it the ""people's department."" In the 1880s, varied  interest groups  were lobbying for Cabinet representation. Business interests sought a  Department of Commerce and Industry . Farmers tried to raise the Department of Agriculture to Cabinet rank. In 1887, the  House of Representatives  and  Senate  passed bills giving Cabinet status to the Department of Agriculture and Labor, but farm interests objected to the addition of labor, and the bill was killed in  conference committee . Finally, on February 9, 1889, President  Grover Cleveland  signed a bill into law elevating the Department of Agriculture to Cabinet level.   In 1887, the  Hatch Act  provided for the federal funding of  agricultural experiment stations  in each state. The  Smith-Lever Act of 1914  then funded  cooperative extension services  in each state to teach agriculture, home economics and related subjects to the public. With these and similar provisions, the USDA reached out to every county of every state.   During the  Great Depression , farming remained a common way of life for millions of Americans. The Department of Agriculture was crucial to providing concerned persons with the assistance that they needed to make it through this difficult period, helping to ensure that food continued to be produced and distributed to those who needed it, assisting with loans for small landowners, and contributing to the education of the rural youth. In this way, the Department of Agriculture became a source of comfort as people struggled to survive in rural areas. Allegations have been made that throughout the agency's history it  discriminated  against  African-American  farmers, denying them  loans  and access to other programs well into the 1990s. [ 2 ]  In 1999, the USDA settled a class action lawsuit alleging discrimination against African-American farmers.   Today, many of the programs concerned with the distribution of food and nutrition to people of America and providing nourishment as well as nutrition education to those in need are run and operated under the USDA Food and Nutrition Service.   USDA also concerns itself with assisting farmers and food producers with the sale of crops and food on both a domestic and on the world market.   The USDA also plays an important role in overseas aid programs by providing surplus foods to developing countries. This aid can go through  USAID , foreign governments, international bodies such as  WFP , or approved non profit organizations. The  Agriculture Act of 1949 , section  416 (b)  and  Agricultural Development and Trade Act of 1954  (also known as Public Law 480 or just  PL 480 ) provides the legal basis of such actions.   The  United States Secretary of Agriculture  administers the USDA.   The USDA's  National Animal Identification System  assists large agri-business and  factory farms  track disease in herds, a necessary regulation for sale of meat overseas.

While many of the awards typically go towards more energy-efficient grain dryers, the USDA notes that a farm in  Iowa  will use its grant to replace a  propane  heating system with a  geothermal  heating system, while a firm in  Louisiana  will purchase energy-efficient  electric motors  for an  irrigation well . [ 4 ]   The grants and loans are awarded through the  Renewable Energy Systems and Energy Efficiency Improvements Program  of the  USDA Rural Development  office. The program was created by Section 9006 of the 2002  Farm Bill  and will be expanded next year under the 2008 Farm Bill.

It aims to meet the needs of  farmers  and  ranchers , promote agricultural  trade  and production, work to assure  food safety , protect  natural resources , foster  rural  communities and end  hunger  in the  United States  and abroad.   The head of the department is the  Secretary of Agriculture , who is a member of the  Cabinet . The current Secretary is  Tom Vilsack .

Officials in the federal government had long sought new and improved varieties of seeds, plants, and animals for importation to the United States. In 1836  Henry Leavitt Ellsworth , a Yale-educated attorney interested in improving agriculture, became  Commissioner of Patents , a position within the  Department of State . He soon began collecting and distributing new varieties of seeds and plants through members of the  Congress  and agricultural societies. In 1839 Congress established the  Agricultural Division  within the  Patent Office  and allotted $1,000 for ""the collection of agricultural statistics and other agricultural purposes.""   Ellsworth's interest in aiding agriculture was evident in his annual reports that called for a public depository to preserve and distribute the various new seeds and plants, a clerk to collect agricultural statistics, the preparation of statewide reports about crops in different regions, and the application of chemistry to agriculture. Henry Leavitt Ellsworth's agricultural focus earned him the  sobriquet  of ""The Father of the Department of Agriculture.""   In 1849 the Patent Office was transferred to the newly created  Department of the Interior . In the ensuing years, agitation for a separate bureau of agriculture within the department or a separate department devoted to agriculture kept recurring.   On May 15, 1862, President  Abraham Lincoln  established the independent  Department of Agriculture  to be headed by a Commissioner without Cabinet status. [ 1 ]  Lincoln called it the ""people's department."" In the 1880s, varied  interest groups  were lobbying for Cabinet representation. Business interests sought a  Department of Commerce and Industry . Farmers tried to raise the Department of Agriculture to Cabinet rank. In 1887, the  House of Representatives  and  Senate  passed bills giving Cabinet status to the Department of Agriculture and Labor, but farm interests objected to the addition of labor, and the bill was killed in  conference committee . Finally, on February 9, 1889, President  Grover Cleveland  signed a bill into law elevating the Department of Agriculture to Cabinet level.   In 1887, the  Hatch Act  provided for the federal funding of  agricultural experiment stations  in each state. The  Smith-Lever Act of 1914  then funded  cooperative extension services  in each state to teach agriculture, home economics and related subjects to the public. With these and similar provisions, the USDA reached out to every county of every state.   During the  Great Depression , farming remained a common way of life for millions of Americans. The Department of Agriculture was crucial to providing concerned persons with the assistance that they needed to make it through this difficult period, helping to ensure that food continued to be produced and distributed to those who needed it, assisting with loans for small landowners, and contributing to the education of the rural youth. In this way, the Department of Agriculture became a source of comfort as people struggled to survive in rural areas. Allegations have been made that throughout the agency's history it  discriminated  against  African-American  farmers, denying them  loans  and access to other programs well into the 1990s. [ 2 ]  In 1999, the USDA settled a class action lawsuit alleging discrimination against African-American farmers.   Today, many of the programs concerned with the distribution of food and nutrition to people of America and providing nourishment as well as nutrition education to those in need are run and operated under the USDA Food and Nutrition Service.   USDA also concerns itself with assisting farmers and food producers with the sale of crops and food on both a domestic and on the world market.   The USDA also plays an important role in overseas aid programs by providing surplus foods to developing countries. This aid can go through  USAID , foreign governments, international bodies such as  WFP , or approved non profit organizations. The  Agriculture Act of 1949 , section  416 (b)  and  Agricultural Development and Trade Act of 1954  (also known as Public Law 480 or just  PL 480 ) provides the legal basis of such actions.   The  United States Secretary of Agriculture  administers the USDA.   The USDA's  National Animal Identification System  assists large agri-business and  factory farms  track disease in herds, a necessary regulation for sale of meat overseas.

It aims to meet the needs of  farmers  and  ranchers , promote agricultural  trade  and production, work to assure  food safety , protect  natural resources , foster  rural  communities and end  hunger  in the  United States  and abroad.   The head of the department is the  Secretary of Agriculture , who is a member of the  Cabinet . The current Secretary is  Tom Vilsack .

Officials in the federal government had long sought new and improved varieties of seeds, plants, and animals for importation to the United States. In 1836  Henry Leavitt Ellsworth , a Yale-educated attorney interested in improving agriculture, became  Commissioner of Patents , a position within the  Department of State . He soon began collecting and distributing new varieties of seeds and plants through members of the  Congress  and agricultural societies. In 1839 Congress established the  Agricultural Division  within the  Patent Office  and allotted $1,000 for ""the collection of agricultural statistics and other agricultural purposes.""   Ellsworth's interest in aiding agriculture was evident in his annual reports that called for a public depository to preserve and distribute the various new seeds and plants, a clerk to collect agricultural statistics, the preparation of statewide reports about crops in different regions, and the application of chemistry to agriculture. Henry Leavitt Ellsworth's agricultural focus earned him the  sobriquet  of ""The Father of the Department of Agriculture.""   In 1849 the Patent Office was transferred to the newly created  Department of the Interior . In the ensuing years, agitation for a separate bureau of agriculture within the department or a separate department devoted to agriculture kept recurring.   On May 15, 1862, President  Abraham Lincoln  established the independent  Department of Agriculture  to be headed by a Commissioner without Cabinet status. [ 1 ]  Lincoln called it the ""people's department."" In the 1880s, varied  interest groups  were lobbying for Cabinet representation. Business interests sought a  Department of Commerce and Industry . Farmers tried to raise the Department of Agriculture to Cabinet rank. In 1887, the  House of Representatives  and  Senate  passed bills giving Cabinet status to the Department of Agriculture and Labor, but farm interests objected to the addition of labor, and the bill was killed in  conference committee . Finally, on February 9, 1889, President  Grover Cleveland  signed a bill into law elevating the Department of Agriculture to Cabinet level.   In 1887, the  Hatch Act  provided for the federal funding of  agricultural experiment stations  in each state. The  Smith-Lever Act of 1914  then funded  cooperative extension services  in each state to teach agriculture, home economics and related subjects to the public. With these and similar provisions, the USDA reached out to every county of every state.   During the  Great Depression , farming remained a common way of life for millions of Americans. The Department of Agriculture was crucial to providing concerned persons with the assistance that they needed to make it through this difficult period, helping to ensure that food continued to be produced and distributed to those who needed it, assisting with loans for small landowners, and contributing to the education of the rural youth. In this way, the Department of Agriculture became a source of comfort as people struggled to survive in rural areas. Allegations have been made that throughout the agency's history it  discriminated  against  African-American  farmers, denying them  loans  and access to other programs well into the 1990s. [ 2 ]  In 1999, the USDA settled a class action lawsuit alleging discrimination against African-American farmers.   Today, many of the programs concerned with the distribution of food and nutrition to people of America and providing nourishment as well as nutrition education to those in need are run and operated under the USDA Food and Nutrition Service.   USDA also concerns itself with assisting farmers and food producers with the sale of crops and food on both a domestic and on the world market.   The USDA also plays an important role in overseas aid programs by providing surplus foods to developing countries. This aid can go through  USAID , foreign governments, international bodies such as  WFP , or approved non profit organizations. The  Agriculture Act of 1949 , section  416 (b)  and  Agricultural Development and Trade Act of 1954  (also known as Public Law 480 or just  PL 480 ) provides the legal basis of such actions.   The  United States Secretary of Agriculture  administers the USDA.   The USDA's  National Animal Identification System  assists large agri-business and  factory farms  track disease in herds, a necessary regulation for sale of meat overseas.

While many of the awards typically go towards more energy-efficient grain dryers, the USDA notes that a farm in  Iowa  will use its grant to replace a  propane  heating system with a  geothermal  heating system, while a firm in  Louisiana  will purchase energy-efficient  electric motors  for an  irrigation well . [ 4 ]   The grants and loans are awarded through the  Renewable Energy Systems and Energy Efficiency Improvements Program  of the  USDA Rural Development  office. The program was created by Section 9006 of the 2002  Farm Bill  and will be expanded next year under the 2008 Farm Bill.

It aims to meet the needs of  farmers  and  ranchers , promote agricultural  trade  and production, work to assure  food safety , protect  natural resources , foster  rural  communities and end  hunger  in the  United States  and abroad.   The head of the department is the  Secretary of Agriculture , who is a member of the  Cabinet . The current Secretary is  Tom Vilsack .

Officials in the federal government had long sought new and improved varieties of seeds, plants, and animals for importation to the United States. In 1836  Henry Leavitt Ellsworth , a Yale-educated attorney interested in improving agriculture, became  Commissioner of Patents , a position within the  Department of State . He soon began collecting and distributing new varieties of seeds and plants through members of the  Congress  and agricultural societies. In 1839 Congress established the  Agricultural Division  within the  Patent Office  and allotted $1,000 for ""the collection of agricultural statistics and other agricultural purposes.""   Ellsworth's interest in aiding agriculture was evident in his annual reports that called for a public depository to preserve and distribute the various new seeds and plants, a clerk to collect agricultural statistics, the preparation of statewide reports about crops in different regions, and the application of chemistry to agriculture. Henry Leavitt Ellsworth's agricultural focus earned him the  sobriquet  of ""The Father of the Department of Agriculture.""   In 1849 the Patent Office was transferred to the newly created  Department of the Interior . In the ensuing years, agitation for a separate bureau of agriculture within the department or a separate department devoted to agriculture kept recurring.   On May 15, 1862, President  Abraham Lincoln  established the independent  Department of Agriculture  to be headed by a Commissioner without Cabinet status. [ 1 ]  Lincoln called it the ""people's department."" In the 1880s, varied  interest groups  were lobbying for Cabinet representation. Business interests sought a  Department of Commerce and Industry . Farmers tried to raise the Department of Agriculture to Cabinet rank. In 1887, the  House of Representatives  and  Senate  passed bills giving Cabinet status to the Department of Agriculture and Labor, but farm interests objected to the addition of labor, and the bill was killed in  conference committee . Finally, on February 9, 1889, President  Grover Cleveland  signed a bill into law elevating the Department of Agriculture to Cabinet level.   In 1887, the  Hatch Act  provided for the federal funding of  agricultural experiment stations  in each state. The  Smith-Lever Act of 1914  then funded  cooperative extension services  in each state to teach agriculture, home economics and related subjects to the public. With these and similar provisions, the USDA reached out to every county of every state.   During the  Great Depression , farming remained a common way of life for millions of Americans. The Department of Agriculture was crucial to providing concerned persons with the assistance that they needed to make it through this difficult period, helping to ensure that food continued to be produced and distributed to those who needed it, assisting with loans for small landowners, and contributing to the education of the rural youth. In this way, the Department of Agriculture became a source of comfort as people struggled to survive in rural areas. Allegations have been made that throughout the agency's history it  discriminated  against  African-American  farmers, denying them  loans  and access to other programs well into the 1990s. [ 2 ]  In 1999, the USDA settled a class action lawsuit alleging discrimination against African-American farmers.   Today, many of the programs concerned with the distribution of food and nutrition to people of America and providing nourishment as well as nutrition education to those in need are run and operated under the USDA Food and Nutrition Service.   USDA also concerns itself with assisting farmers and food producers with the sale of crops and food on both a domestic and on the world market.   The USDA also plays an important role in overseas aid programs by providing surplus foods to developing countries. This aid can go through  USAID , foreign governments, international bodies such as  WFP , or approved non profit organizations. The  Agriculture Act of 1949 , section  416 (b)  and  Agricultural Development and Trade Act of 1954  (also known as Public Law 480 or just  PL 480 ) provides the legal basis of such actions.   The  United States Secretary of Agriculture  administers the USDA.   The USDA's  National Animal Identification System  assists large agri-business and  factory farms  track disease in herds, a necessary regulation for sale of meat overseas.

While many of the awards typically go towards more energy-efficient grain dryers, the USDA notes that a farm in  Iowa  will use its grant to replace a  propane  heating system with a  geothermal  heating system, while a firm in  Louisiana  will purchase energy-efficient  electric motors  for an  irrigation well . [ 3 ]   The grants and loans are awarded through the  Renewable Energy Systems and Energy Efficiency Improvements Program  of the  USDA Rural Development  office. The program was created by Section 9006 of the 2002  Farm Bill  and will be expanded next year under the 2008 Farm Bill.

clueweb09-en0001-98-12549	"    Maryland Department of Natural Resources  Online Privacy Policy   Effective June 1, 2005      Thank you for visiting the Maryland Department of Natural Resources online (DNR Online). In using the Internet to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of our services to public, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) takes data security very seriously. To ensure the privacy of our customers, DNR (1) only collects personal information that is necessary to serve you, and (2) will not disclose this information except for use in carrying out its governmental functions.    Collection of Information:   As mandated by Maryland law, DNR only collects or create personal records if:     The need for the information is clearly established;   The personal data collected are relevant to the purposes for which they are collected and the customer is advised of that purpose;   The customer is advised of the consequences of refusing to provide the information e.g., not being able to obtain a fishing license if an address is not provided; and  The customer is advised of his/her right to inspect and correct personal records, which shall be maintained as accurate and current.   DNR also collects statistical information not associated with any specific individual. For online transactions that require ""cookies,"" they are removed when the application is finished. Email inquiries are retained in a database for quality control and improving customer service, but the email addresses are only used for DNR purposes and not shared.     Disclosure of Information:  Except for carrying out its governmental functions, DNR will not publicly disclose, or allow the inspection and copying of, any part of a public record the contains your personal information.  Examples of personal information include your social security number, home address, telephone number and e-mail address.  A DNR Regulation (effective October 14, 2002) gives this policy the force and effect of law.       Social Security Numbers Required for Hunting and Fishing License Applications  The federal Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-193) requires that States implement a process by which they can deny or rescind licenses (professional and recreational) to individuals owing child support or failing to comply with court orders relating to paternity or child support proceedings.  To fulfill that requirement, Maryland mandated the collection of Social Security numbers from all recreational license applicants (Natural Resources Article, Section 10-301 for hunting licenses and Section 4-205 for fishing licenses).     Under the Department's Privacy Policy, your Social Security number cannot be displayed on any documents accessible to the general public, including your hunting or fishing license.  Your Social Security number is considered sociological information (along with your address and phone number) that can only be used by the Department in carrying out its governmental functions and cannot be released to anyone else without your express permission.

There is an increasing awareness of the importance of changing economic and environmental situations, and the vulnerability of small developing island states if flexibility and adaptation to change are not achieved. The Pacific islands countries have a range of challenges including eroding tariff preferences, population and urban growth, migration of skilled labour, resource depletion and degradation, and risks from climate change. As described in Pacific 2020-challenges and opportunities for growth , ineffective policy implementation is seen as a significant impediment to development and progress.    Agriculture, forestry and fisheries sustain many households and will comprise the majority of livelihoods of Pacific islands countries for the foreseeable future. Many smallholders live in isolated rural communities dependent on household food production and intermittent crop, fish and small livestock sales. Improving and transforming these systems into sustainable income-generating activities through improved productivity and marketing will enhance self-reliance and reduce poverty over time, as will diversification into new activities.    The development of an agriculture-enabling environment is an ongoing objective. Participation in regional projects that address common problems, where appropriate, will help overcome the limited capacity of many countries to engage in collaborative activities. ACIAR has a strong emphasis on working with Pacific regional organisations to improve effective delivery of outputs. In partnership with the University of the South Pacific, ACIAR will implement a scholarships program designed to increase capacity in the region through the allocation of Postgraduate Diploma and Masters Degree scholarships for research associated with ACIAR projects in the Pacific.    Relationship to the AusAID regional strategy    AusAID's Pacific Regional Aid Strategy 2004-09 identifies four key themes: stronger broad-based growth; more effective, accountable and democratic government; improved law, justice and security; and enhanced service delivery. These themes are further underlined in the Pacific 2020 report with a commitment to address governance and institutions, infrastructure, regional cooperation and implementation of programs.    ACIAR's Pacific program, through its three research emphases (increased productivity and diversification through new crops, products and value-adding; development of sustainable management systems; underpinning of systems development, economics, marketing and biosecurity), contributes to these objectives primarily in the thematic area of broad-based economic growth. In fisheries, ACIAR will work in cooperation with AusAID's new Pacific fisheries strategy developed in 2007.    Country-specific issues    Vanuatu's agriculture sector (along with tourism) remains the main focus of the country's development strategy. The main activities relate to coconut, cattle, cocoa, and timber production, with traditional food production for subsistence and local markets. Smallholders also cultivate peanuts, potatoes, vanilla and pepper. Although Vanuatu is an agricultural exporter, the majority of the population is in the subsistence or informal sector.    The Vanuatu Government is currently developing a holistic agricultural plan for the country which will give direction to future ACIAR cooperation in agriculture and fisheries. For the current planning period, the focus of ACIAR activities in Vanuatu will be in forestry. Forest covers almost 40% of the total land area of the country, and policy and technical interventions for sustainable management of plantations and development of new species of commercial value for both plantations and smallholders are important. In forestry, assistance is needed in relation to assessing commercial prospects for native species, including sandalwood and whitewood.

The DNR, along with our watershed improvement partners (Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship- Division of Soil Conservation  and USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service), offers the following:     Technical assistance    From the sediment delivery calculator to tools to use in the field, a number of support options are available to watershed projects.   The DNR and its partners can assist with assessments in the watershed, which help determine what the problems are and where they're coming from.   These include stream (RASCAL), gully, watershed land cover and tillage, livestock and other assessments.   Project coordinators can use tools from the DNR, like tablet computers and hand-held GIS units, to complete these assessments.   Project coordinators can also use the Sediment Delivery Calculator, a database that calculates sediment delivery reduction resulting from conservation practices installed during a project.   Projects can receive advice on selection and design of conservation practices, as well as help with cost-share and funding assistance issues from DNR, DSC and NRCS.    More information on technical assistance is available from Adam Kiel at (515) 282-6149 or  Adam.Kiel@dnr.iowa.gov   or from one of the DSC  regional coordinators .

The RCs -  Vince Sitzmann ,  Jeff Tisl  and  Bob Waters  -    also help develop projects and can answer day-to-day questions from projects.       The DNR two project officers,  Kyle Ament  and  Rachel Glaza , work with the projects and regional coordinators on project planning, development and oversight, and contracts.    The project officers also serve as a contact with EPA and can answer questions on eligibility for 319 funds. Once you have a grant, DNR project officers will visit you in the field at least twice a year to help you reach your watershed improvement goals.     Both the DSC regional coordinators and DNR project officers can help plan your project using the  watershed planning protocol  (*.pdf).

DES MOINES - The Iowa Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship (IDALS) are encouraging groups across the state to apply for grant funding to help improve Iowa's water quality.    The grants from DNR and IDALS' Division of Soil Conservation (DSC) allow groups, such as Soil and Water Conservation Districts and other organizations, to further their local water quality improvement efforts. Watershed and water quality projects help individual Iowans make changes on the land in order to improve the quality of water entering our rivers, streams and lakes.    ""Through our grants program, we've worked with many Iowans over the years to improve their local lake, river or stream,"" said Bill Ehm, the DNR's Water Policy Coordinator. ""We're encouraging new groups to apply, and we look forward to helping more Iowans plan a comprehensive local effort to improve water quality and their communities.""    ""Individual landowners, organizations, and towns can get assistance from their local Soil and Water Conservation District to improve water quality,"" said Secretary of Agriculture Bill Northey. ""Through project grants, landowners can receive technical and financial support to address water quality and watershed issues.""    In a joint application process, Iowa Soil and Water Conservation Districts can apply for funding from DNR Section 319, and/or the Water Protection Fund (WPF) and the Watershed Protection Fund (WSPF) from IDALS-DSC. Other groups and organizations are invited to apply for Section 319 funding through the DNR. The deadline for applications is April 1, 2009.    The DNR and DSC regional watershed coordinators will work with groups that receive Section 319 grants to complete a Watershed Management Plan, or WMP. These comprehensive plans are designed to help groups meet water quality goals by identifying problems and offering solutions. While WMPs are not required prior to applying for a Section 319 grant this year, the WMP must be completed before the project can receive Section 319 funding. Beginning next year, completed WMPs will be required prior to applying for a grant.     The DNR is able to provide these grants annually through funding from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The grants, made possible through Section 319 of the federal Clean Water Act, are often called ""Section 319 Grants"" and currently fund about 50 projects in Iowa, focusing on impaired waters. The IDALS-DSC is able to provide grants annually through funding from the Resource Enhancement and Protection (REAP) program and the state's Environment First Fund. Currently, 70 watershed and water quality projects in 65 Soil and Water Conservation Districts are supported by these funds.    Groups considering applying for a grant can contact Steve Hopkins, DNR watershed improvement coordinator, at (515) 281-6402 with questions and for one-on-one assistance regarding Section 319 grants. Those with questions about WPF or WSPF funding can contact Jim Gillespie, IDALS Field Services Bureau Chief, at (515) 281-7043.    More information on grants and watershed improvement is available on the DNR's Web site at  http://watershed.iowadnr.gov  or the IDALS-DSC Web site at  www.iowaagriculture.gov/soilConservation.asp .

The rulemaking process increases agenciesaccountability to the public, allows public participation in the formulation of rules, and provides legislative oversight for program operations.    Before the Department rules are adopted, they are published in the Iowa Administrative Bulletin as a ""notice of intended action."" Any interested people may submit comments on the proposed rules within time frames set forth in the notice. All notices must allow at least 20 days for persons to submit comments or to request an oral presentation.    The Department may not adopt the rules until 35 days after the date the notice adoption is published. Following notice and adoption, the final rules are again published in the Iowa Administrative Bulletin. They become effective at a date specified with the final rule. Normally the Department must allow at least 35 days from the date of publication for people to prepare to implement the rules.   All chapters of the Iowa Administrative Code (IAC) relevant to the DNR are available through the  Iowa General Assembly website .

This is known as  WTM83, NAD83 (1991) . An alternate term for this coordinate reference system, ""WTM83/91"", is being phased out of use in DNR GIS documentation. The term ""WTM83, NAD83 (1991)"" is preferred as it is more consistent with terminology used for other Wisconsin statewide, regional, and local coordinate reference systems.            Rationale for use of WTM83, NAD83 (1991) for DNR Geographic Data       WTM83/91 Parameters       WTM83/91 ArcGIS Projection File         Rationale for use of WTM83, NAD83 (1991) for DNR Geospatial Data     For the purposes of data integration, there are significant advantages in making all agency geographic data available for internal use in a single statewide coordinate reference system. This approach is intended to better enable DNR GIS users to integrate agency data sets. It also enables integration of statewide vector data with the accumulating raster data, including digital orthophotos, digital raster graphics, and WISCLAND land cover data.     A coordinate reference system is defined by its coordinate system (and zone, where appropriate) and its geodetic system (datum and datum adjustment). To create a single coordinate referencing system for agency use, the DNR has chosen the WTM83 coordinate system and the NAD83 (1991) datum.     WTM83 is a UTM-based coordinate system, modified to cover the state of Wisconsin in a single zone. WTM83 represents a redefinition of the Wisconsin Transverse Mercator coordinate system for the North American Datum of 1983. The WTM83 coordinate system may be used with any adjustment of the North American Datum of 1983, including the upcoming NAD83 (NSRS2007) adjustment. However, the Wisconsin DNR recommends use of the NAD83 (1991) adjustment as an agency standard.     NAD83 (1991) refers to the geodetic datum adjustment based on Wisconsin's high accuracy reference network (HARN). Wisconsin's HARN was the first established for the nation and was originally known as the High Precision Geodetic Network (HPGN).     The coordinate reference system is cited as: WTM83, NAD83 (1991).     Defining parameters for the WTM83 coordinate system are identified below.
