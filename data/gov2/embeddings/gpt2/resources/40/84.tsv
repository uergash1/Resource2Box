GX020-47-12658625	"ADVISORY   FROM THE COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS   Subcommittee on Trade   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, Contact: (202) 225-1721  August 10, 2000  No. TR-23     Crane Announces Hearing on Trade in African Diamonds   Congressman Philip M. Crane (R-IL), Chairman, Subcommittee on Trade of the Committee on Ways and Means, announced today that the Subcommittee will hold a hearing on trade in African  diamonds.   The hearing will take place on Tuesday,  September 12 , 2000, in  the main Committee hearing room, 1100 Longworth  House Office Building, beginning at  10:00 a.m.   Oral testimony at this hearing will be from both invited and public witnesses. Invited witnesses will include officials from the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Also, any individual or organization not scheduled for an oral appearance may submit a written statement for consideration by the Committee or for inclusion in the printed record of the hearing.   BACKGROUND :   Recently, there has been intensified international focus on the trade in diamonds and its link to illegal arms trafficking and civil war in Africa.   Often called ""conflict"" or ""blood"" diamonds, such diamonds generally come from mines controlled   by rebel forces and are traded for arms to fuel civil war in Africa.   Many claim that the Sierra Leone rebel organization Revolutionary United Front has engaged in atrocious acts against civilians and has been trading conflict diamonds to finance its war against the Government of Sierra Leone. On July 5, 2000, the United Nations adopted a resolution calling for an 18-month embargo against diamonds from Sierra Leone. The resolution calls on member states to ban the importation of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone unless those diamonds are exported under a certificate system approved by a Security Council Sanction Committee. This ban is similar to the U.N. embargo implemented against diamonds from Angola in June 1998.   The United States has been actively involved in efforts to curb trade in conflict diamonds. In May 2000 in Kimberly, South Africa, the United States, along with South Africa, the United Kingdom, Belgium, and representatives of the diamond industry reached an agreement on key issues establishing a certification system, accountability and oversight for the industry. The United States has also taken a lead in establishing Sierra Leone's Commission on the Management of Strategic Resources and has committed over $1 million as well as technical advice for this effort.   In response to the international focus on conflict diamond trade and the U.N. ban against diamonds from Sierra Leone, the World Diamond Congress (comprised of the World Federation of Diamond Bourses and the International Diamond Manufacturers Association) adopted on July 19, 2000, a joint resolution laying out a proposal for oversight, accountability and specific actions to track the flow of rough diamonds. The proposal requires each accredited rough diamond importing country to enact ""redline"" legislation prohibiting the importation of any parcel of rough diamonds unless such parcel has been sealed and registered in a universally standardized manner by an accredited export authority from the exporting country. In addition, the proposal does the following: (1) calls for the exporting country to implement an accredited export system; (2) prohibits the importation of diamonds from countries that have not enacted redline legislation; (3) requires countries to adopt criminal penalties for trading in illicit rough diamonds; and (4) requires adherence to a code of conduct. Under the proposal, compliance is to be monitored and controlled by the industry, the International Diamond Council.   Under U.S. law, the origin of a cut diamond is the country where the diamond was cut, and U.S. Customs does not require any information relating to the country of mining of the imported cut diamond. Most experts agree that once a diamond has been cut and polished, it is difficult to determine the country where it was mined.   There have been a number of legislative proposals in Congress seeking to address the trade in conflict diamonds, including banning diamonds from specified countries and requiring a certification of where the diamond sought to be imported was mined. These proposals have not received the support of the Administration, largely because of concerns that they are not administrable and have the potential to harm legitimate diamond trade.   In announcing the hearing, Chairman Crane stated: ""This hearing will provide the Subcommittee with an opportunity to review the options available to curtail conflict diamond trade that are World Trade Organization (WTO) consistent and do not impact legitimate diamond trade. We must break the link that makes diamonds a rebel's best friend, but we must also not harm legitimate diamond trade that is a vital link to the world's economy.""   FOCUS OF THE HEARING:   The focus of the hearing will be to evaluate options available that are administrable and WTO consistent and will effectively curtail conflict diamond trade without impacting legitimate diamond trade. The Subcommittee is interested in receiving testimony on possible approaches to this issue, including testimony on current and developing technology that can determine the country of mining of a cut and polished diamond.

Iran, still split between conservatives and reformers loyal to President Mohammad Khatemi, who was elected in May 1997 and overwhelmingly reelected on June 8, 2001, has not accepted to date. However, recent reports of Iranian meddling in post-Taliban Afghanistan and Iran's intercepted January 2002 shipment of arms allegedly to the Palestinian Authority have reversed the warming trend. Iran was grouped with North Korea and Iraq as part of the ""axis of evil"" identified in President Bush's January 29, 2002 State of the Union message. The President has identified Iran's efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction and delivery means, coupled with its support of terrorist groups, as key U.S. concerns. Iran's ballistic missile program has made major strides over the past few years, with the help of several foreign suppliers, and its nuclear program is advancing with Russia's help. Iran has opposed the U.S.-led Middle East peace process since its inception in October 1991. It continues to provide material support to Hizballah in Lebanon and to Islamic-oriented Palestinian groups that oppose the Arab-Israeli peace process, such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. All Iranian factions have strongly supported Palestinian violence against Israel since September 2000. Iran's human rights practices, particularly its treatment of the Baha'i and the Jewish communities, are also a major concern, although neither the Clinton nor the Bush Administrations cited progress as a specific condition for an improvement in relations. The Bush Administration has identified Iran's modernization of its conventional forces as a potential threat to U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf, but others argue that the buildup has been minor and that Iran still is relatively poorly equipped. Although the Bush Administration says it is still willing to hold a dialogue with Iran, the focus of U.S. policy appears to be containment. During the first term of the Clinton Administration, as part of a policy of ""dual containment"" of Iran and Iraq, President Clinton imposed a ban on U.S. trade and investment in Iran in 1995, and a 1996 law imposed sanctions on foreign investment in Iran's energy sector (Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, ILSA). The sanctions were intended to deny Iran the material resources to threaten U.S. interests. In keeping with a 1997 policy shift toward engagement, in 1999 and 2000 the Clinton Administration and Congress eased sanctions somewhat to allow U.S. exports to Iran of food and medical supplies and importation from Iran of luxury consumer goods, such as carpets. However, the United States continues to work with its allies to prevent arms and advanced technology sales to Iran and to limit Iran's influence over regional energy flows. U.S. purchases of Iranian crude oil and U.S. company investments in Iran remain barred. Legislation to renew ILSA for another 5 years was signed on August 3, 2001 (H.R. 1954, P.L. 107-24).  Congressional Research Service  ~ The Library of Congress   IB93033  03-12-02  MOST RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Legislation to renew the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act for another 5 years was signed on August 3, 2001 (H.R. 1954, P.L. 107-24). The thawing of U.S.-Iran relations reversed in January 2002 over revelations that Iran had sold arms to the Palestinian Authority and over Iranian efforts to exert influence on the new Afghan government. In his January 29, 2002 State of the Union message, President Bush named Iran, along with Iraq and North Korea, as part of an ""axis of evil,"" constituting major potential threats to U.S. national security.  BACKGROUND AND ANALYSIS The power struggle in Iran between revolutionary purists and more moderate reformists colors Iran's domestic and foreign policies. President Mohammad Khatemi, who was reelected on June 8, 2001 by a landslide 77% of the vote against nine more conservative candidates, holds a popular mandate for greater domestic freedoms. His reelection victory was larger than his 69% first win in May 1997. His supporters hold about 70% of the seats in the 290-seat Majlis (parliament) following victories in the February 18, 2000 Majlis elections. However, Khatemi has expressed frustration that his reform program has been obstructed by hardliners, including Supreme Leader Ali Khamene'i (successor to Ayatollah Khomeini), who use their control of key levers of power to prevent a loosening of domestic restrictions or moderation of foreign policy. As part of a hardline backlash since April 2000, hardliners in the judiciary have closed more than 40 reformist newspapers and imprisoned or questioned several editors. In February 2002 testimony, DCI George Tenet said Iran's reform movement may be ""losing momentum"" to the ""unelected"" hardliners. Iran arrested student reformers in late February 2002, a blow to the reform movement.  Iran's Strategic Buildup Iran is not considered a major conventional threat to the United States, but some of its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly medium range ballistic missiles, appear to be making significant progress. For further information, see CRS Report RL30551, Iran: Arms and Technology Acquisitions.  Conventional Weapons Iran's armed forces total about 550,000 personnel, including both the regular military and the Revolutionary Guard, the latter of which is populated largely by hardliners. Low oil prices and high debts slowed Iran's defense acquisitions to about $300 million per year during 1996-1999, from over $1 billion per year in the early 1990s, although purchase levels appear to be rising again. Equipment already purchased has given Iran the ability to temporarily block the Strait of Hormuz or disrupt international shipping, but Iran is largely lacking in ability to project power far beyond its borders. In November 2000, Russia told the United States it would no longer abide by a 1995 pledge to refrain from new conventional arms deals with Iran. On October 2, 2001, Iran and Russia signed an agreement that provides for $300 CRS-1   IB93033  03-12-02  million per year in Iranian arms purchases over the next 5 years. Despite Russian assurances that the arms would be purely defensive, the systems reportedly under consideration include new MiG-29 and Sukhoi combat aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as the S-300 air defense system (the Russian counterpart of the U.S. ""Patriot""). See CRS Report RL31083, Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations, 1993-2000.  Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) It is partly because of Iran's attempts to acquire WMD that President Bush, in his January 29, 2002 State of the Union message, labeled Iran part of an ""axis of evil"" along with Iraq and North Korea. U.S. government proliferation reports, including a February 2002 CIA report covering January - June 2001, assert that Iran is actively seeking to acquire WMD and advanced conventional weapons. Iran's programs, particularly its missile program, continue to be assisted primarily by entities in Russia, China, and North Korea. The foreign assistance continued despite U.S. anti-proliferation efforts through multilateral export control regimes such as the Wassenaar Arrangement, Missile Technology Control Regime, Nuclear Suppliers Group, Zangger Committee, and Australia Group. (See also CRS Report RL30408, Weapons of Mass Destruction in the Middle East.) Chemical and Biological Weapons. U.S. proliferation reports state that Iran is seeking to acquire a self-sufficient chemical weapons infrastructure, that it may have some capability for biological weapons deployment, and that it has stockpiled chemical weapons, including blister, blood, and choking agents. On June 11, 2001, the Bush Administration imposed trade sanctions, in accordance with the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000 (P.L. 106178) on China's Jiangsu Yongli Chemicals and Technology Import and Export Corporation for allegedly selling Iran technology not permitted for export to Iran under the Chemical Weapons Convention. Two more Chinese entities (Liyang Chemical Equipment and China Machinery and Electric Equipment Import-Export Co.) and one individual (Q.C.Chen) were sanctioned under the Act in January 2002 for alleged export to Iran of chemical and biological technology. This record raises questions about Iran's compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which Iran signed on January 13, 1993, and ratified on June 8, 1997. However, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), charged with monitoring the convention, has indicated general satisfaction with Iran's compliance thus far. OPCW toured Iran's declared chemical sites in February 1999, and Iran has made required declarations. Iran is a party to the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. Missiles. Largely with Russian help, Iran is making progress in its missile program. Although two of its first three tests of the 800-mile range Shahab-3 (July 1998, July 2000, and September 2000) were either inconclusive or unsuccessful (the July 2000 test appears to have been a success), U.S. intelligence officials said publicly in August 2001 that Iran will soon ""field"" the Shahab-3. At least one defense publication said in mid-October 2001 that Iran had launched serial production of the Shahab-3. Iran is also developing a 1,200 mile range Shahab-4, and it has publicly mentioned an even longer- range Shahab-5, although development of the Shahab-5 apparently has not begun, according to U.S. reports. DCI Tenet testified in February 2002 that Iran will likely field an intercontinental ballistic missile by 2015. On June 11, 2001, the Bush Administration imposed trade sanctions on North Korean and Iranian entities under the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000 for alleged exports to Iran of missile technology. CIA reports to and testimony before Congress in February CRS-2   IB93033  03-12-02  2002 cast doubt that China is upholding a November 2000 pledge not to export missile technology to Iran or other countries. On February 22, 2002, the Washington Times reported that China had delivered HQ-7 surface-to-air missiles to Iran. In late February 2002, the United States and Russia differed sharply over U.S. allegations that Russian entities are continuing to give Iran missile technology. Nuclear Weapons. DCI Tenet testified in February 2002 that Iran might be able to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon by late this decade, and sooner if it gets such material from outside. Russia, despite these U.S. concerns and protests, is proceeding with its January 1995 contract with Iran to complete a nuclear power plant at Bushehr, and the two countries have said it should be complete by the end of 2002. In November 2001, Russia shipped to Iran the first reactor shell of the project. There have been inconclusive Iranian and Russian statements on whether Iran will commission Russia to build additional reactors. The February 2002 CIA report to Congress, covered January - June 2001, says that some Iran-China interactions raise questions about China's adherence to its pledge to refrain from new nuclear cooperation with Iran. Iran accepts International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards of its known nuclear facilities, and agency visits to Iran's declared facilities since 1992 have found no evidence at the sites visited to indicate Iran is developing nuclear weapons. Iran has refused to permit an enhanced IAEA inspections program (""93+2"") that would include surprise inspections to undeclared facilities, although some observers say Iran is mulling accepting more stringent inspections. Each year since FY1998, foreign aid laws have contained provisions cutting U.S. aid to the Russian government if it continues the Bushehr project or assists Iran's ballistic missile program. No waiver was provided for either in the FY1998 or the FY2000 legislation, although the cuts do not apply to nuclear dismantlement in Russia or aid to Russia's private sector. The foreign operations appropriations for both FY2001 (P.L. 106-429) and FY2002 (conference report H.Rept. 107-345) contain a similar provision, but both increase the aid cut to 60%. The House version of the FY2002 foreign relations authorization bill, H.R. 1646, passed by the House on May 16, 2001, contains Title IX, the Iran Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 2001. Virtually identical to bills introduced in the 106th and 105th congresses, the provision would make the IAEA subject to cuts in U.S. voluntary contributions if it continued technical assistance to Iran's nuclear program.  Iranian Foreign Policy and Involvement in Terrorism Iran's continued support for terrorism contributed to President Bush's strong criticism of Iran in his State of the Union message. The State Department report on international terrorism for 2000, released April 30, 2001, states that Iran ""remained the most active state sponsor of terrorism in 2000,"" although the report attributed that activity to two hardline institutions -- the Revolutionary Guard and the Intelligence Ministry. On the other hand, Iran strongly condemned the September 11 attacks and tacitly supported the U.S. war on the Taliban and Al Qaida. (See also CRS Report RL31119, Terrorism: Near Eastern Groups and State Sponsors, 2002.)  CRS-3   IB93033  03-12-02  Persian Gulf Khatemi has largely succeeded in improving relations with Iran's neighbors, particularly the six states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC; Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates). Since he came into office, Iran apparently has reduced support for Shiite Muslim dissident movements in the Gulf states. See also CRS Report RL30728, Persian Gulf: Issues for U.S. Policy, 2000. Saudi Arabia/Khobar Towers/Gulf States. Iran and Saudi Arabia restored relations in December 1991 (after a 4 year break), and progressively higher level contacts have taken place since December 1997. In May 1999, Khatemi became the first senior Iranian leader to visit Saudi Arabia since the Islamic revolution. In April 2000, Saudi Arabia's number three leader, Prince Sultan, hosted a visit by Iran's Defense Minister. Supreme Leader Khamene'i has been invited to visit the Kingdom as well. In mid-April 2001, Saudi Arabia and Iran formally entered into an anti-crime security pact, suggesting that Saudi Arabia wishes to bury the issue of the June 25, 1996 Khobar Towers housing complex bombing, which killed 19 U.S. airmen. On June 21, 2001, a federal grand jury indicted 14 suspects, 13 Saudis and a Lebanese citizen, for the Khobar bombing. The indictment indicated that official elements in Iran were likely involved, but no indictments of any Iranians were announced. Saudi officials announced that the 11 Saudi suspects who are in custody in Saudi Arabia would be tried in Saudi courts and not turned over to U.S. justice. In 2000, Iran entered into anti-crime security pacts with the other Gulf states of Kuwait and Oman. (See CRS Issue Brief IB93113, Saudi Arabia: Postwar Issues and U.S. Relations.) Gulf Islands Dispute With UAE. Relations between Iran and the UAE deteriorated sharply in April 1992, when Iran asserted complete control of the Persian Gulf island of Abu Musa, which it and the UAE shared under a 1971 bilateral agreement. (In 1971, Iran, then ruled by the U.S.-backed Shah, seized two other islands, Greater and Lesser Tunb, from the emirate of Ras al-Khaymah, which later became part of the UAE.) The UAE wants to refer the dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), but Iran insists on resolving the issue bilaterally. Several GCC states -- Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Oman -- have attempted to mediate and Iran-UAE talks did resume in July 2001, but there is no evidence of Iranian flexibility to date on the key issue of sovereignty. The United States, which is concerned about Iran's military improvements to the islands, generally supports UAE proposals but takes no position on sovereignty. Jane's Defence Weekly reported in March 2000 that Iran's military improvements were relatively minor. Iraq. A legacy of the 8-year long Iran-Iraq war (1980-1988) is deep lingering suspicion between Iran and Iraq, but relations have improved dramatically over the past few years. Since early 1998, the two have exchanged significant numbers of prisoners from the 19801988 Iran-Iraq war. An October 2000 visit to Iraq by Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi resulted in apparent agreement to abide by the waterway-sharing and other provisions of their 1975 Algiers Accords, which Iraq had abrogated prior to its September 1980 invasion of Iran. In exchange for a share of the proceeds, Iran's maritime authorities generally cooperate with Iraq's illicit export of oil products through the Gulf, although Iran has occasionally prevented such shipments. Iranian hardliners still give support to Shiite militants in southern Iraq (the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, SCIRI) trying to overthrow Iraq's regime, and Iran allowed the Iraqi National Congress (INC), Iraq's main opposition umbrella, to open an office in Tehran in 2001. CRS-4   IB93033  03-12-02  Middle East Peace Process/North Africa Many of the allegations of Iran's support for terrorism center on its assistance to groups opposed to the Arab-Israeli peace process, primarily Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Hizballah, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. Apparently corroborating press reports, U.S. terrorism reports state that, following the start of the September 2000 Palestinian uprising, Iran increased its support for terrorism somewhat by encouraging coordination among Palestinian terrorist groups. These groups have escalated attacks on Israel since the Palestinian uprising began in September 2000. Iran also incites anti-Israel violence, including hosting a conference of anti-peace process organizations on April 24, 2001: the conference served as a platform for Iranian statements against Israel that the United States called ""outrageous and intolerable."" Khamene'i told the meeting that Israelis had exaggerated the Holocaust to justify ""crimes"" against the Palestinians. Khamene'i said in early November 2000 that the Palestinian-Israeli violence could end only if Israel were ""eradicated."" Khatemi has sometimes tried to moderate Iran's position somewhat, saying during his November 2001 visit to the United Nations that Iran would accept a final IsraeliPalestinian settlement acceptable to the Palestinians. At the same time, Khatemi has sought to avoid conflict with hardliners by joining them in pledging continued support to anti-peace process groups. On the other hand, Iran has traditionally had few ties to the non-Islamist Palestinian organizations, including elements linked to the Palestinian Authority, that have conducted some of the day-to-day violence against Israel in the current uprising. It was therefore a new development when Israel and the United States asserted in early January 2002 that Iran was the source of a shipment, intercepted by Israel, of 50 tons of arms bought by the Palestinian Authority. The arms could be used for terrorism or for conventional combat capabilities. About 100 Iranian Revolutionary Guards remain in Lebanon to coordinate arms deliveries to Hizballah, and the Los Angeles Times reported on May 6, 2001 that the United States, in late 2000, succeeded in persuading Turkey to prevent Iran from flying over Turkish airspace to Syria, thereby denying Iran an easy route for resupplying Hizballah. Even though the United Nations certified Israel's May 2000 withdrawal from Lebanon as complete, Hizballah occasionally attacks Israel in the Shebaa Farms border area that Israel controls and that Hizballah claims constitutes occupied Lebanese territory. Iran publicly supported Hizballah's ambush and capture of three Israeli soldiers and one alleged Israeli agent in October 2000, all in that area. (H.Res. 99 expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that Iran, Syria, and Lebanon pressure Hizballah to allow visitations to the four captives by the International Committee of the Red Cross. The measure passed the House on June 25, 2001.) In late October 2001, Israel announced it believed the three captured soldiers had died. A New York Times report of January 12, 2002 said that, in the mid-1990s, Iran had transferred American-built Stinger anti-aircraft systems obtained in Afghanistan to Hizballah. Israel asserted in February 2002 that Iran had 8,000 Katyusha rockets to Hizballah recently, but the Israeli claim could not be confirmed. On May 10, 1999, Argentina's Supreme Court ruled that the March 17, 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires was the work of Hizballah. On September 2, 1999, Argentina issued an arrest warrant for senior Hizballah guerrilla leader Imad Mughniyah in connection with it. An Argentine judge has also accused Iran and Hizballah of a July 18, 1994 bombing of a Jewish cultural center (AMIA) in Buenos Aires; 20 alleged Argentine CRS-5   IB93033  03-12-02  accomplices have been arrested and their trial began in late September 2001, but the main suspects are still at large. H.Res. 531 and S.Res. 329, calling on Argentina to step up the investigation of the 1994 bombing, were passed by their full chambers on July 17 and July 19, 2000, respectively. In May 2001, an FBI team traveled to Argentina to help with the AMIA investigation. Sudan. Sudan's close relations with Iran in the early 1990s contributed to Sudan's placement on the U.S. ""terrorism list"" on August 18, 1993. However, Sudan's alliance with Iran frayed as Sudan has sought to achieve removal from the terrorism list.  Central and South Asia/Azerbaijan Iran's policy in Central Asia has thus far emphasized economic cooperation over Islamic ideology, although Iran has become increasingly assertive in its relations with Azerbaijan. In early 1992, Iran led the drive to bring the Central Asian states and Azerbaijan into the Economic Cooperation Organization (founded in 1985 by Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey, as a successor to an organization founded by those states in 1964). Iran is hoping to attract energy pipeline routes through it, rather than through other countries. Iran does not appear to be supporting radical Islamic fundamentalist groups in the Central Asian countries (with the possible exception of Tajikistan) or in Russia's Dagestan and Chechnya regions, but Iran does host at least one anti-Azerbaijan guerrilla leader (Hasan Javadov), and it reportedly allows anti-Uzbekistan activists access to Iran's state radio. Tensions with Azerbaijan flared in late July 2001 over energy exploration rights in the Caspian; Iranian warships and combat aircraft intimidated an international oil firm (BP) on contract to Azerbaijan from continuing its work an area of the Caspian Iran considers its own. The United States called Iran's actions in the Caspian provocative, and it offered new border security aid and increased political support to Azerbaijan. Iran and Armenia, adversary of Azerbaijan, agreed on expanded defense cooperation in early March 2002. Afghanistan/Pakistan. Iran long opposed the puritanical Sunni Muslim regime of the Taliban in Afghanistan on the grounds that it oppressed Shiite Muslim and other Persianspeaking minorities. Iran nearly launched a military attack against the Taliban in September 1998 after Taliban fighters captured and killed several Iranian diplomats based in northern Afghanistan. Subsequently, Iran provided military aid to the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance coalition, made up of mostly Persian-speaking minority groups. Iran -- along with the United States, Russia, and the countries bordering Afghanistan -- attended U.N.-sponsored meetings in New York (the Six Plus Two group) to try to end the internal conflict in Afghanistan. Iran and the United States also participated in a U.N.-sponsored group in Geneva, which also includes Italy and Germany. Tacitly aligned with the U.S. military campaign against the Taliban in Afghanistan, Iran pledged search and rescue assistance to the United States and pledged to allow U.S. humanitarian aid for the Afghan people to transit Iran en route to Afghanistan. U.S. officials have called Iran's role in the anti-Taliban/Al Qaeda effort, including efforts to form a new government at the Bonn conference (ended in agreement December 5, 2001) ""constructive."" Some of Iran's activities in Afghanistan reflect official suspicion of the United States: Iran publicly opposed U.S. military retaliation for the September 11 attacks and refused to join a U.S.-led anti-terrorism coalition. Iran is said to fear the pro-U.S. tilt of the new government of Afghanistan and the waning of Iran's traditional sway in western, central, and CRS-6   IB93033  03-12-02  northern Afghanistan where Persian-speaking Afghans predominate. Amid press reports in January 2002 that Iran might be harboring some Al Qaeda fighters who have fled Afghanistan, President Bush warned Iran against such activity. Other reports say Iran is arming local Afghan strongmen including Herat governor Ismail Khan, Mazar-e-Sharif governor Abdul Rashid Dostam, and others, and President Bush warned Iran not to seek to exert influence over the new government of Afghanistan. Apparently seeking to deflect the U.S. criticism, in March 2002 Iran reportedly expelled exiled Pashtun figure Gulbuddin Hikmatyar, an opponent of the new Afghan government. The expulsion followed a February 24, 2002 visit to Iran by Afghan interim leader Hamid Karzai in which the two countries agreed to cooperate broadly. (See CRS Report RL30588, Afghanistan: Current Issues and U.S. Policy Concerns.)  Former Yugoslavia On June 26, 1996, and again on May 5, 1997, President Clinton certified to Congress that Bosnia had expelled foreign forces and ended intelligence cooperation with Iran. The certifications were required by P.L. 104-122, an FY1996 supplemental appropriation, and P.L. 104-208, the FY1997 foreign aid appropriation, in order to provide U.S. aid to Bosnia.  Human Rights Concerns U.S. and U.N. human rights reports cite Iran for widespread human rights abuses, (especially of the Baha'i faith), including assassinations and executions of regime opponents (Kurds, People's Mojahedin, and others) in Iran and abroad. These reports note that Khatemi's efforts to promote rule of law have met repeated challenges from hardliners. Religious Persecution. On October 27, 2001, the State Department again named Iran as a ""Country of Particular Concern,"" under the International Religious Freedom Act. No sanctions were added, on the grounds that Iran is already subject to extensive U.S. sanctions. Religious persecution continues, especially against the Baha'i community, because Iran's Shiite Muslim clergy views the sect as heretical. Two Baha'is (Dhabihullah Mahrami and Musa Talibi) were sentenced to death in 1996 for apostasy. On July 21, 1998, Iran executed Ruhollah Ruhani, the first Bahai executed since 1992 (Bahman Samandari). The United States condemned the execution. In February 2000, Iran's Supreme Court set aside the death sentences against three Bahais, Sirus Zabihi-Moqaddam, Hedayat KashefiNajafabadi, and Manucher Khulusi. On April 21, 1999, the Clinton Administration expressed concern about the sentencing to prison of four Baha'is. Recent resolutions condemning Iran's treatment of the Baha'is, including S.Con.Res. 57, which passed the Senate July 19, 2000, and H.Con.Res. 257, which passed the House on September 19, 2000. Trial of 13 Jews. Although the 30,000 member Jewish community (the largest in the Middle East aside from Israel) enjoys more freedoms than Jewish communities in several other Muslim states, during 1993-1998 Iran executed five Jews allegedly spying for Israel. In June 1999, Iran confirmed that it had arrested 13 Jews -- teachers, shopkeepers, and butchers -- from the Shiraz area that it said were part of an ""espionage ring"" for Israel. After an April - June 2000 trial in which eight of the suspects ""confessed"" to the allegations, ten of the Jews and two Muslims accomplices were convicted (July 1, 2000) and received CRS-7   IB93033  03-12-02  sentences ranging from 4 years to 13 years. Three Jews were acquitted. The affair provoked an international outcry, and the Clinton Administration worked through U.S. allies to intercede, possibly contributing to a September 21, 2000 decision by a three-judge appeals panel to reduce the sentences slightly, now ranging from 2 to 9 years. On February 8, 2001, Iran's Supreme Court rejected their appeals, allowing the revised sentences to stand. In March 2001, Iran released one of the Jews on the grounds that his sentence included time served. A second was released on January 16, 2002. Several bills in the 106th Congress condemned the arrests and called for the release of the detainees and for linking U.S. relations with Iran to the trial's outcome; the Senate passed S.Con.Res. 39 (June 23, 1999) and S.Con.Res. 109 (May 4, 2000). In April 2001, a similar bill, H.Con.Res. 29, was introduced in the 107th Congress.  U.S. Policy and Legislation The February 11, 1979 fall of the Shah of Iran, a key U.S. ally, opened a long rift in U.S.-Iranian relations, but the rift appears to be starting to close somewhat. On November 4, 1979, radical ""students"" seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held its diplomats hostage until minutes after President Reagan's inauguration on January 20, 1981. The United States broke relations with Iran on April 7, 1980, and the two countries have had no official dialogue since. The exception was the abortive 1985-86 clandestine arms supply relationship with Iran in exchange for some American hostages held by Hizballah in Lebanon (the so-called ""Iran-Contra Affair""). Iran maintains an interests section in Washington through the Embassy of Pakistan, staffed by Iranian permanent resident aliens or U.S. citizens of Iranian descent. The U.S. protecting power in Iran is Switzerland. Upon taking office in 1993, the Clinton Administration moved to further isolate Iran as part of a strategy of ""dual containment"" of Iran and Iraq. In 1995 and 1996, the Clinton Administration and Congress added sanctions on Iran in response to growing concerns about Iran's weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons acquisition programs, its support for terrorist groups, and its efforts to subvert the Arab-Israeli peace process. The election of Khatemi in May 1997 precipitated a shift in U.S. policy from containment to engagement, although with key efforts to limit Iran's strategic capabilities still in place. The Clinton Administration sought to engage Iran in a dialogue, with no substantive preconditions. In January 1998, Khatemi publicly agreed to increase ""people-to-people"" exchanges with the United States but ruled out an official dialogue. In a June 17, 1998 speech, then Secretary of State Albright stepped up the U.S. outreach effort by calling for mutual confidence building measures that could lead to a ""road map"" for normalization of relations. Encouraged by the reformist victory in Iran's March 2000 parliamentary elections, Secretary Albright gave another speech on March 17, 2000, acknowledging past U.S. meddling in Iran, easing sanctions on some Iranian imports, and promising to work to resolve outstanding claims disputes. Iran welcomed the steps, but called them insufficient to warrant the beginning of a dialogue. Iran also rejected a U.S. suggestion for consular visits by U.S. officials. In early September 2000 meetings at the United Nations in connection with the Millennium Summit, Secretary Albright and President Clinton sent a positive signal to Iran by attending Khatemi's speeches.  CRS-8   IB93033  03-12-02  Until early 2002, the Bush Administration appeared to be continuing the Clinton Administration efforts, in part by building on the cooperation between the two countries in Afghanistan. The Administration's November 13, 2001 continuation of the 1979 national emergency on Iran justified the emergency by saying that U.S. ""relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal,"" a far softer statement than previous justifications sighting a continued threat from Iran. However, Iran continued to refuse to engage in official, bilateral talks until at least some U.S. sanctions are lifted. Following a move by some Majlis deputies to call for re-establishing relations with the United States, Supreme Leader Khamene'i moved forcefully to squash talk of improved relations on October 30, 2001, when he threatened to fire Iranian officials who strive for that result. His statement came a few weeks after several Members of Congress had dinner in the Senate with Iran's U.N. representative. The gradual thaw in relations, which appeared to accelerate in the context of the Afghanistan crisis, appears to have stalled or reversed as of January 2002. Allegations of Iran's sale of arms to the Palestinian Authority and reputed meddling in Afghanistan have caused the Administration and Congress to become far more critical of Iran's intentions and actions. As noted above, President Bush named Iran as part of an ""axis of evil"" in his State of the Union message. In subsequent comments, the President and his aides said that the United States would still be willing to hold dialogue with Iran and that the President was implying he wanted Iran's behavior to change, not threatening military action against Iran.  Economic Sanctions Since the November 4, 1979 seizure of the U.S. hostages in Tehran, economic sanctions have formed a major part of U.S. policy toward Iran. On November 14, 1979, President Carter declared a national emergency with respect to Iran, renewed every year since 1979. Terrorism/Foreign Aid. Following the October 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Lebanon, believed perpetrated by Iranian allies, Iran was added to the ""terrorism list"" in January 1984. The designation bans direct U.S. financial assistance and arms sales, restricts sales of U.S. dual use items, and requires the United States to oppose multilateral lending to the designated countries. Separate from its position on the terrorism list, successive foreign aid appropriations laws since the late 1980s ban direct assistance to Iran (loans, credits, insurance, Eximbank credits) and indirect assistance (U.S. contributions to international organizations that work in Iran). Section 307 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (added in 1985) names Iran as unable to benefit from U.S. contributions to international organizations, requiring proportionate cuts if these institutions work in Iran. Iran is also barred from sales of U.S. munitions list items because it has been designated every year since 1997 as not cooperating with U.S. anti-terrorism efforts, under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (P.L. 104-132). That Act also penalizes countries that assist or sell arms to terrorism list countries. Proliferation Sanctions. Some of these sanctions are discussed above, and two laws are unique to Iran. The Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act (P.L. 102-484) requires denial of license applications for exports to Iran of dual use items. It also imposes sanctions on foreign countries that transfer ""destabilizing numbers and types of conventional weapons,"" as well as WMD technology, to Iran. Although progress with Russia has ebbed and flowed, Congress has sought stronger steps to end the missile assistance to Iran. The Iran Nonproliferation Act (P.L. 106-178) authorizes sanctions on foreign entities that assist Iran's CRS-9   IB93033  03-12-02  WMD programs. It also bans U.S. extraordinary payments to the Russian Aviation and Space Agency in connection with the international space station unless the President can certify that the agency or entities under the Agency's control had not transferred any WMD or missile-related technology to Iran within the year prior. The provision contains certain exceptions to ensure the safety of astronauts who will use the space station and for certain space station hardware. Counternarcotics. In February 1987, Iran was first designated as a state that failed to cooperate with U.S. anti-drug efforts or take adequate steps to control narcotics production or trafficking. U.S. and U.N. Drug Control Program (UNDCP) assessments of drug production in Iran prompted the Clinton Administration, on December 7, 1998, to remove Iran from the U.S. list of major drug producing countries. The decision exempts Iran from the annual certification process that kept drug-related U.S. sanctions in place on Iran. Britain reportedly has sold Iran small arms for its anti-drug efforts on the Afghan border. Trade Ban. On May 6, 1995, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12959 banning U.S. trade and investment in Iran, including the trading of Iranian oil overseas by U.S. companies. This followed an earlier March 1995 executive order barring U.S. investment in Iran's energy sector, and, although modified, has been extended each year since. On March 13, 2001, President Bush renewed the declaration of a state of emergency that triggered the March 1995 investment ban. An August 1997 amendment to the trade ban (Executive Order 13059) prevented U.S. companies from knowingly exporting goods to a third country for incorporation into products destined for Iran. The trade ban was partly intended to blunt criticism that U.S. trade with Iran made U.S. appeals for multilateral containment of Iran less credible. Some goods related to the safe operation of civilian aircraft can be licensed for export to Iran, and in December 1999, the Clinton Administration allowed the repair of engine mountings on seven Iran Air 747's (Boeing). Implementing regulations do not permit U.S. firms to negotiate investment deals with Iran, and, in November 2000, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC, Department of Treasury) warned U.S. firms against co-sponsoring energy-related conferences with Iran. Following a 1998 application by a U.S. firm to sell Iran agricultural products, and in the context of Clinton Administration and congressional reviews of U.S. unilateral sanctions policies, the Clinton Administration announced in April 1999 that it would license, on a caseby-case basis, commercial sales of food and medical products to certain countries on which unilateral U.S. trade bans are in place (Iran, Libya, and Sudan). Under regulations issued in July 1999, private letters of credit can be used to finance approved sales, but no U.S. government credit guarantees were made available and U.S. exporters were not permitted to deal directly with Iranian banks. Iran says the lack of credit makes U.S. sales, particularly of wheat, uncompetitive. The FY2001 agriculture appropriations (P.L. 106-387), contains a provision banning the use of official credit guarantees for food and medical sales to Iran and other countries on the U.S. terrorism list, except Cuba, although allowing for a presidential waiver to permit such credit guarantees. (In the 107th Congress, S.171, introduced January 24, 2001, would repeal this provision.) The Clinton Administration did not provide credit guarantees, and the Bush Administration has not done so either. In her March 17, 2000 speech, then Secretary Albright announced an easing of the trade ban to allow U.S. importation of Iranian nuts, dried fruits, carpets, and caviar. Regulations governing the sales were issued in April 2000. The United States was the largest market for CRS-10   IB93033 Iranian Iranian of that carpets  03-12-02  carpets before the 1979 revolution, although U.S. anti-dumping tariffs imposed on pistachio nut imports in 1986 (about 300%) and still in effect are dampening imports product. Iranian caviar began arriving in the United States in May 2000, and Iranian are being sold in the United States, estimated to be a $100 million per year market.  The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA). The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA, H.R. 3107, P.L. 104-172, signed August 5, 1996), a law that sanctions foreign investment in Iran or Libya's energy sector, was scheduled to expire on August 5, 2001. H.R. 1954, which renewed ILSA for five years but requires an Administration report on its effectiveness within 24-30 months, was passed by large majorities in both chambers in July 2001. It was signed on August 3, 2001 (P.L. 107-24). For further discussion of ILSA and its renewal, see CRS Report RS20871, The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA). Caspian/Central Asian Energy Routes Through Iran. The U.S. trade ban permits U.S. companies to apply for licenses to conduct ""swaps"" of Caspian Sea oil with Iran, but, as part of a U.S. policy to route Central Asian energy around Iran (and Russia), a Mobil Corporation application to do so was denied in April 1999. The Administration continues to oppose, and to threaten imposing ILSA sanctions on, pipeline project s that route Caspian/Central Asian energy through Iran. U.S. policy has been to strongly favor construction of a pipeline that would cross the Caspian Sea and let out in Ceyhan, Turkey (Baku-Ceyhan pipeline), avoiding Iran or Russia. Four Caspian nations (Turkey, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan) signed an agreement embracing Baku-Ceyhan on November 18, 1999, and regional and corporate support for the project has gained momentum; a detailed engineering study is under way. In a potential setback to it, in mid-2001 Kazakhstan began pushing for construction of an oil pipeline across Iran. In December 2001, Kazakhstan's President Nazarbayev urged Secretary of State Powell to reconsider U.S. policy and allow routes through Iran; Powell reiterated U.S. policy but did not reject the request outright. Russia, which seeks to route oil and gas lines through it, reportedly also favors a route through Iran. Despite U.S. pressure not to import Iranian gas, Turkey has begun to do so through a new cross-border pipeline, under an August 1996 bilateral agreement. (See CRS Report 98-86, Iran: Relations With Key Central Asian States.) European and Japanese Relations With/Lending to Iran. U.S.-allied differences on Iran narrowed since 1998 in concert with the Clinton Administration's attempt to engage Iran, a policy consistently favored by the European countries as a way to moderate Iran's behavior. During 1992-1997, the European Union (EU) countries maintained a policy of ""critical dialogue"" with Iran. The United States did not oppose those talks with Iran but maintained that the EU's dialogue would not change Iranian behavior. The dialogue was suspended immediately following the April 1997 German terrorism trial that found high-level Iranian involvement in assassinating Iranian dissidents in Germany. Simultaneous with the Khatemi era U.S. shift toward engagement, the EU-Iran dialogue formally resumed in May 1998. Since then, Khatemi has undertaken state visits to several Western countries, including Italy (March 1999), France (October 1999), Germany (July 2000), and Japan (November 2000). The United States publicly welcomed these visits. The resolution of the ""Rushdie affair"" to Britain's satisfaction sparked improvement in its relations with Iran. Iran maintains that Ayatollah Khomeini's 1989 death sentence against author Salman Rushdie cannot be revoked (his ""Satanic Verses"" novel was labeled blasphemous) because Khomeini is no longer alive to revoke it. However, on September 24, CRS-11   IB93033  03-12-02  1998, Iran's Foreign Minister pledged to Britain that Iran will not seek to implement the sentence and opposes any bounties offered for his death. Britain then upgraded relations with Iran to the ambassadorial level, and Foreign Ministers of the two countries have exchanged visits. In October 2000, the United Kingdom began extending longer term credit (two years or greater) for exports to Iran. Some Iranian clerics (outside the formal government structure) have said the death sentence stands, and the Iranian government has not required the Fifteen Khordad foundation to withdraw its $2.8 million reward for Rushdie's death. Khatemi said on June 4, 2001 that he considers the issue closed. In August 1999, Japan's Foreign Minister continued a gradual improvement in relations with Iran by visiting that country and announcing that Japan would resume its official development lending program for Iran to construct a hydroelectric dam over the Karun River. However, the $70 million increment announced was less that Iran had wanted, and Japan said that this tranche would close out Japan's involvement in the project. (In 1993, Japan provided the first $400 million tranche of the overall $1.4 billion official development loan program, but the lending was subsequently placed on hold as the United States sought to persuade its allies to pressure Iran.) In late January 2000, Japan agreed to resume mediumand long-term (two years or longer) export credit insurance for exports to Iran, suspended since 1994. Economic relations improved further during Khatemi's November 2000 visit to Tokyo, which resulted in Japan's commitment to provide insurance cover for over $500 million in private sector projects, including refurbishment of steel and petrochemical plants. Iran also granted Japanese firms the first right to negotiate to develop the large Azadegan field, and Iran and a Japanese-led consortium are moving forward with preliminary studies of the field. Some press reports suggest that Royal Dutch/Shell might join the Azadegan project, apparently because it can provide needed technology. In exchange, Japan agreed to prepay Iran $1 billion per year for the next 3 years for Iranian oil. Partly at U.S. urging, Japan refused to extend to Iran additional official loans. During 1994-1995, and over U.S. objections at the time, Iran's European and Japanese creditors rescheduled about $16 billion in Iranian debt. These countries (governments and private creditors) rescheduled the debt bilaterally, in spite of Paris Club rules that call for multilateral rescheduling and International Monetary Fund (IMF) involvement. Iran has worked its external debt down from $32 billion in 1997 to about $7 billion as of December 2001, according to Iran's Central Bank. Iran plans to retire about half of this remaining debt by March 2002. The improved debt picture has led most European export credit agencies, including Germany's Hermes, France's COFACE, and that of Spain, to restore insurance cover for exports to Iran. In October 1999, Dutch banks extended $2 billion in credits to investors in Iran. In July 2000, Germany increased its export insurance cover from $100 million to $500 million in conjunction with Khatemi's visit there. In July 2001, France's Societe Generale de France extended a $1 billion credit line to a group of Iranian commercial banks. In early September 2001, Iran and the EU met to discuss a possible trade pact that would lower the tariffs or increase quotas for Iranian exports to the EU countries. In August 2001, Iran announced it would tap international capital markets for the first time since the Islamic revolution by issuing a $280 million Eurobond. Multilateral Lending to Iran/WTO. Section 1621 of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-132) amended the Foreign Assistance Act to require the United States to vote against international loans to countries on the U.S. terrorism list. Acting under provisions of successive foreign aid laws, in 1993 the United States voted CRS-12   IB93033  03-12-02  its 16.5% share of the World Bank against loans to Iran of $460 million for electricity, health, and irrigation projects. To signal opposition to international lending to Iran, the FY1994 foreign aid appropriations act (P.L. 103-87) cut the Administration's request for the U.S. contribution to the World Bank by the amount of those loans. That law, the FY1995 foreign aid appropriation (P.L. 103-326), and the FY1996 foreign aid appropriations (P.L. 104-107), would have significantly reduced U.S. payments to the Bank if it had provided new loans to Iran. The legislation contributed to the Bank's refusal to approve any new lending to since then. By 1999, Iran's moderating image had led the World Bank to consider new loans. In May 2000, the United States was unsuccessful in obtaining further delay on a vote on new lending for Iran, and its allies outvoted the United States to approve $232 million in loans for health and sewage projects. Twenty one of the Bank's twenty four governors voted in favor, and France and Canada abstained. Earlier, Iran also had asked the International Monetary Fund for about $400 million in loans (its quota is about $2 billion) to help it deal with its trade financing shortfalls. However, Iran balked at accepting IMF conditionality, and discussions broke off. Despite the required U.S. opposition, on May 10, 2001, the World Bank's executive directors voted to approve a two-year economic reform strategy for Iran that envisions $775 million in new Bank loans. Voting on the actual loans is expected in the spring of 2002. WTO. On May 8, 2001, the World Trade Organization, at U.S. urging, postponed until July 2001 a discussion on whether to launch entry talks with Iran. On July 18, 2001, and again on October 10, 2001, the United States achieved further postponements in considering Iran's application for admission, although the Administration says that position is ""under review."" Iranian officials indicate to U.S. visitors that the dropping of U.S. opposition to Iran's membership in the WTO would be taken as a positive U.S. gesture. Related Sanctions. Use of U.S. passports for travel to Iran is permitted, but a State Department travel warning, softened somewhat in April 1998, asks that Americans ""defer"" travel to Iran. Iranians entering the United States are fingerprinted, although Secretary Albright implied in her March 17, 2000 speech that this practice would be eliminated. U.S. regulations do not bar disaster relief and the United States donated $125,000, through relief agencies, to help victims of two earthquakes in Iran (February and May 1997). Assets Disputes/Victims of Terrorism. Iran claims that the United States has frozen vast amounts of Iranian assets, presenting an obstacle to improved relations. A U.S.Iran Claims Tribunal, at the Hague, is arbitrating cases resulting from the break in relations following the Iranian revolution. The major cases yet to be decided center on hundreds of Foreign Military Sales cases between the United States and the Shah's regime, which Iran claims it paid for but were unfulfilled. About $400 million in proceeds from the resale of that equipment is in a DOD account. In April 2000, then Secretary Albright named a representative to negotiate a resolution of the claims issue at the Hague. The assets issue moved to the forefront following several U.S. court judgements against Iran for past acts of terrorism against Americans, filed under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. Since March 1998, U.S. courts have awarded the following: $247 million to the family of Alisa Flatow, killed in Israel in April 1995 in a bombing by Palestinian Islamic Jihad (awarded in March 1998); $65 million to three Americans held hostage in Lebanon - David Jacobsen, Joseph Cicippio, and Frank Reed (August 1998); $324 CRS-13   IB93033  03-12-02  for Lebanon hostage Terry Anderson (March 2000); $327 million to the families of two Americans killed in a February 1996 Hamas bombing (July 2000); and $355 million to the family of Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, killed by Hizballah in 1989 (September 2000). Former Lebanon hostage Thomas Sutherland won a $353 million judgement against Iran on June 26, 2001. In August 2001, the family of former Lebanon hostage father Lawrence Jenco won a $314.6 million judgment against Iran for his captivity. In June 2001, former hostages Benjamin Weir and Frank Regier sued Iran for over $100 million for their captivity in Lebanon. Also in early June 2001, the family of former hostage Peter Kilburn, who was killed in the course of his captivity in Lebanon, filed a suit against both Libya and Iran for more than $200 million. In October 2001, victims of the October 1982 Hizbollah bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut filed a $5 billion suit against Iran. On January 23, 2002, a federal judge ordered Iran to pay $42 million to the family of Charles Hegna, who was beaten in the course of a 1984 Hizbollah hijacking of Kuwait Air 221. On February 6, 2002, a federal judge awarded $56 million to the family of Ira Weinstein, killed in a 1996 Hamas bus bombing in Israel. On the basis of the sanctity of diplomatic property, the Clinton Administration blocked efforts by the claimants to satisfy their judgments from frozen Iranian assets  diplomatic property in Washington (worth about $22 million) or the DOD account mentioned above. In December 1999, the Clinton Administration also blocked a Flatow effort to seize a $6 million U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal judgement awarded to Iran. A provision of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (H.R. 3244, P.L. 106-386) provides for the use of general revenues to pay 110% of compensatory damage awards to the above and future successful claimants in a total not to exceed the rental proceeds from Iran's diplomatic property and the DOD account. The provision requires the President to try to recoup the expended funds from Iran as part of an overall reconciliation in relations and assets settlement, although there is no requirement that funds ultimately be withheld from Iran. A provision of the FY2002 Commerce, Justice, State appropriation (P.L. 107-77) requires an Administration legislative proposal on how to compensate successful U.S. claimants in future terrorism-related judgments against Iran. In mid-October 2001, the Bush Administration asked a federal judge to throw out a lawsuit against Iran by the 52 Americans held hostage by Iran for 444 days. With regard to the 52 American hostages, the conference report on the FY2002 defense appropriation (P.L. 107-117, H.Rept.107-350) states that the hostages should be able to collect damages from Iranian assets, notwithstanding U.S.-Iran agreements on the disposition of Iran's assets. Regarding the mistaken U.S. shootdown on July 3,1988 of an Iranian Airbus passenger jet, on February 22, 1996, the United States, responding to an Iranian case before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), agreed to pay Iran up to $61.8 million in compensation ($300,000 per wage earning victim, $150,000 per non wage earner) for the 248 Iranians killed in the shootdown. The funds for this settlement came from a general appropriation for judgments against the United States. The United States previously paid $3 million in death benefits for 47 non-Iranians killed in the attack, but has not compensated Iran for the airplane itself. A different case, pending before the ICJ, involves an Iranian claim for damages to Iranian oil platforms during U.S. naval clashes with Iran in October 1987 and April 1988.  CRS-14   IB93033  03-12-02  Military Containment U.S. policy has focused on containing the military threat posed by Iran to the United States, U.S. allies in the Persian Gulf, and international shipping. Although containing Iraq has been the primary goal of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf region since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, U.S. military officials note that U.S. forces can also be used to monitor and deter Iran, if necessary. U.S. military officers note that their encounters with Iranian naval vessels in the Gulf have been more professional and less tense since Khatemi took office.  Iran's Opposition Movements On February 8, 1995, then House Speaker Newt Gingrich said that a U.S. policy supporting the overthrow of Iran's regime was the only policy that made sense. The Administration accepted a House-Senate conference agreement to include $18-$20 million in funding authority for covert operations against Iran in the FY1996 intelligence authorization act (H.R. 1655, P.L. 104-93) -- about $14 million more than requested -- according to a Washington Post report of December 22, 1995. The Clinton Administration reportedly succeeded in focusing the covert aid on changing the regime's behavior, rather than its overthrow. The conference report on H.R. 2267 (H.Rept. 105-405), the FY1998 Commerce/State/ Justice appropriation, provided $4 million for a ""Radio Free Iran,"" to be run by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). The radio, which the Administration is calling the Farsi service of RFE/RL, began operations in Prague on October 31, 1998. Another $4 million for the radio for FY1999 was provided by the omnibus appropriation (H.R. 4328, P.L. 105-277). (See CRS Report 98-539, Radio Free Iraq and Radio Free Iran: Background, Legislation, and Policy Issues for Congress.) Since the late 1980s, the State Department has refused contact with the anti-regime People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI) and its umbrella organization, the National Council of Resistance (NCR). It was designated as a foreign terrorist organization in October 1997 under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. For further information on the PMOI, see CRS Report RL31119, Terrorism: Near Eastern Groups and State Sponsors, 2002. Some Iranian exiles follow the son of the late former Shah, who lives in the United States. On January 24, 2001, the Shah's son, Reza Pahlavi, 40 years old, ended a long period of inactivity by giving a speech in Washington calling for unity in opposition to the current regime and for the institution of a constitutional monarchy and genuine democracy in Iran. He has since broadcast messages into Iran from a station in California, and press reports say a growing number of Iranians are listening to his broadcasts.  CRS-15"

Iran continues to provide material support to Hizballah in Lebanon and to Palestinian groups that oppose the Arab-Israeli peace process, such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Iran's human rights practices, particularly its treatment of the Baha'i and the Jewish communities, are frequently criticized by U.S. officials and Members of Congress. Thus far, the Bush Administration has continued most aspects of the containment policies toward Iran that characterized preceding administrations. During the first term of the Clinton Administration, as part of a policy of ""dual containment"" of Iran and Iraq, President Clinton imposed a ban on U.S. trade and investment in Iran in 1995, and a 1996 law imposed sanctions on foreign investment in Iran's energy sector (Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, ILSA). In keeping with a 1997 policy shift toward engagement, the Clinton Administration and Congress later eased sanctions to allow U.S. exports to Iran of food and medical supplies and importation from Iran of goods such as carpets and caviar. The United States has consistently worked with its allies to prevent arms and advanced technology sales to Iran and to limit Iran's influence over regional energy flows. U.S. purchases of Iranian crude oil and U.S. company investments in Iran remain barred. ILSA was renewed for another 5 years on August 3, 2001 (H.R. 1954, P.L. 107-24).  While continuing previous U.S. Administrations' policies of containing Iran while pursuing limited engagement with it, the the Bush Administration is evaluating whether or not to move more toward a regime change policy, and how to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapons capability. During the late 1990s, signs of moderation in Iran had stimulated the United States to try to engage Iran in broad, official talks. Relations took another downturn when Iran was grouped with North Korea and Iraq as part of the ""axis of evil"" identified in President Bush's January 29, 2002 State of the Union message. The grouping came despite Iran's tacit cooperation with the United States against the Taliban in the post-September 11, 2001 war in Afghanistan. Iran was also quietly helpful in the U.S. effort to oust Iraq's Saddam Hussein in 2003, although Iran reportedly is supporting Shiite Islamic factions there that could greatly boost Iran's influence in post-war Iraq. Some Al Qaeda activists are in Iran as well, although Iran claims some are ""in custody."" The Bush Administration has warned Iran not to meddle in Iraq, to extradite any Al Qaeda in Iran, and to curb its nuclear program. The Bush Administration has sought to dampen speculation that the United States might take major military action against Iran to change its regime, but it has indicated support for demonstrators and others in Iran who call for major internal changes. Iran's efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction and delivery means, coupled with its support of terrorist groups, have long been key U.S. concerns. The concerns have been heightened recently by reported major strides in Iran's nuclear program.  Congressional Research Service  ~ The Library of Congress   IB93033  07-25-03  M  OST  RECENT DEVELOP  MENTS  A visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency to the newly revealed Natanz facility on February 21 found that the facility contained a more advanced uranium enrichment program than was expected. A June 6, 2003 IAEA report strongly criticized Iran for lack of candor on its nuclear program, and President Bush said on June 18 that the United States would ""not tolerate"" construction of an Iranian nuclear weapon. During June 6 - 18, students in Tehran and other major cities demonstrated for major political reform. On July 23, 2003, Iranian officials said they are holding at least one senior Al Qaeda figure.  BACKGROUND  AND  ANAL  YSIS  The debate over U.S. policy toward Iran centers on a number of options for changing Iran's regime or modify its behavior; curbing its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs; and limiting or end its support for terrorist groups. Options include engagement, additional U.S. or international sanctions, military action, and supporting opposition forces.  Regime Power Struggle and the Opposition The United States does not have a declared policy of changing Iran's regime, although adopting such a stance reportedly is under consideration by the Bush Administration. Some who favor a regime change policy point to a growing movement by pro-reform elements against the more conservative clerics that dominate Iran's top leadership. Since February 2002, DCI George Tenet has been saying that Iran's reform movement is ""losing momentum"" to the ""unelected"" hardliners, including Supreme Leader Ali Khamene'i (successor to Ayatollah Khomeini) who controls key institutions such as the Council of Guardians and the military. Since mid-2002, the elected reformist President Mohammad Khatemi has become more vocal in criticizing obstructions by hardliners, and in late August 2002, he proposed new legislation that would strengthen the power of his office; it was passed by the Majlis but has not yet been approved by the conservative-dominated legislative review body called the Council of Guardians. Since early 2000, hardliners in the judiciary have closed more than 60 reformist newspapers and imprisoned or questioned several editors and even some members of the Majlis. Khatemi suffered a political setback in February 28, 2003, local elections, with hardliners winning most of the seats in Tehran in a low turnout (14% in Tehran) election that suggested reformist disillusionment at the slow pace of reform thus far. Khatemi, who was re-elected on June 8, 2001 by a landslide 77% of the vote against nine more conservative candidates, remains popular, by most accounts. His reelection victory was larger than his 69% first win in May 1997. His supporters have held about 70% of the seats in the 290-seat Majlis (parliament) since their victory in the February 18, 2000 Majlis elections. Indications of popular dissatisfaction re-surfaced on June 12, 2003, with student-led protests in major cities, lasting about six days, calling for major reforms, including limitations on the powers of the Supreme Leader. Some protesters called for Khatami to resign for being ineffective in promoting reform. President Bush issued statements in CRS-1   IB93033  07-25-03  support of the demonstrators, although Secretary of State Powell said the protests represented a ""family fight"" within Iran in which the United States should not seek a role. Press reports say as many as four students might have been killed by regime security forces during the days of protest. Exiled Oppositionists. Others believe that the United States should support exiled opposition groups, which seek outright replacement rather than reform of the current regime. No exile group is currently funded by the United States. In 1995, the Clinton Administration accepted a House-Senate conference agreement to include $18-$20 million in funding authority for covert operations against Iran in the FY1996 intelligence authorization act (H.R. 1655, P.L. 104-93) -- about $14 million more than requested -- according to a Washington Post report of December 22, 1995. The Clinton Administration reportedly focused the covert aid on changing the regime's behavior, rather than its overthrow. The conference report on H.R. 2267 (H.Rept. 105-405), the FY1998 Commerce/State/ Justice appropriation, provided $4 million for a ""Radio Free Iran,"" to be run by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). The radio, which the Administration called the Farsi service of RFE/RL, began operations in Prague on October 31, 1998, and has become, as of December 2002, Radio Farda (""Tomorrow"" in Farsi), which broadcasts nearly around the clock. Another $4 million for the radio for FY1999 was provided by the omnibus appropriation (P.L. 105-277). Another U.S.-sponsored television broadcast service to Iran, under the auspices of the Voice of America, began operations on July 3, 2003. Since the late 1980s, the State Department has refused contact with the anti-regime People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI) and its umbrella organization, the National Council of Resistance (NCR). It was designated as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO) in October 1997 under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, and the NCR was named as an alias of the PMOI in the October 1999 re-designations. In November 2002, a letter signed by about 150 House Members was released, asking the President to remove the PMOI from the FTO list. U.S. forces attacked PMOI military installations in Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom and, after temporarily agreeing to a ceasefire with PMOI military elements in Iraq, subsequently demanded their surrender and disarmament. Press reports in late May 2003 say some Administration officials, particularly in the Defense Department, want the group removed from the FTO list and a U.S. alliance with the group against the Tehran regime. On June 17, 2003 France arrested about 170 PMOI members, including its co-leader Maryam Rajavi (wife of PMOI founder Masoud Rajavi, who is based in Iraq.) She was subsequently released. For further information, see CRS Report RL31119, Terrorism: Near Eastern Groups and State Sponsors, 2002. Some Iranian exiles follow the son of the late former Shah, who lives in the United States. On January 24, 2001, the Shah's son, Reza Pahlavi, 44 years old, ended a long period of inactivity by giving a speech in Washington calling for unity in opposition to the current regime and for the institution of a constitutional monarchy and genuine democracy in Iran. He has since broadcast messages into Iran from stations in California, and press reports say a growing number of Iranians are listening to his broadcasts, although he is not believed to have a major following in Iran.  CRS-2   IB93033  07-25-03  Iran's Strategic Capabilities Fo the past two decades, the United States has sought to contain the strategic threat posed by Iran's WMD programs and its support of terrorist groups. Iran is not considered a major conventional threat to the United States, but some of its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, are making significant progress and could put U.S. allies and forces at risk.  Conventional Weapons Iran's armed forces total about 550,000 personnel, including both the regular military and the Revolutionary Guard, the latter of which is loyal to the hardliners. According to U.S. military officials, Iran's forces could block the Strait of Hormuz at least temporarily, but Iran is largely lacking in ability to project power far beyond its borders.  Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) It is partly because of Iran's attempts to acquire WMD that January 29, 2002 State of the Union message, labeled Iran part of with Iraq and North Korea. Iran's programs continue to be assisted Russia, China, and North Korea. For further information, see CRS Arms and Weapons of Mass Destruction Suppliers. President Bush, in his an ""axis of evil"" along primarily by entities in Report RL30551, Iran:  Nuclear Program. U.S. and European concerns are growing about the scope of Iran's nuclear program, despite Iran's occasional voluntary revelations about its facilities. On June 18, 2003, President Bush stated that the United States would ""not tolerate construction"" of a nuclear weapon by Iran. In response to allegations by Iran's exiled opposition, Iran acknowledged in December 2002 that it is building two additional facilities, at Arak and Natanz, that could be used to produce fissile material for a nuclear weapon. Natanz could produce enriched uranium by 2005, and the Arak facility reportedly is a heavy water reactor that could be used to produce plutonium. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) director Mohammad Baradei visited the Natanz site on February 21, 2003, and his report of June 6, 2003, formally discussed by the IAEA on June 18, 2003, was highly critical of Iran, citing that Natanz was an advanced uranium enrichment facility and that Iran had hidden other aspects of its nuclear program, such as importation of uranium. The report stopped short of declaring Iran in violation of the NPT. The Bush Administration has asserted that it believes Iran is working toward a nuclear weapons capability and that it is in violation of its obligations under the 1968 Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT), questioning Iran's assertion that the sites are for electricity generation purposes only. The revelations mean Iran might produce a nuclear weapon ""toward the end of the decade,"" somewhat sooner than the ""end of the decade"" previously stated. Despite the stepped up international attention and European and other support for the U.S. position, Iran is still refusing the IAEA's urging that it sign the ""Additional Protocol"" to the NPT, which would allow no-notice inspections, but it has pledged to inform the IAEA in advance of constructing any new nuclear facilities. Russia, according to some observers, has suspended work, under a January 1995 contract with Iran, to complete a nuclear power plant at Bushehr. The plant is to be operational by the end of 2003. Russia says that it has CRS-3   IB93033  07-25-03  reached agreement with Iran to supply fuel for the reactor for ten years and for Russia to reprocess the plant's spent nuclear material, but the new revelations have apparently made Russia more skeptical of Iran's promises. Some press reports indicate that military action against Iran's nuclear facilities might be considered if diplomacy fails to halt Iran's suspected nuclear weapons program. Chemical and Biological Weapons. Official U.S. reports state that Iran is seeking a self-sufficient chemical weapons infrastructure, mainly from Chinese sources, and that it has stockpiled chemical weapons, including blister, blood, and choking agents. This raises questions about Iran's compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which Iran signed on January 13, 1993, and ratified on June 8, 1997. The reports say Iran may have some capability to produce biological agents, but that its ability to weaponize them is limited. Missiles. Largely with Russian help, Iran is making progress in its missile program. Two of its first three tests of the 800-mile range Shahab-3 (July 1998, July 2000, and September 2000) were inconclusive or unsuccessful (the July 2000 test appears to have been a success), but Iran conducted an apparently successful series of final tests in June 2003, subsequently calling the missile operational and formally delivering five of them to the Revolutionary Guard. Iran is also trying to make a 1,200 mile range Shahab-4, but U.S. officials told journalists in late October 2002 that an Iranian test of an extended-range Shahab had failed. In March 2002, an intelligence community official upgraded the missile threat from Iran, testifying that the United States would ""most likely"" face an intercontinental ballistic missile threat from Iran by 2015. On September 6, 2002, Iran said it successfully tested a 200 mile range ""Fateh 110"" missile, and Iran said in late September 2002 that it has begun production of the missile. (For more information, see CRS Report RS21548, Iran's Ballistic Missile Capabilities.)  Iranian Foreign Policy and Involvement in Terrorism Iran's support for terrorist groups has long concerned U.S. Administrations, particularly by giving Tehran an opportunity to try to obstruct the U.S.-led Middle East peace process. Iran's continued support for terrorism contributed to President Bush's strong criticism of Iran in his 2002 State of the Union message. The State Department report on international terrorism for 2002, released April 30, 2003, again stated, as it has for most of the past decade, that Iran ""remained the most active state sponsor of terrorism in 2002,"" although the report attributes the terrorist activity to two hardline institutions: the Revolutionary Guard and the Intelligence Ministry. (See also CRS Report RL31119, Terrorism: Near Eastern Groups and State Sponsors, 2002.)  Persian Gulf Khatemi has largely succeeded in improving relations with Iran's neighbors, particularly the six states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC; Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates). Since he came into office, Iran has reduced support for Shiite Muslim dissident movements in the Gulf states. See also CRS Report RL31533, Persian Gulf States: Post-War Issues for U.S. Policy, 2003. CRS-4   IB93033  07-25-03  Saudi Arabia/Khobar Towers. Iran and Saudi Arabia restored relations in December 1991 (after a 4 year break), and progressively higher level contacts have taken place since December 1997. In May 1999, Khatemi became the first senior Iranian leader to visit Saudi Arabia since the Islamic revolution; he visited again on September 11, 2002. Supreme Leader Khamene'i has been invited to visit the Kingdom as well but has not done so. The exchanges suggest that Saudi Arabia has tried to move beyond the issue of the June 25, 1996 Khobar Towers housing complex bombing, which killed 19 U.S. airmen, and was believed orchestrated by Iranian agents. On June 21, 2001, a federal grand jury indicted 14 suspects, 13 Saudis and a Lebanese citizen, for that bombing. The indictment indicated that Iranian agents were likely involved, but no indictments of any Iranians were announced. In June 2002, Saudi Arabia reportedly sentenced some of the eleven Saudi suspects held there. (See CRS Issue Brief IB93113, Saudi Arabia: Postwar Issues and U.S. Relations.) Gulf Islands Dispute With UAE. Relations between Iran and the UAE have been strained since April 1992, when Iran asserted complete control of the Persian Gulf island of Abu Musa, which it and the UAE shared under a 1971 bilateral agreement. (In 1971, Iran, then ruled by the U.S.-backed Shah, completely seized two other islands, Greater and Lesser Tunb, from the emirate of Ras al-Khaymah, and it seized part of Abu Musa that year from the emirate of Sharjah.) The UAE wants to refer the dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), but Iran insists on resolving the issue bilaterally. Several GCC states have attempted to mediate and Iran-UAE tensions have eased, but Iran insists that it has sovereignty over the islands. The United States, which is concerned about Iran's military control over the islands, supports UAE proposals but takes no position on sovereignty. Iraq. Senior U.S. officials have, on several occasions since the fall of Saddam Hussein on April 9, 2003, warned Iran not to interfere in post-war Iraq to try to establish a proIranian Islamic republic there. Iran has ties to several Shiite Islamic groups that are gaining influence over southern Iraq, despite lingering suspicion between Iran and Iraq, a legacy of the 8-year long Iran-Iraq war (September 1980 - August 1988). Iran had publicly opposed a major U.S. military offensive against Iraq because it was not authorized by the United Nations, but it tacitly backed the war in the hope that Saddam's overthrow would put Tehran's proteges in power there. Tehran has long supported Shiite militants in southern Iraq, particularly the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI) and the Da'wa (Islamic Call) party. SCIRI is headed by Ayatollah Mohammad Baqr al-Hakim, the late Ayatollah Khomeini's choice to head an Islamic republic in Iraq, who returned to Iraq on May 10, 2003. In the political vacuum left by the ousting of the Baath regime of Iraq, these and similar parties have seized control over many of the towns and cities of southern Iraq. SCIRI loyalists from its armed wing are called the ""Badr Corps."" Iran denies that it is ""meddling"" in Iraq's affairs, saying that longtime Iraqi activists have returned to Iran to participate in the politics of postSaddam Iraq. (For more information on Shiite and other contender for power in Iraq, see CRS Report RL31339, Iraq: U.S. Regime Change Efforts and Post-War Governance.) Over the past five years, Saddam Hussein had sought to improve relations with Iran to reduce Iraq's regional isolation. Since early 1998, Iran and Iraq exchanged almost all remaining prisoners from the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. An October 2000 visit to Iraq by Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi resulted in agreement to abide by the waterwaysharing and other provisions of their 1975 Algiers Accords, which Iraq had abrogated prior CRS-5   IB93033  07-25-03  to its September 1980 invasion of Iran. In exchange for a share of the proceeds, Iran's naval forces sometimes cooperated with Iraq's illicit export of oil through the Gulf.  Middle East/North Africa Many of the U.S. concerns about Iran's support for terrorism center on its assistance to groups opposed to the Arab-Israeli peace process, primarily Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Hizballah, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. U.S. terrorism reports state that, following the start of the September 2000 Palestinian uprising, Iran increased its support for terrorism by encouraging coordination among Palestinian terrorist groups. Iran also incites anti-Israel violence, including hosting conferences of anti-peace process organizations (April 24, 2001, and June 2-3, 2002). Khamene'i has continued to call Israel a ""cancerous tumor"" and make other statements suggesting that he seeks Israel's destruction. Khatemi, while publicly pledging support for the anti-peace process groups, has sometimes tried to moderate Iran's position somewhat. On October 15, 2002, the Iranian Foreign Ministry said Iran would not seek to block any final, two-state Israeli-Palestinian settlement. It was viewed as a new development when Israel and the United States asserted in early January 2002 that Iran was the source of a shipment, intercepted by Israel, of 50 tons of arms bought by the Palestinian Authority (PA). Iran has traditionally had few ties to the non-Islamist Palestinian organizations, including elements linked to the PA, that have conducted some of the day-to-day violence against Israel in the current uprising. Lebanon/Hizballah. About 150 Iranian Revolutionary Guards remain in Lebanon to coordinate Iranian arms deliveries to Hizballah, which are offloaded in Damascus and trucked into Lebanon. The shipments have included Stingers obtained by Iran in Afghanistan, mortars that can reach the Israeli city of Haifa if fired from southern Lebanon, and, in 2002, over 8,000 Katyusha rockets, according to press reports. In mid-April 2002, Foreign Minister Kharrazi visited Lebanon and urged Hizballah to exercise restraint on the Israeli-Lebanese border at a time of heightened tensions between Israel and the Palestinians. Hizballah is believed to take cues from harder line Iranian elements. In mid May 2003, Khatemi made the first top level Iranian visit to Lebanon since the 1979 revolution. On March 11, an Argentinian judge issued arrest warrants for four Iranian diplomats, including former Intelligence Minister Ali Fallahian, for alleged complicity in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, which killed 85. Hizballah is believed to have committed the act, as well as the 1992 bombing of Israel's embassy in that city.  Central and South Asia/Azerbaijan Iran's policy in Central Asia has thus far emphasized economic cooperation over Islamic ideology. Iran has become increasingly assertive in its relations with Azerbaijan, even though its population, like Iran, adheres to Shiite Islam. In early 1992, Iran led the drive to bring the Central Asian states and Azerbaijan into the Economic Cooperation Organization (founded in 1985 by Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey, as a successor to an organization founded by those states in 1964). Iran is hoping to attract energy pipeline routes through it, rather than through other countries. However, Iran does host at least one antiAzerbaijan guerrilla leader (Hasan Javadov), and it allegedly harbors leaders of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), including founder Tahir Yuldashev.  CRS-6   IB93033  07-25-03  Tensions with Azerbaijan flared in late July 2001 over energy exploration rights in the Caspian; Iranian warships and combat aircraft threatened a British Petroleum (BP) ship on contract to Azerbaijan out of an area of the Caspian Iran considers its own. The United States called that action provocative, and it offered new border security aid and increased political support to Azerbaijan. Iran and Armenia, an adversary of Azerbaijan, agreed on expanded defense cooperation in early March 2002. Iran-Azerbaijan tensions eased somewhat in conjunction with the mid-May 2002 visit of Azerbaijan's President Heydar Aliyev to Iran, although there was little evident progress on a bilateral division of their portions of the Caspian. Al Qaeda/Afghanistan/Pakistan. Iran long opposed the puritanical Sunni Muslim regime of the Taliban in Afghanistan on the grounds that it oppressed Shiite Muslim and other Persian-speaking minorities. Iran nearly launched a military attack against the Taliban in September 1998 after Taliban fighters captured and killed several Iranian diplomats based in northern Afghanistan, and it provided military aid to the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance coalition, made up of mostly Persian-speaking minority groups. Iran -- along with the United States, Russia, and the countries bordering Afghanistan -- attended U.N.-sponsored meetings in New York (the Six Plus Two group) to try to end the internal conflict in Afghanistan. Iran and the United States also participated in a U.N.-sponsored group in Geneva, which includes Italy and Germany. Iran tacitly supported the U.S.-led war on the Taliban and Al Qaeda, but some of Iran's subsequent activities in Afghanistan reflect official suspicion of the United States and the influence of hardliners in Iran's regime. Iran is said to fear the pro-U.S. tilt of the new government of Afghanistan and it is moving to restore Iran's traditional sway in western, central, and northern Afghanistan where Persian-speaking Afghans predominate. There have been press reports and U.S. official statements since in January 2002 that hardliners in Iran are harboring, or at least not aggressively moving to arrest, senior Al Qaeda operatives who have fled Afghanistan. U.S. charges on this issue were renewed after the May 12, 2003 bombings in Riyadh, believed conducted by Al Qaeda, against four expatriate housing complexes. Following the U.S. criticism, Iran said it had arrested several low-level Al Qaeda activists and reiterated its position that Iran has long been an enemy of Al Qaeda and the Taliban. On July 23, 2003, Iranian officials, for the first time, asserted Iran had ""in custody"" senior Al Qaeda figures, purported to include Al Qaeda spokesman Sulayman Abu Ghaith or top operative Sayf Al Adl. U.S. officials say they are not certain that Iran is actually holding the Al Qaeda figures or is willing to turn them over to their countries of origin. Other reports say Iran is arming local Afghan strongmen including Herat governor Ismail Khan, Mazar-e-Sharif governor Abdul Rashid Dostam, and others, and President Bush has warned Iran not to seek to exert influence over the new government of Afghanistan. Apparently seeking to deflect the U.S. criticism, in March 2002 Iran reportedly expelled exiled Pashtun figure Gulbuddin Hikmatyar, an opponent of the new Afghan government. The expulsion followed a February 24, 2002, visit to Iran by Afghan leader Hamid Karzai; the two countries agreed to broad cooperation. (See CRS Report RL30588, Afghanistan: Current Issues and U.S. Policy Concerns.)  CRS-7   IB93033  07-25-03  Human Rights Concerns Iran's human rights practices have been a source of concern to recent U.S. Administrations, although U.S. policy has not generally considered Iran's human rights record as a strategic threat to U.S. interests or an obstacle to the beginning of a U.S.-Iran dialogue. U.S. and U.N. human rights reports cite Iran for widespread human rights abuses (especially of the Baha'i faith), including assassinations and executions of regime opponents (Kurds, People's Mojahedin, and others) in Iran and abroad. These reports note that Khatemi's efforts to promote rule of law have met repeated challenges from hardliners, and the U.S. State Department report for 2002, released in March 2003, said Iran's human rights situation had deteriorated further in the past year. On July 24, Canada withdrew its Ambassador from Iran in response to the apparent beating death while in Iranian detention of a Canadian journalist of Iranian origin, Zahra Kazemi. She had been detained in early July 2003 for filming outside Tehran's Evin prison. In April 2002, the U.N. Human Rights Commission narrowly voted not to investigate Iran's human rights record during 2002-2003. On January 30, 2003, Iran released the 80-year-old Ayatollah Montazeri, from house arrest; Montazeri was Khomeini's designated successor until being dismissed by Khomeini in 1989, and he has emerged as a critic of the current leadership. In the 108th Congress, resolutions (S.Res. 82 and H.Res. 140) were introduced on March 12, 2003, expressing concern over Iran's human rights record, particularly its treatment of women. Religious Persecution. In October 2001, the State Department again named Iran as a ""Country of Particular Concern,"" under the International Religious Freedom Act, and little progress in Iran's performance on this issue was noted in the October 2002 religious freedom report. No sanctions were added, on the grounds that Iran is already subject to extensive U.S. sanctions. Religious persecution continues, especially against the Baha'i community, because Iran's Shiite Muslim clergy views the sect as heretical. Two Baha'is (Dhabihullah Mahrami and Musa Talibi) were sentenced to death in 1996 for apostasy. On July 21, 1998, Iran executed Ruhollah Ruhani, the first Bahai executed since 1992 (Bahman Samandari). The United States condemned the execution. In February 2000, Iran's Supreme Court set aside the death sentences against three other Bahais. On April 21, 1999, the Clinton Administration expressed concern about the sentencing to prison of four Baha'is. Recent resolutions condemning Iran's treatment of the Baha'is, including S.Con.Res. 57, which passed the Senate July 19, 2000, and H.Con.Res. 257, which passed the House on September 19, 2000. Trial of 13 Jews. Although the 30,000 member Jewish community (the largest in the Middle East aside from Israel) enjoys more freedoms than Jewish communities in several other Muslim states, during 1993-1998 Iran executed five Jews allegedly spying for Israel. In June 1999, Iran arrested 13 Jews -- teachers, shopkeepers, and butchers -- from the Shiraz area that it said were part of an ""espionage ring"" for Israel. After an April - June 2000 trial, ten of the Jews and two Muslims accomplices were convicted (July 1, 2000) and received sentences ranging from 4 years to 13 years. Three Jews were acquitted. On September 21, 2000, a three-judge appeals panel reduced the sentences slightly, now ranging from 2 to 9 years. On February 8, 2001, Iran's Supreme Court let the revised sentences stand. In March 2001, Iran released one of the Jews on the grounds that his sentence included time served; another was released on January 16, 2002; and three more were given early release in October 2002. Iran said on April 24, 2003, that the remaining five had been released. Several bills in the 106th Congress called for the release of the detainees and for CRS-8   IB93033  07-25-03  linking U.S. relations with Iran to the trial's outcome; the Senate passed S.Con.Res. 39 (June 23, 1999) and S.Con.Res. 109 (May 4, 2000). In April 2001, a similar bill, H.Con.Res. 29, was introduced in the 107th Congress.  U.S.-Iran Relations and Sanctions The February 11, 1979 fall of the Shah of Iran, a key U.S. ally, opened a long rift in U.S.-Iranian relations, but there have been periods over the past five years in which a significant thawing appeared imminent. On November 4, 1979, radical ""students"" seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held its diplomats hostage until minutes after President Reagan's inauguration on January 20, 1981. The United States broke relations with Iran on April 7, 1980, and the two countries have had only limited official dialogue since. An exception was the abortive 1985-86 clandestine arms supply relationship with Iran in exchange for some American hostages held by Hizballah in Lebanon (the so-called ""Iran-Contra Affair""). Iran maintains an interests section in Washington (Embassy of Pakistan), staffed by Iranian permanent resident aliens or U.S. citizens of Iranian descent. The U.S. protecting power in Iran is Switzerland. Upon taking office in 1993, the Clinton Administration moved to further isolate Iran as part of a strategy of ""dual containment"" of Iran and Iraq. In 1995 and 1996, the Clinton Administration and Congress added sanctions on Iran in response to growing concerns about Iran's weapons of mass destruction, its support for terrorist groups, and its efforts to subvert the Arab-Israeli peace process. The election of Khatemi in May 1997 precipitated a shift in U.S. policy toward engagement; the Clinton Administration offered Iran official dialogue, with no substantive preconditions. In January 1998, Khatemi publicly agreed to increase ""people-to-people"" exchanges with the United States but ruled out direct talks. In a June 1998 speech, then Secretary of State Albright stepped up the U.S. outreach effort by calling for mutual confidence building measures that could lead to a ""road map"" for normalization of relations. Encouraged by the reformist victory in Iran's March 2000 parliamentary elections, Secretary Albright gave another speech on March 17, 2000, acknowledging past U.S. meddling in Iran, easing sanctions on some Iranian imports, and promising to work to resolve outstanding claims disputes. Iran called the steps insufficient to warrant direct dialogue. In September 2000 meetings at the United Nations in connection with the Millennium Summit, Albright and President Clinton sent a positive signal to Iran by attending Khatemi's speeches. Until early 2002, the Bush Administration appeared to be continuing the Clinton Administration efforts, in part by building on the cooperation between the two countries in Afghanistan. The Administration's November 13, 2001 continuation of the 1979 national emergency on Iran said that U.S. ""relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal,"" a far softer statement than previous justifications sighting a continued threat from Iran. In October 2001, several Members of Congress had dinner in the Senate with Iran's U.N. representative. Relations worsened again in January 2002 over allegations of Iran's sale of arms to the Palestinian Authority and reputed meddling in Afghanistan, and President Bush named Iran as part of an ""axis of evil"" in his January 2002 State of the Union message. On July 12, 2002, President Bush issued a statement supporting those Iranians demonstrating for reform CRS-9   IB93033  07-25-03  and democracy, a message he reiterated on December 20, 2002 when he inaugurated a new U.S. broadcast to Iran, Radio Farda (""Tomorrow"" in Farsi). The statements signaled a shift in U.S. policy from attempting to engage and support Khatemi to publicly supporting Iranian reformers and activists, possibly a step toward a regime change policy for Iran. This apparent shift, based on the conclusion that engaging Khatemi would not produce more moderate Iranian policies on key issues, has been mirrored in Congress. Two resolutions introduced in late July 2002 (S.Res. 306 and H.Res. 504) called for positive U.S. gestures toward ""the people of Iran, and not political figures whose survival depends upon preservation of the current regime."" A Senate bill, S. 1082, introduced May 19, 2003 by Senator Sam Brownback, is widely interpreted as urging support for the Shah's son (see above) by calling for the use of some U.S. funds for broadcasting and democratization in the Middle East to be used to promote the Shah's son's ideas for the holding of an internationally-monitored democratic referendum in Iran. A House bill (H.R. 2466) contains similar provisions and adds a section reimposing import sanctions on luxury goods from Iran. The sentiments of some of these bills were incorporated into provisions of the House version of the FY2004 foreign relations authorization bill (H.R. 1950), particularly sections calling on the Administration to try to block international lending to Iran (see also below). Despite the apparent policy shift, in May 2003 both countries acknowledged that they were conducting direct talks in Geneva on Afghanistan and Iraq. This marked the first confirmed direct dialogue. However, Iran said the talks did not indicate that the two countries were on the verge of restoring diplomatic relations. The United States broke off the channel, at least temporarily, following the May 12, 2003, bombing in Riyadh that some press reports say might have been planned by Al Qaeda activists located in Iran. Senior Administration officials reportedly are discussing U.S. policy options, including regime change, military action, the future of the U.S.-Iran dialogue, and the IAEA assessment of Iran's nuclear program on May 29, 2003, but the outcome of the deliberations, if any, has not been announced. Possibility of Military Action. The aftermath of the U.S.-led war on Iraq, coupled with heightened U.S. concerns about Iran's WMD programs and links to terrorism, has led to speculation that Iran might be a future target of U.S. military action. President Bush reportedly told leaders at the June 2003 G-8 summit of industrialized countries that the United States is not contemplating major military action against Iran at this time. However, experts say that the Administration is considering a number of options, most of which are diplomatic but some of which might include certain military actions such as airstrikes, to end or slow Iran's suspected nuclear weapons program. U.S. military officials note that U.S. forces in the Gulf region could potentially be used against Iran, if the President so decides. No military tensions are currently evident, and U.S. military officers note that their encounters with Iranian naval vessels in the Gulf have been more professional since Khatemi took office.  Economic Sanctions Since the November 4, 1979 seizure of the U.S. hostages in Tehran, economic sanctions have formed a major part of U.S. policy toward Iran. On November 14, 1979, President Carter declared a national emergency with respect to Iran, renewed every year since 1979. CRS-10   IB93033  07-25-03  Terrorism/Foreign Aid. Following the October 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Lebanon, believed perpetrated by Hizballah, Iran was added to the ""terrorism list"" in January 1984. The designation bans direct U.S. financial assistance and arms sales, restricts sales of U.S. dual use items, and requires the United States to oppose multilateral lending to the designated countries. Separate from its position on the terrorism list, successive foreign aid appropriations laws since the late 1980s ban direct assistance to Iran (loans, credits, insurance, Eximbank credits) and indirect assistance (U.S. contributions to international organizations that work in Iran). Section 307 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (added in 1985) names Iran as unable to benefit from U.S. contributions to international organizations, requiring proportionate cuts if these institutions work in Iran. Iran also has been designated every year since 1997 as not cooperating with U.S. anti-terrorism efforts, under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (P.L. 104-132). That Act penalizes countries that assist or sell arms to terrorism list countries. U.S. regulations do not bar disaster relief and the United States donated $125,000, through relief agencies, to help victims of two earthquakes in Iran (February and May 1997), and another $350,000 worth of aid to the victims of a June 22, 2002 earthquake. Proliferation Sanctions. Several sanctions laws are unique to Iran. The Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act (P.L. 102-484) requires denial of license applications for exports to Iran of dual use items, and imposes sanctions on foreign countries that transfer to Iran ""destabilizing numbers and types of conventional weapons,"" as well as WMD technology. The Iran Nonproliferation Act (P.L. 106-178) authorizes sanctions on foreign entities that assist Iran's WMD programs. It bans U.S. extraordinary payments to the Russian Aviation and Space Agency in connection with the international space station unless the President can certify that the agency or entities under the Agency's control had not transferred any WMD or missile-related technology to Iran within the year prior. The provision contains certain exceptions to ensure the safety of astronauts who will use the space station and for certain space station hardware. During 2001 - 2003, a number of entities in North Korea, China, India, Armenia, and Moldova were sanctioned under the Iran Nonproliferation Act, the IranIraq Arms Nonproliferation Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-484), and another law, the Chemical and Biological Warfare Elimination Act of 1991, for sales to Iran. In late May 2003, the Bush Administration sanctioned a major Chinese industrial entity, Norinco, for allegedly selling missile technology to Iran. On July 4, 2003, an additional Chinese entity, the Taian Foreign Trade General Corporation, was sanctioned under the Iran Nonproliferation Act. Counternarcotics. In February 1987, Iran was first designated as a state that failed to cooperate with U.S. anti-drug efforts or take adequate steps to control narcotics production or trafficking. U.S. and U.N. Drug Control Program (UNDCP) assessments of drug production in Iran prompted the Clinton Administration, on December 7, 1998, to remove Iran from the U.S. list of major drug producing countries. The decision exempts Iran from the annual certification process that kept drug-related U.S. sanctions in place on Iran. Trade Ban. On May 6, 1995, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12959 banning U.S. trade and investment in Iran, including the trading of Iranian oil overseas by U.S. companies. This followed an earlier March 1995 executive order barring U.S. investment in Iran's energy sector. The trade ban was partly intended to blunt criticism that U.S. trade with Iran made U.S. appeals for multilateral containment of Iran less credible. Each March since 1995, most recently on March 13, 2003, the U.S. Administration has renewed a declaration of a state of emergency that triggered the March 1995 investment ban. CRS-11   IB93033  07-25-03  An August 1997 amendment to the trade ban (Executive Order 13059) prevented U.S. companies from knowingly exporting goods to a third country for incorporation into products destined for Iran. Some goods related to the safe operation of civilian aircraft can be licensed for export to Iran, and in December 1999, the Clinton Administration allowed the repair of engine mountings on seven Iran Air 747s (Boeing). Implementing regulations do not permit U.S. firms to negotiate investment deals with Iran. Following a 1998 application by a U.S. firm to sell Iran agricultural products, and in the context of Clinton Administration and congressional reviews of U.S. unilateral sanctions policies, the Clinton Administration announced in April 1999 that it would license, on a case-by-case basis, commercial sales of food and medical products to certain countries on which unilateral U.S. trade bans are in place (Iran, Libya, and Sudan). Under regulations issued in July 1999, private letters of credit can be used to finance approved sales, but no U.S. government credit guarantees are available and U.S. exporters are not permitted to deal directly with Iranian banks. Iran says the lack of credit makes U.S. sales, particularly of wheat, uncompetitive. The FY2001 agriculture appropriations (P.L. 106-387), contained a provision banning the use of official credit guarantees for food and medical sales to Iran and other countries on the U.S. terrorism list, except Cuba, although allowing for a presidential waiver to permit such credit guarantees. Neither the Clinton Administration nor the Bush Administration has provided the credit guarantees. In the March 2000 speech mentioned above, the trade ban was eased to allow U.S. importation of Iranian nuts, dried fruits, carpets, and caviar; regulations governing the imports were issued in April 2000. The United States was the largest market for Iranian carpets before the 1979 revolution, but U.S. anti-dumping tariffs imposed on Iranian pistachio nut imports in 1986 (over 300%) dampened imports of that product. In January 2003, the tariff on roasted pistachios was lowered to 22% and on raw pistachios to 163%. The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA). The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA, H.R. 3107, P.L. 104-172, signed August 5, 1996) is a law that sanctions foreign investment in Iran or Libya's energy sector. It was to sunset on August 5, 2001, but it was renewed for another five years (H.R. 1954, P.L. 107-24, signed August 3, 2001). The renewal law requires an Administration report on its effectiveness within 24-30 months (as early as August 2003). No sanctions have been imposed under ILSA, although three companies involved in one project (South Pars) were deemed in violation in September 1998; sanctions were waived. A number of other investments have remained ""under review"" for ILSA sanctions since 1999. In October 2002, Norway's Statoil agreed to invest $300 million to develop phases six, seven, and eight of the South Pars gas field. As noted below (Japan section), a deal to develop the Azadegan field ($2 billion investment) is expected, as is the outcome of a competition between BP and Totalfina Elf to develop the Bangestan field (also about $2 billion). Foreign firms have invested about $15 billion in Iran's energy sector since Iran opened it to investment. See CRS Report RS20871, The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA). Caspian/Central Asian Energy Routes Through Iran. The U.S. trade ban permits U.S. companies to apply for licenses to conduct ""swaps"" of Caspian Sea oil with Iran, but, as part of a U.S. policy to route Central Asian energy around Iran (and Russia), a Mobil Corporation application to do so was denied in April 1999. The Bush Administration continues to oppose, and to threaten imposing ILSA sanctions on, pipeline projects through Iran. U.S. policy has been to promote construction of a pipeline that would cross the Caspian CRS-12   IB93033  07-25-03  Sea and let out in Ceyhan, Turkey (Baku-Ceyhan pipeline); the policy appeared to bear fruit when four Caspian nations (Turkey, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan) signed an agreement embracing Baku-Ceyhan on November 18, 1999. Regional and corporate support for the project subsequently gained momentum and the early stages of pipeline construction have begun. Despite U.S. pressure not to import Iranian gas, in December 2001 Turkey began doing so through a new cross-border pipeline, under an August 1996 agreement. Europe and Japan's Relations With/Lending to Iran. U.S.-allied differences on Iran narrowed in the late 1990s in concert with the Clinton Administration's attempt to engage Iran, a policy consistently favored by the European countries as a way to moderate Iran's behavior. During 1992-1997, the European Union (EU) countries maintained a policy of ""critical dialogue"" with Iran. The United States did not oppose those talks but maintained that the EU's dialogue would not change Iranian behavior. The dialogue was suspended immediately following the April 1997 German terrorism trial (""Mykonos trial"") that found high-level Iranian involvement in assassinating Iranian dissidents in Germany. Alongside the post-1997 U.S. shift toward engagement, the EU-Iran dialogue formally resumed in May 1998. Since then, Khatemi has undertaken state visits to several Western countries, including Italy (March 1999), France (October 1999), Germany (July 2000), and Japan (November 2000). The United States publicly welcomed these visits. On December 12, 2002, Iran and the EU began formal negotiations on a trade pact that would lower the tariffs or increase quotas for Iranian exports to the EU countries, with some linkage to Iran addressing EU concerns on Iran's human rights practices and terrorism sponsorship. However, recent revelations about Iran's possible nuclear weapons ambitions have caused the EU to become more cautious in approaching Iran; on July 21, 2003, EU foreign ministers warned Iran they would ""review"" relations unless Iran accepted more intrusive IAEA inspections. They also expressed concern about Iran's human rights record. The resolution of the ""Rushdie affair"" to Britain's satisfaction sparked improvement in its relations with Iran. Iran maintains that Ayatollah Khomeini's 1989 death sentence against author Salman Rushdie cannot be revoked (his ""Satanic Verses"" novel was labeled blasphemous) because Khomeini is no longer alive to revoke it. However, on September 24, 1998, Iran's Foreign Minister pledged to Britain that Iran will not seek to implement the sentence and opposes any bounties offered for his death. Britain then upgraded relations with Iran to the ambassadorial level, and Foreign Ministers of the two countries have exchanged several visits. In October 2000, Britain began extending longer term credit (two years or greater) for exports to Iran. Some Iranian clerics (outside the formal government structure) have said the death sentence stands, and the Iranian government has not required the Fifteen Khordad foundation to withdraw its $2.8 million reward for Rushdie's death. Khatemi said on June 4, 2001 that he considers the issue closed. In August 1999, Japan continued a gradual improvement in relations with Iran by announcing a resumption of Japan's official development lending program for Iran to construct a hydroelectric dam over the Karun River. However, the $70 million increment announced was less that Iran had wanted, and Japan said that this tranche would close out Japan's involvement in the project. (In 1993, Japan provided the first $400 million tranche of the overall $1.4 billion official development loan program, but the lending was subsequently placed on hold as the United States sought to persuade its allies to pressure Iran.) In late January 2000, Japan agreed to resume medium- and long-term export credit insurance for exports to Iran, suspended since 1994. Economic relations improved further CRS-13   IB93033  07-25-03  during Khatemi's November 2000 visit to Tokyo, which resulted in Iran's granting Japanese firms the first right to negotiate to develop the large Azadegan field. A $2 billion deal to develop that field was expected by June 30, 2003, but Japan's firms did not reach an agreement by that deadline, partly in protest of Iran's nuclear program, leaving the status of that deal unclear. Partly at U.S. urging, Japan has refused to extend to Iran new official loans. During 1994-1995, and over U.S. objections at the time, Iran's European and Japanese creditors rescheduled about $16 billion in Iranian debt. These countries (governments and private creditors) rescheduled the debt bilaterally, in spite of Paris Club rules that call for multilateral rescheduling and International Monetary Fund (IMF) involvement. Iran has worked its external debt down from $32 billion in 1997 to about $20 billion as of March 2002, according to Iran's Central Bank. The improved debt picture has led most European export credit agencies, including Germany's Hermes, France's COFACE, and that of Spain, to restore insurance cover for exports to Iran. In July 2002, Iran tapped international capital markets for the first time since the Islamic revolution, selling $500 million in bonds to European banks. At the urging of the U.S. government, in May 2002 Moody's stopped its credit ratings service for Iran's government bonds on the grounds that performing the credit ratings service might violate the U.S. trade ban. Multilateral Lending to Iran. Section 1621 of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-132) amended the Foreign Assistance Act to require the United States to vote against international loans to countries on the U.S. terrorism list. Acting under provisions of successive foreign aid laws, in 1993 the United States voted its 16.5% share of the World Bank against loans to Iran of $460 million for electricity, health, and irrigation projects. To signal opposition to international lending to Iran, the FY1994 foreign aid appropriations (P.L. 103-87) cut the Administration's request for the U.S. contribution to the World Bank by the amount of those loans. That law, as well as the foreign aid appropriations for FY1995 (P.L. 103-326) and FY1996 (P.L. 104-107), would have significantly reduced U.S. payments to the Bank if it had provided new loans to Iran. By 1999, Iran's moderating image had led the World Bank to consider new loans. In May 2000, the United States was unsuccessful in obtaining further delay on a vote on new lending for Iran, and its allies outvoted the United States to approve $232 million in loans for health and sewage projects. Twenty one of the Bank's twenty four governors voted in favor, and France and Canada abstained. Earlier, Iran also had asked the International Monetary Fund for about $400 million in loans (its quota is about $2 billion) to help it deal with its trade financing shortfalls. However, Iran balked at accepting IMF conditionality, and there was no agreement. Despite the required U.S. opposition, on May 10, 2001, the World Bank's executive directors voted to approve a two-year economic reform plan for Iran that envisions $775 million in new Bank loans. In May 2003, the Bank began considering a $112 million loan to Iran for low- and middle-income housing. WTO. The Bush Administration said in July 2001 that U.S. opposition to Iran's membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) was ""under review,"" but there have been no recent indications that the United States will drop that opposition. On several occasions since then, the WTO, at U.S. urging, has postponed discussion on whether to launch entry talks with Iran.  CRS-14   IB93033  07-25-03  Travel Sanctions. Use of U.S. passports for travel to Iran is permitted, but a State Department travel warning, softened somewhat in April 1998, asks that Americans ""defer"" travel to Iran. Iranians entering the United States are required to be fingerprinted. Assets Disputes/Victims of Terrorism. Iran views the issue of disputed claims and blocked assets as an obstacle to improved relations. A U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal, at the Hague, is arbitrating cases resulting from the break in relations following the Iranian revolution. The major cases yet to be decided center on hundreds of Foreign Military Sales cases between the United States and the Shah's regime, which Iran claims it paid for but were unfulfilled. About $400 million in proceeds from the resale of that equipment is in a DOD account, and about $22 million in diplomatic property remains blocked. The assets issue moved to the forefront following several U.S. court judgements against Iran for past acts of terrorism against Americans, filed under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. On May 30, 2003, federal judge Royce Lambert ruled that Iran was behind the 1983 bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut, in response to a 2001 lawsuit filed on behalf of over 600 people who lost family members in that bombing. For information on suits against Iran that have been filed, their outcomes, and legislation regarding these suits, see CRS Report RL31258, Suits Against Terrorism States by Victims of Terrorism. Regarding the mistaken U.S. shootdown on July 3,1988 of an Iranian Airbus passenger jet, on February 22, 1996, the United States, responding to an Iranian case before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), agreed to pay Iran up to $61.8 million in compensation ($300,000 per wage earning victim, $150,000 per non wage earner) for the 248 Iranians killed in the shootdown. The funds for this settlement came from a general appropriation for judgments against the United States. The United States previously paid $3 million in death benefits for 47 non-Iranians killed in the attack, but has not compensated Iran for the airplane itself. A different case, pending before the ICJ, involves an Iranian claim for damages to Iranian oil platforms during U.S. naval clashes with Iran in October 1987 and April 1988.  CRS-15"

Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile  The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.     e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial  The Constitution and law provide for an independent judiciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice.  The Ministry of Justice administers the lower court system, while the Supreme Court guards its independence and fairness.  Juries are not used, but multijudge panels are common, especially in the appeals process.  All judges, at all levels, serve for life.  The judiciary provides citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process.  Defendants are presumed innocent.  They are guaranteed the right of access to legal counsel of their own choosing, in time to prepare their defense.  For defendants unable to pay attorneys' fees, the State assumes the cost.  Defendants have the right to be present at their trial, to confront witnesses, and to participate otherwise in the proceedings.  No groups are barred from testifying, and all testimony is treated alike.  Trials are public and are conducted fairly, with no official intimidation.  Defendants have the right to appeal.  There were no reports of political prisoners.     f.   Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence  The Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.  Section 2    Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:     a.   Freedom of Speech and Press  The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice.  An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.     b.   Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association  The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.     c.   Freedom of Religion  Although the official state religion is Lutheran, the Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government respects this right in practice.     d.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation  The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.  The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees.  There were no reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status.  Section 3   Respect for Political Rights:  The Right of Citizens to Change Their Government  The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.  The most recent elections to the Althing (unicameral Parliament) were held on April 8.  There are no legal or practical impediments to women's participation in government and politics.  Two of the four top governmental positions-- the President and the Speaker of the Althing--are occupied by women (both positions are largely ceremonial, however).  There is an active feminist political party, the Women's List, which won 3 of 63 seats in the 1995 parliamentary elections.    Section 4   Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights  A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases.  Government officials are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.  Section 5   Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or Social Status  The culture of the ethnically homogeneous population is strongly egalitarian and opposed to discrimination based on any of these factors.  Government legislation and practice generally reflect this attitude, but credible reports indicate that both the police and the court system are hostile or indifferent to rape victims (see below).     Women  Violence against women received increasing public attention, due largely to the efforts of the Women's List political movement, which continued to raise it in political debate.  A public women's shelter offers protection to approximately 350 women and 180 children per year; these figures are virtually the same as in 1994, indicating a leveling off of an initial surge in demand for services of the shelter.  There is also a rape trauma center sponsored and operated by women's organizations; some 400 women and children annually seek assistance there.  Both facilities are funded by national and municipal governments and private contributions.  The Reykjavik   City Hospital emergency ward now has an all-female staff to care for rape victims.  Studies indicate that only a small percentage of cases involving domestic violence or sexual abuse (rape, attempted rape, or harassment) are reported to the police.  Women's organizations assert that both the state investigative police and the court system are hostile or indifferent to victims of domestic violence or sexual abuse; that female victims who lodge charges of such offenses are often subjected to humiliating police interrogation; and that judges are unduly lenient with sex offenders (the typical prison term for a convicted rapist is 1 or 2 years).  The police have introduced a program to train officers in correct interrogation procedures, and other government agencies are paying closer attention to the problem of violence against women.  In September an all-male committee, working under the auspices of the Social Affairs Ministry, launched a 2-week campaign, ""Men against Violence,"" highlighting men's responsibility for the majority of domestic and sexual violence, and sponsoring seminars on the problem and ways to eliminate it.  Major economic and political institutions remain male-dominated.  Legislation requiring equal pay for equal work is evidently not being adequately implemented.  Studies have consistently revealed an average difference of 40 percent in the earnings of men and women in comparable jobs; when allowance is made for the longer average working hours (and overtime) among men, there remains a 20-percent gap.  Since 1991 complaints regarding the Equal Rights Law have been referred to a special committee under the Equal Rights Affairs Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs.  The committee has only advisory powers, and its recommendations to any employer do not have the force of law.  Only a few complaints have been made to the committee.  Women's groups speculate that many women are reluctant to come forward with complaints in Iceland's small, intimate communities and traditionally stoic culture.  Also, Iceland's largely male-led labor unions have not actively supported individual women who wish to exercise their right to take action on such matters.     Children  Great respect for children's rights is evident in the law and in government policy.  In 1994 the Government created the Office of the Children's Ombudsman in the Prime Ministry, with a mandate to protect children's rights, interests, and welfare by, among other things, exerting influence on legislation, government decisions, and public attitudes.  Some international custody cases involving Icelanders have been complicated by the fact that, although Iceland is a signatory to the Hague Convention on Child Abduction, it has not been brought into force.  The Foreign Minister opined that Iceland's practices in this area lay it open to criticism for possible violations of human rights.  In 1994 the Foreign Minister submitted a bill in the Parliament to bring the Convention into force, but it was not voted on before the end of the session.  The bill was reintroduced early in the new parliamentary term, which began in October.     People with Disabilities  Disabled individuals are not subject to discrimination in employment, education, or provision of other state services.  The Government has legislated accessibility to public buildings for the disabled.  Section 6   Worker Rights     a.   The Right of Association  Workers make extensive use of the right to establish organizations, draw up their own constitutions and rules, choose their own leaders and policies, and publicize their views.  The resulting organizations are not controlled by the Government or any single political party.  Unions take active part in Nordic, European, and international trade union bodies.  With the exception of limited categories of workers in the public sector whose services are essential to public health or safety, unions have had and used the right to strike for many years.  Some 76 percent of all eligible workers belong to unions.     b.   The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively  There are no impediments to union membership in law or in practice.  Virtually all unions exercise their right to bargain collectively.  The central labor and management organizations periodically negotiate collective bargaining agreements that set nationwide standards and specific terms for workers' pay, workhours, and other conditions.  The Government often plays a role in the negotiations, and sometimes undertakes commitments in order to bring the two sides together.  Labor courts effectively adjudicate disputes over contracts and over the rights provided for in the 1938 Act on Trade Unions and Industrial Disputes, which prohibits antiunion discrimination.  By law, employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union activities.  In practice, the charges are difficult to prove.  In June 1993, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the Government had violated the 11th article of the European Human Rights Charter, concerning the right of free association, by obliging taxi drivers to be members of a union.  The new   Parliament is continuing to consider legislation to comply with this judgment.  There are no export processing or other special economic zones.     c.   Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor  Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law, and does not occur.     d.   Minimum Age for Employment of Children  The law requires children to attend school until the age of 16 and prohibits employment of children under that age in factories, on ships, or in other places that are hazardous or require hard labor.  This prohibition is observed in practice.  Children age 14 or 15 may be employed part-time or during school vacations in light, nonhazardous work; their workhours must not exceed the ordinary workhours of adults in the same occupation.  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration enforces child labor regulations.     e.   Acceptable Conditions of Work  Although there is no minimum wage law, union membership is so extensive and effective as to ensure that labor contracts afford even the lowest- paid workers a sufficient income for a decent standard of living for themselves and their families.    Workers are protected by laws that effectively ensure their health and safety as well as provide for unemployment insurance, paid vacations, pensions, and reasonable working conditions and hours.  The standard legal workweek is 40 hours.  Worktime exceeding 8 hours in a workday must be compensated as overtime.  Workers are entitled to 10 hours of rest within each 24-hour period and to a day off every week.  Under defined special circumstances the 10-hour rest period can be reduced to 8, and the day off can be postponed by a week, in which case the worker has a right to 2 additional hours off in the following week.  Health and safety standards are set by the Althing and administered and enforced by the Ministry of Social Affairs through its Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

GX030-93-0446708	Human Rights Practices for 1998 Report                   Released by the Bureau of Democracy,                   Human Rights, and Labor                   U.S. Department of State                                                         ICELAND COUNTRY REPORT                                          February 1999                                                                                                                    TOC  |   Preface  |   Introduction  |   Africa  |  East Asia  |   Europe  |   Latin America  |   Near East  |  South Asia  |   Appendixes                     Iceland is a constitutional republic and a multiparty parliamentary democracy. Its people participate in high percentages in regular, free, and fair elections which determine the distribution of power among political parties and leaders. The judiciary is independent.  Elected officials control the police force, which scrupulously observes and enforces the laws that ensure protection of human rights.  Iceland has a mixed, open economy, in which citizens have the right to hold private property. It provides residents with a high standard of living. The leading export, marine products, accounts for almost 70 percent of export revenues.  The Government generally respects the human rights of its citizens, and the law and judiciary provide effective means of dealing with individual instances of abuse. There is some societal discrimination against women, which the Government has begun to address.  RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS   Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:   a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing  There were no reports of political or other extrajudicial killings.  b. Disappearance  There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.  c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment  Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment are prohibited by law and do not occur.  Prison conditions meet minimum international standards, and the Government permits visits by human rights monitors. While many prisons are near capacity, the Government has over the past year modernized and expanded existing facilities.  d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile  The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.  e. Denial of Fair Public Trial  The Constitution and law provide for an independent judiciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice.  The Ministry of Justice administers the lower court system, while the Supreme Court guards its independence and fairness. Juries are not used, but multijudge panels are common, especially in the appeals process. All judges, at all levels, serve for life.  The judiciary provides citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process. Defendants are presumed innocent. They are provided access to legal counsel of their own choosing with sufficient time to prepare their defense. For defendants unable to pay attorneys' fees, the State assumes the cost. Defendants have the right to be present at their trial, to confront witnesses, and to participate otherwise in the proceedings. No groups are barred from testifying, and all testimony is treated alike. Trials are public and are conducted fairly, with no official intimidation. Defendants have the right to appeal.  There were no reports of political prisoners.  f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence  The Constitution prohibits such practices and the Government generally respect these prohibitions. Violations are subject to effective legal sanction.  Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:   a. Freedom of Speech and Press  The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.  b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association  The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.  c. Freedom of Religion  Although the official state religion is Lutheranism, the Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government respects this right in practice.  d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation  The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government respects them in practice. The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. There were no reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status. The issue of the provision of first asylum did not arise in 1998. In addition to the total of  50 refugees from the former Yugoslavia that Iceland accepted in 1996 and 1997, 23 were settled in the northern town of Blondous in June. Local government authorities in the towns where refugees are being settled have taken a strong interest in helping them adapt to their new environment, including providing Icelandic language classes and jobs.  Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Government   The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair elections held on the basis of universal suffrage. The most recent elections to the Althingi (unicameral Parliament) were held in April 1995.  There are no legal or practical impediments to women's participation in government and politics. There is one woman in the cabinet. Women hold 17 of the 63 seats in Parliament. There is an active feminist political party, the Women's List, which won 3 seats in the 1995 parliamentary elections. One of the three female Parliamentarians left the Women's List in 1998 due to differences over the future of the movement, thereby reducing the Women's List to 2 seats.  Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights   A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.  Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or Social Status   The culture of the ethnically homogeneous population is strongly egalitarian and opposed to discrimination based on any of these factors. Government legislation and practice generally reflect this attitude.  Women  Increased governmental awareness of violence against women, resulting from extensive media coverage, has led to stiffer sentences for sex offenders. The tougher sentencing derives from improved action by the courts in more strictly enforcing existing laws. A police program to train officers in correct interrogation procedures in rape and sexual abuse cases appears to be addressing prior concerns that police indifference and hostility to female victims did not assure proper attention and consideration for victims of such abuses.  There is a public, women's shelter that offers protection to approximately 350 women and 200 children per year; these figures are virtually unchanged since 1995. There is also a rape trauma center sponsored and operated by women's organizations; some 400 women and children seek assistance annually. Both facilities are funded by national and municipal governments, and private contributions. The Reykjavik City Hospital emergency ward has an all-female staff to care for rape victims. During the year the emergency ward reported 101 visits associated with incidents of rape or sexual abuse, 97 by women and 4 by men. Hospital officials estimate that only 51 percent of these victims press charges and only a handful of cases actually go to trial. Officials attribute this low percentage to fear of publicity in such a small, tightly knit society.  With an increasing number of interracial marriages, mostly involving Icelandic men and Asian women, there has been concern that these new Asian immigrants are not assimilating well into Icelandic society. Concern that these women might be vulnerable to mistreatment led the city of Reykjavik to establish a special Center for Immigrant Women, which focuses on providing information on their legal rights, and an introduction to Icelandic society and norms, as well as language training.  Iceland's largest political party, the center-right Independence Party, has begun addressing women's issues as a priority in response to growing public awareness stimulated by the Women's List political movement and the efforts of the recently reelected female mayor of Reykjavik to put women's issues at the forefront. While major political institutions and businesses remain male dominated, the Government is taking steps to enforce legislation requiring equal pay for equal work. There remains about a 20 percent gap in earnings between men and women in comparable jobs nationally, although the gap in Reykjavik is less, at around 10 to 15 percent.  Since 1991 complaints regarding the Equal Rights Law have been referred to a special committee under the Equal Rights Affairs Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs. However, the committee has only advisory powers, and its recommendations to employers do not have the force of law. Few complaints are made to the committee.  Children  The Government demonstrates its strong commitment to children's rights through its well-funded systems of public education and medical care. The Government provides free prenatal and infant medical care, as well as heavily subsidized children's care. Compulsory education ends in the 10th grade. About 85 percent of students continue to upper secondary education, which is financed completely by the State. In 1994 the Government created the Office of the Children's Ombudsman in the Prime Minister's Office, with a mandate to protect children's rights, interests, and welfare by, among other things, exerting influence on legislation, government decisions, and public attitudes.  There is no societal pattern of abuse directed against children.  People With Disabilities  Disabled individuals are not subject to discrimination in employment, education, or provision of other state services. The Government has legislated accessibility for the disabled to public buildings.  Section 6 Worker Rights   a. The Right of Association  Workers make extensive use of the right to establish organizations, draw up their own constitutions and rules, choose their own leaders and policies, and publicize their views. The resulting organizations are controlled neither by the Government nor by any single political party. Unions take active part in Nordic, European, and international trade union bodies. With the exception of limited categories of workers in the public sector whose services are essential to public health or safety, unions have had and used the right to strike for many years. Approximately 76 percent of all eligible workers belong to unions.  b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively  There are no impediments to union membership in law or in practice. Virtually all unions exercise their right to bargain collectively. The central labor and management organizations periodically negotiate collective bargaining agreements that set nationwide standards and specific terms for workers' pay, work hours, and other conditions. The Government often plays a role in the negotiations and sometimes undertakes commitments in order to bring the two sides together. Labor courts effectively adjudicate disputes over contracts and over the rights provided for in the 1938 Act on Trade Unions and Industrial Disputes, which prohibits antiunion discrimination.  By law, employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union activities. In practice, the charges are difficult to prove.  In 1996 the Parliament passed legislation updating the labor laws and bringing them into compliance with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.  There are no export processing or other special economic zones.  c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor  Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law and does not occur. The law prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, and the Government enforces this prohibition effectively.  d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment  The law prohibits forced and bonded labor by children and the Government enforces this prohibition effectively (see Section 6.c.). The law requires children to attend school until the age of 16 years and prohibits employment of children under that age in factories, on ships, or in other places that are hazardous or require hard labor. This prohibition is observed in practice. Children 14 or 15 years old may be employed part-time or during school vacations in light, nonhazardous work. Their work-hours must not exceed the ordinary work- hours of adults in the same occupation. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration enforces child labor regulations.  e. Acceptable Conditions of Work  Although there is no minimum wage law, union membership is so extensive and effective as to ensure that labor contracts afford even the lowest paid workers a sufficient income for a decent standard of living for themselves and their families.  Workers are protected by laws that effectively ensure their health and safety as well as provide for unemployment insurance, paid vacations, pensions, and reasonable working conditions and hours. The standard legal workweek is 40 hours. Work exceeding 8 hours in a workday must be compensated as overtime. Workers are entitled to 10 hours of rest within each 24-hour period and to a day off every week. Under defined special circumstances, the 10-hour rest period can be reduced to 8, and the day off can be postponed by a week, in which case the worker has a right to 2 additional hours off in the following week.  Health and safety standards are set by the Althingi and administered and enforced by the Ministry of Social Affairs through its Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which can close down workplaces until safety and health standards are met. Workers have a collective, not an individual, right to refuse to work in a place that does not meet the criteria of occupational safety and health. Firing workers who report unsafe or unhealthy conditions is considered a violation of the law.

GX033-09-16697746	"Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1999                   Released by the Bureau of Democracy,                   Human Rights, and Labor                   U.S. Department of State                                                        ICELAND                                          February 2000                                                                                                                  TOC  |   Preface  |   Introduction  |   Africa  |  East Asia  |   Europe  |   Latin America  |   Near East  |  South Asia  |   Appendixes                   Iceland is a constitutional republic and a parliamentary democracy in which citizens periodically choose their representatives in free and fair multiparty elections.  The judiciary is independent.   Elected officials control the police force, which scrupulously observes and enforces the laws that ensure protection of human rights.   Iceland has a mixed, open economy that provides residents with a high standard of living.  The leading exports, fish and other marine products, account for almost 70 percent of export revenues.  An abundance of cheap hydroelectric power provides a comparative advantage for the main manufacturing activity--aluminum smelting.  Aluminum is the second leading export.  Growth was expected to exceed 5 percent in 1999.    The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law and judiciary provide effective means of dealing with individual instances of abuse.  Human rights monitors expressed concern about the Government's frequent use of solitary confinement for remand prisoners.  The Government is taking steps to deal with violence against women.  Some societal discrimination against women persists, especially in the area of equal pay.  Instances of suspected trafficking in women were reported.    RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS    Section 1:     Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:        a.     Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing   There were no reports of political or other extrajudicial killings.        b.     Disappearance   There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.  c.     Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment   Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment are prohibited by law and do not occur.     Prison conditions generally meet minimum international standards.     In a February report, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) expressed concern during its visit to the main prison (Litla Hraun) in Reykjavik in 1998 that nearly all detainees still were being placed in solitary confinement while their cases were under investigation.  While the average duration of solitary confinement was between 2 and 3 weeks, the CPT noted that in some cases, solitary confinement lasted up to 3 months.  While in solitary confinement, prisoners cannot leave their cells, except for short periods of time to exercise alone or to use the showers, and are not allowed to listen to the radio, watch television, or receive visitors other than their lawyers and prison officials.  In November the supervising doctor at Litla Hraun wrote to prison authorities, warning that the mental health of several prisoners awaiting trial on drug trafficking charges could be in danger due to the extended time that they were expected to spend in solitary confinement.   In a preliminary response to the CPT report on September 30, the Government argued that solitary confinement was absolutely necessary in some circumstances to keep suspects from tampering with witnesses, destroying evidence, or hindering the investigation.  On the other hand, it conceded that ""in the vast majority of cases"" incarceration alone was sufficient to protect the integrity of witnesses and evidence.  However, the Prison and Probation Administration's own statistics show that solitary confinement was the rule rather than the exception during the first 9 months of the year:  more than 90 percent of the 87 persons taken into custody were put into solitary confinement at least initially.   With the closing of the Sudumuli remand prison in 1996, the Government passed a law in 1998 that allows pretrial detainees to be incarcerated with the general prison population.  Some human rights monitors claim that this law is inconsistent with the country's obligations under the European Human Rights Convention and European prison rules issued by the Council of Europe.  Construction of a new prison in Reykjavik is planned for these detainees.   Juveniles who are 15 years of age or older can be sentenced to prison terms, but the vast majority of juvenile offenders are given probation or suspended sentences, or agree to attend a treatment program instead of going to jail.  In the rare instances when juvenile offenders are incarcerated, they must be confined with the general adult prison population due to the lack of a separate detention facility for juveniles.  In its February report, the CPT stated that it was ""very concerned"" about the current situation and recommended that the Government take ""immediate steps...to ensure that juvenile prisoners are held separately from adults.""   The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors.        d.     Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile   The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.        e.     Denial of Fair Public Trial   The Constitution and law provide for an independent judiciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice.   There are two levels of courts.  The Ministry of Justice administers the district courts, while the Supreme Court guards its independence and fairness by administering itself.  All judges, at all levels, serve for life.   The judiciary provides citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process.  Juries are not used, but multijudge panels are common, especially in the appeals process.  Depending on the seriousness of the charges, a panel can include from three to five judges.  Defendants are presumed innocent.  They are provided access to legal counsel of their own choosing with sufficient time to prepare their defense.  For defendants unable to pay attorneys' fees, the State assumes the cost.  Defendants have the right to be present at their trial, to confront witnesses, and to participate otherwise in the proceedings.  No groups are barred from testifying, and all testimony is treated alike.  Trials are public and are conducted fairly, with no official intimidation.  Defendants have the right to appeal.   There were no reports of political prisoners.   f.     Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence   The Constitution prohibits such practices, and the Government  generally respect these prohibitions.  Violations are subject to effective legal sanction.   Section 2:     Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:        a.     Freedom of Speech and PressThe Constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice.  An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.        b.     Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association   The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.        c.     Freedom of Religion   Although the official state religion is Lutheranism, the Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government respects this right in practice.  The salaries of Lutheran ministers are paid by the state.  Citizens 16 years of age and above are presumed to be members of the state church and are required to support the church by paying a tax, unless they designate another religious denomination to receive their tax payment.  The religion tax payment of persons who choose not to belong to any specific, organized religious group goes to the University of Iceland.  Religious instruction in Christianity is required in the public schools, although students may be exempted.   d.     Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation   The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.     Although neither the Constitution nor the law include provisions for granting refugee or asylee status in accordance with the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, in practice the Government adjudicates cases in accordance with their principles.  The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Committee of the Red Cross, and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees.  There were no reports of the forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status.  In view of the country's geographic isolation and the lack of direct transportation from any traditional source of refugees, the question of first asylum rarely arises.  However, the Government reported that 13 individuals arrived during the year and requested asylum.  None was found to qualify for refugee status (several cases were still under review), but some were granted temporary entry on humanitarian grounds.  Some human rights monitors criticized the arrest and prolonged detention of a Kurdish asylum-seeker, but the Directorate of Immigration, which has responsibility for processing applications for asylum, stated that it had no choice but to turn the individual over to the police for investigation because he had no identity or travel documents and refused to cooperate with the authorities.   The Directorate of Immigration, which traditionally was a part of the national police force, became an independent agency on October 1.  The Directorate is responsible for issuing passports, visas, and residence permits and for processing applications for asylum, while the police and customs now have responsibility for manning passport control points for those coming into and going out of the country.  However, the police and customs are required to consult with the Directorate of Immigration about individuals arriving without valid visas or passports before refusing them entry.  Human rights monitors say that it appears that some of the individuals who were refused entry upon arrival at the international airport during the year were not afforded their legal right to appeal their denial of admission.   In addition to accepting 20 to 25 UNHCR-designated ""quota"" refugees, the Government admitted 72 Kosovar refugees into the country during the year.  Local government authorities in the towns where refugees settle take a strong interest in helping them adapt to their new environment.  The Icelandic Red Cross, in cooperation with the Refugee Council of the Ministry of Social Affairs, developed a support family program, whereby at least three Icelandic families are enlisted to assist each refugee or refugee family.  The refugees immediately are granted work permits and assisted in finding jobs.  For the first year, they also are given free housing, utilities, and health care and receive a stipend so that they can participate in a special half-day Icelandic language course every day that is designed especially for them.  Refugees generally are successful in assimilating into society, but their children drop out of school earlier than children of citizens.   Section 3:     Respect for Political Rights:  The Right of Citizens to Change Their Government   The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.  The most recent elections to the Althingi (unicameral Parliament) were held in May.   Women are underrepresented in government and politics, but no legal or practical impediments hinder their participation.  Of the 12 government ministers, 4 are women, and women hold 23 of the 63 seats in Parliament.  The Women's List (WL), an activist feminist political party whose establishment in 1983 led to a significant increase in the number of female parliamentarians, joined an electoral alliance with other left-leaning parties in the May elections.  The WL plans to merge eventually with the other left-leaning political parties to form a single entity to challenge the more conservative parties.  Women's issues have moved into the mainstream of political debate, and all of the major political parties now have at least one woman in a prominent leadership position.  Section 4:     Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights   A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases.  Government officials are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.   Section 5:     Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or Social Status   The country's ethnically homogenous population is strongly egalitarian and opposed to discrimination based on any of these factors.  The law and practice generally reflect this attitude.  However, concern is voiced that the rapidly increasing number of foreigners being brought into the country to meet the labor shortage in fish processing and other less desirable occupations could lead to future problems, especially in the event of an economic downturn.  Some 14,000 people of foreign origin now live in the country (approximately 2 percent of the population).  During the last half of the year, the Directorate of Immigration was issuing new residence and work permits at the rate of more than 200 per month.  Many of these ""temporary"" workers come from Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and the Directorate of Immigration expects most of them to seek to remain permanently rather than return to their countries of origin.        Women   Violence against women continued to be a matter of concern.  A public women's shelter offers counseling and protection to victims of domestic violence and their children.  Approximately 400 women and 150 children came to the shelter during the year, 100 of whom sought shelter while the rest asked for counseling or information.  At a rape trauma center, 400 women and children seek assistance annually.  Both facilities are financed by national and municipal governments, as well as by private contributors.  The Reykjavik City Hospital emergency ward has a special staff to care for rape victims.  It reports approximately 100 visits per year associated with incidents of sexual abuse.   A police program to train officers in correct interrogation procedures in rape and sexual abuse cases appears to be addressing prior concerns that police indifference and hostility to female victims did not assure proper attention and consideration for victims of such abuses.    Many victims nevertheless decline to press charges, and even more forgo trial, fearing publicity in this small, tightly knit society.  With an increasing number of interracial marriages, mostly involving Icelandic men and Asian women, there is concern that these new Asian immigrants are not assimilating well into local society.  Concern that these women might be vulnerable to mistreatment led the city of Reykjavik to begin offering them emergency accommodation and assistance, which includes information on legal rights, language training, and an introduction to Icelandic society and norms.  There were indications that some women were trafficked to work as striptease dancers or prostitutes against their will (see Section 6.f.).   In the labor market, the rate of participation by women is high.  In part this reflects the country's comprehensive system of subsidized day care, which makes it affordable and convenient for women to work outside the home.  Despite laws that require equal pay for equal work, a sizeable pay gap continues to exist between men and women.  A survey by a union in Reykjavik showed that women, on average, earned 30 percent less than men.  A 12 percent difference in pay is attributable to the fact that men work 4.2 more hours per week than women, but the rest of the gap is unexplained.        Children   The Government demonstrates its strong commitment to children's rights through its well-funded systems of public education and medical care.  School attendance is compulsory through the age of 15.  About 85 percent of students continue to upper secondary education, which is financed completely by the state.  The Government provides free prenatal and infant medical care, as well as heavily subsidized children's care.  In 1994 the government created the Office of the Children's Ombudsman in the Prime Minister's Office, with a mandate to protect children's rights, interests, and welfare by, among other things, exerting influence on legislation, government decisions, and public attitudes.     There is no societal pattern of abuse directed against children.   In an effort to improve the rate of prosecution of child sexual abuse and lessen the trauma to the child, the Government in 1998 established the Children's Assessment Center.  The objective of the Center is to create a safe and secure environment where child victims feel more comfortable talking about what happened to them and are not subjected to multiple interviews.  The Center brings together police, prosecutors, judges, doctors, and counselors, as well as officials from the Child Protection Agency of the Ministry of Social Affairs.  Prior to the establishment of the Center, barely half of the cases dealt with by the Child Protection Agency were sent to the police for investigation, just a third went to the prosecutor, and only 10 percent ever went to trial.  Now some 75 percent of cases are sent to the police for investigation, and the authorities anticipate a corresponding increase in the percentage of cases being prosecuted and sent to trial.        People with Disabilities   Disabled individuals are not subject to discrimination in employment, education, or the provision of other state services.  A 1992 law calls for the disabled to have the right to ""all common national and municipal services"" and provides that they be given assistance to ""make it possible for them to live and work in normal society with others.""  The law also provides that the disabled should receive preference for a government job when they are equally qualified, or more qualified, than regular applicants.  Building regulations updated in 1998 call for public buildings to be accessible.  However, the country's main association for the disabled complains that the provisions related to building access often are ignored because there is no penalty for noncompliance.  Access to new buildings tends to be good, while efforts to make old buildings more accessible have lagged.   Section 6:     Worker Rights        a.     The Right of Association   Workers make extensive use of the right provided by the Constitution to establish organizations, draw up their own constitutions and rules, choose their own leaders and policies, and publicize their views.  The resulting organizations are controlled neither by the Government nor by any single political party.  Unions take active part in Nordic, European, and other international trade union bodies.  With the exception of limited categories of workers in the public sector whose services are essential to public health or safety, unions have had and used the right to strike for many years.  Approximately 80 percent of all eligible workers belong to unions.  No strikes occurred during the year, but there were a handful of work stoppages.        b.     The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively   Union membership is not impeded in law or practice.  Employers are required to withhold union dues (1 percent of gross pay) from the pay of all employees, whether they are members of the union or not.  This is because union dues help support, among other things, an illness fund to which everyone is entitled.     The various trade unions and management organizations periodically negotiate collective bargaining agreements that set specific terms for workers' pay, hours, and other conditions.  The current 3-year collective bargaining agreements expire in February 2000.  In recent years, the Government has played almost no role in the private-sector collective bargaining process, other than generally to encourage wage restraint that would help to limit inflation.     Labor courts effectively adjudicate disputes over contracts and over the rights provided for in the 1938 Act on Trade Unions and Industrial Disputes, which prohibits antiunion discrimination.  By law employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union activities.  In practice the charges are difficult to prove.   In 1996 the Parliament passed legislation updating the labor laws and bringing them into compliance with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.   There are no export processing or other special economic zones.            c.     Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor   Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law and does not occur; however, some women reportedly were coerced to work as striptease dancers or prostitutes (see Section 6.f.), and work permit practices could leave workers vulnerable to abuse by employers (see Section 6.e.).  The law prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, and the Government enforces this prohibition effectively.   d.     Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment   The law prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, and the Government enforces this prohibition effectively (see Section 6.c.).  The law requires children to attend school until the age of 16 and prohibits the employment of younger children in factories, on ships, or in other places that are hazardous or require hard labor.  This prohibition is observed in practice.  Children 14 or 15 years old may be employed part time or during school vacations in light, nonhazardous work.  Their work-hours must not exceed the ordinary work-hours of adults in the same occupation.  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration enforces child labor regulations.        e.     Acceptable Conditions of Work   No minimum wage is mandated legislatively, but the minimum wages negotiated in the various collective bargaining agreements apply automatically to all employees in those occupations, whether they are union members or not.  Union membership is so extensive and effective that labor contracts afford even the lowest paid workers a sufficient income for a decent standard of living for themselves and their families.   Workers are protected by laws that effectively provide for their health and safety as well as for unemployment insurance, paid vacations, pensions, and reasonable working conditions and hours.  The standard legal workweek is 40 hours.  Work exceeding 8 hours in a workday must be compensated as overtime.  Workers are entitled to 10 hours of rest within each 24-hour period and to a day off every week.  Under defined special circumstances, the 10-hour rest period can be reduced to 8, and the day off can be postponed by a week, in which case the worker has a right to 2 additional hours off in the following week.    Health and safety standards are set by the Althingi and administered and enforced by the Ministry of Social Affairs through its Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which can close down workplaces until safety and health standards are met.  Workers have a collective, not an individual, right to refuse to work in a place that does not meet the criteria of occupational safety and health.  Firing workers who report unsafe or unhealthy conditions is illegal.   However, in the case of newly arrived foreign workers or refugees (i.e., those who have been in the country for less than 3 years), human rights monitors expressed concern that the Government's practice of issuing the applicable work permit to the employer rather than to the individual concerned could leave the worker vulnerable to abuse by the employer.        f.     Trafficking in Persons   The law does not specifically criminalize trafficking in persons; however, a number of provisions in the Penal Code can be used to prosecute such cases.      Trafficking in women is suspected in connection with the growing number of foreign women who enter the country to work in striptease clubs.  With the recent opening of several new striptease clubs (there are now 11 clubs altogether), the police expressed concern about the 500 women who entered the country during the year to work in these establishments.  It is suspected that some of the women--especially those from Eastern and Central Europe and the former Soviet Union--were coerced to work as striptease dancers or prostitutes against their will.     Regulation of these clubs has been lacking, in part because striptease dancers can enter the country and perform without a work permit for up to a month under an exemption given for ""artists.""  The Government plans to close this legal loophole.    By year's end, there had been no arrests in connection with these activities.

GX256-98-16288633	"U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE 10 W. JACKSON BLVD. CHICAGO, IL 60604  NEWS RELEASE Thursday, August 29, 2002  Indonesian National Sentenced to 13 Months in Prison for Visa and Identity Fraud Chicago, IL - Brian R. Perryman, District Director for the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) in Chicago, together with Patrick J. Fitzgerald, United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, announced the sentencing today of an Indonesian national for document and visa fraud. Albigensis Sadat, age 24 and an illegal alien, was sentenced today by U.S District Judge David H. Coar to 13 months in prison. On October 2, 2001 an international package mailed from Indonesia to Sadat in Chicago was intercepted at the Fed Ex hub in Anchorage, Alaska. Although the package indicated it contained ""documents,"" it appeared suspicious. Upon opening the package, U.S. Customs Inspectors discovered counterfeit U.S. Immigration admission stamps, counterfeit Illinois Secretary of State stamps, and inkpads containing red and black security ink. INS and Customs worked together to deliver the package to Sadat's residence at 5009 S. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive in Chicago on October 5, 2001. Federal agents took Sadat into custody at that time and a search of his apartment yielded several counterfeit blank immigration documents, counterfeit blank Social Security cards, several completed counterfeit Illinois temporary drivers licenses, and $6,000 in cash. ""During this time of heightened national security, the INS is working hard to combat the proliferation of counterfeit documents being manufactured and sold on our streets,"" says INS District Director Brian R. Perryman. ""The issue of identity theft and fraud is of great concern to the INS here in Chicago and across the country."" Since 1998, INS agents in Chicago have confiscated more than 70,000 fraudulent documents from illegal document manufacturers and vendors. Sadat will be surrendered to the custody of INS upon completion of his sentence to be placed in deportation proceedings. ###"

Iran, still split between conservatives and reformers loyal to President Mohammad Khatemi, who was elected in May 1997 and overwhelmingly reelected on June 8, 2001, has not accepted to date. Even though open to engagement with Iran, the Bush Administration and many in Congress want to continue vigorous efforts to counter Iran's support for terrorist groups and its efforts to acquire weapons of mass destructio n (WMD) programs. Iran's human rights practices, particularly its treatment of the Baha'i and the Jewish communities, are also a major concern, although the Clinton Administration did not cite progress as a specific condition for an improvement in relations. The Bush Administration has identified Iran's modernization of its conventional forces as a potential threat to U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf, but others argue that the buildup has been minor and that Iran still is relatively poorly equipped. Iran's efforts to acquire WMD and delivery means, particularly its ballistic missile program, have made major st rides over the past few years, with the help of foreign suppliers. Barred from U.S. or European advanced technology, Iran continues to receive weaponry and WMD-related technology from China, Russia, and North Korea. Iran has opposed the U.S.-led Middle East peace process since its inception in October 1991. It continues to provide material support to Hizballah in Lebanon and to Islamic-oriented Palestinian groups that oppose the Arab-Israeli peace process, such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Iran apparently is also arming the Palestinian Authority. All Iranian factions have strongly supported Palestinian violence against Israel since September 2000. Current U.S. policy toward Iran marks an apparent shift from the almost exclusive focus on containment that characterized U.S. policy during 1980 - 1997. During the first term of the Clinton Administration, as part of a policy of ""dual containment"" of Iran and Iraq, President Clinton imposed a ban on U.S. trade and investment in Iran in 1995, and a 1996 law imposed sanctions on foreign investment in Iran's energy sector (Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, ILSA). The sanctions were intended to deny Iran the material resources to threaten U.S. interests. In keeping with the 1997 policy shift t oward engagement, in 1999 and 2000 the Clinton Administration and Congress eased sanctions somewhat to allow U.S. exports to Iran of food and medical supplies and importation from Iran of luxury consumer goods, such as carpets. However, the United States continues to work with its allies to prevent arms and advanced technology sales to Iran and to limit Iran's influence over regional energy flows. U.S. purchases of Iranian oil and U.S. company investments in Iran remain barred. Legislation to renew ILSA for another 5 years was signed on August 3, 2001 (H.R. 1954, P.L. 107-24).  Congressional Research Service  ~ The Library of Congress   IB93033  01-14-02  MOST RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Legislation to renew the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act for another 5 years was passed by large majorities in both chambers and signed on August 3, 2001 (H.R. 1954, P.L. 107-24). A long-time supporter of anti-Taliban forces in Afghanistan, Iran has cooperated with U.S. efforts to defeat the Taliban and deliver humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people. However, the thawing of U.S.-Iran relations evident over the past four years began to reverse in January 2002 over revelations that Iran had sold arms to the Palestinian Authority and perceived Iranian efforts to exert influence on the new Afghan government.  BACKGROUND AND ANALYSIS The power struggle in Iran between revolutionary purists and more moderate reformists colors Iran's domestic and foreign policies. President Mohammad Khatemi, who was reelected on June 8, 2001 by a landslide 77% of the vote against nine more conservative candidates, holds a popular mandate for greater domestic freedoms. His reelection victory was larger than his 69% first win in May 1997. His supporters hold about 70% of the seats in the 290-seat Majlis (parliament) following victories in the February 18, 2000 Majlis elections. However, Khatemi has expressed frustration that his reform program has been obstructed by hardliners, including Supreme Leader Ali Khamene'i (successor to Ayatollah Khomeini), who use their control of key levers of power to prevent a loosening of domestic restrictions or moderation of foreign policy. As part of a hardline backlash since April 2000, hardliners in the judiciary have closed more than 30 reformist newspapers and imprisoned or questioned several editors. The power struggle broke into the open in early August 2001, when hardliners succeeded in delaying Khatemi's second term inauguration until the Majlis approved several hardliners to the legislative review body called the Council of Guardians. Khatemi made few changes to his cabinet, and the Majlis approved all his choices.  Iran's Strategic Buildup Iran is not considered a major conventional threat to the United States, but some of its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly medium range ballistic missiles, appear to be making significant progress. Bush Administration officials have also expressed concern about Iran's plans to reinvigorate a conventional buildup. For further information, see CRS Report RL30551, Iran: Arms and Technology Acquisitions.  Conventional Weapons Iran's armed forces total about 550,000 personnel, including both the regular military and the Revolutionary Guard, the latter of which is populated largely by hardliners. Low oil prices and high debts slowed Iran's defense acquisitions to about $300 million per year during 1996-1999, from over $1 billion per year in the early 1990s, although purchase levels appear set to rise again. Equipment already purchased has given Iran the ability to temporarily block the Strait of Hormuz or disrupt international shipping, but Iran is considered to lack the capability to move significant numbers of troops across the Gulf. In November 2000, Russia   IB93033  CRS-2  01-14-02  told the United States it would no longer abide by a 1995 pledge to refrain from new conventional arms deals with Iran. On October 2, 2001, Iran and Russia signed an agreement that provides for $300 million per year in Iranian arms purchases over the next 5 years. Despite Russian assurances that the arms would be purely defensive, the systems reportedly under consideration include new MiG-29 and Sukhoi combat aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as the S-300 air defense system (the Russian counterpart of the U.S. ""Patriot""). A provision of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, P.L. 104-132, cuts U.S. aid to countries that sell lethal military equipment to countries on the U.S. terrorism list. See CRS Report RL30551, Iran: Arms and Technology Acquisitions, and CRS Report RL31083, Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations, 1993-2000.  Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) U.S. government proliferation reports, including an August 2001 CIA report covering July - December 2000, assert that Iran is actively seeking to acquire WMD and advanced conventional weapons. Iran's programs, particularly its missile program, continue to be assisted primarily by entities in Russia, China, and North Korea. The foreign assistance continued despite U.S. anti-proliferation efforts through multilateral export control regimes such as the Wassenaar Arrangement, Missile Technology Control Regime, Nuclear Suppliers Group, Zangger Committee, and Australia Group. (See also CRS Report RL30408, Weapons of Mass Destruction in the Middle East.) Chemical and Biological Weapons. U.S. proliferation reports state that Iran is seeking to acquire a self-sufficient chemical weapons infrastructure, that it may have some capability for biological weapons deployment, and that it has stockpiled chemical weapons, including blister, blood, and choking agents. On June 11, 2001, the Bush Administration imposed trade sanctions, in accordance with the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000 (P.L. 106178) on China's Jiangsu Yongli Chemicals and Technology Import and Export Corporation for allegedly selling Iran technology not permitted for export to Iran under the Chemical Weapons Convention. This record raises questions about Iran's compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which Iran signed on January 13, 1993, and ratified on June 8, 1997. However, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), charged with monitoring the convention, has indicated general satisfaction with Iran's compliance thus far. OPCW toured Iran's declared chemical sites in February 1999, and Iran has made required declarations. Iran is a party to the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. Missiles. Largely with Russian help, Iran is making progress in its missile program. Although two of its first three tests of the 800-mile range Shahab-3 (July 1998, July 2000, and September 2000) were either inconclusive or unsuccessful (the July 2000 test appears to have been a success), U.S. intelligence officials said publicly in August 2001 that Iran will soon ""field"" the Shahab-3. At least one defense publication said in mid-October 2001 that Iran had launched serial production of the Shahab-3. Iran is also developing a 1,200 mile range Shahab-4, and it has publicly mentioned an even longer- range Shahab-5, although development of the Shahab-5 apparently has not begun, according to U.S. reports. A Washington Post report of January 11, 2002 quotes an intelligence estimate as saying that most, but not all, U.S. intelligence agencies believe Iran will likely field an intercontinental ballistic missile by 2015. The Washington Times reported on April 18, 2001, that North Korea was in the process of shipping missile components to Iran, and on June 11, 2001, the Bush Administration imposed trade sanctions on North Korean and Iranian entities under the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000 for alleged exports to Iran of missile technology. In the   IB93033  CRS-3  01-14-02  course of August 2001 talks with China on missile proliferation, Bush Administration officials appeared to cast doubt that China was upholding a November 2000 pledge not to export missile technology to Iran or other countries. See also CRS Report RL30551, Iran: Arms and Technology Acquisitions. Nuclear Weapons. U.S. officials believe Iran is acquiring the expertise and technology that could be used in a nuclear weapons program. Russia, despite U.S. protests, is proceeding with its January 1995 contract with Iran to complete a nuclear power plant at Bushehr, and the two countries have said it should be complete by the end of 2002. In November 2001, Russia shipped to Iran the first reactor shell of the project. There have been inconclusive Iranian and Russian statements on whether Iran will commission Russia to build a second reactor at Bushehr. During his June 16, 2001 meeting with Russia's President Vladimir Putin, President Bush raised U.S. concerns about an alleged transfer by a Russian firm to Iran of high-strength aluminum that the United States believes Iran might use to manufacture enriched uranium for a nuclear weapons program. A February 2001 CIA report to Congress, which covered the period of Khatemi's June 2000 visit to China, dropped language from previous reports that China has kept its pledge to refrain from new nuclear cooperation with Iran. Iran accepts International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards of its known nuclear facilities, and agency visits to Iran's declared facilities since 1992 have found no evidence at the sites visited to indicate Iran is developing nuclear weapons. Iran has refused to permit an enhanced IAEA inspections program (""93+2"") that would include surprise inspections to undeclared facilities, although some observers say Iran is mulling accepting more stringent inspections. Each year since FY1998, foreign aid laws have contained provisions cutting U.S. aid to the Russian government if it continues the Bushehr project or assists Iran's ballistic missile program. No waiver was provided for either in the FY1998 or the FY2000 legislation, although the cuts do not apply to nuclear dismantlement in Russia or aid to Russia's private sector. The foreign operations appropriations for both FY2001 (P.L. 106-429) and FY2002 (conference report H.Rept. 107-345) contain a similar provision, but both increase the aid cut to 60%. The House version of the FY2002 foreign relations authorization bill, H.R. 1646, passed by the House on May 16, 2001, contains Title IX, the Iran Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 2001. Virtually identical to bills introduced in the 106th and 105th congresses, the provision would make the IAEA subject to cuts in U.S. voluntary contributions if it continued technical assistance to Iran's nuclear program.  Iranian Foreign Policy and Involvement in Terrorism Iran's continued support for terrorism is considered an obstacle to improved U.S.-Iran relations. The State Department report on international terrorism for 2000, released April 30, 2001, states that Iran ""remained the most active state sponsor of terrorism in 2000,"" although the report attributed that activity to two hardline institutions -- the Revolutionary Guard and the Intelligence Ministry. Iran strongly condemned the September 11 attacks, but an unprecedented visit by Britain's Foreign Secretary Jack Straw on September 25, 2001 failed to enlist Iran openly in an anti-terrorism coalition. Press reports in November 2001 indicated Iran is considering withdrawing some of its Revolutionary Guard officers from countries, such as Sudan, Lebanon, and Bosnia, where they have been supporting Islamist movements  possibly indicating, if true, diminished Iranian interest in sponsoring some radical Islamic groups that have been involved in terrorism. (See also CRS Report RL31119, Terrorism: Near Eastern Groups and State Sponsors, 2001.)   IB93033  CRS-4  01-14-02  Persian Gulf Khatemi has largely succeeded in improving relations with Iran's neighbors, particularly the six states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC; Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates). Since he came into office, Iran apparently has reduced support for Shiite Muslim dissident movements in the Gulf states. See also CRS Report RL30728, Persian Gulf: Issues for U.S. Policy, 2000. Saudi Arabia/Khobar Towers/Gulf States. Iran and Saudi Arabia restored relations in December 1991 (after a 4 year break), and progressively higher level contacts have taken place since December 1997. In May 1999, Khatemi became the first senior Iranian leader to visit Saudi Arabia since the Islamic revolution. In April 2000, Saudi Arabia's number three leader, Prince Sultan, hosted a visit by Iran's Defense Minister. Supreme Leader Khamene'i has been invited to visit the Kingdom as well. In mid-April 2001, Saudi Arabia and Iran formally entered into an anti-crime security pact, suggesting that Saudi Arabia wishes to bury the issue of the June 25, 1996 Khobar Towers housing complex bombing, which killed 19 U.S. airmen. On June 21, 2001, a federal grand jury indicted 14 suspects, 13 Saudis and a Lebanese citizen, for the Khobar bombing. The indictment indicated that official elements in Iran were likely involved, but no indictments of any Iranians were announced. Saudi Arabia officials announced that the 11 Saudi suspects who are in custody in Saudi Arabia would be tried in Saudi courts and not turned over to U.S. justice. In 2000, Iran entered into anti-crime security pacts with the other Gulf states of Kuwait and Oman. (See CRS Issue Brief IB93113, Saudi Arabia: Postwar Issues and U.S. Relations.) Gulf Islands Dispute With UAE. Relations between Iran and the UAE deteriorated sharply in April 1992, when Iran asserted complete control of the Persian Gulf island of Abu Musa, which it and the UAE shared under a 1971 bilateral agreement. (In 1971, Iran, then ruled by the U.S.-backed Shah, seized two other islands, Greater and Lesser Tunb, from the emirate of Ras al-Khaymah, which later became part of the UAE.) The UAE wants to refer the dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), but Iran insists on resolving the issue bilaterally. Several GCC states -- Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Oman -- have attempted to mediate and Iran-UAE talks did resume in July 2001, but there is no evidence of Iranian flexibility to date on the key issue of sovereignty. The United States, which is concerned about Iran's military improvements to the islands, generally supports UAE proposals but takes no position on sovereignty. Jane's Defence Weekly reported in March 2000 that Iran's military improvements were relatively minor. Iraq. A legacy of the 8-year long Iran-Iraq war (1980-1988) is deep lingering suspicion between Iran and Iraq, but relations have improved dramatically over the past few years. In early 1998, the two began exchanging significant numbers of prisoners from the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war, alleviating a key source of friction. An October 2000 visit to Iraq by Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi resulted in apparent agreement to abide by the waterway-sharing and other provisions of their 1975 Algiers Accords, which Iraq had abrogated prior to its September 1980 invasion of Iran. In exchange for a share of the proceeds, Iran cooperates with Iraq's illicit export of oil products (worth about $50 million per month as of early 2001) through the Gulf, although Iran has occasionally curtailed its cooperation with that exportation. Iranian hardliners still give support to Shiite militants in southern Iraq (the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, SCIRI) trying to overthrow Iraq's regime. Iran allowed the Iraqi National Congress (INC), Iraq's main opposition umbrella, to open an office in Tehran as of March 2001.   IB93033  CRS-5  01-14-02  Middle East Peace Process/North Africa Many of the allegations of Iran's support for terrorism center on its assistance to groups opposed to the Arab-Israeli peace process, primarily Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Hizballah, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. Apparently corroborating press reports, U.S. officials and U.S. terrorism reports state that, following the start of the September 2000 Palestinian uprising, Iran increased its support for terrorism somewhat by encouraging coordination among Palestinian terrorist groups. Hamas and PIJ terrorist attacks escalated since the Palestinian uprising began in late September 2000, and Hamas conducted several major suicide attacks against Israeli civilians in 2001. Many in Congress have criticized Iran's incitement activities, such as its hosting of a conference for anti-peace process organizations on April 24, 2001. The conference served as a platform for Iranian statements against Israel that the United States called ""outrageous and intolerable."" Khamene'i told the meeting that Israelis had exaggerated the Holocaust to justify ""crimes"" against the Palestinians. Khamene'i said in early November 2000 that the Palestinian-Israeli violence could end only if Israel were ""eradicated."" Khatemi has sometimes tried to moderate Iran's position somewhat, saying during his November 2001 visit to the United Nations that Iran would accept a final Israeli-Palestinian settlement acceptable to the Palestinians. At the same time, Khatemi has generally sought to avoid conflict with hardliners by joining them in a denunciation of Israeli-Palestinian interim agreements, and by pledging continued support to anti-peace process groups. On the other hand, Iran has had few ties to the non-Islamist Palestinian organizations, including elements linked to the Palestinian Authority, that have conducted some of the dayto-day violence against Israel in the current uprising. It was therefore a new development when it was revealed in early January that Iran was the source of a shipment of 50 tons of arms bought by the Palestinian Authority, in contravention of the PA's agreements with Israel. The arms could be used for terrorism or to bolster the PA's conventional combat capabilities. Many analysts say that the warming trend in U.S.-Iran relations over the past four years has been set back by the shipment revelations. About 100 Iranian Revolutionary Guards remain in Lebanon to coordinate arms deliveries to Hizballah, and the Los Angeles Times reported on May 6, 2001 that the United States, in late 2000, succeeded in persuading Turkey to prevent Iran from flying over Turkish airspace to Syria, thereby denying Iran an easy route for resupplying Hizballah. Even though the United Nations certified Israel's May 2000 withdrawal from Lebanon as complete, Hizballah continues to battle Israel in the Shebaa Farms border area that Israel controls but which Hizballah claims constitutes Lebanese territory that is still occupied by Israel; Iran publicly supported Hizballah's ambush and capture of three Israeli soldiers and one alleged Israeli agent in October 2000, all in the Shebaa Farms area. (H.Res. 99 expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that Iran, Syria, and Lebanon pressure Hizballah to allow visitations to the four captives by the International Committee of the Red Cross. The measure passed the House on June 25, 2001.) In late October 2001, Israel announced it believed the three captured soldiers had died. A New York Times report of January 12, 2002, said that, in the mid-1990s, Iran had transferred American-built Stinger anti-aircraft systems obtained in Afghanistan to Hizballah. On May 10, 1999, Argentina's Supreme Court ruled that the March 17, 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires was the work of Hizballah. On September 2, 1999, Argentina issued an arrest warrant for senior Hizballah guerrilla leader Imad Mughniyah in   IB93033  CRS-6  01-14-02  connection with it. An Argentine judge has also accused Iran and Hizballah of a July 18, 1994 bombing of a Jewish cultural center (AMIA) in Buenos Aires; 20 alleged Argentine accomplices have been arrested and their trial began in late September 2001, but the main suspects are still at large. H.Res. 531 and S.Res. 329, calling on Argentina to step up the investigation of the 1994 bombing, were passed by their full chambers on July 17 and July 19, 2000, respectively. In May 2001, an FBI team traveled to Argentina to help with the AMIA investigation. Sudan/Egypt/Algeria. Sudan's close relations with Iran in the early 1990s contributed to Sudan's placement on the U.S. ""terrorism list"" on August 18, 1993. However, Sudan's earlier alliance with Iran has frayed as Sudan has sought to achieve removal from the terrorism list. Khatemi said in October 1999 that he wants full normalization with Egypt, but Egypt demands, as a precondition, that Iran rename a Tehran street named for Sadat's assassin (Khalid Islambouli). Iran and Algeria restored relations on September 8, 2000; they were broken in 1992 by Algeria, which accused Iran of aiding Islamic opponents of the secular regime.  Central and South Asia/Azerbaijan Iran's policy in Central Asia has thus far emphasized economic cooperation over Islamic ideology, although Iran has become increasingly assertive in its relations with Azerbaijan. In early 1992, Iran led the drive to bring the Central Asian states and Azerbaijan into the Economic Cooperation Organization (founded in 1985 by Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey, as a successor to an organization founded by those states in 1964). Iran is hoping to attract energy pipeline routes through it, rather than through other countries. Iran does not appear to be supporting radical Islamic fundamentalist groups in the Central Asian countries (with the possible exception of Tajikistan) or in Russia's Dagestan and Chechnya regions, but Iran does host at least one anti-Azerbaijan guerrilla leader (Hasan Javadov), and it reportedly allows anti-Uzbekistan activists access to Iran's state radio. Tensions with Azerbaijan flared in late July 2001 over energy exploration rights in the Caspian; Iranian warships and combat aircraft intimidated an international oil firm (BP) on contract to Azerbaijan from continuing its work an area of the Caspian Iran considers its own. The United States called Iran's actions in the Caspian provocative, and it offered new border security aid and increased political support to Azerbaijan. Afghanistan/Pakistan. Iran long opposed the puritanical Sunni Muslim regime of the Taliban in Afghanistan on the grounds that it oppressed Shiite Muslim and other Persianspeaking minorities. Iran nearly launched a military attack against the Taliban in September 1998 after Taliban fighters captured and killed several Iranian diplomats based in northern Afghanistan. Subsequently, Iran provided military aid to the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance coalition, made up of mostly Persian-speaking minority groups. Iran -- along with the United States, Russia, and the countries bordering Afghanistan -- attended U.N.-sponsored meetings in New York (the Six Plus Two group) to try to end the internal conflict in Afghanistan. Iran and the United States also participated in a U.N.-sponsored group in Geneva, which also includes Italy and Germany. Tacitly aligned with the U.S. military campaign against the Taliban in Afghanistan, Iran has pledged search and rescue assistance to the United States, and is allowing U.S. humanitarian aid for the Afghan people to transit Iran en route to Afghanistan. U.S. officials have called Iran's role in the anti-Taliban/Al Qaeda effort, including efforts to form a new government at the Bonn conference (ended in agreement December 5, 2001) ""constructive"" In late November, Iran reopened its embassy in Kabul.   IB93033  CRS-7  01-14-02  Iran's public stance, and some of its activities, have reflected official suspicion of the United States: Iran publicly opposed U.S. military retaliation for the September 11 attacks and refused to join a U.S.-led anti-terrorism coalition. Iran is said to fear the pro-U.S. tilt of the new government of Afghanistan and the waning of Iran's traditional sway in western, central, and northern Afghanistan where Persian-speaking Afghans predominate. Amid press reports in January 2002 that Iran might be harboring some Al Qaeda fighters who have fled Afghanistan, President Bush warned Iran against such activity. He also warned Iran not to seek to exert influence over the new government of Afghanistan. (See CRS Report RL30588, Afghanistan: Current Issues and U.S. Policy Concerns.)  Former Yugoslavia On June 26, 1996, and again on May 5, 1997, President Clinton certified to Congress that Bosnia had expelled foreign forces and ended intelligence cooperation with Iran. The certifications were required by P.L. 104-122, an FY1996 supplemental appropriation, and P.L. 104-208, the FY1997 foreign aid appropriation, in order to provide U.S. aid to Bosnia.  Human Rights Concerns U.S. and U.N. human rights reports cite Iran for widespread human rights abuses, (especially of the Baha'i faith), including assassinations and executions of regime opponents (Kurds, People's Mojahedin, and others) in Iran and abroad. These reports note that Khatemi's efforts to promote rule of law have met repeated challenges from hardliners in Iran. Religious Persecution. On October 27, 2001, the State Department again named Iran as a ""Country of Particular Concern,"" under the International Religious Freedom Act. No sanctions were added, on the grounds that Iran is already subject to extensive U.S. sanctions. Religious persecution continues, especially against the Baha'i community, because Iran's Shiite Muslim clergy views the sect as heretical. Two Baha'is (Dhabihullah Mahrami and Musa Talibi) were sentenced to death in 1996 for apostasy. On July 21, 1998, Iran executed Ruhollah Ruhani, the first Bahai executed since 1992 (Bahman Samandari). The United States condemned the execution. In February 2000, Iran's Supreme Court set aside the death sentences against three Bahais, Sirus Zabihi-Moqaddam, Hedayat KashefiNajafabadi, and Manucher Khulusi. On April 21, 1999, the Clinton Administration expressed concern about the sentencing to prison of four Baha'is. Recent resolutions condemning Iran's treatment of the Baha'is, including S.Con.Res. 57, which passed the Senate July 19, 2000, and H.Con.Res. 257, which passed the House on September 19, 2000. Trial of 13 Jews. Although the 30,000 member Jewish community (the largest in the Middle East aside from Israel) enjoys more freedoms than Jewish communities in several other Muslim states, during 1993-1998 Iran executed five Jews allegedly spying for Israel. In June 1999, Iran confirmed that it had arrested 13 Jews -- teachers, shopkeepers, and butchers -- from the Shiraz area that it said were part of an ""espionage ring"" for Israel. After an April - June 2000 trial in which eight of the suspects ""confessed"" to the allegations, ten of the Jews and two Muslims accomplices were convicted (July 1, 2000) and received sentences ranging from 4 years to 13 years. Three Jews were acquitted. The affair provoked an international outcry, and the Clinton Administration worked through U.S. allies to intercede, possibly contributing to a September 21, 2000 decision by a three-judge appeals panel to reduce the sentences slightly, now ranging from 2 to 9 years. On February 8, 2001,   IB93033  CRS-8  01-14-02  Iran's Supreme Court rejected their appeals, allowing the revised sentences to stand. In March 2001, Iran released one of the Jews on the grounds that his sentence included time served. Several bills in the 106th Congress condemned the arrests and called for the release of the detainees and for linking U.S. relations with Iran to the trial's outcome; the Senate passed S.Con.Res. 39 (June 23, 1999) and S.Con.Res. 109 (May 4, 2000). In April 2001, a similar bill, H.Con.Res. 29, was introduced in the 107th Congress.  U.S. Policy and Legislation The February 11, 1979 fall of the Shah of Iran, a key U.S. ally, opened a long rift in U.S.-Iranian relations, but the rift appears to be starting to close somewhat. On November 4, 1979, radical ""students"" seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held its diplomats hostage until minutes after President Reagan's inauguration on January 20, 1981. The United States broke relations with Iran on April 7, 1980, and the two countries have had no official dialogue since. The exception was the abortive 1985-86 clandestine arms supply relationship with Iran in exchange for some American hostages held by Hizballah in Lebanon (the so-called ""Iran-Contra Affair""). Iran maintains an interests section in Washington through the Embassy of Pakistan, staffed by Iranian permanent resident aliens or U.S. citizens of Iranian descent. The U.S. protecting power in Iran is Switzerland. Upon taking office in 1993, the Clinton Administration moved to further isolate Iran as part of a strategy of ""dual containment"" of Iran and Iraq. In 1995 and 1996, the Clinton Administration and Congress added sanctions on Iran in response to growing concerns about Iran's weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons acquisition programs, its support for terrorist groups, and its efforts to subvert the Arab-Israeli peace process. The election of Khatemi in May 1997 precipitated a shift in U.S. policy from containment to engagement, although with key efforts to limit Iran's strategic capabilities still in place. The Clinton Administration sought to engage Iran in a dialogue, with no substantive preconditions. In January 1998, Khatemi publicly agreed to increase ""people-to-people"" exchanges with the United States but ruled out an official dialogue. In a June 17, 1998 speech, then Secretary of State Albright stepped up the U.S. outreach effort by calling for mutual confidence building measures that could lead to a ""road map"" for normalization of relations. Encouraged by the reformist victory in Iran's March 2000 parliamentary elections, Secretary Albright gave another speech on March 17, 2000, acknowledging past U.S. meddling in Iran, easing sanctions on some Iranian imports, and promising to work to resolve outstanding claims disputes. Iran welcomed the steps, but called them insufficient to warrant the beginning of a dialogue. Iran also rejected a U.S. suggestion for consular visits by U.S. officials. In early September 2000 meetings at the United Nations in connection with the Millennium Summit, Secretary Albright and President Clinton sent a positive signal to Iran by attending Khatemi's speeches. The Bush Administration appears to be continuing the Clinton Administration efforts to end the long U.S.-Iran estrangement, and it has been looking for ways to build on the tacit cooperation between the two countries in Afghanistan. The Administration's November 13, 2001 continuation of the 1979 national emergency on Iran justified the emergency by saying that U.S. ""relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal,"" a far softer statement than previous justifications sighting a continued threat from Iran. However, Iran continued to refuse to engage in official, bilateral talks until at least some U.S. sanctions are lifted. Following a move by some Majlis deputies to call for re-establishing relations with the United   IB93033  CRS-9  01-14-02  States, Supreme Leader Khamene'i moved forcefully to squash talk of improved relations on October 30, 2001, when he threatened to fire Iranian officials who strive for that result. His statement came a few weeks after several Members of Congress had dinner in the Senate with Iran's representative to the United Nations. The gradual thaw in relations, which appeared to accelerate in the context of the Afghanistan crisis, appears to have stalled or reversed in January 2002. Revelations of Iran's sale of arms to the Palestinian Authority and reputed meddling in Afghanistan have caused the Administration and Congress to become far more critical of Iran's intentions and actions. However, these revelations have, to date, led few experts to argue that Iran is likely to become a target of the U.S. war on terrorism.  Economic Sanctions Since the November 4, 1979 seizure of the U.S. hostages in Tehran, economic sanctions have formed a major part of U.S. policy toward Iran. On November 14, 1979, President Carter declared a national emergency with respect to Iran, renewed every year since 1979. Terrorism List. Following the October 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Lebanon, believed perpetrated by Iranian allies, Iran was added to the ""terrorism list"" in January 1984. The designation bans direct U.S. financial assistance and arms sales, restricts sales of U.S. dual use items, and requires the United States to oppose multilateral lending to the designated countries. For information on U.S. sanctions on foreign suppliers of arms and technology, see CRS Report RL30551, Iran: Arms and Technology Acquisitions. Counternarcotics. In February 1987, Iran was first designated as a state that failed to cooperate with U.S. anti-drug efforts or take adequate steps to control narcotics production or trafficking. U.S. and U.N. Drug Control Program (UNDCP) assessments of drug production in Iran prompted the Clinton Administration, on December 7, 1998, to remove Iran from the U.S. list of major drug producing countries. The decision exempts Iran from the annual certification process that kept drug-related U.S. sanctions in place on Iran. In late January 1999, Iran allowed the UNDCP to open an office in Tehran. Press reports indicate that Britain has sold Iran small arms for its anti-drug efforts on the Afghan border. Trade Ban. On May 6, 1995, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12959 banning U.S. trade and investment in Iran, including the trading of Iranian oil overseas by U.S. companies. This followed an earlier March 1995 executive order barring U.S. investment in Iran's energy sector, and, although modified, has been extended each year since. On March 13, 2001, President Bush renewed the declaration of a state of emergency that triggered the March 1995 investment ban. An August 1997 amendment to the trade ban (Executive Order 13059) prevented U.S. companies from knowingly exporting goods to a third country for incorporation into products destined for Iran. The trade ban was partly intended to blunt criticism that U.S. trade with Iran made U.S. appeals for multilateral containment of Iran less credible. Some goods related to the safe operation of civilian aircraft can be licensed for export to Iran, and in December 1999, the Clinton Administration allowed the repair of engine mountings on seven Iran Air 747's (Boeing). Implementing regulations do not permit U.S. firms to negotiate investment deals with Iran, and, in November 2000, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC, Department of Treasury) warned U.S. firms against co-sponsoring energy-related conferences with Iran.   IB93033  CRS-10  01-14-02  Following a 1998 application by a U.S. firm to sell Iran agricultural products, and in the context of Clinton Administration and congressional reviews of U.S. unilateral sanctions policies, the Clinton Administration announced in April 1999 that it would license, on a caseby-case basis, commercial sales of food and medical products to certain countries on which unilateral U.S. trade bans are in place (Iran, Libya, and Sudan). Under regulations issued in July 1999, private letters of credit can be used to finance approved sales, but no U.S. government credit guarantees were made available and U.S. exporters were not permitted to deal directly with Iranian banks. Iran says the lack of credit makes U.S. sales, particularly of wheat, uncompetitive. The FY2001 agriculture appropriations (P.L. 106-387), contains a provision banning the use of official credit guarantees for food and medical sales to Iran and other countries on the U.S. terrorism list, except Cuba, although allowing for a presidential waiver to permit such credit guarantees. (In the 107th Congress, S.171, introduced January 24, 2001, would repeal this provision.) The Clinton Administration did not provide credit guarantees, and the Bush Administration has not indicated whether it will do so. In her March 17, 2000 speech, then Secretary Albright announced an easing of the trade ban to allow U.S. importation of Iranian nuts, dried fruits, carpets, and caviar. Regulations governing the sales were issued in April 2000. The United States was the largest market for Iranian carpets before the 1979 revolution, although U.S. anti-dumping tariffs imposed on Iranian pistachio nut imports in 1986 (about 300%) and still in effect are dampening imports of that product. Iranian caviar began arriving in the United States in May 2000, and Iranian carpets are being sold in the United States, estimated to be a $100 million per year market. The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA). The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA, H.R. 3107, P.L. 104-172, signed August 5, 1996), a law that sanctions foreign investment in Iran or Libya's energy sector, was scheduled to expire on August 5, 2001. H.R. 1954, which renewed ILSA for five years but requires an Administration report on its effectiveness within 24-30 months, was passed by large majorities in both chambers in July 2001. It was signed on August 3, 2001 (P.L. 107-24). For further discussion of ILSA and its renewal, see CRS Report RS20871, The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA). Caspian/Central Asian Energy Routes Through Iran. The U.S. trade ban permits U.S. companies to apply for licenses to conduct ""swaps"" of Caspian Sea oil with Iran, but, as part of a U.S. policy to route Central Asian energy around Iran (and Russia), a Mobil Corporation application to do so was denied in April 1999. The Administration continues to oppose, and to threaten imposing ILSA sanctions on, pipeline projects that route Caspian/Central Asian energy through Iran. U.S. policy has been to strongly favor construction of a pipeline that would cross the Caspian Sea and let out in Ceyhan, Turkey (Baku-Ceyhan pipeline), avoiding Iran or Russia. Four Caspian nations (Turkey, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan) signed an agreement embracing Baku-Ceyhan on November 18, 1999, and support for the project among oil companies and regional governments has gained momentum over the past few months. A detailed engineering study is under way. However, in a potential setback to Baku-Ceyhan, it was reported in late May 2001 that Kazakhstan will ask Totalfina Elf to study construction of an oil pipeline across Iran. In December 2001, Kazakhstan's President Nazarbayev urged visiting Secretary of State Powell to reconsider U.S. policy to allow oil routes through Iran; Powell reiterated U.S. policy but did not reject the request outright. Russia, which seeks to route oil and gas lines through it, reportedly also favors a route from Kazakhstan through Iran. Despite U.S. pressure not to import Iranian gas, Turkey has begun to do so through a new cross-border pipeline, under an August 1996 bilateral agreement. (See CRS Report 98-86, Iran: Relations With Key Central Asian States.)   IB93033  CRS-11  01-14-02  European and Japanese Relations With/Lending to Iran. U.S.-allied differences on Iran narrowed since 1998 in concert with the Clinton Administration's attempt to engage Iran, a policy consistently favored by the European countries as a way to moderate Iran's behavior. During 1992-1997, the European Union (EU) countries maintained a policy of ""critical dialogue"" with Iran. The United States did not oppose those talks with Iran but maintained that the EU's dialogue would not change Iranian behavior. The dialogue was suspended immediately following the April 1997 German terrorism trial that found high-level Iranian involvement in assassinating Iranian dissidents in Germany. Simultaneous with the U.S. shift toward engagement, the EU-Iran dialogue formally resumed in May 1998, about eight months after Khatemi took office. Since then, Khatemi has undertaken state visits to several Western countries, including Italy (March 1999), France (October 1999), Germany (July 2000), and Japan (November 2000). The United States publicly welcomed these visits. The resolution of the ""Rushdie affair"" to Britain's satisfaction sparked improvement in its relations with Iran. Iran maintains that Ayatollah Khomeini's 1989 death sentence against author Salman Rushdie cannot be revoked (his ""Satanic Verses"" novel was labeled blasphemous) because Khomeini is no longer alive to revoke it. However, on September 24, 1998, Iran's Foreign Minister pledged to Britain that Iran will not seek to implement the sentence and opposes any bounties offered for his death. Britain then upgraded relations with Iran to the ambassadorial level, and Foreign Ministers of the two countries have exchanged visits. In October 2000, the United Kingdom began extending longer term credit (two years or greater) for exports to Iran. Some Iranian clerics (outside the formal government structure) have said the death sentence stands, and the Iranian government has not required the Fifteen Khordad foundation to withdraw its $2.8 million reward for Rushdie's death. Khatemi said on June 4, 2001 that he considers the issue closed. In August 1999, Japan's Foreign Minister continued a gradual improvement in relations with Iran by visiting that country and announcing that Japan would resume its official development lending program for Iran to construct a hydroelectric dam over the Karun River. However, the $70 million increment announced was less that Iran had wanted, and Japan said that this tranche would close out Japan's involvement in the project. (In 1993, Japan provided the first $400 million tranche of the overall $1.4 billion official development loan program, but the lending was subsequently placed on hold as the United States sought to persuade its allies to pressure Iran.) In late January 2000, Japan agreed to resume mediumand long-term (two years or longer) export credit insurance for exports to Iran, suspended since 1994. Economic relations improved further during Khatemi's November 2000 visit to Tokyo, which resulted in Japan's commitment to provide insurance cover for over $500 million in private sector projects, including refurbishment of steel and petrochemical plants. Iran also granted Japanese firms the first right to negotiate to develop the large Azadegan field, and Iran and a Japanese-led consortium are moving forward with preliminary studies of the field. Some press reports suggest that Royal Dutch/Shell might join the Azadegan project, apparently because it can provide needed technology. In exchange, Japan agreed to prepay Iran $1 billion per year for the next 3 years for Iranian oil. Partly at U.S. urging, Japan refused to extend to Iran additional official loans. During 1994-1995, and over U.S. objections at the time, Iran's European and Japanese creditors rescheduled about $16 billion in Iranian debt. These countries (governments and private creditors) rescheduled the debt bilaterally, in spite of Paris Club rules that call for multilateral rescheduling and International Monetary Fund (IMF) involvement. Iran has worked its external debt down from $32 billion in 1997 to $7.8 billion as of April 2001, according to Iran's Central Bank. Iran plans to retire about half of that remaining debt by   IB93033  CRS-12  01-14-02  March 2002. The improved debt picture has led most European export credit agencies, including Germany's Hermes, France's COFACE, and that of Spain, to restore insurance cover for exports to Iran. In October 1999, Dutch banks extended $2 billion in credits to investors in Iran. In July 2000, Germany increased its export insurance cover from $100 million to $500 million in conjunction with Khatemi's visit there. In July 2001, France's Societe Generale de France extended a $1 billion credit line to a group of Iranian commercial banks. In early September 2001, Iran and the EU met to discuss a possible trade pact that would lower the tariffs or increase quotas for Iranian exports to the EU countries. In August 2001, Iran announced it would tap international capital markets for the first time since the Islamic revolution by issuing a $280 million Eurobond. Multilateral Lending to Iran/WTO. Section 1621 of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-132) amended the Foreign Assistance Act to require the United States to vote against international loans to countries on the U.S. terrorism list. Acting under provisions of successive foreign aid laws, in 1993 the United States voted its 16.5% share of the World Bank against loans to Iran of $460 million for electricity, health, and irrigation projects. To signal opposition to international lending to Iran, the FY1994 foreign aid appropriations act (P.L. 103-87) cut the Administration's request for the U.S. contribution to the World Bank by the amount of those loans. That law, the FY1995 foreign aid appropriation (P.L. 103-326), and the FY1996 foreign aid appropriations (P.L. 104-107), would have significantly reduced U.S. payments to the Bank if it had provided new loans to Iran. The legislation contributed to the Bank's refusal to approve any new lending to since then. By 1999, Iran's moderating image had led the World Bank to consider new loans. In May 2000, the United States was unsuccessful in obtaining further delay on a vote on new lending for Iran, and its allies outvoted the United States to approve $232 million in loans for health and sewage projects. Twenty one of the Bank's twenty four governors voted in favor, and France and Canada abstained. Earlier, Iran also had asked the International Monetary Fund for about $400 million in loans (its quota is about $2 billion) to help it deal with its trade financing shortfalls. However, Iran balked at accepting IMF conditionality, and discussions broke off. Despite the required U.S. opposition, on May 10, 2001, the World Bank's executive directors voted to approve a two-year economic reform strategy for Iran that envisions $775 million in new Bank loans. Voting on the actual loans is expected in the spring of 2002. On May 8, 2001, the World Trade Organization, at U.S. urging, postponed until July 2001 a discussion on whether to launch entry talks with Iran. On July 18, 2001, and again on October 10, 2001, the United States achieved further postponements in considering Iran's application for admission, although the Administration says that position is ""under review."" Iranian officials indicate to U.S. visitors that the dropping of U.S. opposition to Iran's membership in the WTO would be taken as a positive U.S. gesture. Assets Disputes/Victims of Terrorism. Iran claims that the United States has frozen vast amounts of Iranian assets, presenting an obstacle to improved relations. A U.S.Iran Claims Tribunal, at the Hague, is arbitrating cases resulting from the break in relations following the Iranian revolution. The major cases yet to be decided center on hundreds of Foreign Military Sales cases between the United States and the Shah's regime, which Iran claims it paid for but were unfulfilled. About $400 million in proceeds from the resale of that equipment is in a DOD account. In April 2000, then Secretary Albright named a representative to negotiate a resolution of the claims issue at the Hague. The assets issue moved to the forefront following several U.S. court judgements against Iran for past acts of terrorism against Americans, filed under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective   IB93033  CRS-13  01-14-02  Death Penalty Act of 1996. Since March 1998, U.S. courts have awarded the following: $247 million to the family of Alisa Flatow, killed in Israel in April 1995 in a bombing by Palestinian Islamic Jihad (awarded in March 1998); $65 million to three Americans held hostage in Lebanon: David Jacobsen, Joseph Cicippio, and Frank Reed (August 1998); $324 for Lebanon hostage Terry Anderson (March 2000); $327 million to the families of two Americans killed in a February 1996 Hamas bombing (July 2000); and $355 million to the family of Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, killed by Hizballah in 1989 (September 2000). Former Lebanon hostage Thomas Sutherland won a $353 million judgement against Iran on June 26, 2001. In August 2001, the family of former Lebanon hostage father Lawrence Jenco won a $314.6 million judgment against Iran for his captivity. In June 2001, former hostages Benjamin Weir and Frank Regier sued Iran for over $100 million for their captivity in Lebanon. Also in early June 2001, the family of former hostage Peter Kilburn, who was killed in the course of his captivity in Lebanon, filed a suit against both Libya and Iran for more than $200 million. In mid-October 2001, the Bush Administration asked a federal judge to throw out a lawsuit against Iran by the 52 Americans held hostage by Iran for 444 days. On the basis of the sanctity of diplomatic property, the Clinton Administration blocked efforts by the claimants to satisfy their judgments from frozen Iranian assets -- diplomatic property in Washington (worth about $22 million) or the DOD account mentioned above. In December 1999, the Clinton Administration also blocked a Flatow effort to seize a $6 million U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal judgement awarded to Iran. A provision of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (H.R. 3244, P.L. 106-386) provides for the use of general revenues to pay 110% of compensatory damage awards to the above and future successful claimants in a total not to exceed the rental proceeds from Iran's diplomatic property and the DOD account. The provision requires the President to try to recoup the expended funds from Iran as part of an overall reconciliation in relations and assets settlement, although there is no requirement that funds ultimately be withheld from Iran. A provision of the FY2002 Commerce, Justice, State appropriation (P.L. 107-77) requires an Administration legislative proposal on how to compensate successful U.S. claimants in future terrorism-related judgments against Iran. Regarding the mistaken U.S. shootdown on July 3,1988 of an Iranian Airbus passenger jet, on February 22, 1996, the United States, responding to an Iranian case before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), agreed to pay Iran up to $61.8 million in compensation ($300,000 per wage earning victim, $150,000 per non wage earner) for the 248 Iranians killed in the shootdown. The funds for this settlement came from a general appropriation for judgments against the United States. The United States previously paid $3 million in death benefits for 47 non-Iranians killed in the attack, but has not compensated Iran for the airplane itself. A different case, pending before the ICJ, involves an Iranian claim for damages to Iranian oil platforms during U.S. naval clashes with Iran in October 1987 and April 1988. Related Issues. Use of U.S. passports for travel to Iran is permitted, but a State Department travel warning, softened somewhat in April 1998, asks that Americans ""defer"" travel to Iran. Iranians entering the United States are fingerprinted, although Secretary Albright implied in her March 17, 2000 speech that this practice would be eliminated. U.S. regulations do not bar disaster relief and the United States donated $125,000, through relief agencies, to help victims of two earthquakes in Iran (February and May 1997).   IB93033  CRS-14  01-14-02  Military Containment U.S. policy has focused on containing the military threat posed by Iran to the United States, U.S. allies in the Persian Gulf, and international shipping. Although containing Iraq has been the primary goal of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf region since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, U.S. military officials note that U.S. forces can also be used to monitor and deter Iran, if necessary. U.S. military officers note that their encounters with Iranian naval vessels in the Gulf have been more professional and less tense since Khatemi took office.  Iran's Opposition Movements On February 8, 1995, then House Speaker Newt Gingrich said that a U.S. policy supporting the overthrow of Iran's regime was the only policy that made sense. The Administration accepted a House-Senate conference agreement to include $18-$20 million in funding authority for covert operations against Iran in the FY1996 intelligence authorization act (H.R. 1655, P.L. 104-93) -- about $14 million more than requested -- according to a Washington Post report of December 22, 1995. The Clinton Administration reportedly succeeded in focusing the covert aid on changing the regime's behavior, rather than its overthrow. The conference report on H.R. 2267 (H.Rept. 105-405), the FY1998 Commerce/State/ Justice appropriation, provided $4 million for a ""Radio Free Iran,"" to be run by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). The radio, which the Administration is calling the Farsi service of RFE/RL, began operations in Prague on October 31, 1998. Another $4 million for the radio for FY1999 was provided by the omnibus appropriation (H.R. 4328, P.L. 105-277). (See CRS Report 98-539, Radio Free Iraq and Radio Free Iran: Background, Legislation, and Policy Issues for Congress.) Since the late 1980s, the State Department has refused contact with the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI) and its umbrella organization, the National Council of Resistance (NCR). It was designated as a foreign terrorist organization in October 1997 under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. On October 8, 1999, the PMOI's umbrella organization, the National Council of Resistance (NCR), was designated an alias of the PMOI, subjecting it to the same restrictions as apply to the PMOI (no visits by its members to the United States, seizure of its U.S. assets, and a ban on U.S. resident contributions to the group). The State Department's annual terrorism review, issued in April 2000, cited several PMOI attacks on Iran as justifying Iran's claim that Iran is a victim of terrorism. Many in Congress appear to differ with the Administration view of the group and majorities in Congress have occasionally signed letters asking the Secretary of State to explore the possibility of working with the PMOI against Iran. On October 11, 2000, a letter signed by 225 House Members and 28 Senators was released, calling for support for the NCR and deploring Iran's human rights record. Among its recent activities in Iran, the PMOI claimed responsibility for assassinating a senior Iranian military officer in Tehran in April 2000. The United States condemned the killing. The PMOI claimed responsibility for a mortar attack on the presidential palace on February 6, 2000; Khatemi was not hurt. On March 13, 2000, the PMOI claimed responsibility for launching a mortar attack in Tehran, although it missed its target and hit an apartment complex. In August 2000, the PMOI claimed responsibility for a mortar attack on an army base in Tehran, and the group's supporters in Iran have been putting up posters of the group's leaders, Masud and Maryam Rajavi. On January 21, 2001, the PMOI claimed responsibility for a rocket attack on a court in Tehran, and, on February 20, 2001, its Iraqbased military arm made a brief incursion into Iran, clashing with local security forces. Iran's   IB93033  CRS-15  01-14-02  agents and military forces frequently retaliate against the group's personnel and facilities in Iraq. Seven alleged members were arrested in Los Angeles in March 2001 for allegedly raising money for the organization, and subsequently were indicted. (See CRS Report 97-961, Iran: The People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran.) Some Iranian exiles follow the son of the late former Shah, who lives in the United States. On January 24, 2001, the Shah's son, Reza Pahlavi, 40 years old, ended a long period of inactivity by giving a speech in Washington calling for unity in opposition to the current regime and for the institution of a constitutional monarchy and genuine democracy in Iran. He has since broadcast messages into Iran from a station in California, and press reports say a growing number of Iranians are listening to his broadcasts."
GX005-39-0432272	FROM THE OFFICE OF           PUBLIC AFFAIRS              September 16, 2003 JS-734 Financial Reconstruction in Iraq:  Strategy and Tactics John B. Taylor Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee Subcommittee on International Trade and Finance Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee Subcommittee on International Trade and Finance   Chairman Hagel, Ranking Member Bayh, other members of the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to testify on the financial reconstruction of Iraq.  Given the importance of trade and finance for Iraqs reconstruction, this Subcommittee is an ideal forum for this discussion.  And the presence of my colleagues, Under Secretary Larson and Chairman Merrill, further underscores the importance of active government-wide participation in the reconstruction effort.      When I last testified on this subject, on June 4 before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I stressed that the international community and the Iraqi people face an enormous task in the reconstruction of the Iraqi economy.  A quarter century of repression and economic mismanagement under Saddam Hussein cut the size of the economy to only a small fraction of what it was before his regime took over.  In 1979 GDP in Iraq was $128 billion...by 2001 it had declined to $40 billion.  I also stressed the strategy of financial reconstructionthe contingency plans developed in advance of the military conflictand the tactics followed on the ground since the conflict began.  I would like to stress these same issues in my testimony today, with emphasis on the additional information we have obtained on the state of the Iraqi economy and on what has happened on the ground during the summer months.     Much has been accomplished in the financial area since the fall of Saddam Husseins repressive regime, and many potential financial catastrophes have been avoided. In my view, months of advance planning by the United States government before Saddams fall as well as the dedicated work of the Coalition Provisional Authority and the Iraqi people since Saddams fall are responsible for these accomplishments.     Starting late last year, we began developing a strategy for financial reconstruction based on the information we had at the time.  The strategy addressed such issues as (1) payments to Iraqi workers and pensioners, (2) the currency, (3) the banking system, (4) Iraqs international debt, (5) an assessment of reconstruction costs, and (6) the international fundraising efforts.  I want to review how that strategy is playing out today.  But before doing so I must emphasize that an important part of our advance planning has been the selection of people to participate in the financial reconstruction effort.  We began selecting financial experts in January; the first wave of people was deployed to Kuwait in March and to Baghdad in April. Early on we decided that a financial coordinator was essential and we are very grateful to Peter McPherson who took leave from the Presidency of Michigan State University and has served most ably in this position, advising Ambassador Bremer and the rest of the Coalition Provisional Authority.     A Strategy for Paying Workers and Pensioners   It was clear that we had to have a strategy for paying Iraqi workers and pensioners after the fall of Saddam Hussein, and thus we crafted a strategy well in advance of his fall.  Keeping workers on the payroll with stable purchasing power would be essential to prevent severe hardship and economic collapse. But how many workers were there and how much should they be paid?  What currency should be used to make the payments?  Where would the funds come from?  Would the payments system be in good enough condition after the conflict to actually make payments?  How could we prevent hyperinflation and a sharp depreciation of the currency, which would further impoverish people?  After all, one of the reasons for the terrible economic performance under Saddam was that he resorted to the printing press to finance his spending, causing high inflation and a drop in the dinar to about 1/5000th of its former value.     Starting late last year we developed such a payments strategy, which was approved interagency after much valuable discussion and debate about alternative strategies. The strategy called for paying workers and pensioners in U.S. dollars on an interim basis.  This was not dollarizing the economy, because the strategy called for the continued use of local currenciessuch as the Saddam dinar in the center and south and the Swiss dinar in the northand their eventual replacement by a new national currency, as described below.  Using U.S. dollars on an interim basis would create stability and would help prevent a collapse of the dinar.     Finding a way to secure the funds to make these payments in advance of the conflict proved to be a challenge.  After much discussion and debate, we decided that the best approach was to use Iraqi regime assets that were frozen at U.S. commercial banks back in 1990 at the time of the first Gulf War.  In order to use the assets for this purpose, they had to be vested for the use of the Iraqi people.  Our estimates were that there was about $1.7 billion that could be vested in the United States and that this amount would probably be sufficient to last until a new currency could be issued in Iraq.  A vesting strategy was worked out and approved by interagency legal experts.  Under this plan the President would call for the vesting of the assets in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York near the time that the military conflict began.   To make such a strategy operational, many tactical issues and contingencies had to be considered.  For example, the plan called for the military on the ground to issue public statementsworked out with the Departments of Defense and Treasurythat the dinar would continue to be accepted as a means of payment after the fall of the Saddam regime. The plan also called for the first wave of financial advisers into Baghdad to assess the payments systems capability for making dollar payments.    Another essential operational issue concerned the actual shipping of the currency to Iraq, and a plan for making the payments to workers and pensioners on the ground had to be developed.  We estimated that enough currency in the right denominations was in storage in the New York Feds warehouse in East Rutherford, New Jersey, and we determined that it was feasible to ship the currency by tractor trailer to Andrews Air Force Base, load it on military aircraft, and fly it to Camp Arifjan in Kuwait for the last leg into Iraq. Many tons of currency were involved because of the need for small denominations:  one-dollar or five-dollar bills.  On the ground, the military would assist in the actual shipment of the currency around the country. Financial experts would develop lists of eligible workers and pensioners who would be paid. The currency would be distributed to Iraqis who would then actually make the payments.  In some cases, the currency would be paid at the state owned enterprises or government ministries.  In other cases, pensioners would come to local banks to receive payments.     I am pleased to say that this strategy along with all its tactical details has been carried out with great success.  On March 20, at the start of the conflict, President Bush issued an order calling for the vesting of the frozen assets.  As a result, approximately $1.7 billion was vested in the New York Fed.  With these funds at the New York Fed, the first shipment of currency from the Feds East Rutherford, New Jersey warehouse to Camp Arifjan was made on April 13.  Even as major combat operations were winding down, a mechanism for shipment of cash and distribution of emergency payments was established and began to function.  Thanks to this system, we were able to make monthly emergency payments to dock workers, rail workers, power plant workers, and others essential to restoring basic services.  We soon transitioned to regular civil service salary and pension payments to over 2 million Iraqis.     Despite tremendous logistical challenges, the system of payments has worked well.  Our financial experts in Baghdad consider this to be a major force for stability in the country, as well as a significant spur to economic growth.  As of this date all but $64 million of the vested assets has been shipped to Iraq where they have been used principally to support salary and pension payments to the Iraqi people.  The Department of Defenses logistical support has been crucial in this enormous undertaking.     Throughout this period there has been no collapse of the currency, no hyperinflation, and no serious glitch in the payments process itself.  In sum, this major and essential success in the reconstruction was due in large part to pre-conflict planning and to adjustments that were made as we implemented the plan and learned from experience.                                                                                                                                                                A New Unified Currency for Iraq    As I indicated, the payments strategy called for the use of U.S. dollars on an interim basis only.  Our goal was for the Iraqi people to choose a new national currency to replace the Saddam dinar and the Swiss dinar, and to provide the necessary financial and logistical assistance to do so.  A stable unified currency is an essential part of a market economy and therefore one of the key parts of financial reconstruction.       I am happy to say that this part of the financial reconstruction strategy is on track as well.  Last July 7, after consulting with representatives from the Central Bank, the finance ministry, and other interested Iraqis in the north and the south, the Coalition Provisional Authority announced that a new currency would be issued starting in October.  The new currency would replace the old currencies at fixed rates that were also announced.   Hence, the Coalition Provisional Authority and Iraqi officials in the Central Bank and the finance ministry are about to begin one of the most important parts of the financial reconstruction to date:  issuing a new currency to replace the Iraqi currencies that are now circulating.  The new currency is a key component in the effort to establish a stable financial system.     The new currency bears the designs of the old Iraqi, or Swiss, dinar and is being produced at printing facilities around the world on schedule.  There will be six denominations to replace the current two denominations.  About 2200 tons of currency will be shipped from printing facilities in England, Spain, and other countries.  A sufficient supply of new notes will be available when they are introduced.     The exchange period will begin on October 15 and last until January 15.  A public education campaign is underway in Iraq to ensure that the Iraqi people are well informed about the new currency and are prepared for the currency exchange.  The new currency will improve the ease of transactions, since it will be issued in more denominations than are currently available, and will have built-in security features that will enhance public confidence by making the notes more difficult to counterfeit.     Restoring and Revitalizing the Banking Sector   We knew well before hostilities began that strengthening and modernizing Iraqs financial sector would be central to achieving overall economic reconstruction, and that a thorough on-the-ground assessment of Iraqs financial sector would be needed as soon as conditions allowed.  Thanks to extensive pre-war planning, Treasury was able to position advisors in Iraqs finance ministry, Central Bank and two main commercial banks even as hostilities were winding down.     The challenges they faced to perform seemingly simple tasks, such as schedule a meeting with Iraqi bankers, were enormous due to security concerns, the lack of working phones or faxes, and language barriers.  Despite these difficulties, I am pleased to report some major successes.     One of the most important is the reopening of most of the branches of Iraqs two large state-owned banks  Rafidain and Rasheed  which enabled cash-strapped Iraqi families to gain access to their savings.   Opening these branches was no small feat.   Many of the banks branches were damaged and we were fearful of a bank run once the banks reopened.  Due to careful planning, individual Iraqis now have access to their deposits and there were no bank runs.    The initial assessments conducted by our advisors have provided much insight into the operations of Rafidain and Rasheed banks.  As our pre-planning analyses indicated, these banks did not function independently of the former regime.  We now know that these banks were not permitted to make loans based on commercial viability and a borrowers ability to repay, but instead on the ability of the borrower to fulfill a Baathist party political objective.  The Coalition Provisional Authority, with the support of Treasury, is hard at work reviewing ideas for restructuring the two major state-owned banks.       Analyses of Iraqs private banks are almost complete.  While these banks are small in relation to the two large state-owned banks, they will play a role in Iraqs future.  We know that remittances through these banks are starting to occur.  Remittances by Iraqis overseas will soon form a large pool of resources in Iraq that will finance investment and consumption.  According to some estimates, about 4 million Iraqis live abroad, and in recent years they have transferred over $1 billion per year to relatives in Iraq.   In addition to strengthening specific banks, the financial system more broadly  including the relevant laws and regulations  will require significant work to ensure that an efficient and effective system for financial intermediation is achieved.  In consultation with the International Monetary Fund, we are working with the Iraqi Governing Council, other Iraqi officials, and the Iraq Bankers Association on a revision of Iraqs Central Bank law and commercial banking law.  Creating a sound supervisory and regulatory regime is also critical to establishing a strong financial system.   We have reached out to countries in the region, including Jordan, Bahrain, and the UAE, who have offered to provide technical training to Central Bank and commercial bank employees.     As work proceeds on these broad objectives, some initial bank lending has started, with the focus on loans directed towards Iraqi small- and medium-sized enterprises.  Additionally, the Treasury has approached the International Finance Corporation, the private sector arm of the World Bank, about setting up a facility in Iraq to provide loans to micro-, small- and medium-sized businesses.  This would be a multilateral facility modeled after other highly successful programs in Russia, Central Asia and Southeast Europe.     One major initiative that is now getting off the ground is the creation of the Trade Bank of Iraq.  This Iraqi-staffed institution will facilitate imports to and exports from Iraq by putting in place the people and systems needed for the country to trade more efficiently and on a larger scale with the rest of the world.  Currently, trade is taking place at the retail level.  In Baghdads markets one can find consumer goods  from refrigerators to satellite disks  imported from neighboring countries.  But in order for Iraqs reconstruction to move forward as quickly as possible, and for private sector activity to take off, there needs to be an efficient system for importing a broad range of capital goods and services.  Our goal is for Iraqi banks to provide trade finance services.  But as the process of strengthening Iraqi banks goes forward, there is an immediate need to do this.  The Trade Bank of Iraq is intended to fill that gap.   Following a competitive bidding process, the CPA is negotiating a contract with a consortium of international banks which will facilitate the operations of the Trade Bank.  Additionally, the Trade Bank will be the entity by which Export Credit Agencies around the world support trade with Iraq.  There is precedent in creating institutions such as the Trade Bank in post-war Japan and Germany.  Those institutions evolved and took on functions akin to export-import banks, although how the Trade Bank evolves will be up to the Iraqi people.       Iraqs International Debt   Early on we recognized that dealing with Iraqs substantial foreign debt problem would be crucial to the countrys medium-term economic health.  We therefore developed a strategy to resolve this problem.     First, using the financial information we had, we ensured that Iraq would not have to service its debt following the end of the war and during the critical reconstruction phase.  Demands for repayment would have greatly reduced the resources available to a new Iraqi government.  Therefore, we secured recognition from the G7 that Iraq would not service its external debt at least through the end of 2004.  Subsequently, the Paris Club group of official creditors stated their expectation that Iraq would not make payments over this time period.   Next we sought to obtain the best possible data on Iraqs foreign debt and its economic condition.  Without any reliable data, it would be difficult to reach an international consensus on a debt strategy.  We began collecting data by sending several technical assistance advisors to Iraq to review the governments debt records once the war ended.  At the same time, we worked intensively through the Paris Club and the International Monetary Fund to obtain data from creditors.     We have made significant progress.  The latest available information indicates that Iraqs external debt amounts to at least $70 billion and is probably closer to $100 to $120 billion.  Paris Club members report that they are owed roughly $40 billion -- $21 billion in principal and roughly an equivalent amount in late interest.  The IMF has polled non-Paris Club governments and, as of September 10, reports creditor claims of $28 billion in principal and interest.  Since 20 governments have yet to respond to the IMF poll, this figure is likely to increase.      With better data in hand, we can now proceed with our strategy and work out a long-term solution to Iraqs debt problem.  We will continue to work with other creditors toward the objective of achieving a substantial restructuring of Iraqs debt that will permit the Iraqi government to channel resources into reconstruction activities.   Assessment of Reconstruction Costs and International Fundraising Efforts   We also knew at the outset that one of the major priorities following the conflict would be to produce a comprehensive assessment of reconstruction costs in Iraq.   We recognized that we could not focus solely on the costs of repairing the damage inflicted during the short conflict.  Saddam Husseins total disregard for the welfare of his population likely meant that the needs of the Iraqi people  and the cost of reversing decades of economic decline  would be substantial.     Because of the extent of Iraqs isolation from the international community, we had little reliable information regarding the extent to which critical investments had been neglected.  We were concerned that the absence of economic data and other information would make the job of producing a timely needs assessment especially challenging.  We engaged early with our fellow shareholders and with senior officials from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to create a process for making a needs assessment as soon as the environment was permissible.  As a result of these discussions, these institutions acted quickly to develop the scope of the assessment, divide up responsibility for different sectors, and recruit the necessary staff.       We expect that the cost for reconstruction will be in the range of $50 to $75 billion.  This estimate covers critical infrastructure needs in electricity, public works, transport, telecommunications, health, education and agricultural sectors, among others.  But it excludes the annual expenses that have been identified by the Coalition Provisional Authority to cover the government operating budget.      Clearly, this is a cost that will need to be shared widely, and underscores the importance of a major donor effort for Iraq.  In June, we established a Core Group of donors, consisting of Japan, the EC and the United Arab Emirates, to consult regularly with the UN, World Bank, IMF and CPA, on the planning and preparation for the donor conference.  The members of this group are engaging intensively with other potential donors to urge them to pledge generously at the donor meeting in Madrid on October 24.   We believe our own substantial contribution of $20 billion  as reflected in the Presidents forthcoming supplemental request  will be critical to leveraging support from other governments.    In addition, we are encouraging the international financial institutions to commit their own resources to the people of Iraq.  As you are aware, the IMF and World Bank recalled their staff following the bombing of UN headquarters where they were also housed.  However, these institutions remain actively engaged on Iraq, and are continuing to work with CPA and Iraqi officials, providing technical assistance and finalizing the needs assessment.  The World Bank  in conjunction with the UN  is also completing the design of a multi-donor trust fund that would pool bilateral donations and make them available for priority needs identified by these agencies in their needs assessments.  In addition to these vital contributions, we have made good progress in our discussions with the IMF and the World Bank on identifying the type and amounts of resources that could be made available to the Iraqi people once the conditions for lending are in place.   In a related exercise, we are reaching out to Export Credit Agencies (ECAs) around the world, encouraging them to follow the U.S. Ex-Im Banks efforts to support investments in Iraq by insuring repayments.  Many other governments have responded positively to this effort, including Japan and the United Kingdom.  Through credit facilities such as the one proposed by Ex-Im Bank, credit agencies will be able to provide short-term export credits worth several billion dollars.  Initiatives like this will be very important for supporting trade, facilitating commercial activity and spurring growth in Iraq.     Countries other than the U.S. have been identifying and freezing assets of the Hussein regime in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1483.  Over $1 billion of such assets has been identified and frozen.  We are working hard to encourage countries that have frozen assets to transfer those funds to the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI), where they will assist in the reconstruction of the country.  We have already had some success in these efforts, including a transfer of approximately $98 million to the DFI announced by Japan on August 29.      Conclusion   Achieving a stable and productive economy is central to our goal of a unified and prosperous Iraq.  We have made considerable progress on financial reconstruction over the last several months, thanks to extensive advance planning and the work of many dedicated professionals from the U.S., Coalition partners, and Iraq.  Our activities will only intensify in the coming months.  While the challenges are formidable, we are well on the way to establishing a vibrant economy that creates opportunities for all Iraqis to achieve a better future for themselves and their children.

GX035-65-0959584	"Iceland Country Reports on Human Rights Practices   -   2001 Released by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor March 4, 2002 Iceland is a constitutional republic and a parliamentary democracy in which citizens periodically choose their representatives in free and fair multiparty elections.  The Government respects the constitutional provisions for an independent judiciary in practice.    Elected officials control the police force, which is responsible for internal security and observes and enforces the laws that ensure the protection of human rights.   The country has a population of approximately 286,000.  The mixed, open economy provides residents with a high standard of living.  The gross domestic product during the year was estimated at $8 billion.  Fish and other marine products account for almost two-thirds of the country's revenue from goods exports.  An abundance of inexpensive hydroelectric power provides a comparative advantage for aluminum smelting, the main manufacturing activity.  Aluminum is the second leading export.  Growth was estimated to be approximately 2 percent during the year.   The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law and judiciary provide effective means of dealing with individual instances of abuse.  Human rights monitors expressed concern about the Government's frequent use of solitary confinement for remand prisoners.  The Government is taking steps to deal with violence against women.  Some societal discrimination against women persists, especially in the area of equal pay.  There were reports of trafficking in women for prostitution.   RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS   Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:    a. Arbitrary or Unlawful Deprivation of Life   There were no reports of the arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of life committed by the Government or its agents.     b. Disappearance   There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.   c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment   The law prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that government officials employed them.     Prison conditions generally meet international standards.  Most of the country's prison population of less than 100 inmates are held at Litla Hraun Prison, which includes a state-of-the-art detention facility.  However, the prison system still uses a substandard jail (Hegningarhusid, built in 1874), where the 16 individual cells lack toilets and sinks.  In most cases, prisoners are kept in Hegningarhusid Prison only a short time for evaluation and processing before being transferred to another facility, and some prisoners with short sentences (less than 30 days) elect to serve their time there to be closer to friends and family.   Human rights monitors have expressed concern about the use of illegal drugs by some inmates at Litla Hraun Prison and about the lack of social services to help inmates overcome drug addiction and prepare them for eventual release.  Despite the small inmate population at Litla Hraun, the authorities have not been able to stop narcotics from being smuggled into the prison.   In a 1999 report, the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) expressed concern that nearly all detainees at Litla Hraun continued to be placed in solitary confinement while their cases were under investigation.  While the average duration of solitary confinement was between 2 and 3 weeks, the CPT noted that in some cases, solitary confinement lasted up to 3 months.  Under the strictest form of solitary confinement, prisoners cannot leave their cells, except briefly to exercise alone or to use the showers, and are not allowed to listen to the radio, watch television, or receive visitors other than their lawyers, the prison doctor, and a chaplain.  In 1999 the supervising doctor at Litla Hraun wrote to prison authorities, warning that the mental health of several prisoners awaiting trial on drug trafficking charges could be in danger due to the extended time that they spent in solitary confinement.  During the year, the ombudsman of the Parliament investigated the use of solitary confinement as a punishment for violations of prison regulations.  He concluded that the Ministry of Justice needed to adopt clearer guidelines to prevent the arbitrary use of solitary confinement by prison authorities.   Despite the Government's admission that ""in the vast majority of cases"" incarceration alone was sufficient to protect the integrity of the investigative process, witnesses, and evidence,  the Prison and Probation Administration's statistics show that solitary confinement was the rule rather than the exception, and that most of those arrested were placed into solitary confinement, at least initially.  During the first 11 months of the year, 78 of the 86 persons arrested and held on remand were put into solitary confinement, each for an average of 4 weeks.  The police decide whether persons should be put in solitary confinement, but the accused may appeal this decision to the courts, which have the final say.  Inmates occasionally have appealed solitary confinement, but the courts in general have allowed the police considerable leeway during the first 2 to 3 weeks of incarceration.  The courts have been less willing to allow continued solitary confinement after that time.   A 1998 law allows pretrial detainees to be incarcerated with the general prison population; some human rights monitors have criticized this law.  During the year, the Government budgeted planning funds for a new remand prison just outside of Reykjavik; however, construction had not begun by year's end.    Juveniles who are 15 years of age or older may be sentenced to prison terms, but the vast majority of juvenile offenders are given probation, suspended sentences, or attend a treatment program instead of going to jail.  In the rare instances when juvenile offenders are incarcerated, they are confined with the adult prison population since there is no separate detention facility for juveniles.  The Government has argued that such separation is not practical since the need to incarcerate a juvenile occurs so infrequently.    There is a separate minimum-security prison for women inmates.  But because so few women are incarcerated, some men who have been convicted of nonviolent crimes are held there as well (with the approval of the women inmates).   The Government permits prison visits by independent human rights monitors, including by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).    d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile   The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention, and the Government generally observes these prohibitions.  There was a report that police detained an asylum seeker at the airport during the year contrary to established procedures for asylum processing (see Section 2.d.).   The law prohibits forced exile, and the Government does not employ it.    e. Denial of Fair Public Trial   The Constitution and the law provide for an independent judiciary, and the Government generally respects this provision in practice.     There are two levels of courts.  A five-member Judicial Council appointed by the Minister of Justice administers the eight district courts, and the Supreme Court administers itself.  All judges, at all levels, serve for life.    The law provides for the right to a fair trial, and an independent judiciary generally enforces this right.  Juries are not used, but multijudge panels are common, especially in the Supreme Court, which hears all appeals.  Depending on the seriousness of the case, a Supreme Court panel can include from three to seven judges.  Defendants are presumed innocent and generally are tried without delay.  They are provided access to legal counsel of their own choosing with sufficient time in general to prepare their defense.  For defendants unable to pay attorneys' fees, the state covers the cost, as set by the court; however, defendants are required to reimburse the state.  Defendants have the right to be present at their trial, to confront witnesses, and to participate in the proceedings.  No groups are barred from testifying, and all testimony is treated alike.  The courts have the discretion to allow the introduction of evidence obtained illegally by the police.  With limited exceptions, trials are public and conducted fairly, with no official intimidation.  Defendants have the right to appeal, and appeals are handled expeditiously.   There were no reports of political prisoners.   f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence   The Constitution prohibits such actions, and the Government generally respects these prohibitions in practice.    Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:    a. Freedom of Speech and Press   The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the press, and the Government generally respects these rights in practice.  An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.   The law bans the production, exhibition, distribution, or sale of ""violent"" movies, which ""strive to show mistreatment or the brutal killing of men or animals.""  A six-member Motion Picture Review Committee, appointed by the Minister of Education and Culture, reviews all movies before they are shown and rates their suitability for children.  The committee has banned or required edits of several dozen films over the past 6 years.   Internet access is available and unrestricted.    b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association   The Constitution provides for the freedoms of assembly and association, and the Government generally respects these rights in practice.    c. Freedom of Religion   The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respects this right in practice; however, the State financially supports and promotes an official religion, Lutheranism.     The salaries of the 146 ministers in the Lutheran state church are paid directly by the state, and these ministers are considered to be public servants under the Ministry of Justice and Ecclesiastical Affairs.  The Government does not pay Lutheran ministers in the nonstate churches.                               All citizens 16 years of age and above must pay a church tax of approximately $5.50 (554.24 krona) per month.  Individuals may direct their tax payments to any of the two dozen religious denominations and organizations officially recognized by the Government, including the State Lutheran Church.  For individuals who are not registered as belonging to a religious organization, or who belong to one that is not registered and recognized officially by the Government, the tax payment goes to the University of Iceland, a secular institution.   Children at birth are presumed to have the same religious affiliation as their mother and are registered as such.  Parents control the religious affiliation of their children until they reach the age of 16, but parents must ""consult"" their children about any changes in the children's affiliation after the age of 12.   By law religious instruction in Christianity is required in the public schools; however, students may be exempted.   By law religious organizations must follow specific conditions and procedures in order to be recognized officially and registered by the Government.  Such recognition is necessary for religious organizations other than the state church to receive a per capita share of church tax funds from the Government.  The law applies only to religious organizations that are seeking to be, or are already, officially recognized and registered.  No restrictions or requirements are placed on unregistered religious organizations, which have the same rights as other groups in society.    d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation   The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government generally respects them in practice.    Although neither the Constitution nor the law includes provisions for the granting of refugee or asylum status in accordance with the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, in practice the Government adjudicates cases in accordance with their provisions.  The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the ICRC, and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees.  Human rights monitors have expressed concern about the lack of comprehensive legislation to govern the processing of asylum seekers and to provide a framework for the handling of foreigners and immigrants in general.  In particular there is concern that the 1965 Supervision of Foreigners Law gives police and custom officers at ports of entry too much discretion to deny admission to asylum seekers whose claims they deem to be not credible.  During the year, the police at the international airport in Keflavik reported that they denied entry to 21 asylum seekers on that basis.   The question of first asylum rarely arises.  However, the Directorate of Immigration and the Icelandic Red Cross (which houses and assists asylum seekers under a contract with the Government) reported that 51 individuals applied for asylum during the year, compared with 24 in 2000.  Most asylum seekers applied for asylum after entering the country, rather than at the airport; none were found to qualify for refugee status, but several cases were still under consideration at year's end.  Only one asylum application has ever been approved, that of a 17-year-old individual who claimed to be fleeing from persecution in Central Africa.  During the year, there was a report that police detained for 3 days an Iraqi man who claimed asylum upon arrival at the airport, before returning him to the United Kingdom--his last stop before coming to Iceland.  This was contrary to established asylum procedures, which require that asylum seekers who are admitted into the country be turned over immediately to the Red Cross and the Directorate of Immigration for processing and care.  Iceland became part of the Schengen free travel area on March 25, which resulted in the elimination of formal border controls on the movement of persons into Iceland from other Schengen countries.   The Government accepted 23 UNHCR-designated ""quota"" refugees from the former Yugoslavia during the year, continuing a program begun in 1996 of resettling 20 to 25 refugees from the region each year.  Local government authorities in the towns where refugees settle take a strong interest in helping them adapt to their new environment.  The Icelandic Red Cross, in cooperation with the Refugee Council of the Ministry of Social Affairs, has developed a family support program whereby at least three Icelandic families are enlisted to assist each refugee or refugee family.  The refugees are granted work permits and assisted in finding jobs.  For the first year, they also are given free housing, utilities, and health care and receive a stipend so that they can participate daily in a special half-day language course.    There were no reports of the forced return of persons to a country where they feared persecution.   Section 3 Respect for Political Rights:  The Right of Citizens to Change Their Government   The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.  The latest elections to the Althingi (unicameral Parliament) were held in May 1999.   The percentage of women in government and politics does not correspond to their percentage of the population, but no legal or practical impediments hinder their participation.  Women hold 23 of the 63 seats in Parliament.  Of the 12 government ministers, 3 are women, and 2 of 12 ministerial permanent secretaries (civil servants who function as deputy ministers) are women.  Of the nine Supreme Court justices, two are women.  There has been a marked increase in the number of female parliamentarians elected since the Women's List (WL), a feminist political party, was founded in 1983.  The WL, which no longer exists because of a political party merger, forced the established political parties to nominate more female candidates or face losing support.  As a result, women's issues moved into the mainstream of political debate, and all of the major political parties have at least one woman in a prominent leadership position.    Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights   A number of domestic and international human rights groups in general operate without government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases.  Government officials are cooperative and responsive to their views.   Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or Social Status   The law prohibits discrimination based on these factors, and the Government enforces this prohibition in practice.  The population is strongly egalitarian and opposed to discrimination based on any of these factors.      Women   Violence against women continued to be a matter of concern.  Police statistics show that the incidence of violence against women--including rape and sexual assault--is low; however, the number of women seeking assistance at the public women's shelter, the counseling center, and the emergency ward of the National Hospital indicates that many incidents go unreported.  Each year approximately 100 women ask for temporary lodging at the women's shelter, while 300 to 400 women and children seek assistance at the counseling center.  The hospital emergency ward, which has a special staff to care for rape victims, reports that during the year, 134 women sought care associated with sexual assault or abuse.  The law prohibits domestic violence and rape, including spousal rape.   The Government takes violence against women seriously; it helps finance various facilities and organizations that provide assistance to victims.  The City of Reykjavik, in addition to partially funding such services, provides special help to immigrant women who find themselves in abusive relationships, offering emergency accommodation, counseling, and information on legal rights.  In 2000 Parliament passed legislation that gives the courts the power to issue restraining orders, which has been a useful legal tool in protecting women from abusive husbands and boyfriends.  In 1999 the Government amended the Criminal Code to provide victims of sexual crimes with lawyers to advise them of their legal rights and help them pursue cases against the alleged assailants.   Nonetheless a large majority of victims decline to press charges or choose to forgo trial, in part to avoid unwanted publicity in a small, tightly knit society.  Some local human rights monitors also attribute underreporting to the fact that convictions traditionally yield light sentences:  The maximum penalty for rape is 16 years, but the actual sentences imposed typically are much closer to the minimum sentence of 1 year.   The sale of sex for money is not illegal per se, but it is against the law for someone to engage in prostitution as his or her main source of income.  It is also illegal to act as an intermediary in the sale or procurement of sex.  There were indications that some foreign women were trafficked to work as striptease dancers or prostitutes (see Sections 6.c. and 6.f.).   The rate of participation by women in the labor market is high.  In part this reflects the country's comprehensive system of subsidized day care, which makes it affordable and convenient for women to work outside the home.  The law requires that preference be given to hiring and promoting women in areas where they are underrepresented, as long as they are equal in all other respects to male job seekers.  Despite laws that require equal pay for equal work, a sizeable pay gap continues to exist between men and women:  A 2000 survey by a union in Reykjavik showed that women, on average, earned 30 percent less than men.  A 12 percent difference in pay may be attributable to the fact that men work on average 4.2 more hours per week than women, but the rest of the gap is unexplained.   In 2000 Parliament passed legislation that gives fathers the same right as mothers to paid leave upon the birth of a child.  Under the law, which is expected to be fully implemented in 2003, both mothers and fathers will be allowed to take 3 months of paid leave (at 80 percent of the normal salary), with an additional 3 months that can be taken by either parent or shared between them.  Previously a mother was given 6 months of paid maternity leave and the father just 2 weeks.  The new leave requirements apply equally to the public and private sectors.      Children   The Government is strongly committed to children's rights and welfare; it amply funds a system of public education and health care.  School attendance is compulsory through the age of 15 and free through public university level.  Approximately 85 percent of students continue to upper secondary education, which is financed completely by the Government.  The Government provides free prenatal and infant medical care, as well as heavily subsidized childcare.  The Office of the Children's Ombudsman in the Prime Minister's Office has a mandate to protect children's rights, interests, and welfare by, among other things, exerting influence on legislation, government decisions, and public attitudes and has done so.   The government-funded Agency for Child Protection coordinates the work of 56 committees around the country that are responsible for managing child protection issues (for example, adoption and foster care) in their local areas.  The agency also investigates reports of child abuse through a specially designed ""Children's House"" (Barnahusid) and operates treatment centers for abused and troubled minors.   There is no societal pattern of abuse directed against children.   In an effort to improve the rate of prosecution of child sexual abuse and lessen the trauma to the child, the Government established the Children's Assessment Center in 1998.  The objective of the center is to create a safe and secure environment where child victims feel more comfortable talking about what happened to them and are not subjected to multiple interviews.  The center brings together police, prosecutors, judges, doctors, and officials from child protection services.  However, a 1999 change in the Criminal Code made judges (instead of the police) responsible for the investigatory interview of abused children and allowed these interviews to be conducted in specially designed rooms at district courthouses.  In 2000 the Supreme Court upheld the right of a Reykjavik district court judge to hold an investigatory interview in the courthouse rather than at the center, which has led to a significant decrease in the child sexual abuse cases being handled through the center.  Human rights monitors criticized this as a step backward in the protection of children's rights.     Persons with Disabilities   Persons with disabilities are not subject to discrimination in employment, education, or the provision of other state services.  The law provides that such persons have the right to ""all common national and municipal services"" and provides that they be given assistance to ""make it possible for them to live and work in normal society with others.""  The law also provides that persons with disabilities should receive preference for a government job when they are qualified equally, or more qualified, than regular applicants.   Building regulations updated in 1998 call for public accommodations--such as hotels, restaurants, banks, and stores--as well as government buildings to be accessible so that persons in wheelchairs have access without assistance.  Building regulations also specify that elevators in such buildings should be large enough to accommodate wheelchairs and that 1 percent of parking spaces (a minimum of one space) should be reserved for disabled use.  Moreover, the regulations also specify that, to the extent possible, the sidewalk outside the main entrance of a public accommodation or government building should be heated so that it remains clear of ice and snow throughout the winter.  The law provides that violations of these regulations are punishable by a fine or a jail sentence of up to 2 years; however, the country's main association for persons with disabilities complains that enforcement is lax and that penalties rarely are assessed for noncompliance.     Access to new buildings tends to be good, while efforts to make old buildings more accessible have lagged.  A government committee was surveying systematically all state-owned buildings in the country to evaluate their accessibility.  The Reykjavik city government, in cooperation with local associations representing bicycle riders and the blind, has been beveling sidewalks at intersections throughout the city to facilitate the movement of pedestrians, bicyclists, and persons in wheelchairs.  The city is spending approximately $175,000 (17.5 million krona) a year on this project, which it aims to have completed by 2006.       In 2000 the Supreme Court ruled that the extent to which the State was reducing social security payments to persons with disabilities based on the income of their able-bodied spouses was unconstitutional.  The Court stated that the significant cuts in social security payments as a result of means testing violated constitutional protections regarding equality and support for persons with disabilities.  In reaction to the ruling, Parliament passed legislation in January that increased the minimum payment to persons with disabilities who have able-bodied spouses.  However, their social security benefits continued to be subject to a modified form of means testing.  The Association of Disabled Persons protested that the legislation did not comply with the Supreme Court ruling and challenged the new law in court.  There was no ruling by year's end.   While significant progress has been made in the last few years in addressing the concerns and needs of persons with physical disabilities, some mental health advocates fault the Government for not devoting sufficient attention and resources to the care of persons with mental disabilities.     National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities   Concern has been voiced, including by the Prime Minister, that the rapidly increasing number of foreigners being brought into the country to meet the labor shortage in fish processing and other less desirable occupations could lead to future problems, especially in the event of an economic downturn.  At the end of 2000, 8,824 foreigners were living in the country, or approximately 3 percent of the population, according to the National Statistical Office.  However, persons of foreign origin constituted 4 or 5 percent of the population when account was taken of individuals who were born in foreign countries but have since become citizens.  New work and residence permits were issued at a rate of approximately 150 per month during the year.  Many of these ""temporary"" workers come from Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and the Directorate of Immigration expected most of them to seek to remain permanently rather than return to their countries of origin.  According to a 2000 opinion poll, 85 percent of foreigners were content with living in Iceland, and 40 percent were ""unlikely"" to return to their country of origin.   For several years, the City of Reykjavik has operated a highly regarded Intercultural Center that helps foreigners adjust to living in the country.  In December the City of Reykjavik, in cooperation with surrounding towns and local NGO's, opened a larger and better staffed International House to replace the Intercultural Center.   Human rights monitors continued to express concern about an ultranationalist organization called ""Iceland for Icelanders,"" which was founded in 1997 with the goal of limiting the further settlement of foreigners in the country to persons of European origin.  In April the deputy leader of the organization was indicted for making disparaging remarks about foreigners in a newspaper interview.  In October he was found guilty and fined $300 (30,000 krona).  There is no law that prohibits organizations that promote and incite racial discrimination.   Section 6 Worker Rights    a. The Right of Association   Workers make extensive use of the right provided by the Constitution to establish unions, draw up their own constitutions and rules, choose their own leaders and policies, and publicize their views.  The resulting organizations are independent of the Government and political parties.  Approximately 85 percent of all eligible workers belong to unions.    With the exception of limited categories of workers in the public sector whose services are essential to public health or safety, unions have the right to strike.  During the year, there were minor strikes by air traffic controllers, hospital nurses, nurse assistants, physical therapists, municipal employees, and music teachers.  In April and May, there was also a 6-week seamen's strike, which brought the fishing industry to a standstill.  Concerned about the strike's effect on the economy, Parliament passed a law in May ordering the seamen to return to work and providing that the dispute be referred to binding arbitration.  The arbitration panel handed down its decision in June, which was accepted by all parties (see Section 6.b.).   Unions are permitted to affiliate internationally, and they take active part in Nordic, European, and other international trade union bodies.    b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively   Union membership is not impeded by law or practice.  Employers are required to withhold union dues (1 percent of gross pay) from the pay of all employees, whether or not they are union members, to help support, among other benefits, disability, strike, and pension funds to which all workers are entitled.    The various trade unions and management organizations periodically negotiate collective bargaining agreements that set specific terms for workers' pay, hours, and other conditions.  Collective bargaining agreements were negotiated in 2000, and most will expire in either 2003 or 2004.  The Government played only a minor role in the bargaining process, providing mediation assistance in a few cases (through the State Mediator's Office) while generally encouraging wage restraint to limit inflation.  The new contracts provide that if inflation exceeds expectations during the first year, the unions have the right to seek renegotiation of the wage terms.    The Icelandic Federation of Labor (IFL) filed lawsuits in June and again in November charging that Parliament's intervention in the fish industry strike violated the seamen's constitutional rights to associate freely and to bargain collectively (see Section 6.a.).  The case was ongoing at year's end.  In December the IFL also filed a complaint about the Government's action with the International Labor Organization.     Labor courts effectively adjudicate disputes over contracts and over the rights provided for under the law, which prohibits antiunion discrimination.  By law employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union activities; however, in practice the charges often are difficult to prove.   There are no export processing or other special economic zones.    c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor   Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law; however, some women reportedly were trafficked into the country to work as striptease dancers or prostitutes (see Sections 5 and 6.f.).  In addition work permit practices left newly arrived foreign workers vulnerable to abuse by employers (see Section 6.e.).     The law prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, and there were no reports that such practices occur.   d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment   The law prohibits the employment of children younger than age 16 in factories, on ships, or in other places that are hazardous or require hard labor; this prohibition is observed in practice.  Children 14 or 15 years old may be employed part time or during school vacations in light, nonhazardous work.  Their work hours must not exceed the ordinary work-hours of adults in the same occupation.  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration enforces child labor regulations effectively.   The Government ratified ILO Convention 182 on the worst forms of child labor in 2000, and it entered into force in May.   The law prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, and such practices are not known to occur (see Section 6.c.).    e. Acceptable Conditions of Work   No minimum wage is mandated by law, but the minimum wages negotiated in various collective bargaining agreements apply automatically to all employees in those occupations, whether they are union members or not.  Labor contracts afford even the lowest paid workers a sufficient income for a decent standard of living for themselves and their families.   Workers are protected by laws that effectively provide for their health and safety as well as for unemployment insurance, paid vacations, pensions, and reasonable working conditions and hours.  The standard legal workweek is 40 hours, which includes nearly 3 hours of paid breaks per week.  Work exceeding 8 hours in a workday must be compensated as overtime.  Under changes that took effect during 2000, workers are entitled to 11 hours of rest (up from 10 hours previously) within each 24-hour period and to a day off every week.  Under defined special circumstances, the 11-hour rest period can be reduced to 8 hours, but workers must then be compensated with 1.5 hours of rest for every hour received less than 11 hours.  The day off can be postponed by a week, in which case the worker has a right to 2 additional hours off in the following week.  Health and safety standards are set by Parliament and administered and enforced by the Ministry of Social Affairs through its Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which can and does close down workplaces until safety and health standards are met.  Workers have a collective, not an individual, right to refuse to work in a place that does not meet the criteria of occupational safety and health.  Firing workers who report unsafe or unhealthy conditions is illegal.   Human rights monitors expressed concern that in the case of newly arrived foreign workers or refugees (i.e., those who have been in the country for less than 3 years), the Government's practice of issuing applicable work permits to the employer rather than to the employee has left the worker vulnerable to abuse by the employer in some instances (see Section 5).    f. Trafficking in Persons   The law does not prohibit specifically trafficking in persons, although a number of legal provisions may be used to prosecute such cases; trafficking was suspected in connection with the hundreds of foreign women who entered the country to work in striptease clubs.  The main concern was that some of the women, especially those from Eastern and Central Europe, were being brought to Iceland under false pretenses and then coerced to work as striptease dancers or prostitutes.  While most attention has been focused on Iceland as a possible destination point for trafficked women, there were some cases during the year that indicated that the country was also being used as a transit point for the movement of trafficked women between mainland Europe and North America.  There were no reliable estimates on how many women this may involve.   In May, for the first time, formal charges of coercion were filed against a club.  Four striptease dancers from Estonia told police that a club owner had pressured them into prostitution.  Two Danish dancers lodged a similar complaint against the same employer.  As of year's end, the cases remained under investigation, and no arrests had been made.   Parliament passed legislation in 2000 that closed a loophole that allowed striptease dancers to enter the country and perform without a work permit for up to 4 weeks under an exemption given for ""artists.""  Any foreigner (except those from the European Economic Area) seeking to come to the country to work as a striptease dancer must first obtain a work permit, which is typically valid for 3 months.  However, the Government has not yet put any numerical limits or other controls on the issuance of work permits for foreign striptease dancers.  The clubs are allowed to bring in as many dancers as they want.   For the first several months that the new system was in place, the IFL vetted the work permit applications of foreign striptease dancers and ensured that their contracts afforded the minimal labor protections.  However, the IFL announced in March that it would no longer take part in this process.  Citing the suspicious circumstances under which these dancers come and work in Iceland, the IFL said it did not want to assist unwittingly in human trafficking.  However, the Directorate of Labor decided that under the existing law, it had no choice but to continue issuing the work permits, even without the review of the IFL.   Human right monitors were critical of the fact that the striptease clubs continued to operate with few, if any, restrictions on their operations.  There are no regulations, for example, mandating a minimal distance between dancers and patrons.  A study on prostitution, commissioned by the Ministry of Justice and released in March, concluded that organized prostitution existed at some, if not all, of the striptease clubs.  In the absence of national legislation, some municipalities have taken action on their own to prohibit the opening of striptease clubs within their jurisdictions.  The City of Reykjavik was moving to restrict the location of new clubs to designated areas only.  However, the changes were not expected to be retroactive and would not affect the existing clubs, most of which were located downtown.   Victims may seek assistance at the women's shelter, counseling center, and hospital, which are all government funded (see Section 5)."

The Bush Administration has identified Iran's modernization of its conventional forces as a potential threat to U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf, but others argue that the buildup has been minor and that Iran still is relatively poorly equipped. Although the Bush Administration says it is still willing to hold a dialogue with Iran, the focus of current U.S. policy appears to be a return to the containment policy that prevailed during the early part of the Clinton Administration. During the first term of the Clinton Administration, as part of a policy of ""dual containment"" of Iran and Iraq, President Clinton imposed a ban on U.S. trade and investment in Iran in 1995, and a 1996 law imposed sanctions on foreign investment in Iran's energy sector (Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, ILSA). In keeping with a 1997 policy shift toward engagement, the Clinton Administration and Congress later eased sanctions to allow U.S. exports to Iran of food and medical supplies and importation from Iran of goods such as carpets and caviar. The United States has consistently worked with its allies to prevent arms and advanced technology sales to Iran and to limit Iran's influence over regional energy flows. U.S. purchases of Iranian crude oil and U.S. company investments in Iran remain barred. ILSA was renewed for another 5 years on August 3, 2001 (H.R. 1954, P.L. 107-24).  Even before Iran's tacit cooperation with post-September 11 U.S. efforts to defeat Afghanistan's Taliban regime, signs of moderation in Iran had stimulated the United States to try to engage Iran in official talks. Iran, still split between conservatives and reformers loyal to President Mohammad Khatemi did not accept. By early 2002, reports of Iran's continued support to antiMiddle East peace process groups such as Hizballah had reversed the warming trend. Iran was grouped with North Korea and Iraq as part of the ""axis of evil"" identified in President Bush's January 29, 2002 State of the Union message. The United States said subsequently it supports reform-minded Iranians who want democracy, an apparent shift from the stance of attempting to engage Khatemi's government. President Bush has identified Iran's efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction and delivery means, coupled with its support of terrorist groups, as key U.S. concerns. Iran's ballistic missile program has made major strides over the past few years, with the help of several foreign suppliers, and the strides in its civilian nuclear power program could further a nuclear weapons effort. Iran has opposed the U.S.-led Middle East peace process since its inception in October 1991. It continues to provide material support to Hizballah in Lebanon and to Palestinian groups that oppose the Arab-Israeli peace process, such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. All Iranian factions have publicly supported Palestinian violence against Israel since September 2000.  Congressional Research Service  ~ The Library of Congress   IB93033  01-29-03  M  OST  RECENT DEVELOP  MENTS  In his January 29, 2002 State of the Union message, President Bush named Iran, along with Iraq and North Korea, as part of an ""axis of evil,"" constituting major threats to U.S. security. In July 2002, the Administration articulated a shift in policy: supporting Iranians who want reform and democracy, rather than seeking to support Khatemi and his faction. In December 2002, U.S. officials said that Iran is building two previously unknown nuclear sites at Arak and Natanz, which could be used in a nuclear weapons program.  BACKGROUND  AND  ANAL  YSIS  A power struggle in Iran between revolutionary purists and more moderate reformists colors Iran's domestic and foreign policies. Since February 2002 testimony, DCI George Tenet has been saying that Iran's reform movement was ""losing momentum"" to the ""unelected"" hardliners. Since mid-2002, President Mohammad Khatemi has become more vocal in criticizing obstructions by hardliners, and in late August 2002, he proposed new legislation, passed by the Majlis but still pending before the legislative review body called the Council of Guardians, that would strengthen the power of his office. Several analysts say Khatemi, along with much of the Majlis, might resign if the proposals are blocked. Khatemi, who was re-elected on June 8, 2001 by a landslide 77% of the vote against nine more conservative candidates, holds a popular mandate for greater domestic freedoms. His reelection victory was larger than his 69% first win in May 1997. His supporters hold about 70% of the seats in the 290-seat Majlis (parliament) following victories in the February 18, 2000 Majlis elections. However, Khatemi's reform program has been largely obstructed by hardliners, including Supreme Leader Ali Khamene'i (successor to Ayatollah Khomeini), who control key revolutionary institutions such as the Council of Guardians. Since April 2000, hardliners in the judiciary have closed more than 60 reformist newspapers and imprisoned or questioned several editors and even some members of the Majlis. About 225,000 candidates nationwide have registered to run for the 170,000 seats on city and town council elections to be held February 28, 2003. Applications are well below the 330,000 candidates that ran in the local elections four years ago, possibly suggesting some frustration that the reformers have not made much progress in that time. In November 2002, a popular history professor and ally of Khatemi, Hashem Aghajari, was convicted by a local (Hamadan) court of apostasy and sentenced to death, prompting several days of student demonstrations and some clashes with hardline security enforcers. Khamene'i ordered the sentence reviewed.  Iran's Strategic Buildup Iran is not considered a major conventional threat to the United States, but some of its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly medium range ballistic missiles, appear to be making significant progress and could put U.S. allies and installations at risk.  CRS-1   IB93033  01-29-03  For further information, see CRS Report RL30551, Iran: Arms and Weapons of Mass Destruction Suppliers.  Conventional Weapons Iran's armed forces total about 550,000 personnel, including both the regular military and the Revolutionary Guard, the latter of which is loyal to the hardliners. According to U.S. military officials, Iran's forces could block the Strait of Hormuz at least temporarily, but Iran is largely lacking in ability to project power far beyond its borders. See CRS Report RL31529, Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations, 1994-2001.  Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) It is partly because of Iran's attempts to acquire WMD that President Bush, in his January 29, 2002 State of the Union message, labeled Iran part of an ""axis of evil"" along with Iraq and North Korea. Iran's programs, particularly its missile program, continue to be assisted primarily by entities in Russia, China, and North Korea. Chemical and Biological Weapons. Official U.S. reports state that Iran is seeking to acquire a self-sufficient chemical weapons infrastructure, that it may have some capability for biological weapons deployment, and that it has stockpiled chemical weapons, including blister, blood, and choking agents. This record raises questions about Iran's compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which Iran signed on January 13, 1993, and ratified on June 8, 1997. Missiles. Largely with Russian help, Iran is making progress in its missile program. Two of its first three tests of the 800-mile range Shahab-3 (July 1998, July 2000, and September 2000) were either inconclusive or unsuccessful (the July 2000 test appears to have been a success), but Iran conducted an apparently successful test in late May 2002, and the Defense Department now assesses the missile as operational. Iran might have produced 10 20 of them, according to press reports. Iran is also trying to make a 1,200 mile range Shahab-4, but U.S. officials told journalists in late October 2002 that an Iranian test of an extended-range Shahab had failed. In March 2002, an intelligence community official upgraded the missile threat from Iran, testifying that the United States would ""most likely"" face an intercontinental ballistic missile threat from Iran by 2015. On September 6, 2002, Iran said it successfully tested a 200 mile range ""Fateh 110"" missile, and Iran said in late September 2002 that it has begun production of the missile. Nuclear Weapons. DCI Tenet testified in February 2002 that Iran might be able to produce, without outside help, enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon by late this decade. Russia, despite these U.S. concerns and protests, is proceeding with its January 1995 contract with Iran to complete a nuclear power plant at Bushehr, and the two countries agreed in December 2002 to have the plant operational by the end of 2003. Russia says that it has reached agreement with Iran to supply fuel for the reactor for ten years and for Russia to reprocess the plant's spent nuclear material. However, Undersecretary of State John Bolton told Congress on October 9, 2002, that Iran is building a nuclear fuel cycle to support a nuclear weapons program. That statement came before public revelations in December 2002 that Iran is building two additional facilities, at Arak and Natanz, that could be used for a nuclear weapons program. Iran, denying it has a nuclear weapons program but responding CRS-2   IB93033  01-29-03  partly to international demands, has said it will allow IAEA inspections of the Arak and Natanz sites in February 2003.  Iranian Foreign Policy and Involvement in Terrorism Iran's continued support for terrorism contributed to President Bush's strong criticism of Iran in his State of the Union message. The State Department report on international terrorism for 2001, released May 21, 2002, again states, as it has for most of the past decade, that Iran ""remained the most active state sponsor of terrorism in 2001,"" although the report attributes the terrorist activity to two hardline institutions -- the Revolutionary Guard and the Intelligence Ministry. On the other hand, Iran strongly condemned the September 11 attacks and tacitly supported the U.S. war on the Taliban and Al Qaeda. (See also CRS Report RL31119, Terrorism: Near Eastern Groups and State Sponsors, 2002.)  Persian Gulf Khatemi has largely succeeded in improving relations with Iran's neighbors, particularly the six states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC; Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates). Since he came into office, Iran has reduced support for Shiite Muslim dissident movements in the Gulf states. In early October 2002, Iran and Kuwait signed a defense and intelligence cooperation agreement. See also CRS Report RL31533, Persian Gulf: Issues for U.S. Policy, 2003. Saudi Arabia/Khobar Towers. Iran and Saudi Arabia restored relations in December 1991 (after a 4 year break), and progressively higher level contacts have taken place since December 1997. In May 1999, Khatemi became the first senior Iranian leader to visit Saudi Arabia since the Islamic revolution; he visited again on September 11, 2002, to discuss possible U.S.-Iraq war. Supreme Leader Khamene'i has been invited to visit the Kingdom as well but has not yet done so. In mid-April 2001, Saudi Arabia and Iran formally entered into an anti-crime security pact, suggesting that Saudi Arabia wishes to bury the issue of the June 25, 1996 Khobar Towers housing complex bombing, which killed 19 U.S. airmen. On June 21, 2001, a federal grand jury indicted 14 suspects, 13 Saudis and a Lebanese citizen, for the Khobar bombing. The indictment indicated that Iranian agents were likely involved, but no indictments of any Iranians were announced. In June 2002, Saudi Arabia reportedly sentenced some of the eleven Saudi suspects held there. (See CRS Issue Brief IB93113, Saudi Arabia: Postwar Issues and U.S. Relations.) Gulf Islands Dispute With UAE. Relations between Iran and the UAE became acrimonious in April 1992, when Iran asserted complete control of the Persian Gulf island of Abu Musa, which it and the UAE shared under a 1971 bilateral agreement. (In 1971, Iran, then ruled by the U.S.-backed Shah, completely seized two other islands, Greater and Lesser Tunb, from the emirate of Ras al-Khaymah, which later became part of the UAE. It seized part of Abu Musa from the emirate of Sharjah.) The UAE wants to refer the dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), but Iran insists on resolving the issue bilaterally. Several GCC states have attempted to mediate in recent years and Iran-UAE tensions have eased somewhat, but Iran insists that it has sovereignty over the islands. The United States, which is concerned about Iran's military improvements to the islands, generally supports CRS-3   IB93033  01-29-03  UAE proposals but takes no position on sovereignty. Jane's Defence Weekly reported in March 2000 that Iran's military emplacements on the islands are relatively minor. Iraq. A legacy of the 8-year long Iran-Iraq war (September 1980 - August 1988) is deep lingering suspicion between Iran and Iraq, but the two have drawn closer in recent years. Some of Iran's actions suggest it is positioning itself to benefit politically in Iraq if the United States ousts Saddam Husayn. Iran, which fears potential encirclement by pro-U.S. regimes, publicly opposes a major U.S. military offensive against Iraq unless it is authorized by the United Nations. However, Iran has reportedly been offering the United States at least tacit backing if the United States attacks Iraq, perhaps hoping that Saddam's overthrow would put Tehran's proteges in power there. Iranian hardliners are still politically close to Shiite militants in southern Iraq  the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI) and the Da'wa (Islamic Call) party  who, since August 2002, have been increasingly open about accepting U.S. backing for efforts to overthrow Iraq's regime. Iran allowed the U.S.-backed Iraqi National Congress (INC), Iraq's main opposition umbrella, to open an office in Tehran in 2001 and reportedly will allow it and other opposition groups the ability to go into northern Iraq in February 2003 to hold an opposition meeting there. Since early 1998, Iran and Iraq have exchanged significant numbers of prisoners from the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. An October 2000 visit to Iraq by Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi resulted in apparent agreement to abide by the waterway-sharing and other provisions of their 1975 Algiers Accords, which Iraq had abrogated prior to its September 1980 invasion of Iran. In exchange for a share of the proceeds, Iran's maritime authorities sometimes cooperate with Iraq's illicit export of oil products through the Gulf, although U.S. officials say Iran has been preventing the smuggling in recent months.  Middle East/North Africa Many of the allegations of Iran's support for terrorism center on its assistance to groups opposed to the Arab-Israeli peace process, primarily Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Hizballah, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. U.S. terrorism reports state that, following the start of the September 2000 Palestinian uprising, Iran increased its support for terrorism by encouraging coordination among Palestinian terrorist groups. Iran also incites anti-Israel violence, including hosting conferences of antipeace process organizations (April 24, 2001, and June 2-3, 2002). Khamene'i has continued to call Israel a ""cancerous tumor"" and make other statements suggesting that he seeks Israel's destruction. Khatemi, while publicly pledging support for the anti-peace process groups, has sometimes tried to moderate Iran's position somewhat. On October 15, 2002, the Iranian Foreign Ministry said Iran would not seek to block a final, two-state Israeli-Palestinian settlement. It was viewed as a new development when Israel and the United States asserted in early January 2002 that Iran was the source of a shipment, intercepted by Israel, of 50 tons of arms bought by the Palestinian Authority (PA). Iran has traditionally had few ties to the nonIslamist Palestinian organizations, including elements linked to the PA, that have conducted some of the day-to-day violence against Israel in the current uprising. Lebanon/Hizballah. About 150 Iranian Revolutionary Guards remain in Lebanon to coordinate Iranian arms deliveries to Hizballah, which are offloaded in Damascus and CRS-4   IB93033  01-29-03  trucked into Lebanon. The shipments have included Stingers obtained by Iran in Afghanistan, mortars that can reach the Israeli city of Haifa if fired from southern Lebanon, and, in 2002, over 8,000 Katyusha rockets, according to press reports. In mid-April 2002, Foreign Minister Kharrazi visited Lebanon and urged Hizballah to exercise restraint on the Israeli-Lebanese border at a time of heightened tensions between Israel and the Palestinians. However, Hizballah is believed to take cues from harder line Iranian elements. Sudan. Sudan's close relations with Iran in the early 1990s contributed to Sudan's placement on the U.S. ""terrorism list"" on August 18, 1993. However, Sudan's alliance with Iran frayed in the mid 1990s as Sudan sought to burnish its international image.  Central and South Asia/Azerbaijan/Former Yugoslavia Iran's policy in Central Asia has thus far emphasized economic cooperation over Islamic ideology, although Iran has become increasingly assertive in its relations with Azerbaijan. In early 1992, Iran led the drive to bring the Central Asian states and Azerbaijan into the Economic Cooperation Organization (founded in 1985 by Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey, as a successor to an organization founded by those states in 1964). Iran is hoping to attract energy pipeline routes through it, rather than through other countries. However, Iran does host at least one anti-Azerbaijan guerrilla leader (Hasan Javadov), and it allegedly harbors leaders of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), including founder Tahir Yuldashev. Tensions with Azerbaijan flared in late July 2001 over energy exploration rights in the Caspian; Iranian warships and combat aircraft threatened a British Petroleum (BP) ship on contract to Azerbaijan out of an area of the Caspian Iran considers its own. The United States called that action provocative, and it offered new border security aid and increased political support to Azerbaijan. Iran and Armenia, an adversary of Azerbaijan, agreed on expanded defense cooperation in early March 2002. Iran-Azerbaijan tensions eased somewhat in conjunction with the mid-May 2002 visit of Azerbaijan's President Heydar Aliyev to Iran, although there was little evident progress on a bilateral division of their portions of the Caspian. Al Qaeda/Afghanistan/Pakistan. Iran long opposed the puritanical Sunni Muslim regime of the Taliban in Afghanistan on the grounds that it oppressed Shiite Muslim and other Persian-speaking minorities. Iran nearly launched a military attack against the Taliban in September 1998 after Taliban fighters captured and killed several Iranian diplomats based in northern Afghanistan, and it provided military aid to the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance coalition, made up of mostly Persian-speaking minority groups. Iran -- along with the United States, Russia, and the countries bordering Afghanistan -- attended U.N.-sponsored meetings in New York (the Six Plus Two group) to try to end the internal conflict in Afghanistan. Iran and the United States also participated in a U.N.-sponsored group in Geneva, which includes Italy and Germany. Tacitly aligned with the U.S. military campaign against the Taliban in Afghanistan, Iran pledged search and rescue assistance to the United States and allowed U.S. humanitarian aid for the Afghan people to transit Iran. Some of Iran's subsequent activities in Afghanistan reflect official suspicion of the United States and the influence of hardliners in Iran's regime. Iran is said to fear the proU.S. tilt of the new government of Afghanistan and the waning of Iran's traditional sway in western, central, and northern Afghanistan where Persian-speaking Afghans predominate. CRS-5   IB93033  01-29-03  There have been press reports and U.S. official statements since in January 2002 that hardliners in Iran are harboring, or at least not aggressively moving to arrest, senior Al Qaeda operatives who have fled Afghanistan (Sayf al-Adl and Abu Hafs the Mauritanian) as well as perhaps a few hundred Al Qaeda fighters. The United States reportedly has moved U.S. special operations forces in Afghanistan to areas near the Iranian border to hunt for Al Qaeda fighters. Another report in early September 2002 said Iran is helping Al Qaeda transport some of its gold assets, which it is increasingly using instead of bank accounts. On the other hand, press reports say Iran has been arresting and extraditing Al Qaeda members to Saudi Arabia. Other reports say Iran is arming local Afghan strongmen including Herat governor Ismail Khan, Mazar-e-Sharif governor Abdul Rashid Dostam, and others, and President Bush has warned Iran not to seek to exert influence over the new government of Afghanistan. Apparently seeking to deflect the U.S. criticism, in March 2002 Iran reportedly expelled exiled Pashtun figure Gulbuddin Hikmatyar, an opponent of the new Afghan government. The expulsion followed a February 24, 2002 visit to Iran by Afghan leader Hamid Karzai; the two countries agreed to broad cooperation. (See CRS Report RL30588, Afghanistan: Current Issues and U.S. Policy Concerns.) Former Yugoslavia. On June 26, 1996, and again on May 5, 1997, President Clinton certified to Congress that Bosnia had expelled foreign forces and ended intelligence cooperation with Iran. The certifications were required by P.L. 104-122, an FY1996 supplemental appropriation, and P.L. 104-208, the FY1997 foreign aid appropriation, in order to provide U.S. aid to Bosnia.  Human Rights Concerns U.S. and U.N. human rights reports cite Iran for widespread human rights abuses, (especially of the Baha'i faith), including assassinations and executions of regime opponents (Kurds, People's Mojahedin, and others) in Iran and abroad. These reports note that Khatemi's efforts to promote rule of law have met repeated challenges from hardliners. In April 2002, the U.N. Human Rights Commission narrowly voted not to investigate Iran's human rights record during 2002-2003. On January 29, 2003, Iran released the 80-year-old Ayatollah Montazeri, from house arrest; Montazeri was Khomeini's designated successor until being dismissed by Khomeini in 1989, and he later emerged as a critic of the postKhomeini leadership. The release came about a week after European Union parliamentarians criticized Iran for a reported rise in the number of public executions. Religious Persecution. On October 27, 2001, the State Department again named Iran as a ""Country of Particular Concern,"" under the International Religious Freedom Act. No sanctions were added, on the grounds that Iran is already subject to extensive U.S. sanctions. Religious persecution continues, especially against the Baha'i community, because Iran's Shiite Muslim clergy views the sect as heretical. Two Baha'is (Dhabihullah Mahrami and Musa Talibi) were sentenced to death in 1996 for apostasy. On July 21, 1998, Iran executed Ruhollah Ruhani, the first Bahai executed since 1992 (Bahman Samandari). The United States condemned the execution. In February 2000, Iran's Supreme Court set aside the death sentences against three Bahais, Sirus Zabihi-Moqaddam, Hedayat KashefiNajafabadi, and Manucher Khulusi. On April 21, 1999, the Clinton Administration CRS-6   IB93033  01-29-03  expressed concern about the sentencing to prison of four Baha'is. Recent resolutions condemning Iran's treatment of the Baha'is, including S.Con.Res. 57, which passed the Senate July 19, 2000, and H.Con.Res. 257, which passed the House on September 19, 2000. Trial of 13 Jews. Although the 30,000 member Jewish community (the largest in the Middle East aside from Israel) enjoys more freedoms than Jewish communities in several other Muslim states, during 1993-1998 Iran executed five Jews allegedly spying for Israel. In June 1999, Iran confirmed that it had arrested 13 Jews -- teachers, shopkeepers, and butchers -- from the Shiraz area that it said were part of an ""espionage ring"" for Israel. After an April - June 2000 trial in which eight of the suspects ""confessed"" to the allegations, ten of the Jews and two Muslims accomplices were convicted (July 1, 2000) and received sentences ranging from 4 years to 13 years. Three Jews were acquitted. On September 21, 2000, a three-judge appeals panel reduced the sentences slightly, now ranging from 2 to 9 years. On February 8, 2001, Iran's Supreme Court let the revised sentences stand. In March 2001, Iran released one of the Jews on the grounds that his sentence included time served; another was released on January 16, 2002. Three more were given early release in late October 2002. Several bills in the 106th Congress called for the release of the detainees and for linking U.S. relations with Iran to the trial's outcome; the Senate passed S.Con.Res. 39 (June 23, 1999) and S.Con.Res. 109 (May 4, 2000). In April 2001, a similar bill, H.Con.Res. 29, was introduced in the 107th Congress.  U.S. Policy and Sanctions The February 11, 1979 fall of the Shah of Iran, a key U.S. ally, opened a long rift in U.S.-Iranian relations. On November 4, 1979, radical ""students"" seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held its diplomats hostage until minutes after President Reagan's inauguration on January 20, 1981. The United States broke relations with Iran on April 7, 1980, and the two countries have had no official dialogue since. The exception was the abortive 1985-86 clandestine arms supply relationship with Iran in exchange for some American hostages held by Hizballah in Lebanon (the so-called ""Iran-Contra Affair""). Iran maintains an interests section in Washington (Embassy of Pakistan), staffed by Iranian permanent resident aliens or U.S. citizens of Iranian descent. The U.S. protecting power in Iran is Switzerland. Upon taking office in 1993, the Clinton Administration moved to further isolate Iran as part of a strategy of ""dual containment"" of Iran and Iraq. In 1995 and 1996, the Clinton Administration and Congress added sanctions on Iran in response to growing concerns about Iran's weapons of mass destruction, its support for terrorist groups, and its efforts to subvert the Arab-Israeli peace process. The election of Khatemi in May 1997 precipitated a shift in U.S. policy toward engagement; the Clinton Administration offered Iran official dialogue, with no substantive preconditions. In January 1998, Khatemi publicly agreed to increase ""people-to-people"" exchanges with the United States but ruled out official dialogue. In a June 17, 1998 speech, then Secretary of State Albright stepped up the U.S. outreach effort by calling for mutual confidence building measures that could lead to a ""road map"" for normalization of relations. Encouraged by the reformist victory in Iran's March 2000 parliamentary elections, Secretary Albright gave another speech on March 17, 2000, acknowledging past U.S. meddling in Iran, easing sanctions on some Iranian imports, and promising to work to resolve outstanding claims disputes. Iran welcomed the steps, but CRS-7   IB93033  01-29-03  called them insufficient to warrant the beginning of a dialogue. In early September 2000 meetings at the United Nations in connection with the Millennium Summit, Secretary Albright and President Clinton sent a positive signal to Iran by attending Khatemi's speeches. Until early 2002, the Bush Administration appeared to be continuing the Clinton Administration efforts, in part by building on the cooperation between the two countries in Afghanistan. The Administration's November 13, 2001 continuation of the 1979 national emergency on Iran justified the emergency by saying that U.S. ""relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal,"" a far softer statement than previous justifications sighting a continued threat from Iran. Supreme Leader Khamene'i sought to undermine any warming; on October 30, 2001, he threatened to dismiss any Iranian official who tried to forge relations with the United States. His statement came a few weeks after several Members of Congress had dinner in the Senate with Iran's U.N. representative. The thawing in relations has largely reversed since January 2002. Allegations of Iran's sale of arms to the Palestinian Authority and reputed meddling in Afghanistan, and revelations of new undeclared nuclear sites at Arak and Natanz (see above) have caused the Administration and Congress to become more critical of Iran's intentions and actions. As noted above, President Bush named Iran as part of an ""axis of evil"" in his State of the Union message. On July 12, 2002, President Bush issued a statement supporting those Iranians demonstrating for reform and democracy, a message he reiterated on December 20, 2002 when he inaugurated a new U.S. broadcast to Iran, Radio Farda (Tomorrow). Even though the Bush Administration might need Iranian cooperation in its efforts to disarm Iraq or change its regime, the statements signaled a shift in U.S. policy from attempting to engage and support Khatemi and his faction to publicly supporting Iranian reformers and activists. This view, based on the conclusion that engaging Khatemi would not produce more moderate Iranian policies on key issues, was mirrored in Congress during 2002 when several Members called for U.S. efforts to promote civil society in Iran. Two resolutions introduced in late July 2002 (S.Res. 306 and H.Res. 504) called for positive U.S. gestures toward ""the people of Iran, and not political figures whose survival depends upon preservation of the current regime."" Some interpreted the U.S. shift as a move toward a policy of regime change for Iran.  Economic Sanctions Since the November 4, 1979 seizure of the U.S. hostages in Tehran, economic sanctions have formed a major part of U.S. policy toward Iran. On November 14, 1979, President Carter declared a national emergency with respect to Iran, renewed every year since 1979. Terrorism/Foreign Aid. Following the October 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Lebanon, believed perpetrated by Hizballah, Iran was added to the ""terrorism list"" in January 1984. The designation bans direct U.S. financial assistance and arms sales, restricts sales of U.S. dual use items, and requires the United States to oppose multilateral lending to the designated countries. Separate from its position on the terrorism list, successive foreign aid appropriations laws since the late 1980s ban direct assistance to Iran (loans, credits, insurance, Eximbank credits) and indirect assistance (U.S. contributions to international organizations that work in Iran). Section 307 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (added in 1985) names Iran as unable to benefit from U.S. contributions to international organizations, requiring proportionate cuts if these institutions work in Iran. Iran also has CRS-8   IB93033  01-29-03  been designated every year since 1997 as not cooperating with U.S. anti-terrorism efforts, under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (P.L. 104-132). That Act penalizes countries that assist or sell arms to terrorism list countries, and another law (the Defense Department Authorization Act of 1987) limits Defense Department contracts with companies controlled by terrorism list states ($100,000 contract limit). U.S. regulations do not bar disaster relief and the United States donated $125,000, through relief agencies, to help victims of two earthquakes in Iran (February and May 1997), and another $350,000 worth of aid to the victims of a June 22, 2002 earthquake. Proliferation Sanctions. Several sanctions laws are unique to Iran. The Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act (P.L. 102-484) requires denial of license applications for exports to Iran of dual use items, and imposes sanctions on foreign countries that transfer to Iran ""destabilizing numbers and types of conventional weapons,"" as well as WMD technology. The Iran Nonproliferation Act (P.L. 106-178) authorizes sanctions on foreign entities that assist Iran's WMD programs. It bans U.S. extraordinary payments to the Russian Aviation and Space Agency in connection with the international space station unless the President can certify that the agency or entities under the Agency's control had not transferred any WMD or missile-related technology to Iran within the year prior. The provision contains certain exceptions to ensure the safety of astronauts who will use the space station and for certain space station hardware. During 2001 and 2002, a number of entities in North Korea, China, India, Armenia, and Moldova have been sanctioned under the Iran Nonproliferation Act, the Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-484), and another law, the Chemical and Biological Warfare Elimination Act of 1991, for sales to Iran. Counternarcotics. In February 1987, Iran was first designated as a state that failed to cooperate with U.S. anti-drug efforts or take adequate steps to control narcotics production or trafficking. U.S. and U.N. Drug Control Program (UNDCP) assessments of drug production in Iran prompted the Clinton Administration, on December 7, 1998, to remove Iran from the U.S. list of major drug producing countries. The decision exempts Iran from the annual certification process that kept drug-related U.S. sanctions in place on Iran. Britain reportedly has sold Iran small arms for its anti-drug efforts on the Afghan border. Trade Ban. On May 6, 1995, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12959 banning U.S. trade and investment in Iran, including the trading of Iranian oil overseas by U.S. companies. This followed an earlier March 1995 executive order barring U.S. investment in Iran's energy sector, and, although modified, has been extended each year since. On March 13, 2001, President Bush renewed the declaration of a state of emergency that triggered the March 1995 investment ban. An August 1997 amendment to the trade ban (Executive Order 13059) prevented U.S. companies from knowingly exporting goods to a third country for incorporation into products destined for Iran. The trade ban was partly intended to blunt criticism that U.S. trade with Iran made U.S. appeals for multilateral containment of Iran less credible. Some goods related to the safe operation of civilian aircraft can be licensed for export to Iran, and in December 1999, the Clinton Administration allowed the repair of engine mountings on seven Iran Air 747's (Boeing). Implementing regulations do not permit U.S. firms to negotiate investment deals with Iran. Following a 1998 application by a U.S. firm to sell Iran agricultural products, and in the context of Clinton Administration and congressional reviews of U.S. unilateral sanctions policies, the Clinton Administration announced in April 1999 that it would license, on a CRS-9   IB93033  01-29-03  case-by-case basis, commercial sales of food and medical products to certain countries on which unilateral U.S. trade bans are in place (Iran, Libya, and Sudan). Under regulations issued in July 1999, private letters of credit can be used to finance approved sales, but no U.S. government credit guarantees were made available and U.S. exporters were not permitted to deal directly with Iranian banks. Iran says the lack of credit makes U.S. sales, particularly of wheat, uncompetitive. The FY2001 agriculture appropriations (P.L. 106-387), contains a provision banning the use of official credit guarantees for food and medical sales to Iran and other countries on the U.S. terrorism list, except Cuba, although allowing for a presidential waiver to permit such credit guarantees. The Clinton Administration did not provide credit guarantees, and the Bush Administration has not done so either. In her March 17, 2000 speech, then Secretary Albright announced an easing of the trade ban to allow U.S. importation of Iranian nuts, dried fruits, carpets, and caviar; regulations governing the imports were issued in April 2000. The United States was the largest market for Iranian carpets before the 1979 revolution, although U.S. anti-dumping tariffs imposed on Iranian pistachio nut imports since 1986 (over 300%, although the Commerce Department is expected to lower this tariff in the near future) are dampening imports of that product. In January 2003, the tariff on roasted pistachios was lowered to 22% and on raw pistachios to 163%. Iranian caviar and carpets are now sold in the United States; the Iranian carpet market could eventually reach an estimated $100 million per year. The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA). The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA, H.R. 3107, P.L. 104-172, signed August 5, 1996), a law that sanctions foreign investment in Iran or Libya's energy sector, was to expire on August 5, 2001. H.R. 1954, which renewed ILSA for five years but requires an Administration report on its effectiveness within 24-30 months, was passed by large majorities in both chambers in July 2001. It was signed on August 3, 2001 (P.L. 107-24). In testimony before the House International Relations Committee on June 20, 2002, a senior State Department official said that the Bush Administration probably would waive sanctions on European companies that invest in Iran, in exchange for European assistance in curbing Iran's WMD programs and terrorism. The statement was a response to calls in Congress (H.Res.434) to sanction Canadian oil company Sheer Energy, which, in May 2002, announced an $80 million contract to develop an Iranian oil field. On October 28, 2002, Norway's Statoil signed an agreement to invest $300 million to develop phases six, seven, and eight or Iran's South Pars gas field. See CRS Report RS20871, The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA). Caspian/Central Asian Energy Routes Through Iran. The U.S. trade ban permits U.S. companies to apply for licenses to conduct ""swaps"" of Caspian Sea oil with Iran, but, as part of a U.S. policy to route Central Asian energy around Iran (and Russia), a Mobil Corporation application to do so was denied in April 1999. The Administration continues to oppose, and to threaten imposing ILSA sanctions on, pipeline projects that route Caspian/Central Asian energy through Iran. U.S. policy has been to strongly favor construction of a pipeline that would cross the Caspian Sea and let out in Ceyhan, Turkey (Baku-Ceyhan pipeline), avoiding Iran or Russia. Four Caspian nations (Turkey, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan) signed an agreement embracing Baku-Ceyhan on November 18, 1999, and regional and corporate support for the project has gained momentum to the point where pipeline construction is expected to begin in earnest soon. Kazakhstan nonetheless is pushing for construction of an oil pipeline across Iran. Despite U.S. pressure not to import Iranian gas, in December 2001 Turkey began doing so through a new crossCRS-10   IB93033  01-29-03  border pipeline, under an August 1996 agreement. (See CRS Report 98-86, Iran: Relations With Key Central Asian States.) Europe and Japan's Relations With/Lending to Iran. U.S.-allied differences on Iran narrowed since 1998 in concert with the Clinton Administration's attempt to engage Iran, a policy consistently favored by the European countries as a way to moderate Iran's behavior. During 1992-1997, the European Union (EU) countries maintained a policy of ""critical dialogue"" with Iran. The United States did not oppose those talks but maintained that the EU's dialogue would not change Iranian behavior. The dialogue was suspended immediately following the April 1997 German terrorism trial that found high-level Iranian involvement in assassinating Iranian dissidents in Germany. Alongside the post-1997 U.S. shift toward engagement, the EU-Iran dialogue formally resumed in May 1998. Since then, Khatemi has undertaken state visits to several Western countries, including Italy (March 1999), France (October 1999), Germany (July 2000), and Japan (November 2000). The United States publicly welcomed these visits. On December 12, 2002, Iran and the EU began formal negotiations on a trade pact that would lower the tariffs or increase quotas for Iranian exports to the EU countries, with some linkage to Iran addressing EU concerns on Iran's human rights practices and terrorism sponsorship. The resolution of the ""Rushdie affair"" to Britain's satisfaction sparked improvement in its relations with Iran. Iran maintains that Ayatollah Khomeini's 1989 death sentence against author Salman Rushdie cannot be revoked (his ""Satanic Verses"" novel was labeled blasphemous) because Khomeini is no longer alive to revoke it. However, on September 24, 1998, Iran's Foreign Minister pledged to Britain that Iran will not seek to implement the sentence and opposes any bounties offered for his death. Britain then upgraded relations with Iran to the ambassadorial level, and Foreign Ministers of the two countries have exchanged several visits. In October 2000, Britain began extending longer term credit (two years or greater) for exports to Iran. Some Iranian clerics (outside the formal government structure) have said the death sentence stands, and the Iranian government has not required the Fifteen Khordad foundation to withdraw its $2.8 million reward for Rushdie's death. Khatemi said on June 4, 2001 that he considers the issue closed. In August 1999, Japan continued a gradual improvement in relations with Iran by announcing a resumption of Japan's official development lending program for Iran to construct a hydroelectric dam over the Karun River. However, the $70 million increment announced was less that Iran had wanted, and Japan said that this tranche would close out Japan's involvement in the project. (In 1993, Japan provided the first $400 million tranche of the overall $1.4 billion official development loan program, but the lending was subsequently placed on hold as the United States sought to persuade its allies to pressure Iran.) In late January 2000, Japan agreed to resume medium- and long-term export credit insurance for exports to Iran, suspended since 1994. Economic relations improved further during Khatemi's November 2000 visit to Tokyo, which resulted in Iran's granting Japanese firms the first right to negotiate to develop the large Azadegan field, and Iran and a Japaneseled consortium are moving forward with preliminary studies of the field. Some press reports suggest that Royal Dutch/Shell might join the Azadegan project, apparently because it can provide needed technology. In exchange, Japan agreed to prepay Iran $1 billion per year for the next 3 years for Iranian oil. Partly at U.S. urging, Japan refused to extend to Iran additional official loans.  CRS-11   IB93033  01-29-03  During 1994-1995, and over U.S. objections at the time, Iran's European and Japanese creditors rescheduled about $16 billion in Iranian debt. These countries (governments and private creditors) rescheduled the debt bilaterally, in spite of Paris Club rules that call for multilateral rescheduling and International Monetary Fund (IMF) involvement. Iran has worked its external debt down from $32 billion in 1997 to about $20 billion as of March 2002, according to Iran's Central Bank. The improved debt picture has led most European export credit agencies, including Germany's Hermes, France's COFACE, and that of Spain, to restore insurance cover for exports to Iran. In July 2002, Iran tapped international capital markets for the first time since the Islamic revolution, selling $500 million in bonds to European banks. At the urging of the U.S. government, in May 2002 Moody's stopped its credit ratings service for Iran's government bonds on the grounds that performing the credit ratings service might violate the U.S. trade ban. Multilateral Lending to Iran. Section 1621 of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-132) amended the Foreign Assistance Act to require the United States to vote against international loans to countries on the U.S. terrorism list. Acting under provisions of successive foreign aid laws, in 1993 the United States voted its 16.5% share of the World Bank against loans to Iran of $460 million for electricity, health, and irrigation projects. To signal opposition to international lending to Iran, the FY1994 foreign aid appropriations act (P.L. 103-87) cut the Administration's request for the U.S. contribution to the World Bank by the amount of those loans. That law, the FY1995 foreign aid appropriation (P.L. 103-326), and the FY1996 foreign aid appropriations (P.L. 104-107), would have significantly reduced U.S. payments to the Bank if it had provided new loans to Iran. By 1999, Iran's moderating image had led the World Bank to consider new loans. In May 2000, the United States was unsuccessful in obtaining further delay on a vote on new lending for Iran, and its allies outvoted the United States to approve $232 million in loans for health and sewage projects. Twenty one of the Bank's twenty four governors voted in favor, and France and Canada abstained. Earlier, Iran also had asked the International Monetary Fund for about $400 million in loans (its quota is about $2 billion) to help it deal with its trade financing shortfalls. However, Iran balked at accepting IMF conditionality, and there was no agreement. Despite the required U.S. opposition, on May 10, 2001, the World Bank's executive directors voted to approve a two-year economic reform plan for Iran that envisions $775 million in new Bank loans. In May 2003, the Bank will consider a $112 million loan to Iran for low- and middle-income housing. WTO. The Bush Administration said in 2001 that U.S. opposition to Iran's membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) was ""under review,"" but there have been no recent indications in 2002 that the United States will drop that opposition. On several occasions since mid-2001, the WTO, at U.S. urging, postponed a discussion on whether to launch entry talks with Iran. Travel Sanctions. Use of U.S. passports for travel to Iran is permitted, but a State Department travel warning, softened somewhat in April 1998, asks that Americans ""defer"" travel to Iran. Iranians entering the United States are required to be fingerprinted. Assets Disputes/Victims of Terrorism. Iran claims that the United States has frozen vast amounts of Iranian assets, presenting an obstacle to improved relations. A U.S.CRS-12   IB93033  01-29-03  Iran Claims Tribunal, at the Hague, is arbitrating cases resulting from the break in relations following the Iranian revolution. The major cases yet to be decided center on hundreds of Foreign Military Sales cases between the United States and the Shah's regime, which Iran claims it paid for but were unfulfilled. About $400 million in proceeds from the resale of that equipment is in a DOD account. In April 2000, then Secretary Albright named a representative to negotiate a resolution of the claims issue at the Hague. The assets issue moved to the forefront following several U.S. court judgements against Iran for past acts of terrorism against Americans, filed under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. Since March 1998, U.S. courts have awarded the following: $247 million to the family of Alisa Flatow, killed in Israel in April 1995 in a bombing by Palestinian Islamic Jihad (awarded in March 1998); $65 million to three Americans held hostage in Lebanon - David Jacobsen, Joseph Cicippio, and Frank Reed (August 1998); $324 for Lebanon hostage Terry Anderson (March 2000); $327 million to the families of two Americans killed in a February 1996 Hamas bombing (July 2000); and $355 million to the family of Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, killed by Hizballah in 1989 (September 2000). Former Lebanon hostage Thomas Sutherland won a $353 million judgement against Iran on June 26, 2001. In August 2001, the family of former Lebanon hostage father Lawrence Jenco won a $314.6 million judgment against Iran for his captivity. In June 2001, former hostages Benjamin Weir and Frank Regier sued Iran for over $100 million for their captivity in Lebanon. Also in early June 2001, the family of former hostage Peter Kilburn, who was killed in the course of his captivity in Lebanon, filed a suit against both Libya and Iran for more than $200 million. In October 2001, victims of the October 1983 Hizballah bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut filed a $5 billion suit against Iran. On January 23, 2002, a federal judge ordered Iran to pay $42 million to the family of Charles Hegna, who was beaten in the course of a 1984 Hizballah hijacking of Kuwait Air 221. On February 6, 2002, a federal judge awarded $56 million to the family of Ira Weinstein, killed in a 1996 Hamas bus bombing in Israel. On the basis of the sanctity of diplomatic property, the Clinton Administration blocked efforts by the claimants to satisfy their judgments from frozen Iranian assets  diplomatic property in Washington (worth about $22 million) or the DOD account mentioned above. In December 1999, the Clinton Administration also blocked a Flatow effort to seize a $6 million U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal judgement awarded to Iran. A provision of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (H.R. 3244, P.L. 106-386) provides for the use of general revenues to pay 110% of compensatory damage awards to the above and future successful claimants in a total not to exceed the rental proceeds from Iran's diplomatic property and the DOD account. (The tenant of the Iranian Embassy building was evicted for non-payment of rent in March 2002, with rent of about $750,000 overdue.) The provision requires the President to try to recoup the expended funds from Iran as part of an overall reconciliation in relations and assets settlement, although there is no requirement that funds ultimately be withheld from Iran. A provision of the FY2002 Commerce, Justice, State requires an Administration legislative proposal on how to claimants in future terrorism-related judgments against Iran. ruled that Iran, under the Algiers Accords, had immunity from CRS-13 appropriation (P.L. 107-77) compensate successful U.S. In April 2002, a federal judge a lawsuit by the 52 Americans   IB93033  01-29-03  held hostage by Iran for 444 days. With regard to the 52 American hostages, the conference report on the FY2002 defense appropriation (P.L. 107-117, H.Rept.107-350) states that the hostages should be able to collect damages from Iranian assets, notwithstanding U.S.-Iran agreements on the disposition of Iran's assets. Regarding the mistaken U.S. shootdown on July 3,1988 of an Iranian Airbus passenger jet, on February 22, 1996, the United States, responding to an Iranian case before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), agreed to pay Iran up to $61.8 million in compensation ($300,000 per wage earning victim, $150,000 per non wage earner) for the 248 Iranians killed in the shootdown. The funds for this settlement came from a general appropriation for judgments against the United States. The United States previously paid $3 million in death benefits for 47 non-Iranians killed in the attack, but has not compensated Iran for the airplane itself. A different case, pending before the ICJ, involves an Iranian claim for damages to Iranian oil platforms during U.S. naval clashes with Iran in October 1987 and April 1988.  Military Containment U.S. policy has focused on containing the military threat posed by Iran to the United States, U.S. allies in the Persian Gulf, and international shipping. Although containing Iraq has been the primary goal of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf region since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, U.S. military officials note that U.S. forces could potentially be used against Iran, if the President so decides. U.S. military officers note that their encounters with Iranian naval vessels in the Gulf have been more professional since Khatemi took office.  Iran's Opposition Movements It is not official U.S. policy to change Iran's regime, and the United States does not fund Iranian opposition movements. In 1995, the Clinton Administration accepted a House-Senate conference agreement to include $18-$20 million in funding authority for covert operations against Iran in the FY1996 intelligence authorization act (H.R. 1655, P.L. 104-93) -- about $14 million more than requested -- according to a Washington Post report of December 22, 1995. The Clinton Administration reportedly focused the covert aid on changing the regime's behavior, rather than its overthrow. The conference report on H.R. 2267 (H.Rept. 105-405), the FY1998 Commerce/State/ Justice appropriation, provided $4 million for a ""Radio Free Iran,"" to be run by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). The radio, which the Administration called the Farsi service of RFE/RL, began operations in Prague on October 31, 1998, and has become, as of December 2002, Radio Farda (Tomorrow), which will broadcast nearly around the clock. Another $4 million for the radio for FY1999 was provided by the omnibus appropriation (H.R. 4328, P.L. 105-277). (See CRS Report 98-539, Radio Free Iraq and Radio Free Iran: Background, Legislation, and Policy Issues for Congress.) Since the late 1980s, the State Department has refused contact with the anti-regime People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI) and its umbrella organization, the National Council of Resistance (NCR). It was designated as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO) in October 1997 under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. In November 2002, a letter signed by about 150 House Members was released, asking the President to remove the PMOI from the FTO list. For further information on this group, see CRS Report RL31119, Terrorism: Near Eastern Groups and State Sponsors, 2002. CRS-14   IB93033  01-29-03  Some Iranian exiles follow the son of the late former Shah, who lives in the United States. On January 24, 2001, the Shah's son, Reza Pahlavi, 40 years old, ended a long period of inactivity by giving a speech in Washington calling for unity in opposition to the current regime and for the institution of a constitutional monarchy and genuine democracy in Iran. He has since broadcast messages into Iran from a station in California, and press reports say a growing number of Iranians are listening to his broadcasts.  CRS-15"

Its people participate in high percentages in regular, free, and fair elections which determine the distribution of power among political parties and leaders.     Elected officials control the police force, which scrupulously observes and enforces the laws that ensure protection of human rights.     Iceland has a mixed, open economy, in which citizens have the right to hold private property. It provides residents with a high standard of living. The leading export, marine products, accounts for almost 80 percent of export revenues.     The Government fully respects the human rights of its citizens, and the law and judiciary provide effective means of dealing with instances of individual abuse. There is some societal discrimination against women, which the Government has begun to address.     RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS      Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from :     a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing     There were no reports of political or other extrajudicial killings.     b. Disappearance     There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.     c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment     Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment are prohibited by law and do not occur. Prison conditions are good, but most prisons are full, and many are antiquated. The Government has begun a construction program to alleviate these difficulties.     d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile     The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.     e. Denial of Fair Public Trial     The Constitution and law provide for an independent judiciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The Ministry of Justice administers the lower court system, while the Supreme Court guards its independence and fairness. Juries are not used, but multijudge panels are common, especially in the appeals process. All judges, at all levels, serve for life.     The judiciary provides citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process. Defendants are presumed innocent. They are guaranteed the right of access to legal counsel of their own choosing in time to prepare their defense. For defendants unable to pay attorneys' fees, the State assumes the cost. Defendants have the right to be present at their trial, to confront witnesses, and to participate otherwise in the proceedings. No groups are barred from testifying, and all testimony is treated alike. Trials are public and are conducted fairly, with no official intimidation. Defendants have the right to appeal.     There were no reports of political prisoners.     f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence     The Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.     Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including :     a. Freedom of Speech and Press     The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.     b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association     The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.     c. Freedom of Religion     Although the official state religion is Lutheranism, the Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government respects this right in practice.     d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation     The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government respects them in practice. The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. There were no reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status. The issue of the provision of first asylum did not arise in 1996. The Government responded to the UNHCR's request that it take in refugees from the former Yugoslavia by accepting 31 in 1996. The Icelandic Red Cross and the town of Isafjordur, where the refugees were settled, made significant efforts to begin incorporating them into Icelandic society.     Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Government      The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair elections held on the basis of universal suffrage. The most recent elections to the Althing (unicameral Parliament) were held in April 1995.     There are no legal or practical impediments to women's participation in government and politics. There is an active feminist political party, the Women's List, which won 3 of 63 seats in the 1995 parliamentary elections.     Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights      A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.     Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or Social Status      The culture of the ethnically homogeneous population is strongly egalitarian and opposed to discrimination based on any of these factors. Government legislation and practice generally reflect this attitude.     Women     Increased governmental awareness of violence against women, resulting from extensive media coverage, has led to stiffening of sentencing for sex offenders. The tougher sentencing derives from improved action by the courts in more strictly enforcing existing laws. A police program to train officers in correct interrogation procedures in rape and sexual abuse cases appears to be addressing prior concerns that police indifference and hostility to female victims did not assure victims of such abuses proper attention and consideration.     There is a public women's shelter that offers protection to approximately 350 women and 200 children per year; these figures are virtually unchanged since 1995. There is also a rape trauma center sponsored and operated by women's organizations; some 400 women and children seek assistance annually. Both facilities are funded by national and municipal governments, and private contributions. The Reykjavik City Hospital emergency ward has an all-female staff to care for rape victims. During the year the emergency ward reported 76 visits associated with incidents of rape or sexual abuse. Hospital officials estimate that only 55 percent of these victims press charges and only a handful of cases actually go to trial, attributing this to fear of publicity in such a small, tight-knit society.     The Women's List political movement and the female Mayor of Reykjavik have kept women's issues in the forefront of public debate. The 1996 Conservative Independence Party convention focused on increasing the political participation of women and on women's issues in general. While major political institutions and businesses remain male dominated, the Government is taking steps to enforce legislation requiring equal pay for equal work. The 20 percent gap in earnings between men and women in comparable jobs narrowed somewhat nationally but dropped significantly in Reykjavik to 10 to 15 percent.     Since 1991 complaints regarding the Equal Rights Law have been referred to a special committee under the Equal Rights Affairs Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs. However, the committee has only advisory powers, and its recommendations to employers do not have the force of law. Few complaints are made to the committee.     Children     The Government demonstrates its strong commitment to children's rights through its well-funded systems of public education and medical care. The Government provides free prenatal and infant medical care, as well as heavily subsidized children's care. Compulsory education ends in the 10th grade. About 85 percent of students continue to upper secondary education, which is financed completely by the State. In 1994 the Government created the Office of the Children's Ombudsman in the Prime Ministry, with a mandate to protect children's rights, interests, and welfare by, among other things, exerting influence on legislation, government decisions, and public attitudes. The Parliament ratified the Hague Convention on Child Abduction which entered into force in December. This action is expected to facilitate the handling of international child custody cases.     There is no societal pattern of abuse directed against children.     People with Disabilities     Disabled individuals are not subject to discrimination in employment, education, or provision of other state services. The Government has legislated accessibility to public buildings for the disabled.     Section 6 Worker Rights      a. The Right of Association     Workers make extensive use of the right to establish organizations, draw up their own constitutions and rules, choose their own leaders and policies, and publicize their views. The resulting organizations are controlled neither by the Government nor any single political party. Unions take active part in Nordic, European, and international trade union bodies. With the exception of limited categories of workers in the public sector whose services are essential to public health or safety, unions have had and used the right to strike for many years. Some 76 percent of all eligible workers belong to unions.     b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively     There are no impediments to union membership in law or in practice. Virtually all unions exercise their right to bargain collectively. The central labor and management organizations periodically negotiate collective bargaining agreements that set nationwide standards and specific terms for workers' pay, workhours, and other conditions. The Government often plays a role in the negotiations, and sometimes undertakes commitments in order to bring the two sides together. Labor courts effectively adjudicate disputes over contracts and over the rights provided for in the 1938 Act on Trade Unions and Industrial Disputes, which prohibits antiunion discrimination.     By law, employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union activities. In practice, the charges are difficult to prove.     In May the Parliament passed legislation updating the labor laws and bringing them into compliance with the European human rights convention.     There are no export processing or other special economic zones.     c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor     Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law and does not occur.     d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children     The law requires children to attend school until the age of 16 years and prohibits employment of children under that age in factories, on ships, or in other places that are hazardous or require hard labor. This prohibition is observed in practice. Children 14 or 15 years old may be employed part-time or during school vacations in light, nonhazardous work. Their workhours must not exceed the ordinary workhours of adults in the same occupation. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration enforces child labor regulations.     e. Acceptable Conditions of Work     Although there is no minimum wage law, union membership is so extensive and effective as to ensure that labor contracts afford even the lowest paid workers a sufficient income for a decent standard of living for themselves and their families.     Workers are protected by laws that effectively ensure their health and safety as well as provide for unemployment insurance, paid vacations, pensions, and reasonable working conditions and hours. The standard legal workweek is 40 hours. Work exceeding 8 hours in a workday must be compensated as overtime. Workers are entitled to 10 hours of rest within each 24-hour period and to a day off every week. Under defined special circumstances the 10-hour rest period can be reduced to 8, and the day off can be postponed by a week, in which case the worker has a right to 2 additional hours off in the following week.     Health and safety standards are set by the Althing and administered and enforced by the Ministry of Social Affairs through its Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

GX038-06-2901107	"[Print Friendly Version]      Iceland Country Reports on Human Rights Practices   -   2000 Released by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor February 23, 2001   Iceland is a constitutional republic and a parliamentary democracy in which citizens periodically choose their representatives in free and fair multiparty elections. The judiciary is independent.   Elected officials control the police force, which scrupulously observes and enforces the laws that ensure protection of human rights.   Iceland has a mixed, open economy that provides residents with a high standard of living. The leading exports, fish and other marine products, account for almost 70 percent of export revenues. An abundance of cheap hydroelectric power provides a comparative advantage for the main manufacturing activity--aluminum smelting. Aluminum is the second leading export. Growth was expected to approach 4 percent in 1999.    The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law and judiciary provide effective means of dealing with individual instances of abuse. Human rights monitors expressed concern about the Government's frequent use of solitary confinement for remand prisoners. The Government is taking steps to deal with violence against women. Some societal discrimination against women persists, especially in the area of equal pay. Instances of suspected trafficking in women were reported.   RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS   Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:   a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing   There were no reports of political or other extrajudicial killings.   b. Disappearance   There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.   c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment   Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment are prohibited by law and do not occur.    Prison conditions generally meet minimum international standards. Most of the country's small prison population (less than 100 inmates total) is held at Litla Hraun Prison in Reykjavik, which includes a state-of-the-art detention facility opened in 1995. However, the prison system still uses a substandard jail (Hegningarhusid in downtown Reykjavik) to hold a small number of prisoners, where the individual cells lack toilets and sinks.   Human rights monitors have expressed concern about the use of illegal drugs by some inmates at Litla Hraun Prison and about the lack of social services to help inmates overcome drug addiction and prepare them for eventual release. Despite the small inmate population at Litla Hraun, the authorities have not been able to stop narcotics from being smuggled into the prison.   In a 1999 report, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) expressed concern during its visit to Litla Hraun prison in 1998 that nearly all detainees still were placed in solitary confinement while their cases were under investigation. While the average duration of solitary confinement was between 2 and 3 weeks, the CPT noted that in some cases, solitary confinement lasted up to 3 months. Under the strictest form of solitary confinement, prisoners cannot leave their cells, except briefly to exercise alone or to use the showers, and are not allowed to listen to the radio, watch television, or receive visitors other than their lawyers, the prison doctor, and a chaplain. In November 1999, the supervising doctor at Litla Hraun wrote to prison authorities, warning that the mental health of several prisoners awaiting trial on drug trafficking charges could be in danger due to the extended time that they were expected to spend in solitary confinement.   In a preliminary response to the CPT report on September 30, 1999, the Government argued that solitary confinement was absolutely necessary in some circumstances to keep suspects from tampering with witnesses, destroying evidence, or hindering the investigation. On the other hand, it conceded that ""in the vast majority of cases"" incarceration alone was sufficient to protect the integrity of witnesses and evidence. However, the Prison and Probation Administration's statistics show that solitary confinement has been the rule rather than the exception, with most of those arrested being placed into solitary confinement, at least initially.   In May the European Court of Human Rights ruled in favor of an Icelandic woman who had been denied compensation for wrongful arrest on the grounds that she had not cooperated with police. The woman was held in solitary confinement for 5 weeks in 1989 in connection with a drug case before being cleared and released. The Government since has changed the law to make it easier for victims of wrongful arrest to receive compensation, recognizing the principle that all detainees should be presumed innocent until proven guilty.    With the closing of the Sudumuli remand prison in 1996, the Government passed a law in 1998 that allows pretrial detainees to be incarcerated with the general prison population. Some human rights monitors claim that this law is inconsistent with the country's obligations under the European Human Rights Convention and European prison rules issued by the Council of Europe.    Juveniles who are 15 years of age or older can be sentenced to prison terms, but the vast majority of juvenile offenders are given probation or suspended sentences or agree to attend a treatment program instead of going to jail. In the rare instances when juvenile offenders are incarcerated, they are confined with the general adult prison population due to the lack of a separate detention facility for juveniles. In its 1999 report, the CPT stated that it was ""very concerned"" about the current situation and recommended that the Government take ""immediate steps...to ensure that juvenile prisoners are held separately from adults."" In signing the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1990, the Government entered a reservation on the provision requiring the separation of adult and juvenile prisoners. Government officials said that it is not practical to establish and operate a separate facility for juvenile prisoners in a small country like Iceland because the requirement to incarcerate a juvenile occurs so infrequently.   The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors.   d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile   The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest, detention, and exile, and the Government observes these prohibitions.   e. Denial of Fair Public Trial   The Constitution and law provide for an independent judiciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice.   There are two levels of courts. A five-member Judicial Council appointed by the Minister of Justice administers the district courts, while the Supreme Court guards its independence and fairness by administering itself. All judges, at all levels, serve for life.   The judiciary provides citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process. Juries are not used, but multijudge panels are common, especially in the Supreme Court, which hears all appeals. Depending on the seriousness of the case, a Supreme Court panel can include from three to seven judges. Defendants are presumed innocent. They are provided access to legal counsel of their own choosing with sufficient time to prepare their defense. For defendants unable to pay attorneys' fees, the state covers the cost, as set by the court, but defendants are required to reimburse the state. Defendants have the right to be present at their trial, to confront witnesses, and to participate otherwise in the proceedings. No groups are barred from testifying, and all testimony is treated alike. The courts have the discretion to allow the introduction of evidence obtained illegally by the police. With limited exceptions, trials are public and conducted fairly, with no official intimidation. Defendants have the right to appeal.   There were no reports of political prisoners.   f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence   The Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.   Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:   a. Freedom of Speech and Press   The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.   b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association   The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.   c. Freedom of Religion   Although the official state religion is Lutheranism, the Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government respects this right in practice. The salaries of Lutheran ministers are paid by the state. Citizens 16 years of age and above are presumed to be members of the state church and are required to support the church by paying a tax, unless they designate another religious denomination to receive their tax payment. The religion tax payment of persons who choose not to belong to any specific, organized religious group goes to the University of Iceland. Religious instruction in Christianity is required in the public schools, although students may be exempted.    A new law passed by Parliament in December 1999 (Law No. 108) sets specific conditions and procedures that religious organizations must follow in order to be recognized officially and registered by the State. Such recognition is necessary in order for religious organizations other than the state church to receive a per capita share of church tax funds. The 1999 law is narrower in scope than the 1975 law it replaced and applies only to religious organizations that are seeking to be, or are already, officially recognized and registered. No restrictions or requirements are placed on unregistered religious organizations, which have the same rights as other groups in society. The law is considered necessary to deal with frequent attempts by individuals to obtain recognition of religious organizations simply to receive the tax income benefits.    d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation   The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.    Although neither the Constitution nor the 1965 Law on the Supervision of Foreigners includes provisions for granting refugee or asylee status in accordance with the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 protocol, in practice the Government adjudicates cases in accordance with their principles. The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Committee of the Red Cross, and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees.   However, human rights monitors have expressed concern about the lack of a modern and comprehensive immigration law to govern the processing of asylum seekers and to provide a framework for the handling of foreigners and immigrants in general. In particular there is concern that the Supervision of Foreigners Law gives police and custom officers at ports of entry too much discretion to deny admission to asylum seekers whose claims they deem to be not ""credible.""    In response the Government states that official discretion is rarely exercised and that none of the 42 individuals who were denied entry to the country during the first 9 months of 2000 requested asylum. Nevertheless, many government officials agree that a comprehensive and modern immigration law is necessary.   In view of the country's geographic isolation and the lack of direct transportation from any traditional source of refugees, the question of first asylum rarely arises. However, the Directorate of Immigration (which is responsible for adjudicating applications for asylum) and the Icelandic Red Cross (which houses and assists asylum seekers under a contact with the Government) report that 24 individuals applied for asylum during the year, compared with 17 in 1999. None was found to qualify for refugee status (several cases were still under consideration or on appeal), but the 1999 application of an individual who claimed to be 17 years old and fleeing persecution in central Africa was approved. It was the first application for asylum status ever approved. There were no reports of asylum seekers being detained or forcibly expelled during the year.   The Government accepted 23 UNHCR-designated ""quota"" refugees from the former Yugoslavia during the year, continuing a program begun in 1996 of bringing in 20 to 25 refugees from the region each year. In 1999 the Government also admitted 75 Kosovar refugees into the country, 37 of whom since returned to Kosovo with the financial support of the Government. Local government authorities in the towns where refugees settle take a strong interest in helping them adapt to their new environment. The Icelandic Red Cross, in cooperation with the Refugee Council of the Ministry of Social Affairs, developed a support family program, whereby at least three Icelandic families are enlisted to assist each refugee or refugee family. The refugees immediately are granted work permits and assisted in finding jobs. For the first year, they also are given free housing, utilities, and health care and receive a stipend so that they can participate daily in a special half-day language course designed specially for them. Refugees generally are successful in assimilating into society, but their children generally drop out of school earlier than children of citizens.   Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Government   The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair elections held on the basis of universal suffrage. The most recent elections to the Althingi (unicameral Parliament) were held in May 1999.   Women are underrepresented in government and politics, but no legal or practical impediments hinder their participation. Some human rights monitors criticized the Minister of Justice (herself a woman) for filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court during the year by choosing the sole male candidate (who had never served on the bench) over three experienced female district court judges. Only one of the nine Supreme Court justices is a woman. Similarly, only 2 of 12 ministerial permanent secretaries (civil servants who function as deputy ministers) are women.   Women have greater representation in politics. Of the 12 government ministers, 4 are women, and women hold 24 of the 63 seats in Parliament. There has been a marked increase in the number of female parliamentarians elected since the Women's List (WL), a feminist political party, was founded in 1983. The WL forced the established political parties to nominate more female candidates or face losing support. The WL disappeared from the scene as the result of a political party merger, but its legacy survives. Women's issues have moved into the mainstream of political debate, and all of the major political parties now have at least one woman in a prominent leadership position.    Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights   A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.   Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or Social Status   The country's ethnically homogenous population is strongly egalitarian and opposed to discrimination based on any of these factors. The law and practice generally reflect this attitude.    Women   Violence against women continued to be a matter of concern. A public women's shelter offers counseling and protection to victims of domestic violence and their children. Approximately 340 women used the shelter during the year, 94 of whom sought temporary lodging, while the rest asked for counseling or information. About 60 children accompanied their mothers to the shelter during the year. At a rape trauma center, between 300 and 400 women and children seek assistance annually. Both facilities are financed by national and municipal governments, as well as by private contributors. The emergency ward of the National Hospital in Reykjavik has a special staff to care for rape victims. It reports approximately 100 visits per year associated with incidents of sexual abuse.   A police program to train officers in correct interrogation procedures in rape and sexual abuse cases appears to be addressing prior concerns that police indifference and hostility to female victims did not assure proper attention and consideration for victims of such abuses. Parliament passed legislation in May that gives courts the power to issue restraining orders, an action that human rights monitors praised as a potentially useful legal tool in keeping abusive husbands away from their spouses.   A large majority of victims nevertheless decline to press charges, and even more forgo trial, fearing publicity in this small, tightly knit society. With an increasing number of interracial marriages, mostly involving Icelandic men and Asian women, there is concern that these new Asian immigrants are not assimilating well into local society and could be vulnerable to mistreatment. To address this concern, the city of Reykjavik offers these immigrant women emergency accommodation, counseling, and information on legal rights, language training, and Icelandic societal norms.   There were indications that some foreign women were trafficked to work as striptease dancers or prostitutes against their will (see Sections 6.c. and 6.f.). The sale of sex for money is not illegal per se, but it is against the law for someone to engage in prostitution as his or her main source of income. It is also illegal to act as an intermediary in the sale or procurement of sex.   The rate of participation by women in the labor market is high. In part this reflects the country's comprehensive system of subsidized day care, which makes it affordable and convenient for women to work outside the home. The Act on the Equal Status of Men and Women requires that preference be given to the hiring and promotion of women in areas where they are underrepresented, as long as they are equal in all other respects to their male job seekers. Despite laws that require equal pay for equal work, a sizeable pay gap continues to exist between men and women. A survey by a union in Reykjavik showed that women, on average, earned 30 percent less than men. A 12 percent difference in pay is attributable to the fact that men work 4.2 more hours per week than women, but the rest of the gap is unexplained.   Parliament passed legislation during the year that gives fathers the same right as mothers to paid leave upon the birth of a child. When the law is fully implemented in 2003, both mother and father will be allowed to take 3 months of paid leave, with an additional 3 months that can be taken by either parent or shared between them. Previously, a mother was given 6 months of paid maternity leave and the father just 2 weeks. The new leave requirements apply equally to the public and private sectors.   Children   The Government demonstrates its strong commitment to children's rights through its well-funded systems of public education and medical care. School attendance is compulsory through the age of 15. About 85 percent of students continue to upper secondary education, which is financed completely by the State. The Government provides free prenatal and infant medical care, as well as heavily subsidized childcare. The Office of the Children's Ombudsman in the Prime Minister's Office has a mandate to protect children's rights, interests, and welfare by, among other things, exerting influence on legislation, government decisions, and public attitudes.    There is no societal pattern of abuse directed against children.   In an effort to improve the rate of prosecution of child sexual abuse and lessen the trauma to the child, the Government in 1998 established the Children's Assessment Center. The objective of the center is to create a safe and secure environment where child victims feel more comfortable talking about what happened to them and are not subjected to multiple interviews. The center brings together police, prosecutors, judges, doctors, and officials from child protection services. However, a 1999 change in the Code of Criminal Procedure inadvertently undermined the center by making judges (instead of the police) responsible for the investigatory interview of abused children and by allowing these interviews to be conducted in specially designed rooms at district courthouses. In September the Supreme Court upheld the right of a Reykjavik district court judge to hold an investigatory interview in the courthouse rather than at the assessment center. As of September, only about 20 percent of child sexual abuse cases were being handled through the center, a development that human rights monitors claim is a step backwards in the protection of children's rights.   People with Disabilities   Disabled individuals are not subject to discrimination in employment, education, or the provision of other state services. A 1992 law calls for the disabled to have the right to ""all common national and municipal services"" and provides that they be given assistance to ""make it possible for them to live and work in normal society with others."" The law also provides that the disabled should receive preference for a government job when they are qualified equally, or more qualified, than regular applicants.    Building regulations updated in 1998 call for public accommodations--such as hotels, restaurants, banks, and stores--as well as government buildings to be accessible so that persons in wheelchairs have access without assistance. Building regulations also specify that elevators in such buildings should be large enough to accommodate wheelchairs and that 1 percent of parking spaces (a minimum of one space) should be reserved for disabled use only. Moreover, the regulations specify that, to the extent possible, the sidewalk outside the main entrance of a public accommodation or government building should be heated so that it remains clear of ice and snow throughout the winter.    The 1997 Planning and Building Act provides that violations of these regulations are punishable by a fine or a jail sentence of up to 2 years. However, the country's main association for the disabled complains that enforcement is lax and that penalties are rarely assessed for noncompliance. Access to new buildings tends to be good, while efforts to make old buildings more accessible have lagged. A government committee is currently doing a systematic survey of all state-owned buildings in the country to evaluate their accessibility. Since 1995 the Reykjavik city government, in cooperation with local associations representing bicycle riders and the blind, has been systematically beveling sidewalks at intersections throughout the city to facilitate the movement of pedestrians, bicyclists, and disabled persons in wheelchairs. The city is spending about $175,000 a year on this project, which it aims to have completed by 2006.    In what was heralded as a major human rights victory for the disabled, the Supreme Court ruled in December that the Government's practice of basing a disabled person's social security payment on the income of his or her able-bodied spouse or partner was unconstitutional. The Court said that such means testing violated constitutional protections regarding equality and support for the disabled and that it was contrary to the country's obligations under the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights. At year's end, the Government appointed a committee to study the court ruling, a move that the Association of Disabled Persons criticized as a delaying tactic. It called on the Government to take immediate action to end the means testing and reimburse disabled persons for past reductions in their social security payments.   National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities   Concern was voiced during the year that the rapidly increasing number of foreigners being brought into the country to meet the labor shortage in fish processing and other less desirable occupations could lead to future problems, especially in the event of an economic downturn. At the end of 1999, 7,271 foreigners were living in Iceland, or about 3 percent of the population, according to the statistics office. However, persons of foreign origin actually constituted 4 or 5 percent of the population when account is taken of individuals who were born in foreign countries but have since become citizens. New work and residence permits were issued at a rate of about 150 per month during the year. Many of these ""temporary"" workers come from Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and the Directorate of Immigration expected most of them to seek to remain permanently rather than return to their countries of origin.   Human rights monitors expressed concern about the establishment in 1997 of an ultra-nationalist organization called the Association of Icelandic Nationalists, whose motto is ""Iceland for Icelanders."" The avowed aim of the association is to prevent further settlement of foreigners of other than European origin in the country. Some human rights monitors claim that the Government is not living up its obligations under Article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination because there is no law that prohibits organizations that promote and incite racial discrimination.    Section 6 Worker Rights   a. The Right of Association   Workers make extensive use of the right provided by the Constitution to establish organizations, draw up their own constitutions and rules, choose their own leaders and policies, and publicize their views. The resulting organizations are controlled neither by the Government nor by any single political party. Unions take active part in Nordic, European, and other international trade union bodies. With the exception of limited categories of workers in the public sector whose services are essential to public health or safety, unions have had and used the right to strike for many years. Approximately 80 percent of all eligible workers belong to unions. During the year, 3 major strikes took place: A 2-week strike in the spring by most of the unskilled and semiskilled labor unions outside of Reykjavik, a 2-month strike during the summer by the main bus drivers' union, and a 2-month strike at the end of the year by secondary school teachers. The teachers' strike, which was the longest such strike in the country's history, led some students to leave school and take up full-time jobs.   b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively   Union membership is not impeded in law or practice. Employers are required to withhold union dues (1 percent of gross pay) from the pay of all employees, whether or not they are union members. This is because union dues help support, among other things, disability, strike, and pension funds to which all workers are entitled.    The various trade unions and management organizations periodically negotiate collective bargaining agreements that set specific terms for workers' pay, hours, and other conditions. New collective bargaining agreements were negotiated in the spring of 2000, and most will expire in either 2003 or 2004. The Government played only a minor role in the bargaining process, providing mediation assistance in a few cases (through the State Mediator's Office) while generally encouraging wage restraint to limit inflation. The new contacts provide that if inflation exceeds expectations during the first year, the unions have the right to seek renegotiation of the wage terms. In recent years, the Government has played almost no role in the private sector collective bargaining process, other than generally to encourage wage restraint that would help to limit inflation.    Labor courts effectively adjudicate disputes over contracts and over the rights provided for in the 1938 Act on Trade Unions and Industrial Disputes, which prohibits antiunion discrimination. By law employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union activities. In practice the charges are difficult to prove.   In 1996 Parliament passed legislation updating the labor laws and bringing them into compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights.     There are no export processing or other special economic zones.   c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor   Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law and does not occur; however, some women reportedly were coerced to work as striptease dancers or prostitutes (see Sections 5 and 6.f.), and work permit practices could leave workers vulnerable to abuse by employers (see Section 6.e.). The law prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, and the Government enforces this prohibition effectively.   d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment   The law prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, and the Government enforces this prohibition effectively (see Section 6.c.). The law requires children to attend school until the age of 16 and prohibits the employment of younger children in factories, on ships, or in other places that are hazardous or require hard labor. This prohibition is observed in practice. Children 14 or 15 years old may be employed part time or during school vacations in light, nonhazardous work. Their work-hours must not exceed the ordinary work hours of adults in the same occupation. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration enforces child labor regulations.   The Government ratified ILO Convention 182 on the worst forms of child labor in May.   e. Acceptable Conditions of Work   No minimum wage is mandated legislatively, but the minimum wages negotiated in the various collective bargaining agreements apply automatically to all employees in those occupations, whether they are union members or not. Union membership is so extensive and effective that labor contracts afford even the lowest paid workers a sufficient income for a decent standard of living for themselves and their families.   Workers are protected by laws that effectively provide for their health and safety as well as for unemployment insurance, paid vacations, pensions, and reasonable working conditions and hours. The standard legal workweek is 40 hours, which includes nearly 3 hours of paid breaks. Work exceeding 8 hours in a workday must be compensated as overtime. Under changes that took effect during the year, workers are entitled to 11 hours of rest (up from 10 hours previously) within each 24-hour period and to a day off every week. Under defined special circumstances, the 11-hour rest period can be reduced to 8 hours, but the worker must then be compensated with 1.5 hours of rest for every hour he received less than 11 hours. The day off can be postponed by a week, in which case the worker has a right to 2 additional hours off in the following week. Health and safety standards are set by Parliament and administered and enforced by the Ministry of Social Affairs through its Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which can close down workplaces until safety and health standards are met. Workers have a collective, not an individual, right to refuse to work in a place that does not meet the criteria of occupational safety and health. Firing workers who report unsafe or unhealthy conditions is illegal.   However, in the case of newly arrived foreign workers or refugees (i.e., those who have been in the country for less than 3 years), human rights monitors expressed concern that the Government's practice of issuing the applicable work permit to the employer rather than to the individual concerned could leave the worker vulnerable to abuse by the employer.   f. Trafficking in Persons   The law does not specifically criminalize trafficking in persons; however, a number of provisions in the Penal Code can be used to prosecute such cases.      Although no charges have ever been filed, trafficking in women is suspected in connection with the hundreds of foreign women who enter the country to work in striptease clubs. The main concern is that some of the women, especially those from Eastern and Central Europe, are being brought to Iceland under false pretenses and then coerced to work as striptease dancers or prostitutes. The police believe that the foreign women also may be used to bring illegal drugs into the country.   Parliament passed legislation in May that closed a loophole that allowed striptease dancers to enter the country and perform without a work permit for up to 4 weeks under an exemption given for ""artists."" Now any foreign woman (except those from the Nordic area and countries of the European Economic Area) seeking to come to the country to work as a striptease dancer must first obtain work and residence permits, which are typically valid for 3 months. However, the Government has not yet put any numerical limits or other controls on the issuance of work permits for foreign striptease dancers. The clubs are allowed to bring in as many as they want. One check is provided by the Icelandic Federation of Labor. The Federation reviews the work permit applications and labor contacts for striptease dancers (under the law, all work permit applications must be reviewed and approved by the ""relevant"" labor union) and ensures that the dancers are afforded the minimal labor protections and benefits.    The number of women entering the country for such work, while still based on anecdotal evidence, has fallen to a few hundred since they can now stay longer legally. By year's end, there had been no arrests in connection with these activities.

The Bush Administration has identified Iran's modernization of its conventional forces as a potential threat to U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf, but others argue that the buildup has been minor and that Iran still is relatively poorly equipped. Although the Bush Administration says it is still willing to hold a dialogue with Iran, the focus of current U.S. policy appears to be a return to the containment policy that prevailed during the early part of the Clinton Administration. During the first term of the Clinton Administration, as part of a policy of ""dual containment"" of Iran and Iraq, President Clinton imposed a ban on U.S. trade and investment in Iran in 1995, and a 1996 law imposed sanctions on foreign investment in Iran's energy sector (Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, ILSA). In keeping with a 1997 policy shift toward engagement, the Clinton Administration and Congress later eased sanctions to allow U.S. exports to Iran of food and medical supplies and importation from Iran of goods such as carpets and caviar. The United States has consistently worked with its allies to prevent arms and advanced technology sales to Iran and to limit Iran's influence over regional energy flows. U.S. purchases of Iranian crude oil and U.S. company investments in Iran remain barred. ILSA was renewed for another 5 years on August 3, 2001 (H.R. 1954, P.L. 107-24).  Even before Iran's tacit cooperation with post-September 11 U.S. efforts to defeat Afghanistan's Taliban regime, signs of moderation in Iran had stimulated the United States to try to engage Iran in official talks. Iran, still split between conservatives and reformers loyal to President Mohammad Khatemi, who was elected in May 1997 and overwhelmingly reelected on June 8, 2001, has not accepted to date. Recent reports of Iranian meddling in post-Taliban Afghanistan and Iran's intercepted January 2002 shipment of arms allegedly to the Palestinian Authority have reversed the warming trend. Iran was grouped with North Korea and Iraq as part of the ""axis of evil"" identified in President Bush's January 29, 2002 State of the Union message. President Bush has identified Iran's efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction and delivery means, coupled with its support of terrorist groups, as key U.S. concerns. Iran's ballistic missile program has made major strides over the past few years, with the help of several foreign suppliers, and its nuclear program is advancing with Russia's help. Iran has opposed the U.S.-led Middle East peace process since its inception in October 1991. It continues to provide material support to Hizballah in Lebanon and to Palestinian groups that oppose the Arab-Israeli peace process, such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. All Iranian factions have publicly supported Palestinian violence against Israel since September 2000. Iran's human rights practices, particularly its treatment of the Baha'i and the Jewish  Congressional Research Service  ~ The Library of Congress   IB93033  06-10-02  M  OST  RECENT DEVELOP  MENTS  The multi-year thawing of U.S.-Iran relations reversed in January 2002 over revelations that Iran had sold arms to the Palestinian Authority and over Iranian efforts to exert influence on the new Afghan government. In his January 29, 2002 State of the Union message, President Bush named Iran, along with Iraq and North Korea, as part of an ""axis of evil,"" constituting major potential threats to U.S. national security.  BACKGROUND  AND  ANAL  YSIS  The power struggle in Iran between revolutionary purists and more moderate reformists colors Iran's domestic and foreign policies. President Mohammad Khatemi, who was reelected on June 8, 2001 by a landslide 77% of the vote against nine more conservative candidates, holds a popular mandate for greater domestic freedoms. His reelection victory was larger than his 69% first win in May 1997. His supporters hold about 70% of the seats in the 290-seat Majlis (parliament) following victories in the February 18, 2000 Majlis elections. However, Khatemi's reform program has been largely obstructed by hardliners, including Supreme Leader Ali Khamene'i (successor to Ayatollah Khomeini), who control key revolutionary institutions and other levers of power. The hardliners also have constrained Khatemi's efforts to moderate Iran's foreign policy. As part of a hardline backlash since April 2000, hardliners in the judiciary have closed more than 40 reformist newspapers and imprisoned or questioned several editors and even some members of the Majlis. In February 2002 testimony, DCI George Tenet said Iran's reform movement may be ""losing momentum"" to the ""unelected"" hardliners, and, in early May 2002, Khatemi publicly criticized hardline elements for slowing his reform attempts.  Iran's Strategic Buildup Iran is not considered a major conventional threat to the United States, but some of its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly medium range ballistic missiles, appear to be making significant progress. For further information, see CRS Report RL30551, Iran: Arms and Technology Acquisitions.  Conventional Weapons Iran's armed forces total about 550,000 personnel, including both the regular military and the Revolutionary Guard, the latter of which is populated largely by hardliners. Low oil prices and high debts slowed Iran's defense acquisitions to about $300 million per year during 1996-1999, from over $1 billion per year in the early 1990s, although purchase levels appear to be rising again. According to U.S. military officials, equipment already purchased has given Iran the ability to block the Strait of Hormuz at least temporarily, but Iran is largely lacking in ability to project power far beyond its borders. In November 2000, Russia told the United States it would no longer abide by a 1995 pledge to refrain from new conventional arms deals with Iran. On October 2, 2001, Iran and Russia signed an agreement that provides CRS-1   IB93033  06-10-02  for $300 million per year in Iranian arms purchases over the next 5 years. Despite Russian assurances that the arms would be purely defensive, the systems reportedly under consideration include new MiG-29 and Sukhoi combat aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as the S-300 air defense system (the Russian counterpart of the U.S. ""Patriot""). In May 2002, it was reported that Iran was buying new cruise-missile carrying patrol boats from China. See CRS Report RL31083, Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations, 1993-2000.  Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) It is partly because of Iran's attempts to acquire WMD that President Bush, in his January 29, 2002 State of the Union message, labeled Iran part of an ""axis of evil"" along with Iraq and North Korea. U.S. government proliferation reports, including a February 2002 CIA report covering January - June 2001, assert that Iran is actively seeking to acquire WMD and advanced conventional weapons. Iran's programs, particularly its missile program, continue to be assisted primarily by entities in Russia, China, and North Korea. In mid-May 2002, the Administration, under the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-178), sanctioned 9 companies and 3 persons in China, Armenia, and Moldova for alleged WMD technology (chemical weapons and missile-related) sales to Iran. (See also CRS Report RL30408, Weapons of Mass Destruction in the Middle East.) Chemical and Biological Weapons. U.S. proliferation reports state that Iran is seeking to acquire a self-sufficient chemical weapons infrastructure, that it may have some capability for biological weapons deployment, and that it has stockpiled chemical weapons, including blister, blood, and choking agents. On June 11, 2001, the Bush Administration imposed trade sanctions, in accordance with the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-178) on China's Jiangsu Yongli Chemicals and Technology Import and Export Corporation for allegedly selling Iran technology not permitted for export to Iran under the Chemical Weapons Convention. Two more Chinese entities (Liyang Chemical Equipment and China Machinery and Electric Equipment Import-Export Co.) and one individual (Q.C.Chen) were sanctioned under the Act in January 2002 for alleged export to Iran of chemical and biological technology. (These entities were again named in the May 2002 sanctioning discussed above.) This record raises questions about Iran's compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which Iran signed on January 13, 1993, and ratified on June 8, 1997. However, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), charged with monitoring the convention, has indicated general satisfaction with Iran's compliance thus far. OPCW toured Iran's declared chemical sites in February 1999, and Iran has made required declarations. Iran is a party to the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. Missiles. Largely with Russian help, Iran is making progress in its missile program. Two of its first three tests of the 800-mile range Shahab-3 (July 1998, July 2000, and September 2000) were either inconclusive or unsuccessful (the July 2000 test appears to have been a success), but Iran conducted an apparently successful test in late May 2002, and press reports say Iran might have produced 10 - 20 copies of the Shahab-3. Amid press reports that Iran might also be making progress on the 1,200 mile range Shahab-4, U.S. officials said in May 2002 that Iran's could be upgraded to reach countries in central Europe. An intelligence community official upgraded the missile threat from Iran, testifying on March 11, 2002, that the United States would ""most likely"" face an intercontinental ballistic missile CRS-2   IB93033  06-10-02  threat from Iran by 2015. On June 11, 2001, the Bush Administration imposed trade sanctions on North Korean and Iranian entities under the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000 for alleged exports to Iran of missile technology. CIA statements in February 2002 cast doubt that China is upholding a November 2000 pledge not to export missile technology to Iran or other countries. On February 22, 2002, the Washington Times reported that China had delivered HQ-7 surface-to-air missiles to Iran. Nuclear Weapons. DCI Tenet testified in February 2002 that Iran might be able to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon by late this decade, and sooner if it gets such material from outside. Russia, despite these U.S. concerns and protests, is proceeding with its January 1995 contract with Iran to complete a nuclear power plant at Bushehr, and the two countries have said it should be complete by the end of 2003 and operational by 2005. Amid concerns among experts that the plant could help Iran produce fissile material for a nuclear weapon, Iran, perhaps fearing a U.S. air or missile strike to destroy the plant, has been surrounding it with anti-aircraft batteries (""Inside the Ring,"" Washington Times, May 10, 2002). In November 2001, Russia shipped to Iran the first reactor shell of the project. There have been inconclusive Iranian and Russian statements on whether Iran will commission Russia to build additional reactors. The February 2002 CIA report to Congress, covering January - June 2001, says that some Iran-China interactions raise questions about China's adherence to its pledge to refrain from new nuclear cooperation with Iran. Iran accepts International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards of its known nuclear facilities, and agency visits to Iran's declared facilities since 1992 have found no evidence at the sites visited to indicate Iran is developing nuclear weapons. Iran has refused to permit an enhanced IAEA inspections program (""93+2"") that would include surprise inspections to undeclared facilities, although some observers say Iran might accept the plan. Each year since FY1998, foreign aid laws have contained provisions cutting U.S. aid to the Russian government if it continues the Bushehr project or assists Iran's ballistic missile program. No waiver was provided for either in the FY1998 or the FY2000 legislation, although the cuts do not apply to nuclear dismantlement in Russia or aid to Russia's private sector. The foreign operations appropriations for both FY2001 (P.L. 106429) and FY2002 (conference report H.Rept. 107-345) contain a similar provision, but both increase the aid cut to 60%. The House version of the FY2002 foreign relations authorization bill, H.R. 1646, passed by the House on May 16, 2001, contains Title IX, the Iran Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 2001. Virtually identical to bills introduced in the 106th and 105th congresses, the provision would make the IAEA subject to cuts in U.S. voluntary contributions if it continued technical assistance to Iran's nuclear program.  Iranian Foreign Policy and Involvement in Terrorism Iran's continued support for terrorism contributed to President Bush's strong criticism of Iran in his State of the Union message. The State Department report on international terrorism for 2001, released May 21, 2002, against states, as it has for most of the past decade, that Iran ""remained the most active state sponsor of terrorism in 2001,"" although the report attributes the terrorist activity to two hardline institutions -- the Revolutionary Guard and the Intelligence Ministry. On the other hand, Iran strongly condemned the September 11 attacks and tacitly supported the U.S. war on the Taliban and Al Qaeda. (See also CRS Report RL31119, Terrorism: Near Eastern Groups and State Sponsors, 2002.) CRS-3   IB93033  06-10-02  Persian Gulf Khatemi has largely succeeded in improving relations with Iran's neighbors, particularly the six states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC; Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates). Since he came into office, Iran apparently has reduced support for Shiite Muslim dissident movements in the Gulf states. See also CRS Report RL30728, Persian Gulf: Issues for U.S. Policy, 2000. Saudi Arabia/Khobar Towers/Gulf States. Iran and Saudi Arabia restored relations in December 1991 (after a 4 year break), and progressively higher level contacts have taken place since December 1997. In May 1999, Khatemi became the first senior Iranian leader to visit Saudi Arabia since the Islamic revolution. In April 2000, Saudi Arabia's number three leader, Prince Sultan, hosted a visit by Iran's Defense Minister. Supreme Leader Khamene'i has been invited to visit the Kingdom as well. In mid-April 2001, Saudi Arabia and Iran formally entered into an anti-crime security pact, suggesting that Saudi Arabia wishes to bury the issue of the June 25, 1996 Khobar Towers housing complex bombing, which killed 19 U.S. airmen. On June 21, 2001, a federal grand jury indicted 14 suspects, 13 Saudis and a Lebanese citizen, for the Khobar bombing. The indictment suggested that official elements in Iran were likely involved, but no indictments of any Iranians were announced. In June 2002, it was reported that Saudi Arabia had sentenced some of the eleven suspects held there. In 2000, Iran entered into anti-crime security pacts with the other Gulf states of Kuwait and Oman. (See CRS Issue Brief IB93113, Saudi Arabia: Postwar Issues and U.S. Relations.) Gulf Islands Dispute With UAE. Relations between Iran and the UAE deteriorated sharply in April 1992, when Iran asserted complete control of the Persian Gulf island of Abu Musa, which it and the UAE shared under a 1971 bilateral agreement. (In 1971, Iran, then ruled by the U.S.-backed Shah, seized two other islands, Greater and Lesser Tunb, from the emirate of Ras al-Khaymah, which later became part of the UAE.) The UAE wants to refer the dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), but Iran insists on resolving the issue bilaterally. Several GCC states -- Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Oman -- have attempted to mediate and Iran-UAE talks did resume in July 2001, but there is no evidence of Iranian flexibility to date on the key issue of sovereignty. The United States, which is concerned about Iran's military improvements to the islands, generally supports UAE proposals but takes no position on sovereignty. Jane's Defence Weekly reported in March 2000 that Iran's military improvements were relatively minor. Iraq. A legacy of the 8-year long Iran-Iraq war (1980-1988) is deep lingering suspicion between Iran and Iraq, but the two have drawn closer in recent years. Since early 1998, the two have exchanged significant numbers of prisoners from the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. An October 2000 visit to Iraq by Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi resulted in apparent agreement to abide by the waterway-sharing and other provisions of their 1975 Algiers Accords, which Iraq had abrogated prior to its September 1980 invasion of Iran. In exchange for a share of the proceeds, Iran's maritime authorities generally cooperate with Iraq's illicit export of oil products through the Gulf, although Iran has occasionally prevented such shipments. Iranian hardliners still give support to Shiite militants in southern Iraq (the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, SCIRI) trying to overthrow Iraq's regime, and Iran allowed the Iraqi National Congress (INC), Iraq's main opposition umbrella, to open an office in Tehran in 2001. CRS-4   IB93033  06-10-02  Middle East Peace Process/North Africa Many of the allegations of Iran's support for terrorism center on its assistance to groups opposed to the Arab-Israeli peace process, primarily Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Hizballah, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. Apparently corroborating press reports, U.S. terrorism reports state that, following the start of the September 2000 Palestinian uprising, Iran increased its support for terrorism somewhat by encouraging coordination among Palestinian terrorist groups. Iran also incites anti-Israel violence, including hosting conferences of anti-peace process organizations (April 24, 2001, and June 2-3, 2002). Khamene'i has continued to call Israel a ""cancerous tumor"" and he said in early November 2000 that the Palestinian-Israeli violence could end only if Israel were ""eradicated."" Khatemi has sometimes tried to moderate Iran's position somewhat, saying during his November 2001 visit to the United Nations that Iran would accept a final IsraeliPalestinian settlement acceptable to the Palestinians. At the same time, Khatemi has sought to avoid conflict with hardliners by pledging his support for anti-peace process groups. On the other hand, Iran has traditionally had few ties to the non-Islamist Palestinian organizations, including elements linked to the Palestinian Authority, that have conducted some of the day-to-day violence against Israel in the current uprising. It was therefore viewed as a new development when Israel and the United States asserted in early January 2002 that Iran was the source of a shipment, intercepted by Israel, of 50 tons of arms bought by the Palestinian Authority. About 150 Iranian Revolutionary Guards remain in Lebanon to coordinate Iranian arms deliveries to Hizballah, which are offloaded in Damascus and trucked into Lebanon. A New York Times report of January 12, 2002 said that, in the mid-1990s, Iran had transferred American-built Stinger anti-aircraft systems obtained in Afghanistan to Hizballah. Israel asserted in February 2002 that Iran had delivered 8,000 Katyusha rockets to Hizballah recently, but the Israeli claim could not be confirmed. On the other hand, in mid-April 2002, Foreign Minister Kharrazi visited Lebanon and urged Hizbollah to exercise restraint on the Israeli-Lebanese border at a time of heightened tensions between Israel and the Palestinians. (For more information on Hizballah, see CRS Report RL31119, Terrorism: Near Eastern Groups and State Sponsors, 2002.) Sudan. Sudan's close relations with Iran in the early 1990s contributed to Sudan's placement on the U.S. ""terrorism list"" on August 18, 1993. However, Sudan's alliance with Iran frayed in the mid 1990s as Sudan sought to burnish its international image.  Central and South Asia/Azerbaijan Iran's policy in Central Asia has thus far emphasized economic cooperation over Islamic ideology, although Iran has become increasingly assertive in its relations with Azerbaijan. In early 1992, Iran led the drive to bring the Central Asian states and Azerbaijan into the Economic Cooperation Organization (founded in 1985 by Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey, as a successor to an organization founded by those states in 1964). Iran is hoping to attract energy pipeline routes through it, rather than through other countries. However, Iran does host at least one anti-Azerbaijan guerrilla leader (Hasan Javadov), and it reportedly harbors leaders of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU). Some allegations surfaced in April  CRS-5   IB93033  06-10-02  2002 that Iran is actively helping the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), an Al Qaeda ally, regroup after the war in Afghanistan. Tensions with Azerbaijan flared in late July 2001 over energy exploration rights in the Caspian; Iranian warships and combat aircraft intimidated an international oil firm (BP) on contract to Azerbaijan from continuing its work an area of the Caspian Iran considers its own. The United States called Iran's actions in the Caspian provocative, and it offered new border security aid and increased political support to Azerbaijan. Iran and Armenia, adversary of Azerbaijan, agreed on expanded defense cooperation in early March 2002. Tensions eased somewhat in conjunction with the mid-May 2002 visit of Azerbaijan's President Heydar Aliyev to Iran, although there was little evident progress on a bilateral division of their portions of the Caspian. Afghanistan/Pakistan. Iran long opposed the puritanical Sunni Muslim regime of the Taliban in Afghanistan on the grounds that it oppressed Shiite Muslim and other Persianspeaking minorities. Iran nearly launched a military attack against the Taliban in September 1998 after Taliban fighters captured and killed several Iranian diplomats based in northern Afghanistan. Subsequently, Iran provided military aid to the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance coalition, made up of mostly Persian-speaking minority groups. Iran -- along with the United States, Russia, and the countries bordering Afghanistan -- attended U.N.-sponsored meetings in New York (the Six Plus Two group) to try to end the internal conflict in Afghanistan. Iran and the United States also participated in a U.N.-sponsored group in Geneva, which also includes Italy and Germany. Tacitly aligned with the U.S. military campaign against the Taliban in Afghanistan, Iran pledged search and rescue assistance to the United States and pledged to allow U.S. humanitarian aid for the Afghan people to transit Iran en route to Afghanistan. U.S. officials initially called Iran's role in the anti-Taliban/Al Qaeda effort, including efforts to form a new government at the Bonn conference (ended in agreement December 5, 2001) ""constructive."" Some of Iran's activities in Afghanistan reflect official suspicion of the United States: Iran publicly opposed U.S. military retaliation for the September 11 attacks and refused to join a U.S.-led anti-terrorism coalition. Iran is said to fear the pro-U.S. tilt of the new government of Afghanistan and the waning of Iran's traditional sway in western, central, and northern Afghanistan where Persian-speaking Afghans predominate. There have been press reports and U.S. official statements since in January 2002 that Iran is harboring  or at least not aggressively moving to arrest  Al Qaeda fighters who have fled Afghanistan. Other reports say Iran is arming local Afghan strongmen including Herat governor Ismail Khan, Mazar-e-Sharif governor Abdul Rashid Dostam, and others, and President Bush has warned Iran not to seek to exert influence over the new government of Afghanistan. Apparently seeking to deflect the U.S. criticism, in March 2002 Iran reportedly expelled exiled Pashtun figure Gulbuddin Hikmatyar, an opponent of the new Afghan government. The expulsion followed a February 24, 2002 visit to Iran by Afghan interim leader Hamid Karzai in which the two countries agreed to cooperate broadly. (See CRS Report RL30588, Afghanistan: Current Issues and U.S. Policy Concerns.)  Former Yugoslavia On June 26, 1996, and again on May 5, 1997, President Clinton certified to Congress that Bosnia had expelled foreign forces and ended intelligence cooperation with Iran. The CRS-6   IB93033  06-10-02  certifications were required by P.L. 104-122, an FY1996 supplemental appropriation, and P.L. 104-208, the FY1997 foreign aid appropriation, in order to provide U.S. aid to Bosnia.  Human Rights Concerns U.S. and U.N. human rights reports cite Iran for widespread human rights abuses, (especially of the Baha'i faith), including assassinations and executions of regime opponents (Kurds, People's Mojahedin, and others) in Iran and abroad. These reports note that Khatemi's efforts to promote rule of law have met repeated challenges from hardliners. In April 2002, the U.N. Human Rights Commission narrowly voted not to investigate Iran's human rights record during 2002-3. Religious Persecution. On October 27, 2001, the State Department again named Iran as a ""Country of Particular Concern,"" under the International Religious Freedom Act. No sanctions were added, on the grounds that Iran is already subject to extensive U.S. sanctions. Religious persecution continues, especially against the Baha'i community, because Iran's Shiite Muslim clergy views the sect as heretical. Two Baha'is (Dhabihullah Mahrami and Musa Talibi) were sentenced to death in 1996 for apostasy. On July 21, 1998, Iran executed Ruhollah Ruhani, the first Bahai executed since 1992 (Bahman Samandari). The United States condemned the execution. In February 2000, Iran's Supreme Court set aside the death sentences against three Bahais, Sirus Zabihi-Moqaddam, Hedayat KashefiNajafabadi, and Manucher Khulusi. On April 21, 1999, the Clinton Administration expressed concern about the sentencing to prison of four Baha'is. Recent resolutions condemning Iran's treatment of the Baha'is, including S.Con.Res. 57, which passed the Senate July 19, 2000, and H.Con.Res. 257, which passed the House on September 19, 2000. Trial of 13 Jews. Although the 30,000 member Jewish community (the largest in the Middle East aside from Israel) enjoys more freedoms than Jewish communities in several other Muslim states, during 1993-1998 Iran executed five Jews allegedly spying for Israel. In June 1999, Iran confirmed that it had arrested 13 Jews -- teachers, shopkeepers, and butchers -- from the Shiraz area that it said were part of an ""espionage ring"" for Israel. After an April - June 2000 trial in which eight of the suspects ""confessed"" to the allegations, ten of the Jews and two Muslims accomplices were convicted (July 1, 2000) and received sentences ranging from 4 years to 13 years. Three Jews were acquitted. The affair provoked an international outcry, and the Clinton Administration worked through U.S. allies to intercede, possibly contributing to a September 21, 2000 decision by a three-judge appeals panel to reduce the sentences slightly, now ranging from 2 to 9 years. On February 8, 2001, Iran's Supreme Court rejected their appeals, allowing the revised sentences to stand. In March 2001, Iran released one of the Jews on the grounds that his sentence included time served. A second was released on January 16, 2002. Several bills in the 106th Congress condemned the arrests and called for the release of the detainees and for linking U.S. relations with Iran to the trial's outcome; the Senate passed S.Con.Res. 39 (June 23, 1999) and S.Con.Res. 109 (May 4, 2000). In April 2001, a similar bill, H.Con.Res. 29, was introduced in the 107th Congress.  CRS-7   IB93033  06-10-02  U.S. Policy and Legislation The February 11, 1979 fall of the Shah of Iran, a key U.S. ally, opened a long rift in U.S.-Iranian relations. On November 4, 1979, radical ""students"" seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held its diplomats hostage until minutes after President Reagan's inauguration on January 20, 1981. The United States broke relations with Iran on April 7, 1980, and the two countries have had no official dialogue since. The exception was the abortive 1985-86 clandestine arms supply relationship with Iran in exchange for some American hostages held by Hizballah in Lebanon (the so-called ""Iran-Contra Affair""). Iran maintains an interests section in Washington (Embassy of Pakistan), staffed by Iranian permanent resident aliens or U.S. citizens of Iranian descent. The U.S. protecting power in Iran is Switzerland. Upon taking office in 1993, the Clinton Administration moved to further isolate Iran as part of a strategy of ""dual containment"" of Iran and Iraq. In 1995 and 1996, the Clinton Administration and Congress added sanctions on Iran in response to growing concerns about Iran's weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons acquisition programs, its support for terrorist groups, and its efforts to subvert the Arab-Israeli peace process. The election of Khatemi in May 1997 precipitated a shift in U.S. policy from containment to engagement, although with key efforts to limit Iran's strategic capabilities still in place. The Clinton Administration sought to engage Iran in a dialogue, with no substantive preconditions. In January 1998, Khatemi publicly agreed to increase ""people-to-people"" exchanges with the United States but ruled out an official dialogue. In a June 17, 1998 speech, then Secretary of State Albright stepped up the U.S. outreach effort by calling for mutual confidence building measures that could lead to a ""road map"" for normalization of relations. Encouraged by the reformist victory in Iran's March 2000 parliamentary elections, Secretary Albright gave another speech on March 17, 2000, acknowledging past U.S. meddling in Iran, easing sanctions on some Iranian imports, and promising to work to resolve outstanding claims disputes. Iran welcomed the steps, but called them insufficient to warrant the beginning of a dialogue. Iran also rejected a U.S. suggestion for consular visits by U.S. officials. In early September 2000 meetings at the United Nations in connection with the Millennium Summit, Secretary Albright and President Clinton sent a positive signal to Iran by attending Khatemi's speeches. Until early 2002, the Bush Administration appeared to be continuing the Clinton Administration efforts, in part by building on the cooperation between the two countries in Afghanistan. The Administration's November 13, 2001 continuation of the 1979 national emergency on Iran justified the emergency by saying that U.S. ""relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal,"" a far softer statement than previous justifications sighting a continued threat from Iran. Following a move by some Majlis deputies to call for reestablishing relations with the United States, Supreme Leader Khamene'i moved forcefully to squash talk of improved relations on October 30, 2001, when he threatened to fire Iranian officials who strive for that result. His statement came a few weeks after several Members of Congress had dinner in the Senate with Iran's U.N. representative. The gradual thaw in relations, which appeared to accelerate in the context of the Afghanistan crisis, appears to have stalled or reversed since January 2002. Allegations of Iran's sale of arms to the Palestinian Authority and reputed meddling in Afghanistan have caused the Administration and Congress to become far more critical of Iran's intentions and CRS-8   IB93033  06-10-02  actions. As noted above, President Bush named Iran as part of an ""axis of evil"" in his State of the Union message. In subsequent comments, the President and his aides said that the United States would still be willing to hold dialogue with Iran and that the President was implying he wants Iran's behavior to change, not threatening military action against Iran, such as airstrikes on Iranian WMD or arms facilities. Despite the tensions, in March and April 2002 Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Joseph Biden and the Chairman of the Middle East Subcommittee of the House International Relations Committee, Benjamin Gilman, called for U.S. efforts to promote civil society in Iran, in part to strengthen reformists' efforts. However, apparently under pressure from Khamene'i, in late May 2002 Khatemi urged his reformist supporters in the Majles to abandon efforts to explore renewed relations with the United States. That had been the subject of recent closed-door Majles meetings orchestrated by reformist Majles members who want to end U.S.-Iran estrangement.  Economic Sanctions Since the November 4, 1979 seizure of the U.S. hostages in Tehran, economic sanctions have formed a major part of U.S. policy toward Iran. On November 14, 1979, President Carter declared a national emergency with respect to Iran, renewed every year since 1979. Terrorism/Foreign Aid. Following the October 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Lebanon, believed perpetrated by Iranian allies, Iran was added to the ""terrorism list"" in January 1984. The designation bans direct U.S. financial assistance and arms sales, restricts sales of U.S. dual use items, and requires the United States to oppose multilateral lending to the designated countries. Separate from its position on the terrorism list, successive foreign aid appropriations laws since the late 1980s ban direct assistance to Iran (loans, credits, insurance, Eximbank credits) and indirect assistance (U.S. contributions to international organizations that work in Iran). Section 307 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (added in 1985) names Iran as unable to benefit from U.S. contributions to international organizations, requiring proportionate cuts if these institutions work in Iran. Iran is also barred from sales of U.S. munitions list items because it has been designated every year since 1997 as not cooperating with U.S. anti-terrorism efforts, under the AntiTerrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (P.L. 104-132). That Act also penalizes countries that assist or sell arms to terrorism list countries, and limits Defense Department contracts with companies controlled by terrorism list states ($100,000 contract limit). Proliferation Sanctions. Some of these sanctions are discussed above, and two laws are unique to Iran. The Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act (P.L. 102-484) requires denial of license applications for exports to Iran of dual use items. It also imposes sanctions on foreign countries that transfer ""destabilizing numbers and types of conventional weapons,"" as well as WMD technology, to Iran. The Iran Nonproliferation Act (P.L. 106-178) authorizes sanctions on foreign entities that assist Iran's WMD programs. It also bans U.S. extraordinary payments to the Russian Aviation and Space Agency in connection with the international space station unless the President can certify that the agency or entities under the Agency's control had not transferred any WMD or missile-related technology to Iran within the year prior. The provision contains certain exceptions to ensure the safety of astronauts who will use the space station and for certain space station hardware. Counternarcotics. In February 1987, Iran was first designated as a state that failed to cooperate with U.S. anti-drug efforts or take adequate steps to control narcotics production CRS-9   IB93033  06-10-02  or trafficking. U.S. and U.N. Drug Control Program (UNDCP) assessments of drug production in Iran prompted the Clinton Administration, on December 7, 1998, to remove Iran from the U.S. list of major drug producing countries. The decision exempts Iran from the annual certification process that kept drug-related U.S. sanctions in place on Iran. Britain reportedly has sold Iran small arms for its anti-drug efforts on the Afghan border. Trade Ban. On May 6, 1995, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12959 banning U.S. trade and investment in Iran, including the trading of Iranian oil overseas by U.S. companies. This followed an earlier March 1995 executive order barring U.S. investment in Iran's energy sector, and, although modified, has been extended each year since. On March 13, 2001, President Bush renewed the declaration of a state of emergency that triggered the March 1995 investment ban. An August 1997 amendment to the trade ban (Executive Order 13059) prevented U.S. companies from knowingly exporting goods to a third country for incorporation into products destined for Iran. The trade ban was partly intended to blunt criticism that U.S. trade with Iran made U.S. appeals for multilateral containment of Iran less credible. Some goods related to the safe operation of civilian aircraft can be licensed for export to Iran, and in December 1999, the Clinton Administration allowed the repair of engine mountings on seven Iran Air 747's (Boeing). Implementing regulations do not permit U.S. firms to negotiate investment deals with Iran, and, in November 2000, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC, Department of Treasury) warned U.S. firms against co-sponsoring energy-related conferences with Iran. Following a 1998 application by a U.S. firm to sell Iran agricultural products, and in the context of Clinton Administration and congressional reviews of U.S. unilateral sanctions policies, the Clinton Administration announced in April 1999 that it would license, on a case-by-case basis, commercial sales of food and medical products to certain countries on which unilateral U.S. trade bans are in place (Iran, Libya, and Sudan). Under regulations issued in July 1999, private letters of credit can be used to finance approved sales, but no U.S. government credit guarantees were made available and U.S. exporters were not permitted to deal directly with Iranian banks. Iran says the lack of credit makes U.S. sales, particularly of wheat, uncompetitive. The FY2001 agriculture appropriations (P.L. 106-387), contains a provision banning the use of official credit guarantees for food and medical sales to Iran and other countries on the U.S. terrorism list, except Cuba, although allowing for a presidential waiver to permit such credit guarantees. (In the 107th Congress, S.171, introduced January 24, 2001, would repeal this provision.) The Clinton Administration did not provide credit guarantees, and the Bush Administration has not done so either. In her March 17, 2000 speech, then Secretary Albright announced an easing of the trade ban to allow U.S. importation of Iranian nuts, dried fruits, carpets, and caviar; regulations governing the sales were issued in April 2000. The United States was the largest market for Iranian carpets before the 1979 revolution, although U.S. anti-dumping tariffs imposed on Iranian pistachio nut imports in 1986 (about 300%) and still in effect are dampening imports of that product. Iranian caviar began arriving in the United States in May 2000, and Iranian carpets are being sold in the United States, estimated to be a $100 million per year market. The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA). The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA, H.R. 3107, P.L. 104-172, signed August 5, 1996), a law that sanctions foreign investment in Iran or Libya's energy sector, was to expire on August 5, 2001. H.R. 1954, which renewed ILSA for five years but requires an Administration report on its effectiveness within 24-30 months, CRS-10   IB93033  06-10-02  was passed by large majorities in both chambers in July 2001. It was signed on August 3, 2001 (P.L. 107-24). See CRS Report RS20871, The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA). Caspian/Central Asian Energy Routes Through Iran. The U.S. trade ban permits U.S. companies to apply for licenses to conduct ""swaps"" of Caspian Sea oil with Iran, but, as part of a U.S. policy to route Central Asian energy around Iran (and Russia), a Mobil Corporation application to do so was denied in April 1999. The Administration continues to oppose, and to threaten imposing ILSA sanctions on, pipeline projects that route Caspian/Central Asian energy through Iran. U.S. policy has been to strongly favor construction of a pipeline that would cross the Caspian Sea and let out in Ceyhan, Turkey (Baku-Ceyhan pipeline), avoiding Iran or Russia. Four Caspian nations (Turkey, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan) signed an agreement embracing Baku-Ceyhan on November 18, 1999, and regional and corporate support for the project has gained momentum to the point where pipeline construction might soon begin. Kazakhstan nonetheless is pushing for construction of an oil pipeline across Iran. In December 2001, Kazakhstan's President Nazarbayev urged Secretary of State Powell to reconsider U.S. policy and allow routes through Iran; Powell did not reject the request outright. U.S. official statements in March 2002 reiterated that U.S. policy is to favor energy projects that do not transit Iran. Despite U.S. pressure not to import Iranian gas, Turkey has begun to do so through a new crossborder pipeline, under an August 1996 bilateral agreement. (See CRS Report 98-86, Iran: Relations With Key Central Asian States.) European and Japanese Relations With/Lending to Iran. U.S.-allied differences on Iran narrowed since 1998 in concert with the Clinton Administration's attempt to engage Iran, a policy consistently favored by the European countries as a way to moderate Iran's behavior. During 1992-1997, the European Union (EU) countries maintained a policy of ""critical dialogue"" with Iran. The United States did not oppose those talks with Iran but maintained that the EU's dialogue would not change Iranian behavior. The dialogue was suspended immediately following the April 1997 German terrorism trial that found highlevel Iranian involvement in assassinating Iranian dissidents in Germany. Simultaneous with the Khatemi era U.S. shift toward engagement, the EU-Iran dialogue formally resumed in May 1998. Since then, Khatemi has undertaken state visits to several Western countries, including Italy (March 1999), France (October 1999), Germany (July 2000), and Japan (November 2000). The United States publicly welcomed these visits. The resolution of the ""Rushdie affair"" to Britain's satisfaction sparked improvement in its relations with Iran. Iran maintains that Ayatollah Khomeini's 1989 death sentence against author Salman Rushdie cannot be revoked (his ""Satanic Verses"" novel was labeled blasphemous) because Khomeini is no longer alive to revoke it. However, on September 24, 1998, Iran's Foreign Minister pledged to Britain that Iran will not seek to implement the sentence and opposes any bounties offered for his death. Britain then upgraded relations with Iran to the ambassadorial level, and Foreign Ministers of the two countries have exchanged visits. In October 2000, the United Kingdom began extending longer term credit (two years or greater) for exports to Iran. Some Iranian clerics (outside the formal government structure) have said the death sentence stands, and the Iranian government has not required the Fifteen Khordad foundation to withdraw its $2.8 million reward for Rushdie's death. Khatemi said on June 4, 2001 that he considers the issue closed.  CRS-11   IB93033  06-10-02  In August 1999, Japan's Foreign Minister continued a gradual improvement in relations with Iran by visiting that country and announcing that Japan would resume its official development lending program for Iran to construct a hydroelectric dam over the Karun River. However, the $70 million increment announced was less that Iran had wanted, and Japan said that this tranche would close out Japan's involvement in the project. (In 1993, Japan provided the first $400 million tranche of the overall $1.4 billion official development loan program, but the lending was subsequently placed on hold as the United States sought to persuade its allies to pressure Iran.) In late January 2000, Japan agreed to resume mediumand long-term (two years or longer) export credit insurance for exports to Iran, suspended since 1994. Economic relations improved further during Khatemi's November 2000 visit to Tokyo, which resulted in Japan's commitment to provide insurance cover for over $500 million in private sector projects, including refurbishment of steel and petrochemical plants. Iran also granted Japanese firms the first right to negotiate to develop the large Azadegan field, and Iran and a Japanese-led consortium are moving forward with preliminary studies of the field. Some press reports suggest that Royal Dutch/Shell might join the Azadegan project, apparently because it can provide needed technology. In exchange, Japan agreed to prepay Iran $1 billion per year for the next 3 years for Iranian oil. Partly at U.S. urging, Japan refused to extend to Iran additional official loans. During 1994-1995, and over U.S. objections at the time, Iran's European and Japanese creditors rescheduled about $16 billion in Iranian debt. These countries (governments and private creditors) rescheduled the debt bilaterally, in spite of Paris Club rules that call for multilateral rescheduling and International Monetary Fund (IMF) involvement. Iran has worked its external debt down from $32 billion in 1997 to about $20 billion as of March 2002, according to Iran's Central Bank. The improved debt picture has led most European export credit agencies, including Germany's Hermes, France's COFACE, and that of Spain, to restore insurance cover for exports to Iran. In early September 2001, Iran and the EU met to discuss a possible trade pact that would lower the tariffs or increase quotas for Iranian exports to the EU countries. However, in mid-May 2002, the EU delayed the start of formal negotiations on that pact. In August 2001, Iran announced it would tap international capital markets for the first time since the Islamic revolution by issuing a $280 million Eurobond. However, at the urging of the U.S. government, Moody's stopped its credit ratings service for Iran's government bonds in May 2002 on the grounds that performing the credit ratings service might violate the U.S. trade ban. Multilateral Lending to Iran. Section 1621 of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-132) amended the Foreign Assistance Act to require the United States to vote against international loans to countries on the U.S. terrorism list. Acting under provisions of successive foreign aid laws, in 1993 the United States voted its 16.5% share of the World Bank against loans to Iran of $460 million for electricity, health, and irrigation projects. To signal opposition to international lending to Iran, the FY1994 foreign aid appropriations act (P.L. 103-87) cut the Administration's request for the U.S. contribution to the World Bank by the amount of those loans. That law, the FY1995 foreign aid appropriation (P.L. 103-326), and the FY1996 foreign aid appropriations (P.L. 104-107), would have significantly reduced U.S. payments to the Bank if it had provided new loans to Iran. The legislation contributed to the Bank's refusal to approve any new lending to since then. By 1999, Iran's moderating image had led the World Bank to consider new loans.  CRS-12   IB93033  06-10-02  In May 2000, the United States was unsuccessful in obtaining further delay on a vote on new lending for Iran, and its allies outvoted the United States to approve $232 million in loans for health and sewage projects. Twenty one of the Bank's twenty four governors voted in favor, and France and Canada abstained. Earlier, Iran also had asked the International Monetary Fund for about $400 million in loans (its quota is about $2 billion) to help it deal with its trade financing shortfalls. However, Iran balked at accepting IMF conditionality, and discussions broke off. Despite the required U.S. opposition, on May 10, 2001, the World Bank's executive directors voted to approve a two-year economic reform plan for Iran that envisions $775 million in new Bank loans. Voting on the loans is expected later in 2002. WTO. On May 8, 2001, the World Trade Organization, at U.S. urging, postponed until July 2001 a discussion on whether to launch entry talks with Iran. On July 18, 2001, and again on October 10, 2001, the United States achieved further postponements in considering Iran's application for admission, although the Administration says that position is ""under review."" Iranian officials indicate to U.S. visitors that the dropping of U.S. opposition to Iran's membership in the WTO would be taken as a positive U.S. gesture. Related Sanctions. Use of U.S. passports for travel to Iran is permitted, but a State Department travel warning, softened somewhat in April 1998, asks that Americans ""defer"" travel to Iran. Iranians entering the United States are fingerprinted, although Secretary Albright implied in her March 17, 2000 speech that this practice would be eliminated. U.S. regulations do not bar disaster relief and the United States donated $125,000, through relief agencies, to help victims of two earthquakes in Iran (February and May 1997). Assets Disputes/Victims of Terrorism. Iran claims that the United States has frozen vast amounts of Iranian assets, presenting an obstacle to improved relations. A U.S.Iran Claims Tribunal, at the Hague, is arbitrating cases resulting from the break in relations following the Iranian revolution. The major cases yet to be decided center on hundreds of Foreign Military Sales cases between the United States and the Shah's regime, which Iran claims it paid for but were unfulfilled. About $400 million in proceeds from the resale of that equipment is in a DOD account. In April 2000, then Secretary Albright named a representative to negotiate a resolution of the claims issue at the Hague. The assets issue moved to the forefront following several U.S. court judgements against Iran for past acts of terrorism against Americans, filed under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. Since March 1998, U.S. courts have awarded the following: $247 million to the family of Alisa Flatow, killed in Israel in April 1995 in a bombing by Palestinian Islamic Jihad (awarded in March 1998); $65 million to three Americans held hostage in Lebanon - David Jacobsen, Joseph Cicippio, and Frank Reed (August 1998); $324 for Lebanon hostage Terry Anderson (March 2000); $327 million to the families of two Americans killed in a February 1996 Hamas bombing (July 2000); and $355 million to the family of Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, killed by Hizballah in 1989 (September 2000). Former Lebanon hostage Thomas Sutherland won a $353 million judgement against Iran on June 26, 2001. In August $314.6 million Benjamin Weir Lebanon. Also 2001, the family of former Lebanon hostage father Lawrence Jenco won a judgment against Iran for his captivity. In June 2001, former hostages and Frank Regier sued Iran for over $100 million for their captivity in in early June 2001, the family of former hostage Peter Kilburn, who was CRS-13   IB93033  06-10-02  killed in the course of his captivity in Lebanon, filed a suit against both Libya and Iran for more than $200 million. In October 2001, victims of the October 1982 Hizbollah bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut filed a $5 billion suit against Iran. On January 23, 2002, a federal judge ordered Iran to pay $42 million to the family of Charles Hegna, who was beaten in the course of a 1984 Hizbollah hijacking of Kuwait Air 221. On February 6, 2002, a federal judge awarded $56 million to the family of Ira Weinstein, killed in a 1996 Hamas bus bombing in Israel. On the basis of the sanctity of diplomatic property, the Clinton Administration blocked efforts by the claimants to satisfy their judgments from frozen Iranian assets  diplomatic property in Washington (worth about $22 million) or the DOD account mentioned above. In December 1999, the Clinton Administration also blocked a Flatow effort to seize a $6 million U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal judgement awarded to Iran. A provision of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (H.R. 3244, P.L. 106-386) provides for the use of general revenues to pay 110% of compensatory damage awards to the above and future successful claimants in a total not to exceed the rental proceeds from Iran's diplomatic property and the DOD account. (The tenant of the Iranian Embassy building was evicted for non-payment of rent in March 2002, with rent of about $750,000 overdue.) The provision requires the President to try to recoup the expended funds from Iran as part of an overall reconciliation in relations and assets settlement, although there is no requirement that funds ultimately be withheld from Iran. A provision of the FY2002 Commerce, Justice, State appropriation (P.L. 107-77) requires an Administration legislative proposal on how to compensate successful U.S. claimants in future terrorism-related judgments against Iran. In April 2002, a federal judge ruled that Iran, under the Algiers Accords, had immunity from a lawsuit by the 52 Americans held hostage by Iran for 444 days. With regard to the 52 American hostages, the conference report on the FY2002 defense appropriation (P.L. 107117, H.Rept.107-350) states that the hostages should be able to collect damages from Iranian assets, notwithstanding U.S.-Iran agreements on the disposition of Iran's assets. Regarding the mistaken U.S. shootdown on July 3,1988 of an Iranian Airbus passenger jet, on February 22, 1996, the United States, responding to an Iranian case before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), agreed to pay Iran up to $61.8 million in compensation ($300,000 per wage earning victim, $150,000 per non wage earner) for the 248 Iranians killed in the shootdown. The funds for this settlement came from a general appropriation for judgments against the United States. The United States previously paid $3 million in death benefits for 47 non-Iranians killed in the attack, but has not compensated Iran for the airplane itself. A different case, pending before the ICJ, involves an Iranian claim for damages to Iranian oil platforms during U.S. naval clashes with Iran in October 1987 and April 1988.  Military Containment U.S. policy has focused on containing the military threat posed by Iran to the United States, U.S. allies in the Persian Gulf, and international shipping. Although containing Iraq has been the primary goal of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf region since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, U.S. military officials note that U.S. forces can also be used to monitor and deter Iran, if necessary. U.S. military officers note that their encounters with Iranian naval vessels in the Gulf have been more professional and less tense since Khatemi took office.  CRS-14   IB93033  06-10-02  Iran's Opposition Movements On February 8, 1995, then House Speaker Newt Gingrich said that a U.S. policy supporting the overthrow of Iran's regime was the only policy that made sense. The Administration accepted a House-Senate conference agreement to include $18-$20 million in funding authority for covert operations against Iran in the FY1996 intelligence authorization act (H.R. 1655, P.L. 104-93) -- about $14 million more than requested -- according to a Washington Post report of December 22, 1995. The Clinton Administration reportedly succeeded in focusing the covert aid on changing the regime's behavior, rather than its overthrow. The conference report on H.R. 2267 (H.Rept. 105-405), the FY1998 Commerce/State/ Justice appropriation, provided $4 million for a ""Radio Free Iran,"" to be run by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). The radio, which the Administration is calling the Farsi service of RFE/RL, began operations in Prague on October 31, 1998. Another $4 million for the radio for FY1999 was provided by the omnibus appropriation (H.R. 4328, P.L. 105-277). (See CRS Report 98-539, Radio Free Iraq and Radio Free Iran: Background, Legislation, and Policy Issues for Congress.) Since the late 1980s, the State Department has refused contact with the anti-regime People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI) and its umbrella organization, the National Council of Resistance (NCR). It was designated as a foreign terrorist organization in October 1997 under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. For further information on the PMOI, see CRS Report RL31119, Terrorism: Near Eastern Groups and State Sponsors, 2002. Some Iranian exiles follow the son of the late former Shah, who lives in the United States. On January 24, 2001, the Shah's son, Reza Pahlavi, 40 years old, ended a long period of inactivity by giving a speech in Washington calling for unity in opposition to the current regime and for the institution of a constitutional monarchy and genuine democracy in Iran. He has since broadcast messages into Iran from a station in California, and press reports say a growing number of Iranians are listening to his broadcasts.  CRS-15"

Iran, still split between conservatives and reformers loyal to President Mohammad Khatemi, who was elected in May 1997 and overwhelmingly reelected on June 8, 2001, has not accepted to date. Even though open to engagement with Iran, the Bush Administration and many in Congress want to continue vigorous efforts to counter Iran's support for terrorist groups and its efforts to acquire weapons of mass destructio n (WMD) programs. Iran's human rights practices, particularly its treatment of the Baha'i and the Jewish communities, are also a major concern, although the Clinton Administration did not cite progress as a specific condition for an improvement in relations. The Bush Administration has identified Iran's modernization of its conventional forces as a potential threat to U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf, but others argue that the buildup has been minor and that Iran still is relatively poorly equipped. Iran's efforts to acquire WMD and delivery means, particularly its ballistic missile program, have made major st rides over the past few years, with the help of foreign suppliers. Barred from U.S. or European advanced technology, Iran continues to receive weaponry and WMD-related technology from China, Russia, and North Korea. Iran has opposed the U.S.-led Middle East peace process since its inception in October 1991. It continues to provide material support to Hizballah in Lebanon and to Islamic-oriented Palestinian groups that oppose the Arab-Israeli peace process, such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. All Iranian factions have strongly supported the terrorist attacks carried out by these groups in clashes with Israel since September 2000. On the other hand, Iran has few ties to the nonIslamist Palestinian groups driving much of the violence in the new uprising. Current U.S. policy toward Iran marks an apparent shift from the almost exclusive focus on containment that characterized U.S. policy during 1980 - 1997. During the first term of the Clinton Administration, as part of a policy of ""dual containment"" of Iran and Iraq, President Clinton imposed a ban on U.S. trade and investment in Iran in 1995, and a 1996 law imposed sanctions on foreign investment in Iran's energy sector (Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, ILSA). The sanctions were intended to deny Iran the material resources to threaten U.S. interests. In keeping with the 1997 policy shift toward engagement, in 1999 and 2000 the Clinton Administration and Congress eased sanctions somewhat to allow U.S. exports to Iran of food and medical supplies and importation from Iran of luxury consumer goods, such as carpets. However, the United States continues to work with its allies to prevent arms and advanced technology sales to Iran and to limit Iran's influence over regional energy flows. U.S. purchases of Iranian oil and U.S. company investments in Iran remain barred. Legislation to renew ILSA for another 5 years was signed on August 3, 2001 (H.R. 1954, P.L. 107-24).  Congressional Research Service  ~ The Library of Congress   IB93033  01-03-02  MOST RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Legislation to renew the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act for another 5 years was passed by large majorities in both chambers and signed on August 3, 2001 (H.R. 1954, P.L. 107-24). A long-time supporter of anti-Taliban forces in Afghanistan, Iran cooperated with U.S. efforts to defeat the Taliban and deliver humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people. Iran's Supreme Leader has tried to quell efforts by some Iranian officials to use the similarity of interests on Afghanistan as an opportunity to rebuild U.S.-Iran relations.  BACKGROUND AND ANALYSIS The power struggle in Iran between revolutionary purists and more moderate reformists colors Iran's domestic and foreign policies. President Mohammad Khatemi, who was reelected on June 8, 2001 by a landslide 77% of the vote against nine more conservative candidates, holds a popular mandate for greater domestic freedoms. His reelection victory was larger than his 69% first win in May 1997. His supporters hold about 70% of the seats in the 290-seat Majlis (parliament) following victories in the February 18, 2000 Majlis elections. However, Khatemi has expressed frustration that his reform program has been obstructed by hardliners, including Supreme Leader Ali Khamene'i (successor to Ayatollah Khomeini), who use their control of key levers of power to prevent a loosening of domestic restrictions or moderation of foreign policy. As part of a hardline backlash since April 2000, hardliners in the judiciary have closed more than 30 reformist newspapers and imprisoned or questioned several editors. The power struggle broke into the open in early August 2001, when hardliners succeeded in delaying Khatemi's second term inauguration until the Majlis approved several hardliners to the legislative review body called the Council of Guardians. Khatemi made few changes to his cabinet, and the Majlis approved all his choices.  Iran's Strategic Buildup Iran is not considered a major conventional threat to the United States, but some of its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly medium range ballistic missiles, appear to be making significant progress. Bush Administration officials have also expressed concern about Iran's plans to reinvigorate a conventional buildup. For further information, see CRS Report RL30551, Iran: Arms and Technology Acquisitions.  Conventional Weapons Iran's armed forces total about 550,000 personnel, including both the regular military and the Revolutionary Guard, the latter of which is populated largely by hardliners. Low oil prices and high debts slowed Iran's defense acquisitions to about $300 million per year during 1996-1999, from over $1 billion per year in the early 1990s, although purchase levels appear set to rise again. Equipment already purchased has given Iran the ability to temporarily block the Strait of Hormuz or disrupt international shipping, but Iran is considered to lack the capability to move significant numbers of troops across the Gulf. In November 2000, Russia told the United States it would no longer abide by a 1995 pledge to refrain from new   IB93033  CRS-2  01-03-02  conventional arms deals with Iran. On October 2, 2001, Iran and Russia signed an agreement that provides for $300 million per year in Iranian arms purchases over the next 5 years. Despite Russian assurances that the arms would be purely defensive, the systems reportedly under consideration include new MiG-29 and Sukhoi combat aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as the S-300 air defense system (the Russian counterpart of the U.S. ""Patriot""). A provision of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, P.L. 104-132, cuts U.S. aid to countries that sell lethal military equipment to countries on the U.S. terrorism list. See CRS Report RL30551, Iran: Arms and Technology Acquisitions, and CRS Report RL31083, Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations, 1993-2000.  Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) U.S. government proliferation reports, including an August 2001 CIA report covering July - December 2000, assert that Iran is actively seeking to acquire WMD and advanced conventional weapons. Iran's programs, particularly its missile program, continue to be assisted primarily by entities in Russia, China, and North Korea. The foreign assistance continued despite U.S. anti-proliferation efforts through multilateral export control regimes such as the Wassenaar Arrangement, Missile Technology Control Regime, Nuclear Suppliers Group, Zangger Committee, and Australia Group. (See also CRS Report RL30408, Weapons of Mass Destruction in the Middle East.) Chemical and Biological Weapons. U.S. proliferation reports state that Iran is seeking to acquire a self-sufficient chemical weapons infrastructure, that it may have some capability for biological weapons deployment, and that it has stockpiled chemical weapons, including blister, blood, and choking agents. On June 11, 2001, the Bush Administration imposed trade sanctions, in accordance with the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000 (P.L. 106178) on China's Jiangsu Yongli Chemicals and Technology Import and Export Corporation for allegedly selling Iran technology not permitted for export to Iran under the Chemical Weapons Convention. This record raises questions about Iran's compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which Iran signed on January 13, 1993, and ratified on June 8, 1997. However, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), charged with monitoring the convention, has indicated general satisfaction with Iran's compliance thus far. OPCW toured Iran's declared chemical sites in February 1999, and Iran has made required declarations. Iran is a party to the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. Missiles. Largely with Russian help, Iran is making progress in its missile program. Although two of its first three tests of the 800-mile range Shahab-3 (July 1998, July 2000, and September 2000) were either inconclusive or unsuccessful (the July 2000 test appears to have been a success), U.S. intelligence officials said publicly in August 2001 that Iran will soon ""field"" the Shahab-3. At least one defense publication said in mid-October 2001 that Iran had launched serial production of the Shahab-3. Iran is also developing a 1,200 mile range Shahab-4, and it has publicly mentioned an even longer- range Shahab-5, although development of the Shahab-5 apparently has not begun, according to U.S. reports. The Washington Times reported on April 18, 2001, that North Korea was in the process of shipping missile components to Iran, and on June 11, 2001, the Bush Administration imposed trade sanctions on North Korean and Iranian entities under the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000 for alleged exports to Iran of missile technology. In the course of August 2001 talks with China on missile proliferation, Bush Administration officials appeared to cast doubt that China was upholding a November 2000 pledge not to export missile technology to Iran or other countries. See also CRS Report RL30551, Iran: Arms and Technology Acquisitions.   IB93033  CRS-3  01-03-02  Nuclear Weapons. U.S. officials believe Iran is acquiring the expertise and technology that could be used in a nuclear weapons program. Russia, despite U.S. protests, is proceeding with its January 1995 contract with Iran to complete a nuclear power plant at Bushehr, and the two countries have said it should be complete by the end of 2002. In November 2001, Russia shipped to Iran the first reactor shell of the project. There have been inconclusive Iranian and Russian statements on whether Iran will commission Russia to build a second reactor at Bushehr. During his June 16, 2001 meeting with Russia's President Vladimir Putin, President Bush raised U.S. concerns about an alleged transfer by a Russian firm to Iran of high-strength aluminum that the United States believes Iran might use to manufacture enriched uranium for a nuclear weapons program. A February 2001 CIA report to Congress , which covered the period of Khatemi's June 2000 visit to China, dropped language from previous reports that China has kept its pledge to refrain from new nuclear cooperation with Iran. Iran accepts International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards of its known nuclear facilities, and agency visits to Iran's declared facilities since 1992 have found no evidence at the sites visited to indicate Iran is developing nuclear weapons. Iran has refused to permit an enhanced IAEA inspections program (""93+2"") that would include surprise inspections to undeclared facilities. Each year since FY1998, foreign aid laws have contained provisions cutting U.S. aid to the Russian government if it continues the Bushehr project or assists Iran's ballistic missile program. No waiver was provided for either in the FY1998 or the FY2000 legislation, although the cuts do not apply to nuclear dismantlement in Russia or aid to Russia's private sector. The foreign operations appropriations for both FY2001 (P.L. 106-429) and FY2002 (conference report H.Rept. 107-345) contain a similar provision, but both increase the aid cut to 60%. The House version of the FY2002 foreign relations authorization bill, H.R. 1646, passed by the House on May 16, 2001, contains Title IX, the Iran Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 2001. Virtually identical to bills introduced in the 106th and 105th congresses, the provision would make the IAEA subject to cuts in U.S. voluntary contributions if it continued technical assistance to Iran's nuclear program.  Iranian Foreign Policy and Involvement in Terrorism The State Department report on international terrorism for 2000, released April 30, 2001, states that Iran ""remained the most active state sponsor of terrorism in 2000,"" although the report attributed that activity to two hardline institutions -- the Revolutionary Guard and the Intelligence Ministry. Iran strongly condemned the September 11 attacks, but an unprecedented visit by Britain's Foreign Secretary Jack Straw on September 25, 2001 failed to enlist Iran openly in an anti-terrorism coalition. Iran publicly denied a December 31, 2001 New York Times report that bin Laden had sought Iran as an ally in the mid-1990s. Press reports in November 2001 indicated Iran is considering withdrawing some of its Revolutionary Guard officers from countries, such as Sudan, Lebanon, and Bosnia, where they have been supporting Islamist movements  possibly indicating, if true, diminished Iranian interest in sponsoring some radical Islamic groups that have been involved in terrorism. (See also CRS Report RL31119, Terrorism: Near Eastern Groups and State Sponsors, 2001.)   IB93033  CRS-4  01-03-02  Persian Gulf Khatemi has largely succeeded in improving relations with Iran's neighbors, particularly the six states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC; Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates). Since he came into office, Iran apparently has reduced support for Shiite Muslim dissident movements in the Gulf states. See also CRS Report RL30728, Persian Gulf: Issues for U.S. Policy, 2000. Saudi Arabia/Khobar Towers/Gulf States. Iran and Saudi Arabia restored relations in December 1991 (after a 4 year break), and progressively higher level contacts have taken place since December 1997. In May 1999, Khatemi became the first senior Iranian leader to visit Saudi Arabia since the Islamic revolution. In April 2000, Saudi Arabia's number three leader, Prince Sultan, hosted a visit by Iran's Defense Minister. Supreme Leader Khamene'i has been invited to visit the Kingdom as well. In mid-April 2001, Saudi Arabia and Iran formally entered into an anti-crime security pact, suggesting that Saudi Arabia wishes to bury the issue of the June 25, 1996 Khobar Towers housing complex bombing, which killed 19 U.S. airmen. On June 21, 2001, a federal grand jury indicted 14 suspects, 13 Saudis and a Lebanese citizen, for the Khobar bombing. The indictment indicated that official elements in Iran were likely involved, but no indictments of any Iranians were announced. Saudi Arabia officials announced that the 11 Saudi suspects who are in custody in Saudi Arabia would be tried in Saudi courts and not turned over to U.S. justice. In 2000, Iran entered into anti-crime security pacts with the other Gulf states of Kuwait and Oman. (See CRS Issue Brief IB93113, Saudi Arabia: Postwar Issues and U.S. Relations.) Gulf Islands Dispute With UAE. Relations between Iran and the UAE deteriorated sharply in April 1992, when Iran asserted complete control of the Persian Gulf island of Abu Musa, which it and the UAE shared under a 1971 bilateral agreement. (In 1971, Iran, then ruled by the U.S.-backed Shah, seized two other islands, Greater and Lesser Tunb, from the emirate of Ras al-Khaymah, which later became part of the UAE.) The UAE wants to refer the dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), but Iran insists on resolving the issue bilaterally. Several GCC states -- Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Oman -- have attempted to mediate and Iran-UAE talks did resume in July 2001, but there is no evidence of Iranian flexibility to date on the key issue of sovereignty. The United States, which is concerned about Iran's military improvements to the islands, generally supports UAE proposals but takes no position on sovereignty. Jane's Defence Weekly reported in March 2000 that Iran's military improvements were relatively minor. Iraq. A legacy of the 8-year long Iran-Iraq war (1980-1988) is deep lingering suspicion between Iran and Iraq, but relations have improved dramatically over the past few years. In early 1998, the two began exchanging significant numbers of prisoners from the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war, alleviating a key source of friction. An October 2000 visit to Iraq by Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi resulted in apparent agreement to abide by the waterwaysharing and other provisions of their 1975 Algiers Accords, which Iraq had abrogated prior to its September 1980 invasion of Iran. In exchange for a share of the proceeds, Iran cooperates with Iraq's illicit export of oil products (worth about $50 million per month as of early 2001) through the Gulf, although Iran has occasionally curtailed its cooperation with that exportation. Iranian hardliners still give support to Shiite militants in southern Iraq (the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, SCIRI) trying to overthrow Iraq's regime. Iran allowed the Iraqi National Congress (INC), Iraq's main opposition umbrella, to open an office in Tehran as of March 2001.   IB93033  CRS-5  01-03-02  Middle East Peace Process/North Africa Many of the allegations of Iran's support for terrorism center on its assistance to groups opposed to the Arab-Israeli peace process, primarily Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Hizballah, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. Apparently corroborating press reports, U.S. officials and U.S. terrorism reports state that, following the September 2000 Palestinian uprising began, Iran increased its support for terrorism somewhat by encouraging coordination among Palestinian terrorist groups. However, the Administration has indicated that the groups Iran supports will not be immediate targets of U.S. military operations in conjunction with the war on terrorism, although pro-Iranian groups are included in post-September 11 diplomatic and financial antiterrorism measures. Hamas and PIJ terrorist attacks escalated since the Palestinian uprising began in late September 2000, and Hamas conducted several major suicide attacks against Israeli civilians in 2001. On the other hand, Iran has had few ties to the non-Islamist Palestinian organizations that have conducted much of the day-to-day violence against Israel in the current uprising. Many in Congress have criticized Iran's incitement activities, such as its hosting of a conference for anti-peace process organizations on April 24, 2001. The conference served as a platform for Iranian statements against Israel that the United States called ""outrageous and intolerable."" Khamene'i told the meeting that Israelis had exaggerated the Holocaust to justify ""crimes"" against the Palestinians. Khamene'i said in early November 2000 that the Palestinian-Israeli violence could end only if Israel were ""eradicated."" Khatemi has sometimes tried to moderate Iran's position somewhat, saying during his November 2001 visit to the United Nations that Iran would accept a final IsraeliPalestinian settlement acceptable to the Palestinians. At the same time, Khatemi has generally sought to avoid conflict with hardliners by joining them in a denunciation of Israeli-Palestinian interim agreements, and by pledging continued support to anti-peace process groups. About 100 Iranian Revolutionary Guards remain in Lebanon to coordinate arms deliveries to Hizballah, and the Los Angeles Times reported on May 6, 2001 that the United States, in late 2000, succeeded in persuading Turkey to prevent Iran from flying over Turkish airspace to Syria, thereby denying Iran an easy route for resupplying Hizballah. Even though the United Nations certified Israel's May 2000 withdrawal from Lebanon as complete, Hizballah continues to battle Israel in the Shebaa Farms border area that Israel controls but which Hizballah claims constitutes Lebanese territory that is still occupied by Israel; Iran publicly supported Hizballah's ambush and capture of three Israeli soldiers and one alleged Israeli agent in October 2000, all in the Shebaa Farms area. (H.Res. 99 expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that Iran, Syria, and Lebanon pressure Hizballah to allow visitations to the four captives by the International Committee of the Red Cross. The measure passed the House on June 25, 2001.) In late October 2001, Israel announced it believed the three captured soldiers had died. On May 10, 1999, Argentina's Supreme Court ruled that the March 17, 1992 bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires was the work of Hizballah. On September 2, 1999, Argentina issued an arrest warrant for senior Hizballah guerrilla leader Imad Mughniyah in connection with it. An Argentine judge has also accused Iran and Hizballah of a July 18, 1994 bombing of a Jewish cultural center (AMIA) in Buenos Aires; 20 alleged Argentine accomplices have been arrested and their trial began in late September 2001, but the main suspects are still at large. H.Res. 531 and S.Res. 329, calling on Argentina to step up the investigation of the 1994 bombing, were passed by their full chambers on July 17 and July   IB93033  CRS-6  01-03-02  19, 2000, respectively. In May 2001, an FBI team traveled to Argentina to help with the AMIA investigation. Sudan/Egypt/Algeria. Sudan's close relations with Iran in the early 1990s contributed to Sudan's placement on the U.S. ""terrorism list"" on August 18, 1993. However, Sudan's earlier alliance with Iran has frayed as Sudan has sought to achieve removal from the terrorism list. Khatemi said in October 1999 that he wants full normalization with Egypt, but Egypt demands, as a precondition, that Iran rename a Tehran street named for Sadat's assassin (Khalid Islambouli). Iran and Algeria restored relations on September 8, 2000; they were broken in 1992 by Algeria, which accused Iran of aiding Islamic opponents of the secular regime.  Central and South Asia/Azerbaijan Iran's policy in Central Asia has thus far emphasized economic cooperation over Islamic ideology, although Iran has become increasingly assertive in its relations with Azerbaijan. In early 1992, Iran led the drive to bring the Central Asian states and Azerbaijan into the Economic Cooperation Organization (founded in 1985 by Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey, as a successor to an organization founded by those states in 1964). Iran is hoping to attract energy pipeline routes through it, rather than through other countries. Iran does not appear to be supporting radical Islamic fundamentalist groups in the Central Asian countries (with the possible exception of Tajikistan) or in Russia's Dagestan and Chechnya regions, but Iran does host at least one anti-Azerbaijan guerrilla leader (Hasan Javadov), and it reportedly allows anti-Uzbekistan activists access to Iran's state radio. Tensions with Azerbaijan flared in late July 2001 over energy exploration rights in the Caspian; Iranian warships and combat aircraft intimidated an international oil firm (BP) on contract to Azerbaijan from continuing its work an area of the Caspian Iran considers its own. The United States called Iran's actions in the Caspian provocative, and it offered new border security aid and increased political support to Azerbaijan. Afghanistan/Pakistan. Iran long opposed the puritanical Sunni Muslim regime of the Taliban in Afghanistan on the grounds that it oppressed Shiite Muslim and other Persianspeaking minorities. Iran nearly launched a military attack against the Taliban in September 1998 after Taliban fighters captured and killed several Iranian diplomats based in northern Afghanistan. Subsequently, Iran provided military aid to the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance coalition, made up of mostly Persian-speaking minority groups. Iran -- along with the United States, Russia, and the countries bordering Afghanistan -- attended U.N.-sponsored meetings in New York (the Six Plus Two group) to try to end the internal conflict in Afghanistan. Iran and the United States also participated in a U.N.-sponsored group in Geneva, which also includes Italy and Germany. Tacitly aligned with the U.S. military campaign against the Taliban in Afghanistan, Iran has pledged search and rescue assistance to the United States, and is allowing U.S. humanitarian aid for the Afghan people to transit Iran en route to Afghanistan. U.S. officials have called Iran's role in the anti-Taliban/Al Qaeda effort, including efforts to form a new government at the Bonn conference (ended in agreement December 5, 2001) ""constructive"" In late November, Iran reopened its embassy in Kabul. However, Iran's public stance has been somewhat different, reflecting official suspicion of the United States: Iran publicly opposed U.S. military retaliation for the September 11 attacks and refused to join a U.S.-led anti-terrorism coaltion. (See CRS Report RL30588, Afghanistan: Current Issues and U.S. Policy Concerns.)   IB93033  CRS-7  01-03-02  Former Yugoslavia On June 26, 1996, and again on May 5, 1997, President Clinton certified to Congress that Bosnia had expelled foreign forces and ended intelligence cooperation with Iran. The certifications were required by P.L. 104-122, an FY1996 supplemental appropriation, and P.L. 104-208, the FY1997 foreign aid appropriation, in order to provide U.S. aid to Bosnia.  Human Rights Concerns U.S. and U.N. human rights reports cite Iran for widespread human rights abuses, (especially of the Baha'i faith), including assassinations and executions of regime opponents (Kurds, People's Mojahedin, and others) in Iran and abroad. These reports note that Khatemi's efforts to promote rule of law have met repeated challenges from hardliners in Iran. Religious Persecution. On October 27, 2001, the State Department again named Iran as a ""Country of Particular Concern,"" under the International Religious Freedom Act. No sanctions were added, on the grounds that Iran is already subject to extensive U.S. sanctions. Religious persecution continues, especially against the Baha'i community, because Iran's Shiite Muslim clergy views the sect as heretical. Two Baha'is (Dhabihullah Mahrami and Musa Talibi) were sentenced to death in 1996 for apostasy. On July 21, 1998, Iran executed Ruhollah Ruhani, the first Bahai executed since 1992 (Bahman Samandari). The United States condemned the execution. In February 2000, Iran's Supreme Court set aside the death sentences against three Bahais, Sirus Zabihi-Moqaddam, Hedayat KashefiNajafabadi, and Manucher Khulusi. On April 21, 1999, the Clinton Administration expressed concern about the sentencing to prison of four Baha'is. Recent resolutions condemning Iran's treatment of the Baha'is, including S.Con.Res. 57, which passed the Senate July 19, 2000, and H.Con.Res. 257, which passed the House on September 19, 2000. Trial of 13 Jews. Although the 30,000 member Jewish community (the largest in the Middle East aside from Israel) enjoys more freedoms than Jewish communities in several other Muslim states, during 1993-1998 Iran executed five Jews allegedly spying for Israel. In June 1999, Iran confirmed that it had arrested 13 Jews -- teachers, shopkeepers, and butchers -- from the Shiraz area that it said were part of an ""espionage ring"" for Israel. After an April - June 2000 trial in which eight of the suspects ""confessed"" to the allegations, ten of the Jews and two Muslims accomplices were convicted (July 1, 2000) and received sentences ranging from 4 years to 13 years. Three Jews were acquitted. The affair provoked an international outcry, and the Clinton Administration worked through U.S. allies to intercede, possibly contributing to a September 21, 2000 decision by a three-judge appeals panel to reduce the sentences slightly, now ranging from 2 to 9 years. On February 8, 2001, Iran's Supreme Court rejected their appeals, allowing the revised sentences to stand. In March 2001, Iran released one of the Jews on the grounds that his sentence included time served. Several bills in the 106th Congress condemned the arrests and called for the release of the detainees and for linking U.S. relations with Iran to the trial's outcome; the Senate passed S.Con.Res. 39 (June 23, 1999) and S.Con.Res. 109 (May 4, 2000). In April 2001, a similar bill, H.Con.Res. 29, was introduced in the 107th Congress.   IB93033  CRS-8  01-03-02  U.S. Policy and Legislation The February 11, 1979 fall of the Shah of Iran, a key U.S. ally, opened a long rift in U.S.-Iranian relations, but the rift appears to be starting to close somewhat. On November 4, 1979, radical ""students"" seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held its diplomats hostage until minutes after President Reagan's inauguration on January 20, 1981. The United States broke relations with Iran on April 7, 1980, and the two countries have had no official dialogue since. The exception was the abortive 1985-86 clandestine arms supply relationship with Iran in exchange for some American hostages held by Hizballah in Lebanon (the so-called ""Iran-Contra Affair""). Iran maintains an interests section in Washington through the Embassy of Pakistan, staffed by Iranian permanent resident aliens or U.S. citizens of Iranian descent. The U.S. protecting power in Iran is Switzerland. Upon taking office in 1993, the Clinton Administration moved to further isolate Iran as part of a strategy of ""dual containment"" of Iran and Iraq. In 1995 and 1996, the Clinton Administration and Congress added sanctions on Iran in response to growing concerns about Iran's weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons acquisition programs, its support for terrorist groups, and its efforts to subvert the Arab-Israeli peace process. The election of Khatemi in May 1997 precipitated a shift in U.S. policy from containment to engagement, although with key efforts to limit Iran's strategic capabilities still in place. The Clinton Administration sought to engage Iran in a dialogue, with no substantive preconditions. In January 1998, Khatemi publicly agreed to increase ""people-to-people"" exchanges with the United States but ruled out an official dialogue. In a June 17, 1998 speech, then Secretary of State Albright stepped up the U.S. outreach effort by calling for mutual confidence building measures that could lead to a ""road map"" for normalization of relations. Encouraged by the reformist victory in Iran's March 2000 parliamentary elections, Secretary Albright gave another speech on March 17, 2000, acknowledging past U.S. meddling in Iran, easing sanctions on some Iranian imports, and promising to work to resolve outstanding claims disputes. Iran welcomed the steps, but called them insufficient to warrant the beginning of a dialogue. Iran also rejected a U.S. suggestion for consular visits by U.S. officials. In early September 2000 meetings at the United Nations in connection with the Millennium Summit, Secretary Albright and President Clinton sent a positive signal to Iran by attending Khatemi's speeches. The Bush Administration appears to be continuing the Clinton Administration efforts to end the long U.S.-Iran estrangement, and it is looking for ways to build on the tacit cooperation between the two countries in Afghanistan. The Administration's November 13, 2001 continuation of the 1979 national emergency on Iran justified the emergency by saying that U.S. ""relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal,"" a far softer statement than previous justifications sighting a continued threat from Iran. However, Iran continues to refuse to engage in official, bilateral talks until at least some U.S. sanctions are lifted. Following a move by some Majlis deputies to call for re-establishing relations with the United States, Supreme Leader Khamene'i moved forcefully to squash talk of improved relations on October 30, 2001, when he threatened to fire Iranian officials who strive for that result. His statement came a few weeks after several Members of Congress had dinner in the Senate with Iran's representative to the United Nations. Some other Members believe that Iran's foreign policies have not moderated and that Iran does not merit U.S. diplomatic overtures or easing of U.S. sanctions (see below).   IB93033  CRS-9  01-03-02  Economic Sanctions Since the November 4, 1979 seizure of the U.S. hostages in Tehran, economic sanctions have formed a major part of U.S. policy toward Iran. On November 14, 1979, President Carter declared a national emergency with respect to Iran, renewed every year since 1979. Terrorism List. Following the October 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Lebanon, believed perpetrated by Iranian allies, Iran was added to the ""terrorism list"" in January 1984. The designation bans direct U.S. financial assistance and arms sales, restricts sales of U.S. dual use items, and requires the United States to oppose multilateral lending to the designated countries. For information on U.S. sanctions on foreign suppliers of arms and technology, see CRS Report RL30551, Iran: Arms and Technology Acquisitions. Counternarcotics. In February 1987, Iran was first designated as a state that failed to cooperate with U.S. anti-drug efforts or take adequate steps to control narcotics production or trafficking. U.S. and U.N. Drug Control Program (UNDCP) assessments of drug production in Iran prompted the Clinton Administration, on December 7, 1998, to remove Iran from the U.S. list of major drug producing countries. The decision exempts Iran from the annual certification process that kept drug-related U.S. sanctions in place on Iran. In late January 1999, Iran allowed the UNDCP to open an office in Tehran. Press reports indicate that Britain has sold Iran small arms for its anti-drug efforts on the Afghan border. Trade Ban. On May 6, 1995, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12959 banning U.S. trade and investment in Iran, including the trading of Iranian oil overseas by U.S. companies. This followed an earlier March 1995 executive order barring U.S. investment in Iran's energy sector, and, although modified, has been extended each year since. On March 13, 2001, President Bush renewed the declaration of a state of emergency that triggered the March 1995 investment ban. An August 1997 amendment to the trade ban (Executive Order 13059) prevented U.S. companies from knowingly exporting goods to a third country for incorporation into products destined for Iran. The trade ban was partly intended to blunt criticism that U.S. trade with Iran made U.S. appeals for multilateral containment of Iran less credible. Some goods related to the safe operation of civilian aircraft can be licensed for export to Iran, and in December 1999, the Clinton Administration allowed the repair of engine mountings on seven Iran Air 747's (Boeing). Implementing regulations do not permit U.S. firms to negotiate investment deals with Iran, and, in November 2000, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC, Department of Treasury) warned U.S. firms against co-sponsoring energy-related conferences with Iran. Following a 1998 application by a U.S. firm to sell Iran agricultural products, and in the context of Clinton Administration and congressional reviews of U.S. unilateral sanctions policies, the Clinton Administration announced in April 1999 that it would license, on a caseby-case basis, commercial sales of food and medical products to certain countries on which unilateral U.S. trade bans are in place (Iran, Libya, and Sudan). Under regulations issued in July 1999, private letters of credit can be used to finance approved sales, but no U.S. government credit guarantees were made available and U.S. exporters were not permitted to deal directly with Iranian banks. Iran says the lack of credit makes U.S. sales, particularly of wheat, uncompetitive. The FY2001 agriculture appropriations (P.L. 106-387), contains a provision banning the use of official credit guarantees for food and medical sales to Iran and other countries on the U.S. terrorism list, except Cuba, although allowing for a presidential waiver to permit such credit guarantees. (In the 107th Congress, S.171, introduced January   IB93033  CRS-10  01-03-02  24, 2001, would repeal this provision.) The Clinton Administration did not provide credit guarantees, and the Bush Administration has not indicated whether it will do so. In her March 17, 2000 speech, then Secretary Albright announced an easing of the trade ban to allow U.S. importation of Iranian nuts, dried fruits, carpets, and caviar. Regulations governing the sales were issued in April 2000. The United States was the largest market for Iranian carpets before the 1979 revolution, although U.S. anti-dumping tariffs imposed on Iranian pistachio nut imports in 1986 (about 300%) and still in effect are dampening imports of that product. Iranian caviar began arriving in the United States in May 2000, and Iranian carpets are being sold in the United States, estimated to be a $100 million per year market. The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA). The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA, H.R. 3107, P.L. 104-172, signed August 5, 1996), a law that sanctions foreign investment in Iran or Libya's energy sector, was scheduled to expire on August 5, 2001. H.R. 1954, which renewed ILSA for five years but requires an Administration report on its effectiveness within 24-30 months, was passed by large majorities in both chambers in July 2001. It was signed on August 3, 2001 (P.L. 107-24). For further discussion of ILSA and its renewal, see CRS Report RS20871, The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA). Caspian/Central Asian Energy Routes Through Iran. The U.S. trade ban permits U.S. companies to apply for licenses to conduct ""swaps"" of Caspian Sea oil with Iran, but, as part of a U.S. policy to route Central Asian energy around Iran (and Russia), a Mobil Corporation application to do so was denied in April 1999. The Administration continues to oppose, and to threaten imposing ILSA sanctions on, pipeline projects that route Caspian/Central Asian energy through Iran. U.S. policy has been to strongly favor construction of a pipeline that would cross the Caspian Sea and let out in Ceyhan, Turkey (Baku-Ceyhan pipeline), avoiding Iran or Russia. Four Caspian nations (Turkey, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan) signed an agreement embracing Baku-Ceyhan on November 18, 1999, and support for the project among oil companies and regional governments has gained momentum over the past few months. A detailed engineering study is under way. However, in a potential setback to Baku-Ceyhan, it was reported in late May 2001 that Kazakhstan will ask Totalfina Elf to study construction of an oil pipeline across Iran. In December 2001, Kazakhstan's President Nazarbayev urged visiting Secretary of State Powell to reconsider U.S. policy to allow oil routes through Iran; Powell reiterated U.S. policy but did not reject the request outright. Russia, which seeks to route oil and gas lines through it, reportedly also favors a route from Kazakhstan through Iran. Despite U.S. pressure not to import Iranian gas, Turkey has begun to do so through a new cross-border pipeline, under an August 1996 bilateral agreement. (See CRS Report 98-86, Iran: Relations With Key Central Asian States.) European and Japanese Relations With/Lending to Iran. U.S.-allied differences on Iran narrowed since 1998 in concert with the Clinton Administration's attempt to engage Iran, a policy consistently favored by the European countries as a way to moderate Iran's behavior. During 1992-1997, the European Union (EU) countries maintained a policy of ""critical dialogue"" with Iran. The United States did not oppose those talks with Iran but maintained that the EU's dialogue would not change Iranian behavior. The dialogue was suspended immediately following the April 1997 German terrorism trial that found high-level Iranian involvement in assassinating Iranian dissidents in Germany. Simultaneous with the U.S. shift toward engagement, the EU-Iran dialogue formally resumed in May 1998, about eight months after Khatemi took office. Since then, Khatemi has undertaken state visits to   IB93033  CRS-11  01-03-02  several Western countries, including Italy (March 1999), France (October 1999), Germany (July 2000), and Japan (November 2000). The United States publicly welcomed these visits. The resolution of the ""Rushdie affair"" to Britain's satisfaction sparked improvement in its relations with Iran. Iran maintains that Ayatollah Khomeini's 1989 death sentence against author Salman Rushdie cannot be revoked (his ""Satanic Verses"" novel was labeled blasphemous) because Khomeini is no longer alive to revoke it. However, on September 24, 1998, Iran's Foreign Minister pledged to Britain that Iran will not seek to implement the sentence and opposes any bounties offered for his death. Britain then upgraded relations with Iran to the ambassadorial level, and Foreign Ministers of the two countries have exchanged visits. In October 2000, the United Kingdom began extending longer term credit (two years or greater) for exports to Iran. Some Iranian clerics (outside the formal government structure) have said the death sentence stands, and the Iranian government has not required the Fifteen Khordad foundation to withdraw its $2.8 million reward for Rushdie's death. Khatemi said on June 4, 2001 that he considers the issue closed. In August 1999, Japan's Foreign Minister continued a gradual improvement in relations with Iran by visiting that country and announcing that Japan would resume its official development lending program for Iran to construct a hydroelectric dam over the Karun River. However, the $70 million increment announced was less that Iran had wanted, and Japan said that this tranche would close out Japan's involvement in the project. (In 1993, Japan provided the first $400 million tranche of the overall $1.4 billion official development loan program, but the lending was subsequently placed on hold as the United States sought to persuade its allies to pressure Iran.) In late January 2000, Japan agreed to resume mediumand long-term (two years or longer) export credit insurance for exports to Iran, suspended since 1994. Economic relations improved further during Khatemi's November 2000 visit to Tokyo, which resulted in Japan's commitment to provide insurance cover for over $500 million in private sector projects, including refurbishment of steel and petrochemical plants. Iran also granted Japanese firms the first right to negotiate to develop the large Azadegan field, and Iran and a Japanese-led consortium are moving forward with preliminary studies of the field. Some press reports suggest that Royal Dutch/Shell might join the Azadegan project, apparently because it can provide needed technology. In exchange, Japan agreed to prepay Iran $1 billion per year for the next 3 years for Iranian oil. Partly at U.S. urging, Japan refused to extend to Iran additional official loans. During 1994-1995, and over U.S. objections at the time, Iran's European and Japanese creditors rescheduled about $16 billion in Iranian debt. These countries (governments and private creditors) rescheduled the debt bilaterally, in spite of Paris Club rules that call for multilateral rescheduling and International Monetary Fund (IMF) involvement. Iran has worked its external debt down from $32 billion in 1997 to $7.8 billion as of April 2001, according to Iran's Central Bank. Iran plans to retire about half of that remaining debt by March 2002. The improved debt picture has led most European export credit agencies, including Germany's Hermes, France's COFACE, and that of Spain, to restore insurance cover for exports to Iran. In October 1999, Dutch banks extended $2 billion in credits to investors in Iran. In July 2000, Germany increased its export insurance cover from $100 million to $500 million in conjunction with Khatemi's visit there. In July 2001, France's Societe Generale de France extended a $1 billion credit line to a group of Iranian commercial banks. In early September 2001, Iran and the EU met to discuss a possible trade pact that would lower the tariffs or increase quotas for Iranian exports to the EU countries. In August 2001, Iran announced it would tap international capital markets for the first time since the Islamic revolution by issuing a $280 million Eurobond.   IB93033  CRS-12  01-03-02  Multilateral Lending to Iran/WTO. Section 1621 of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-132) amended the Foreign Assistance Act to require the United States to vote against international loans to countries on the U.S. terrorism list. Acting under provisions of successive foreign aid laws, in 1993 the United States voted its 16.5% share of the World Bank against loans to Iran of $460 million for electricity, health, and irrigation projects. To signal opposition to international lending to Iran, the FY1994 foreign aid appropriations act (P.L. 103-87) cut the Administration's request for the U.S. contribution to the World Bank by the amount of those loans. That law, the FY1995 foreign aid appropriation (P.L. 103-326), and the FY1996 foreign aid appropriations (P.L. 104-107), would have significantly reduced U.S. payments to the Bank if it had provided new loans to Iran. The legislation contributed to the Bank's refusal to approve any new lending to since then. By 1999, Iran's moderating image had led the World Bank to consider new loans. In May 2000, the United States was unsuccessful in obtaining further delay on a vote on new lending for Iran, and its allies outvoted the United States to approve $232 million in loans for health and sewage projects. Twenty one of the Bank's twenty four governors voted in favor, and France and Canada abstained. Earlier, Iran also had asked the International Monetary Fund for about $400 million in loans (its quota is about $2 billion) to help it deal with its trade financing shortfalls. However, Iran balked at accepting IMF conditionality, and discussions broke off. Despite the required U.S. opposition, on May 10, 2001, the World Bank's executive directors voted to approve a two-year economic reform strategy for Iran that envisions $775 million in new Bank loans. Voting on the actual loans is expected in the spring of 2002. On May 8, 2001, the World Trade Organization, at U.S. urging, postponed until July 2001 a discussion on whether to launch entry talks with Iran. On July 18, 2001, and again on October 10, 2001, the United States achieved further postponements in considering Iran's application for admission, although the Administration says that position is ""under review."" Iranian officials indicate to U.S. visitors that the dropping of U.S. opposition to Iran's membership in the WTO would be taken as a positive U.S. gesture. Assets Disputes/Victims of Terrorism. Iran claims that the United States has frozen vast amounts of Iranian assets, presenting an obstacle to improved relations. A U.S.Iran Claims Tribunal, at the Hague, is arbitrating cases resulting from the break in relations following the Iranian revolution. The major cases yet to be decided center on hundreds of Foreign Military Sales cases between the United States and the Shah's regime, which Iran claims it paid for but were unfulfilled. About $400 million in proceeds from the resale of that equipment is in a DOD account. In April 2000, then Secretary Albright named a representative to negotiate a resolution of the claims issue at the Hague. The assets issue moved to the forefront following several U.S. court judgements against Iran for past acts of terrorism against Americans, filed under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. Since March 1998, U.S. courts have awarded the following: $247 million to the family of Alisa Flatow, killed in Israel in April 1995 in a bombing by Palestinian Islamic Jihad (awarded in March 1998); $65 million to three Americans held hostage in Lebanon - David Jacobsen, Joseph Cicippio, and Frank Reed (August 1998); $324 for Lebanon hostage Terry Anderson (March 2000); $327 million to the families of two Americans killed in a February 1996 Hamas bombing (July 2000); and $355 million to the family of Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, killed by Hizballah in 1989 (September 2000). Former Lebanon hostage Thomas Sutherland won a $353 million judgement against Iran on June 26, 2001. In August 2001, the family of former Lebanon hostage father Lawrence Jenco won a $314.6 million judgment against Iran for his captivity. In June 2001, former hostages Benjamin Weir and Frank Regier sued Iran for over $100 million for their captivity in   IB93033  CRS-13  01-03-02  Lebanon. Also in early June 2001, the family of former hostage Peter Kilburn, who was killed in the course of his captivity in Lebanon, filed a suit against both Libya and Iran for more than $200 million. In mid-October 2001, the Bush Administration asked a federal judge to throw out a lawsuit against Iran by the 52 Americans held hostage by Iran for 444 days. On the basis of the sanctity of diplomatic property, the Clinton Administration blocked efforts by the claimants to satisfy their judgments from frozen Iranian assets -- diplomatic property in Washington (worth about $22 million) or the DOD account mentioned above. In December 1999, the Clinton Administration also blocked a Flatow effort to seize a $6 million U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal judgement awarded to Iran. A provision of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (H.R. 3244, P.L. 106-386) provides for the use of general revenues to pay 110% of compensatory damage awards to the above and future successful claimants in a total not to exceed the rental proceeds from Iran's diplomatic property and the DOD account. The provision requires the President to try to recoup the expended funds from Iran as part of an overall reconciliation in relations and assets settlement, although there is no requirement that funds ultimately be withheld from Iran. A provision of the FY2002 Commerce, Justice, State appropriation (P.L. 107-77) requires an Administration legislative proposal on how to compensate successful U.S. claimants in future terrorism-related judgments against Iran. Regarding the mistaken U.S. shootdown on July 3,1988 of an Iranian Airbus passenger jet, on February 22, 1996, the United States, responding to an Iranian case before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), agreed to pay Iran up to $61.8 million in compensation ($300,000 per wage earning victim, $150,000 per non wage earner) for the 248 Iranians killed in the shootdown. The funds for this settlement came from a general appropriation for judgments against the United States. The United States previously paid $3 million in death benefits for 47 non-Iranians killed in the attack, but has not compensated Iran for the airplane itself. A different case, pending before the ICJ, involves an Iranian claim for damages to Iranian oil platforms during U.S. naval clashes with Iran in October 1987 and April 1988. Related Issues. Use of U.S. passports for travel to Iran is permitted, but a State Department travel warning, softened somewhat in April 1998, asks that Americans ""defer"" travel to Iran. Iranians entering the United States are fingerprinted, although Secretary Albright implied in her March 17, 2000 speech that this practice would be eliminated. U.S. regulations do not bar disaster relief and the United States donated $125,000, through relief agencies, to help victims of two earthquakes in Iran (February and May 1997).  Military Containment U.S. policy has focused on containing the military threat posed by Iran to the United States, U.S. allies in the Persian Gulf, and international shipping. Although containing Iraq has been the primary goal of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf region since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, U.S. military officials note that U.S. forces can also be used to monitor and deter Iran, if necessary. U.S. military officers note that their encounters with Iranian naval vessels in the Gulf have been more professional and less tense since Khatemi took office.  Iran's Opposition Movements On February 8, 1995, then House Speaker Newt Gingrich said that a U.S. policy supporting the overthrow of Iran's regime was the only policy that made sense. The Administration accepted a House-Senate conference agreement to include $18-$20 million   IB93033  CRS-14  01-03-02  in funding authority for covert operations against Iran in the FY1996 intelligence authorization act (H.R. 1655, P.L. 104-93) -- about $14 million more than requested -- according to a Washington Post report of December 22, 1995. The Clinton Administration reportedly succeeded in focusing the covert aid on changing the regime's behavior, rather than its overthrow. The conference report on H.R. 2267 (H.Rept. 105-405), the FY1998 Commerce/State/ Justice appropriation, provided $4 million for a ""Radio Free Iran,"" to be run by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). The radio, which the Administration is calling the Farsi service of RFE/RL, began operations in Prague on October 31, 1998. Another $4 million for the radio for FY1999 was provided by the omnibus appropriation (H.R. 4328, P.L. 105-277). (See CRS Report 98-539, Radio Free Iraq and Radio Free Iran: Background, Legislation, and Policy Issues for Congress.) Since the late 1980s, the State Department has refused contact with the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI) and its umbrella organization, the National Council of Resistance (NCR). It was designated as a foreign terrorist organization in October 1997 under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. On October 8, 1999, the PMOI's umbrella organization, the National Council of Resistance (NCR), was designated an alias of the PMOI, subjecting it to the same restrictions as apply to the PMOI (no visits by its members to the United States, seizure of its U.S. assets, and a ban on U.S. resident contributions to the group). The State Department's annual terrorism review, issued in April 2000, cited several PMOI attacks on Iran as justifying Iran's claim that Iran is a victim of terrorism. Many in Congress appear to differ with the Administration view of the group and majorities in Congress have occasionally signed letters asking the Secretary of State to explore the possibility of working with the PMOI against Iran. On October 11, 2000, a letter signed by 225 House Members and 28 Senators was released, calling for support for the NCR and deploring Iran's human rights record. Among its recent activities in Iran, the PMOI claimed responsibility for assassinating a senior Iranian military officer in Tehran in April 2000. The United States condemned the killing. The PMOI claimed responsibility for a mortar attack on the presidential palace on February 6, 2000; Khatemi was not hurt. On March 13, 2000, the PMOI claimed responsibility for launching a mortar attack in Tehran, although it missed its target and hit an apartment complex. In August 2000, the PMOI claimed responsibility for a mortar attack on an army base in Tehran, and the group's supporters in Iran have been putting up posters of the group's leaders, Masud and Maryam Rajavi. On January 21, 2001, the PMOI claimed responsibility for a rocket attack on a court in Tehran, and, on February 20, 2001, its Iraqbased military arm made a brief incursion into Iran, clashing with local security forces. Iran's agents and military forces frequently retaliate against the group's personnel and facilities in Iraq. Seven alleged members were arrested in Los Angeles in March 2001 for allegedly raising money for the organization, and subsequently were indicted. (See CRS Report 97-961, Iran: The People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran.) Some Iranian exiles follow the son of the late former Shah, who lives in the United States. On January 24, 2001, the Shah's son, Reza Pahlavi, 40 years old, ended a long period of inactivity by giving a speech in Washington calling for unity in opposition to the current regime and for the institution of a constitutional monarchy and genuine democracy in Iran. He has since broadcast messages into Iran from a station in California, and press reports say a growing number of Iranians are listening to his broadcasts."

The Bush Administration has identified Iran's modernization of its conventional forces as a potential threat to U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf, but others argue that the buildup has been minor and that Iran still is relatively poorly equipped. Although the Bush Administration says it is still willing to hold a dialogue with Iran, the focus of current U.S. policy appears to be a return to the containment policy that prevailed during the early part of the Clinton Administration. During the first term of the Clinton Administration, as part of a policy of ""dual containment"" of Iran and Iraq, President Clinton imposed a ban on U.S. trade and investment in Iran in 1995, and a 1996 law imposed sanctions on foreign investment in Iran's energy sector (Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, ILSA). In keeping with a 1997 policy shift toward engagement, the Clinton Administration and Congress later eased sanctions to allow U.S. exports to Iran of food and medical supplies and importation from Iran of goods such as carpets and caviar. The United States has consistently worked with its allies to prevent arms and advanced technology sales to Iran and to limit Iran's influence over regional energy flows. U.S. purchases of Iranian crude oil and U.S. company investments in Iran remain barred. ILSA was renewed for another 5 years on August 3, 2001 (H.R. 1954, P.L. 107-24).  Even before Iran's tacit cooperation with post-September 11 U.S. efforts to defeat Afghanistan's Taliban regime, signs of moderation in Iran had stimulated the United States to try to engage Iran in official talks. Iran, still split between conservatives and reformers loyal to President Mohammad Khatemi did not accept. By early 2002, reports of Iran's continued support to antiMiddle East peace process groups such as Hizballah had reversed the warming trend. Iran was grouped with North Korea and Iraq as part of the ""axis of evil"" identified in President Bush's January 29, 2002 State of the Union message. The United States said subsequently it supports reform-minded Iranians who want democracy, an apparent shift from the stance of attempting to engage Khatemi's government. President Bush has identified Iran's efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction and delivery means, coupled with its support of terrorist groups, as key U.S. concerns. Iran's ballistic missile program has made major strides over the past few years, with the help of several foreign suppliers, and the strides in its civilian nuclear power program could further a nuclear weapons effort. Iran has opposed the U.S.-led Middle East peace process since its inception in October 1991. It continues to provide material support to Hizballah in Lebanon and to Palestinian groups that oppose the Arab-Israeli peace process, such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. All Iranian factions have publicly supported Palestinian violence against Israel since September 2000.  Congressional Research Service  ~ The Library of Congress   IB93033  11-26-02  M  OST  RECENT DEVELOP  MENTS  The multi-year thawing of U.S.-Iran relations reversed in January 2002 over revelations that Iran had sold arms to the Palestinian Authority and following reports in mid-2002 that large numbers of Al Qaeda fighers had received refuge in Iran. In his January 29, 2002 State of the Union message, President Bush named Iran, along with Iraq and North Korea, as part of an ""axis of evil,"" constituting major threats to U.S. security. In July 2002, the Administration articulated a shift in policy - supporting Iranians who want reform and democracy, rather than seeking to support Khatemi and his faction.  BACKGROUND  AND  ANAL  YSIS  The power struggle in Iran between revolutionary purists and more moderate reformists colors Iran's domestic and foreign policies. President Mohammad Khatemi, who was reelected on June 8, 2001 by a landslide 77% of the vote against nine more conservative candidates, holds a popular mandate for greater domestic freedoms. His reelection victory was larger than his 69% first win in May 1997. His supporters hold about 70% of the seats in the 290-seat Majlis (parliament) following victories in the February 18, 2000 Majlis elections. However, Khatemi's reform program has been largely obstructed by hardliners, including Supreme Leader Ali Khamene'i (successor to Ayatollah Khomeini), who control key revolutionary institutions and other levers of power. The hardliners also have constrained Khatemi's efforts to moderate Iran's foreign policy. As part of a hardline backlash since April 2000, hardliners in the judiciary have closed more than 60 reformist newspapers and imprisoned or questioned several editors and even some members of the Majlis. In February 2002 testimony, DCI George Tenet said Iran's reform movement was ""losing momentum"" to the ""unelected"" hardliners, and Khatemi has publicly criticized hardline elements for slowing his reform attempts. In late August 2002, Khatemi proposed new legislation that would strengthen the power of his office, and several analysts say Khatemi might resign if the proposals are blocked by hardliners. In November 2002, a popular history professor and ally of Khatemi, Hashem Aghajari, was convicted by a local (Hamadan) court of apostasy and sentenced to death, prompting several days of student demonstrations and some clashes with hardline security enforcers. Khamene'i has ordered the sentence reviewed, but Aghajari has refused to appeal the sentence.  Iran's Strategic Buildup Iran is not considered a major conventional threat to the United States, but some of its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly medium range ballistic missiles, appear to be making significant progress and could put U.S. allies and installations at risk. For further information, see CRS Report RL30551, Iran: Arms and Technology Acquisitions.  Conventional Weapons Iran's armed forces total about 550,000 personnel, including both the regular military and the Revolutionary Guard, the latter of which is loyal to the hardliners. Lower oil prices CRS-1   IB93033  11-26-02  and high debts slowed Iran's defense acquisitions to about $300 million per year during 1996-1999, from over $1 billion per year in the early 1990s, although purchase levels appear to be rising again. According to U.S. military officials, equipment already purchased has given Iran the ability to block the Strait of Hormuz at least temporarily, but Iran is largely lacking in ability to project power far beyond its borders. In November 2000, Russia told the United States it would no longer abide by a 1995 pledge to refrain from new conventional arms deals with Iran. On October 2, 2001, Iran and Russia signed an agreement that provides for $300 million per year in Iranian arms purchases over the next 5 years, reportedly to include new MiG-29 and Sukhoi combat aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as the S-300 air defense system (the Russian counterpart of the U.S. ""Patriot""). In May 2002, it was reported that Iran will buy new cruise-missile carrying patrol boats from China. See CRS Report RL31529, Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations, 1994-2001.  Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) It is partly because of Iran's attempts to acquire WMD that President Bush, in his January 29, 2002 State of the Union message, labeled Iran part of an ""axis of evil"" along with Iraq and North Korea. Iran's programs, particularly its missile program, continue to be assisted primarily by entities in Russia, China, and North Korea. Chemical and Biological Weapons. U.S. proliferation reports state that Iran is seeking to acquire a self-sufficient chemical weapons infrastructure, that it may have some capability for biological weapons deployment, and that it has stockpiled chemical weapons, including blister, blood, and choking agents. This record raises questions about Iran's compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which Iran signed on January 13, 1993, and ratified on June 8, 1997. However, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), charged with monitoring the convention, has indicated general satisfaction with Iran's compliance thus far. OPCW toured Iran's declared chemical sites in February 1999, and Iran has made required declarations. Iran is a party to the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. Missiles. Largely with Russian help, Iran is making progress in its missile program. Two of its first three tests of the 800-mile range Shahab-3 (July 1998, July 2000, and September 2000) were either inconclusive or unsuccessful (the July 2000 test appears to have been a success), but Iran conducted an apparently successful test in late May 2002, and the Defense Department now assesses the missile as operational. Iran might have produced 10 20 of them, according to press reports. Iran is also trying to make a 1,200 mile range Shahab-4, but U.S. officials told journalists in late October 2002 that an Iranian test of an extended-range Shahab had failed. In March 2002, an intelligence community official upgraded the missile threat from Iran, testifying that the United States would ""most likely"" face an intercontinental ballistic missile threat from Iran by 2015. CIA statements in February 2002 cast doubt that China is upholding a November 2000 pledge not to export missile technology to Iran or other countries. On February 22, 2002, the Washington Times reported that China had delivered HQ-7 surface-to-air missiles to Iran. On September 6, 2002, Iran said it successfully tested a 200 mile range ""Fateh 110"" missile, and Iran said in late September 2002 that it has begun production of the missile. Nuclear Weapons. DCI Tenet testified in February 2002 that Iran might be able to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon by late this decade, and sooner if it gets CRS-2   IB93033  11-26-02  such material from outside. Russia, despite these U.S. concerns and protests, is proceeding with its January 1995 contract with Iran to complete a nuclear power plant at Bushehr, and the two countries have said it should be complete by the end of 2003 and operational by 2005. Russia says that it has reached agreement with Iran for the spent nuclear material produced by the plant to be returned to Russia and reprocessed there. However, Undersecretary of State John Bolton told Congress on October 9, 2002, that Iran is building a nuclear fuel cycle to support a nuclear weapons program. Perhaps fearing a U.S. air or missile strike to destroy the plant, Iran has been surrounding it with anti-aircraft batteries; a possible strike on the plant was the subject of a July 29, 2002 Washington Post article. Russian technicians have begun assembling the reactor and turbine. In July 2002, Russia raised U.S. concerns by unveiling a plan to build five more reactors in Iran over the next ten years. Russia sought to downplay this plan during a visit to Moscow by Energy Secretary Spence Abraham, although Russia continues to insist Bushehr is not a proliferation threat. The February 2002 CIA report to Congress, covering January - June 2001, says that some Iran-China interactions raise questions about China's adherence to its pledge to refrain from new nuclear cooperation with Iran. Iran accepts International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards of its known nuclear facilities, and agency visits to Iran's declared facilities since 1992 have found no evidence at the sites visited to indicate Iran is developing nuclear weapons. Iran has refused to permit an enhanced IAEA inspections program (""93+2"") that would include surprise inspections to undeclared facilities, although some observers say Iran might ultimately accept the plan. Each year since FY1998, foreign aid laws have contained provisions cutting U.S. aid to the Russian government if it continues the Bushehr project or assists Iran's ballistic missile program. No waiver was provided for either in the FY1998 or the FY2000 legislation, although the cuts do not apply to nuclear dismantlement in Russia or aid to Russia's private sector. The foreign operations appropriations for both FY2001 (P.L. 106429) and FY2002 (conference report H.Rept. 107-345) contain a similar provision, but both increase the aid cut to 60%. The FY2002 foreign relations authorization bill (H.R. 1646, P.L. 107-228), contains Subtitle B, ""The Iran Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 2001,"" making the IAEA subject to cuts in U.S. voluntary contributions if it provides assistance to Iran's nuclear program that could be used for a nuclear weapons program.  Iranian Foreign Policy and Involvement in Terrorism Iran's continued support for terrorism contributed to President Bush's strong criticism of Iran in his State of the Union message. The State Department report on international terrorism for 2001, released May 21, 2002, again states, as it has for most of the past decade, that Iran ""remained the most active state sponsor of terrorism in 2001,"" although the report attributes the terrorist activity to two hardline institutions -- the Revolutionary Guard and the Intelligence Ministry. On the other hand, Iran strongly condemned the September 11 attacks and tacitly supported the U.S. war on the Taliban and Al Qaeda. (See also CRS Report RL31119, Terrorism: Near Eastern Groups and State Sponsors, 2002.)  CRS-3   IB93033  11-26-02  Persian Gulf Khatemi has largely succeeded in improving relations with Iran's neighbors, particularly the six states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC; Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates). Since he came into office, Iran has reduced support for Shiite Muslim dissident movements in the Gulf states. In early October 2002, Iran and Kuwait signed a defense and intelligence cooperation agreement. See also CRS Report RL30728, Persian Gulf: Issues for U.S. Policy, 2000. Saudi Arabia/Khobar Towers. Iran and Saudi Arabia restored relations in December 1991 (after a 4 year break), and progressively higher level contacts have taken place since December 1997. In May 1999, Khatemi became the first senior Iranian leader to visit Saudi Arabia since the Islamic revolution; he visited again on September 11, 2002, to discuss the possible U.S. military action against Iraq. Supreme Leader Khamene'i has been invited to visit the Kingdom as well. In mid-April 2001, Saudi Arabia and Iran formally entered into an anti-crime security pact, suggesting that Saudi Arabia wishes to bury the issue of the June 25, 1996 Khobar Towers housing complex bombing, which killed 19 U.S. airmen. On June 21, 2001, a federal grand jury indicted 14 suspects, 13 Saudis and a Lebanese citizen, for the Khobar bombing. The indictment indicated that Iranian agents were likely involved, but no indictments of any Iranians were announced. In June 2002, Saudi Arabia reportedly sentenced some of the eleven Saudi suspects held there. (See CRS Issue Brief IB93113, Saudi Arabia: Postwar Issues and U.S. Relations.) Gulf Islands Dispute With UAE. Relations between Iran and the UAE deteriorated sharply in April 1992, when Iran asserted complete control of the Persian Gulf island of Abu Musa, which it and the UAE shared under a 1971 bilateral agreement. (In 1971, Iran, then ruled by the U.S.-backed Shah, seized two other islands, Greater and Lesser Tunb, from the emirate of Ras al-Khaymah, which later became part of the UAE.) The UAE wants to refer the dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), but Iran insists on resolving the issue bilaterally. Several GCC states have attempted to mediate in recent years and Iran-UAE tensions have eased somewhat, but Iran insists that it has sovereignty over the islands and that this issue is not negotiable. The United States, which is concerned about Iran's military improvements to the islands, generally supports UAE proposals but takes no position on sovereignty. Jane's Defence Weekly reported in March 2000 that Iran's military emplacements on the islands are relatively minor. Iraq. A legacy of the 8-year long Iran-Iraq war (September 1980 - August 1988) is deep lingering suspicion between Iran and Iraq, but the two have drawn closer in recent years. However, some of Iran's actions suggest it is positioning itself to benefit politically in Iraq if the United States ousts Saddam Husayn. Iran, which fears potential encirclement by pro-U.S. regimes, publicly opposes a major U.S. military offensive against Iraq unless it is authorized by the United Nations. However, in late 2002, Iran has reportedly been offering the United States at least tacit backing if the United States attacks Iraq, perhaps hoping that Saddam's overthrow would put Tehran's proteges in power there. Iranian hardliners are still politically close to Shiite militants in southern Iraq (the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, SCIRI) who, as of August 2002, have been increasingly open about accepting U.S. backing for efforts to overthrow Iraq's regime. Iran allowed the U.S.-backed Iraqi National Congress (INC), Iraq's main opposition umbrella, to open an office in Tehran in 2001. CRS-4   IB93033  11-26-02  Since early 1998, Iran and Iraq have exchanged significant numbers of prisoners from the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. An October 2000 visit to Iraq by Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi resulted in apparent agreement to abide by the waterway-sharing and other provisions of their 1975 Algiers Accords, which Iraq had abrogated prior to its September 1980 invasion of Iran. In exchange for a share of the proceeds, Iran's maritime authorities sometimes cooperate with Iraq's illicit export of oil products through the Gulf.  Middle East Peace Process/North Africa Many of the allegations of Iran's support for terrorism center on its assistance to groups opposed to the Arab-Israeli peace process, primarily Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Hizballah, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. U.S. terrorism reports state that, following the start of the September 2000 Palestinian uprising, Iran increased its support for terrorism by encouraging coordination among Palestinian terrorist groups. Iran also incites anti-Israel violence, including hosting conferences of antipeace process organizations (April 24, 2001, and June 2-3, 2002). Khamene'i has continued to call Israel a ""cancerous tumor"" and make other statements suggesting that he seeks Israel's destruction. Khatemi, while publicly pledging support for the anti-peace process groups, has sometimes tried to moderate Iran's position somewhat. On October 15, the Iranian Foreign Ministry said Iran would not seek to block a final, two-state Israeli-Palestinian settlement. Iran has traditionally had few ties to the non-Islamist Palestinian organizations, including elements linked to the Palestinian Authority, that have conducted some of the dayto-day violence against Israel in the current uprising. It was viewed as a new development when Israel and the United States asserted in early January 2002 that Iran was the source of a shipment, intercepted by Israel, of 50 tons of arms bought by the Palestinian Authority. About 150 Iranian Revolutionary Guards remain in Lebanon to coordinate Iranian arms deliveries to Hizballah, which are offloaded in Damascus and trucked into Lebanon. The shipments have included Stingers obtained by Iran in Afghanistan, mortars that can reach the Israeli city of Haifa if fired from southern Lebanon, and, recently, over 8,000 Katyusha rockets, according to press reports. In mid-April 2002, Foreign Minister Kharrazi visited Lebanon and urged Hizballah to exercise restraint on the Israeli-Lebanese border at a time of heightened tensions between Israel and the Palestinians. However, Hizballah is believed to take its advice from Iran's hardliners, not those linked to Khatemi and the reformists. Sudan. Sudan's close relations with Iran in the early 1990s contributed to Sudan's placement on the U.S. ""terrorism list"" on August 18, 1993. However, Sudan's alliance with Iran frayed in the mid 1990s as Sudan sought to burnish its international image.  Central and South Asia/Azerbaijan Iran's policy in Central Asia has thus far emphasized economic cooperation over Islamic ideology, although Iran has become increasingly assertive in its relations with Azerbaijan. In early 1992, Iran led the drive to bring the Central Asian states and Azerbaijan into the Economic Cooperation Organization (founded in 1985 by Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey, as a successor to an organization founded by those states in 1964). Iran is hoping to attract energy pipeline routes through it, rather than through other countries. However, Iran does  CRS-5   IB93033  11-26-02  host at least one anti-Azerbaijan guerrilla leader (Hasan Javadov), and it allegedly harbors leaders of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), including founder Tahir Yuldashev. Tensions with Azerbaijan flared in late July 2001 over energy exploration rights in the Caspian; Iranian warships and combat aircraft intimidated an international oil firm (BP) on contract to Azerbaijan from continuing its work an area of the Caspian Iran considers its own. The United States called Iran's actions in the Caspian provocative, and it offered new border security aid and increased political support to Azerbaijan. Iran and Armenia, an adversary of Azerbaijan, agreed on expanded defense cooperation in early March 2002. IranAzerbaijan tensions eased somewhat in conjunction with the mid-May 2002 visit of Azerbaijan's President Heydar Aliyev to Iran, although there was little evident progress on a bilateral division of their portions of the Caspian. Al Qaeda/Afghanistan/Pakistan. Iran long opposed the puritanical Sunni Muslim regime of the Taliban in Afghanistan on the grounds that it oppressed Shiite Muslim and other Persian-speaking minorities. Iran nearly launched a military attack against the Taliban in September 1998 after Taliban fighters captured and killed several Iranian diplomats based in northern Afghanistan, and it provided military aid to the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance coalition, made up of mostly Persian-speaking minority groups. Iran -- along with the United States, Russia, and the countries bordering Afghanistan -- attended U.N.-sponsored meetings in New York (the Six Plus Two group) to try to end the internal conflict in Afghanistan. Iran and the United States also participated in a U.N.-sponsored group in Geneva, which includes Italy and Germany. Tacitly aligned with the U.S. military campaign against the Taliban in Afghanistan, Iran pledged search and rescue assistance to the United States and allowed U.S. humanitarian aid for the Afghan people to transit Iran. Some of Iran's subsequent activities in Afghanistan reflect official suspicion of the United States and the influence of hardliners in Iran's regime. Iran is said to fear the proU.S. tilt of the new government of Afghanistan and the waning of Iran's traditional sway in western, central, and northern Afghanistan where Persian-speaking Afghans predominate. There have been press reports and U.S. official statements since in January 2002 that hardliners in Iran are harboring, or at least not aggressively moving to arrest, senior Al Qaeda operatives who have fled Afghanistan (Sayf al-Adl and Abu Hafs the Mauritanian) as well as relatively large numbers (a few hundred) rank and file Al Qaeda fighters. The United States reportedly has moved U.S. special operations forces in Afghanistan to areas near the Iranian border to hunt for Al Qaeda fighters. Another report in early September 2002 said Iran is helping Al Qaeda transport some of its gold assets, which it is increasingly using instead of bank accounts. On the other hand, Saudi Arabia said in August 2002 that Iran had extradited to Saudi Arabia 16 Al Qaeda members. An unconfirmed report in November 2002 said that Iran had extradited one of Osama bin Laden's sons to Saudi Arabia. Other reports say Iran is arming local Afghan strongmen including Herat governor Ismail Khan, Mazar-e-Sharif governor Abdul Rashid Dostam, and others, and President Bush has warned Iran not to seek to exert influence over the new government of Afghanistan. Apparently seeking to deflect the U.S. criticism, in March 2002 Iran reportedly expelled exiled Pashtun figure Gulbuddin Hikmatyar, an opponent of the new Afghan government. The expulsion followed a February 24, 2002 visit to Iran by Afghan leader Hamid Karzai; the two countries agreed to broad cooperation. (See CRS Report RL30588, Afghanistan: Current Issues and U.S. Policy Concerns.) CRS-6   IB93033  11-26-02  Former Yugoslavia On June 26, 1996, and again on May 5, 1997, President Clinton certified to Congress that Bosnia had expelled foreign forces and ended intelligence cooperation with Iran. The certifications were required by P.L. 104-122, an FY1996 supplemental appropriation, and P.L. 104-208, the FY1997 foreign aid appropriation, in order to provide U.S. aid to Bosnia.  Human Rights Concerns U.S. and U.N. human rights reports cite Iran for widespread human rights abuses, (especially of the Baha'i faith), including assassinations and executions of regime opponents (Kurds, People's Mojahedin, and others) in Iran and abroad. These reports note that Khatemi's efforts to promote rule of law have met repeated challenges from hardliners. In April 2002, the U.N. Human Rights Commission narrowly voted not to investigate Iran's human rights record during 2002-3. Religious Persecution. On October 27, 2001, the State Department again named Iran as a ""Country of Particular Concern,"" under the International Religious Freedom Act. No sanctions were added, on the grounds that Iran is already subject to extensive U.S. sanctions. Religious persecution continues, especially against the Baha'i community, because Iran's Shiite Muslim clergy views the sect as heretical. Two Baha'is (Dhabihullah Mahrami and Musa Talibi) were sentenced to death in 1996 for apostasy. On July 21, 1998, Iran executed Ruhollah Ruhani, the first Bahai executed since 1992 (Bahman Samandari). The United States condemned the execution. In February 2000, Iran's Supreme Court set aside the death sentences against three Bahais, Sirus Zabihi-Moqaddam, Hedayat KashefiNajafabadi, and Manucher Khulusi. On April 21, 1999, the Clinton Administration expressed concern about the sentencing to prison of four Baha'is. Recent resolutions condemning Iran's treatment of the Baha'is, including S.Con.Res. 57, which passed the Senate July 19, 2000, and H.Con.Res. 257, which passed the House on September 19, 2000. Trial of 13 Jews. Although the 30,000 member Jewish community (the largest in the Middle East aside from Israel) enjoys more freedoms than Jewish communities in several other Muslim states, during 1993-1998 Iran executed five Jews allegedly spying for Israel. In June 1999, Iran confirmed that it had arrested 13 Jews -- teachers, shopkeepers, and butchers -- from the Shiraz area that it said were part of an ""espionage ring"" for Israel. After an April - June 2000 trial in which eight of the suspects ""confessed"" to the allegations, ten of the Jews and two Muslims accomplices were convicted (July 1, 2000) and received sentences ranging from 4 years to 13 years. Three Jews were acquitted. On September 21, 2000, a three-judge appeals panel reduced the sentences slightly, now ranging from 2 to 9 years. On February 8, 2001, Iran's Supreme Court let the revised sentences stand. In March 2001, Iran released one of the Jews on the grounds that his sentence included time served; another was released on January 16, 2002. Three more were given early release in late October 2002. Several bills in the 106th Congress called for the release of the detainees and for linking U.S. relations with Iran to the trial's outcome; the Senate passed S.Con.Res. 39 (June 23, 1999) and S.Con.Res. 109 (May 4, 2000). In April 2001, a similar bill, H.Con.Res. 29, was introduced in the 107th Congress.  CRS-7   IB93033  11-26-02  U.S. Policy and Sanctions The February 11, 1979 fall of the Shah of Iran, a key U.S. ally, opened a long rift in U.S.-Iranian relations. On November 4, 1979, radical ""students"" seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held its diplomats hostage until minutes after President Reagan's inauguration on January 20, 1981. The United States broke relations with Iran on April 7, 1980, and the two countries have had no official dialogue since. The exception was the abortive 1985-86 clandestine arms supply relationship with Iran in exchange for some American hostages held by Hizballah in Lebanon (the so-called ""Iran-Contra Affair""). Iran maintains an interests section in Washington (Embassy of Pakistan), staffed by Iranian permanent resident aliens or U.S. citizens of Iranian descent. The U.S. protecting power in Iran is Switzerland. Upon taking office in 1993, the Clinton Administration moved to further isolate Iran as part of a strategy of ""dual containment"" of Iran and Iraq. In 1995 and 1996, the Clinton Administration and Congress added sanctions on Iran in response to growing concerns about Iran's weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons acquisition programs, its support for terrorist groups, and its efforts to subvert the Arab-Israeli peace process. The election of Khatemi in May 1997 precipitated a shift in U.S. policy more toward engagement. The Administration offered Iran official dialogue, with no substantive preconditions. In January 1998, Khatemi publicly agreed to increase ""people-to-people"" exchanges with the United States, ruling out official dialogue. In a June 17, 1998 speech, then Secretary of State Albright stepped up the U.S. outreach effort by calling for mutual confidence building measures that could lead to a ""road map"" for normalization of relations. Encouraged by the reformist victory in Iran's March 2000 parliamentary elections, Secretary Albright gave another speech on March 17, 2000, acknowledging past U.S. meddling in Iran, easing sanctions on some Iranian imports, and promising to work to resolve outstanding claims disputes. Iran welcomed the steps, but called them insufficient to warrant the beginning of a dialogue. In early September 2000 meetings at the United Nations in connection with the Millennium Summit, Secretary Albright and President Clinton sent a positive signal to Iran by attending Khatemi's speeches. Until early 2002, the Bush Administration appeared to be continuing the Clinton Administration efforts, in part by building on the cooperation between the two countries in Afghanistan. The Administration's November 13, 2001 continuation of the 1979 national emergency on Iran justified the emergency by saying that U.S. ""relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal,"" a far softer statement than previous justifications sighting a continued threat from Iran. Following a move by some Majlis deputies to call for reestablishing relations with the United States, on October 30, 2001, Supreme Leader Khamene'i threatened to fire any Iranian official who seeks to forge relations with the United States. His statement came a few weeks after several Members of Congress had dinner in the Senate with Iran's U.N. representative. The thaw in relations, which appeared to accelerate in the context of cooperation in the Afghanistan crisis, appears to have reversed since January 2002. Allegations of Iran's sale of arms to the Palestinian Authority and reputed meddling in Afghanistan have caused the Administration and Congress to become more critical of Iran's intentions and actions. As noted above, President Bush named Iran as part of an ""axis of evil"" in his State of the Union message. On July 12, 2002, President Bush issued a statement supporting those Iranians CRS-8   IB93033  11-26-02  demonstrating for reform and democracy. The statement signaled a shift in U.S. policy from attempting to engage and support Khatemi and his faction to publicly supporting Iranian reformers and activists. This view, based on the conclusion that engaging Khatemi would not produce more moderate Iranian policies on key issues, was mirrored in Congress during 2002 when several Members called for U.S. efforts to promote civil society in Iran. Two resolutions introduced in late July (S.Res. 306 and H.Res. 504) called for positive U.S. gestures toward ""the people of Iran, and not political figures whose survival depends upon preservation of the current regime."" Some interpreted the U.S. shift as a move toward a policy of regime change for Iran. On the other hand, there have been reports in November 2002 that the United States is again reaching out to Iran, in this case for cooperation against Iraq's Saddam Hussein.  Economic Sanctions Since the November 4, 1979 seizure of the U.S. hostages in Tehran, economic sanctions have formed a major part of U.S. policy toward Iran. On November 14, 1979, President Carter declared a national emergency with respect to Iran, renewed every year since 1979. Terrorism/Foreign Aid. Following the October 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Lebanon, believed perpetrated by Iranian allies, Iran was added to the ""terrorism list"" in January 1984. The designation bans direct U.S. financial assistance and arms sales, restricts sales of U.S. dual use items, and requires the United States to oppose multilateral lending to the designated countries. Separate from its position on the terrorism list, successive foreign aid appropriations laws since the late 1980s ban direct assistance to Iran (loans, credits, insurance, Eximbank credits) and indirect assistance (U.S. contributions to international organizations that work in Iran). Section 307 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (added in 1985) names Iran as unable to benefit from U.S. contributions to international organizations, requiring proportionate cuts if these institutions work in Iran. Iran is also barred from sales of U.S. munitions list items because it has been designated every year since 1997 as not cooperating with U.S. anti-terrorism efforts, under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (P.L. 104-132). That Act also penalizes countries that assist or sell arms to terrorism list countries, and another law (the Defense Department Authorization Act of 1987) limits Defense Department contracts with companies controlled by terrorism list states ($100,000 contract limit). U.S. regulations do not bar disaster relief and the United States donated $125,000, through relief agencies, to help victims of two earthquakes in Iran (February and May 1997), and another $350,000 worth of aid to the victims of a June 22, 2002 earthquake. Proliferation Sanctions. Several sanctions laws are unique to Iran. The Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act (P.L. 102-484) requires denial of license applications for exports to Iran of dual use items, and imposes sanctions on foreign countries that transfer to Iran ""destabilizing numbers and types of conventional weapons,"" as well as WMD technology. The Iran Nonproliferation Act (P.L. 106-178) authorizes sanctions on foreign entities that assist Iran's WMD programs. It bans U.S. extraordinary payments to the Russian Aviation and Space Agency in connection with the international space station unless the President can certify that the agency or entities under the Agency's control had not transferred any WMD or missile-related technology to Iran within the year prior. The provision contains certain exceptions to ensure the safety of astronauts who will use the space station and for certain space station hardware. During 2001 and 2002, a number of entities in North Korea, China, CRS-9   IB93033  11-26-02  India, Armenia, and Moldova have been sanctioned under the Iran Nonproliferation Act, the Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-484), and another law, the Chemical and Biological Warfare Elimination Act of 1991, for sales to Iran. Counternarcotics. In February 1987, Iran was first designated as a state that failed to cooperate with U.S. anti-drug efforts or take adequate steps to control narcotics production or trafficking. U.S. and U.N. Drug Control Program (UNDCP) assessments of drug production in Iran prompted the Clinton Administration, on December 7, 1998, to remove Iran from the U.S. list of major drug producing countries. The decision exempts Iran from the annual certification process that kept drug-related U.S. sanctions in place on Iran. Britain reportedly has sold Iran small arms for its anti-drug efforts on the Afghan border. Trade Ban. On May 6, 1995, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12959 banning U.S. trade and investment in Iran, including the trading of Iranian oil overseas by U.S. companies. This followed an earlier March 1995 executive order barring U.S. investment in Iran's energy sector, and, although modified, has been extended each year since. On March 13, 2001, President Bush renewed the declaration of a state of emergency that triggered the March 1995 investment ban. An August 1997 amendment to the trade ban (Executive Order 13059) prevented U.S. companies from knowingly exporting goods to a third country for incorporation into products destined for Iran. The trade ban was partly intended to blunt criticism that U.S. trade with Iran made U.S. appeals for multilateral containment of Iran less credible. Some goods related to the safe operation of civilian aircraft can be licensed for export to Iran, and in December 1999, the Clinton Administration allowed the repair of engine mountings on seven Iran Air 747's (Boeing). Implementing regulations do not permit U.S. firms to negotiate investment deals with Iran. Following a 1998 application by a U.S. firm to sell Iran agricultural products, and in the context of Clinton Administration and congressional reviews of U.S. unilateral sanctions policies, the Clinton Administration announced in April 1999 that it would license, on a case-by-case basis, commercial sales of food and medical products to certain countries on which unilateral U.S. trade bans are in place (Iran, Libya, and Sudan). Under regulations issued in July 1999, private letters of credit can be used to finance approved sales, but no U.S. government credit guarantees were made available and U.S. exporters were not permitted to deal directly with Iranian banks. Iran says the lack of credit makes U.S. sales, particularly of wheat, uncompetitive. The FY2001 agriculture appropriations (P.L. 106-387), contains a provision banning the use of official credit guarantees for food and medical sales to Iran and other countries on the U.S. terrorism list, except Cuba, although allowing for a presidential waiver to permit such credit guarantees. (In the 107th Congress, S.171, introduced January 24, 2001, would repeal this provision.) The Clinton Administration did not provide credit guarantees, and the Bush Administration has not done so either. In her March 17, 2000 speech, then Secretary Albright announced an easing of the trade ban to allow U.S. importation of Iranian nuts, dried fruits, carpets, and caviar; regulations governing the imports were issued in April 2000. The United States was the largest market for Iranian carpets before the 1979 revolution, although U.S. anti-dumping tariffs imposed on Iranian pistachio nut imports since 1986 (over 300%, although the Commerce Department is expected to lower this tariff in the near future) are dampening imports of that product. Iranian caviar and carpets are now sold in the United States; the Iranian carpet market could eventually reach an estimated $100 million per year. CRS-10   IB93033  11-26-02  The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA). The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA, H.R. 3107, P.L. 104-172, signed August 5, 1996), a law that sanctions foreign investment in Iran or Libya's energy sector, was to expire on August 5, 2001. H.R. 1954, which renewed ILSA for five years but requires an Administration report on its effectiveness within 24-30 months, was passed by large majorities in both chambers in July 2001. It was signed on August 3, 2001 (P.L. 107-24). In testimony before the House International Relations Committee on June 20, 2002, a senior State Department official said that the Bush Administration probably would waive sanctions on European companies that invest in Iran, in exchange for European assistance in curbing Iran's WMD programs and terrorism. The statement was a response to calls in Congress (H.Res.434) to sanction Canadian oil company Sheer Energy, which, in May 2002, announced an $80 million contract to develop an Iranian oil field. On October 28, 2002, Norway's Statoil signed an agreement to invest $300 million to develop phases six, seven, and eight or Iran's South Pars gas field. See CRS Report RS20871, The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA). Caspian/Central Asian Energy Routes Through Iran. The U.S. trade ban permits U.S. companies to apply for licenses to conduct ""swaps"" of Caspian Sea oil with Iran, but, as part of a U.S. policy to route Central Asian energy around Iran (and Russia), a Mobil Corporation application to do so was denied in April 1999. The Administration continues to oppose, and to threaten imposing ILSA sanctions on, pipeline projects that route Caspian/Central Asian energy through Iran. U.S. policy has been to strongly favor construction of a pipeline that would cross the Caspian Sea and let out in Ceyhan, Turkey (Baku-Ceyhan pipeline), avoiding Iran or Russia. Four Caspian nations (Turkey, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan) signed an agreement embracing Baku-Ceyhan on November 18, 1999, and regional and corporate support for the project has gained momentum to the point where pipeline construction is expected to begin in earnest soon. Kazakhstan nonetheless is pushing for construction of an oil pipeline across Iran. Despite U.S. pressure not to import Iranian gas, in December 2001 Turkey began doing so through a new crossborder pipeline, under an August 1996 agreement. (See CRS Report 98-86, Iran: Relations With Key Central Asian States.) Europe and Japan's Relations With/Lending to Iran. U .S.-allied differences on Iran narrowed since 1998 in concert with the Clinton Administration's attempt to engage Iran, a policy consistently favored by the European countries as a way to moderate Iran's behavior. During 1992-1997, the European Union (EU) countries maintained a policy of ""critical dialogue"" with Iran. The United States did not oppose those talks but maintained that the EU's dialogue would not change Iranian behavior. The dialogue was suspended immediately following the April 1997 German terrorism trial that found high-level Iranian involvement in assassinating Iranian dissidents in Germany. Alongside the post-1997 U.S. shift toward engagement, the EU-Iran dialogue formally resumed in May 1998. Since then, Khatemi has undertaken state visits to several Western countries, including Italy (March 1999), France (October 1999), Germany (July 2000), and Japan (November 2000). The United States publicly welcomed these visits. In early September 2001, Iran and the EU met to discuss a possible trade pact that would lower the tariffs or increase quotas for Iranian exports to the EU countries, and the EU decided in mid-June 2002 to move toward formal negotiations on that pact. Another round of talks took place September 10, 2002. The resolution of the ""Rushdie affair"" to Britain's satisfaction sparked improvement in its relations with Iran. Iran maintains that Ayatollah Khomeini's 1989 death sentence against CRS-11   IB93033  11-26-02  author Salman Rushdie cannot be revoked (his ""Satanic Verses"" novel was labeled blasphemous) because Khomeini is no longer alive to revoke it. However, on September 24, 1998, Iran's Foreign Minister pledged to Britain that Iran will not seek to implement the sentence and opposes any bounties offered for his death. Britain then upgraded relations with Iran to the ambassadorial level, and Foreign Ministers of the two countries have exchanged several visits. In October 2000, Britain began extending longer term credit (two years or greater) for exports to Iran. Some Iranian clerics (outside the formal government structure) have said the death sentence stands, and the Iranian government has not required the Fifteen Khordad foundation to withdraw its $2.8 million reward for Rushdie's death. Khatemi said on June 4, 2001 that he considers the issue closed. In August 1999, Japan continued a gradual improvement in relations with Iran by announcing a resumption of Japan's official development lending program for Iran to construct a hydroelectric dam over the Karun River. However, the $70 million increment announced was less that Iran had wanted, and Japan said that this tranche would close out Japan's involvement in the project. (In 1993, Japan provided the first $400 million tranche of the overall $1.4 billion official development loan program, but the lending was subsequently placed on hold as the United States sought to persuade its allies to pressure Iran.) In late January 2000, Japan agreed to resume medium- and long-term export credit insurance for exports to Iran, suspended since 1994. Economic relations improved further during Khatemi's November 2000 visit to Tokyo, which resulted in Iran's granting Japanese firms the first right to negotiate to develop the large Azadegan field, and Iran and a Japaneseled consortium are moving forward with preliminary studies of the field. Some press reports suggest that Royal Dutch/Shell might join the Azadegan project, apparently because it can provide needed technology. In exchange, Japan agreed to prepay Iran $1 billion per year for the next 3 years for Iranian oil. Partly at U.S. urging, Japan refused to extend to Iran additional official loans. During 1994-1995, and over U.S. objections at the time, Iran's European and Japanese creditors rescheduled about $16 billion in Iranian debt. These countries (governments and private creditors) rescheduled the debt bilaterally, in spite of Paris Club rules that call for multilateral rescheduling and International Monetary Fund (IMF) involvement. Iran has worked its external debt down from $32 billion in 1997 to about $20 billion as of March 2002, according to Iran's Central Bank. The improved debt picture has led most European export credit agencies, including Germany's Hermes, France's COFACE, and that of Spain, to restore insurance cover for exports to Iran. In July 2002, Iran tapped international capital markets for the first time since the Islamic revolution, selling $500 million in bonds to European banks. At the urging of the U.S. government, in May 2002 Moody's stopped its credit ratings service for Iran's government bonds on the grounds that performing the credit ratings service might violate the U.S. trade ban. Multilateral Lending to Iran. Section 1621 of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-132) amended the Foreign Assistance Act to require the United States to vote against international loans to countries on the U.S. terrorism list. Acting under provisions of successive foreign aid laws, in 1993 the United States voted its 16.5% share of the World Bank against loans to Iran of $460 million for electricity, health, and irrigation projects. To signal opposition to international lending to Iran, the FY1994 foreign aid appropriations act (P.L. 103-87) cut the Administration's request for the U.S. contribution to the World Bank by the amount of those loans. That law, the FY1995 foreign CRS-12   IB93033  11-26-02  aid appropriation (P.L. 103-326), and the FY1996 foreign aid appropriations (P.L. 104-107), would have significantly reduced U.S. payments to the Bank if it had provided new loans to Iran. By 1999, Iran's moderating image had led the World Bank to consider new loans. In May 2000, the United States was unsuccessful in obtaining further delay on a vote on new lending for Iran, and its allies outvoted the United States to approve $232 million in loans for health and sewage projects. Twenty one of the Bank's twenty four governors voted in favor, and France and Canada abstained. Earlier, Iran also had asked the International Monetary Fund for about $400 million in loans (its quota is about $2 billion) to help it deal with its trade financing shortfalls. However, Iran balked at accepting IMF conditionality, and there was no agreement. Despite the required U.S. opposition, on May 10, 2001, the World Bank's executive directors voted to approve a two-year economic reform plan for Iran that envisions $775 million in new Bank loans. In May 2003, the Bank will consider a $112 million loan to Iran for low- and middle-income housing. WTO. The Bush Administration said in 2001 that U.S. opposition to Iran's membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) was ""under review,"" but there have been no recent indications in 2002 that the United States will drop that opposition. On several occasions since mid-2001, the WTO, at U.S. urging, postponed a discussion on whether to launch entry talks with Iran. Travel Sanctions. Use of U.S. passports for travel to Iran is permitted, but a State Department travel warning, softened somewhat in April 1998, asks that Americans ""defer"" travel to Iran. Iranians entering the United States are required to be fingerprinted, although the Clinton Administration had promised to eliminate the practice for Iranian visitors. Assets Disputes/Victims of Terrorism. Iran claims that the United States has frozen vast amounts of Iranian assets, presenting an obstacle to improved relations. A U.S.Iran Claims Tribunal, at the Hague, is arbitrating cases resulting from the break in relations following the Iranian revolution. The major cases yet to be decided center on hundreds of Foreign Military Sales cases between the United States and the Shah's regime, which Iran claims it paid for but were unfulfilled. About $400 million in proceeds from the resale of that equipment is in a DOD account. In April 2000, then Secretary Albright named a representative to negotiate a resolution of the claims issue at the Hague. The assets issue moved to the forefront following several U.S. court judgements against Iran for past acts of terrorism against Americans, filed under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. Since March 1998, U.S. courts have awarded the following: $247 million to the family of Alisa Flatow, killed in Israel in April 1995 in a bombing by Palestinian Islamic Jihad (awarded in March 1998); $65 million to three Americans held hostage in Lebanon - David Jacobsen, Joseph Cicippio, and Frank Reed (August 1998); $324 for Lebanon hostage Terry Anderson (March 2000); $327 million to the families of two Americans killed in a February 1996 Hamas bombing (July 2000); and $355 million to the family of Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, killed by Hizballah in 1989 (September 2000). Former Lebanon hostage Thomas Sutherland won a $353 million judgement against Iran on June 26, 2001.  CRS-13   IB93033  11-26-02  In August 2001, the family of former Lebanon hostage father Lawrence Jenco won a $314.6 million judgment against Iran for his captivity. In June 2001, former hostages Benjamin Weir and Frank Regier sued Iran for over $100 million for their captivity in Lebanon. Also in early June 2001, the family of former hostage Peter Kilburn, who was killed in the course of his captivity in Lebanon, filed a suit against both Libya and Iran for more than $200 million. In October 2001, victims of the October 1982 Hizballah bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut filed a $5 billion suit against Iran. On January 23, 2002, a federal judge ordered Iran to pay $42 million to the family of Charles Hegna, who was beaten in the course of a 1984 Hizballah hijacking of Kuwait Air 221. On February 6, 2002, a federal judge awarded $56 million to the family of Ira Weinstein, killed in a 1996 Hamas bus bombing in Israel. On the basis of the sanctity of diplomatic property, the Clinton Administration blocked efforts by the claimants to satisfy their judgments from frozen Iranian assets  diplomatic property in Washington (worth about $22 million) or the DOD account mentioned above. In December 1999, the Clinton Administration also blocked a Flatow effort to seize a $6 million U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal judgement awarded to Iran. A provision of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (H.R. 3244, P.L. 106-386) provides for the use of general revenues to pay 110% of compensatory damage awards to the above and future successful claimants in a total not to exceed the rental proceeds from Iran's diplomatic property and the DOD account. (The tenant of the Iranian Embassy building was evicted for non-payment of rent in March 2002, with rent of about $750,000 overdue.) The provision requires the President to try to recoup the expended funds from Iran as part of an overall reconciliation in relations and assets settlement, although there is no requirement that funds ultimately be withheld from Iran. A provision of the FY2002 Commerce, Justice, State appropriation (P.L. 107-77) requires an Administration legislative proposal on how to compensate successful U.S. claimants in future terrorism-related judgments against Iran. In April 2002, a federal judge ruled that Iran, under the Algiers Accords, had immunity from a lawsuit by the 52 Americans held hostage by Iran for 444 days. With regard to the 52 American hostages, the conference report on the FY2002 defense appropriation (P.L. 107-117, H.Rept.107-350) states that the hostages should be able to collect damages from Iranian assets, notwithstanding U.S.-Iran agreements on the disposition of Iran's assets. Regarding the mistaken U.S. shootdown on July 3,1988 of an Iranian Airbus passenger jet, on February 22, 1996, the United States, responding to an Iranian case before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), agreed to pay Iran up to $61.8 million in compensation ($300,000 per wage earning victim, $150,000 per non wage earner) for the 248 Iranians killed in the shootdown. The funds for this settlement came from a general appropriation for judgments against the United States. The United States previously paid $3 million in death benefits for 47 non-Iranians killed in the attack, but has not compensated Iran for the airplane itself. A different case, pending before the ICJ, involves an Iranian claim for damages to Iranian oil platforms during U.S. naval clashes with Iran in October 1987 and April 1988.  Military Containment U.S. policy has focused on containing the military threat posed by Iran to the United States, U.S. allies in the Persian Gulf, and international shipping. Although containing Iraq CRS-14   IB93033  11-26-02  has been the primary goal of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf region since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, U.S. military officials note that U.S. forces could potentially be used against Iran, if the President so decides. U.S. military officers note that their encounters with Iranian naval vessels in the Gulf have been more professional since Khatemi took office.  Iran's Opposition Movements It is not official U.S. policy to change Iran's regime, and the United States does not fund Iranian opposition movements. In 1995, the Clinton Administration accepted a House-Senate conference agreement to include $18-$20 million in funding authority for covert operations against Iran in the FY1996 intelligence authorization act (H.R. 1655, P.L. 104-93) -- about $14 million more than requested -- according to a Washington Post report of December 22, 1995. The Clinton Administration reportedly focused the covert aid on changing the regime's behavior, rather than its overthrow. The conference report on H.R. 2267 (H.Rept. 105-405), the FY1998 Commerce/State/ Justice appropriation, provided $4 million for a ""Radio Free Iran,"" to be run by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). The radio, which the Administration is calling the Farsi service of RFE/RL, began operations in Prague on October 31, 1998. Another $4 million for the radio for FY1999 was provided by the omnibus appropriation (H.R. 4328, P.L. 105-277). (See CRS Report 98-539, Radio Free Iraq and Radio Free Iran: Background, Legislation, and Policy Issues for Congress.) Since the late 1980s, the State Department has refused contact with the anti-regime People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI) and its umbrella organization, the National Council of Resistance (NCR). It was designated as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO) in October 1997 under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. In November 2002, a letter signed by about 150 House Members was released, asking the President to remove the PMOI from the FTO list. For further information on this group, see CRS Report RL31119, Terrorism: Near Eastern Groups and State Sponsors, 2002. Some Iranian exiles follow the son of the late former Shah, who lives in the United States. On January 24, 2001, the Shah's son, Reza Pahlavi, 40 years old, ended a long period of inactivity by giving a speech in Washington calling for unity in opposition to the current regime and for the institution of a constitutional monarchy and genuine democracy in Iran. He has since broadcast messages into Iran from a station in California, and press reports say a growing number of Iranians are listening to his broadcasts.  CRS-15"

Iran's human rights practices, particularly its treatment of the Baha'i and the Jewish communities, are also a major concern. The Bush Administration has identified Iran's modernization of its conventional forces as a potential threat to U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf, but others argue that the buildup has been minor and that Iran still is relatively poorly equipped. Although the Bush Administration says it is still willing to hold a dialogue with Iran, the focus of current U.S. policy appears to be a return to the containment policy that prevailed during the early part of the Clinton Administration. During the first term of the Clinton Administration, as part of a policy of ""dual containment"" of Iran and Iraq, President Clinton imposed a ban on U.S. trade and investment in Iran in 1995, and a 1996 law imposed sanctions on foreign investment in Iran's energy sector (Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, ILSA). In keeping with a 1997 policy shift toward engagement, the Clinton Administration and Congress later eased sanctions to allow U.S. exports to Iran of food and medical supplies and importation from Iran of goods such as carpets and caviar. The United States has consistently worked with its allies to prevent arms and advanced technology sales to Iran and to limit Iran's influence over regional energy flows. U.S. purchases of Iranian crude oil and U.S. company investments in Iran remain barred. ILSA was renewed for another 5 years on August 3, 2001 (H.R. 1954, P.L. 107-24).  Even before Iran's tacit cooperation with post-September 11 U.S. efforts to defeat Afghanistan's Taliban regime, signs of moderation in Iran had stimulated the United States to try to engage Iran in official talks. Iran, still split between conservatives and reformers loyal to President Mohammad Khatemi did not accept. By early 2002, reports of Iran's continued support to antiMiddle East peace process groups such as Hizballah had reversed the warming trend. Iran was grouped with North Korea and Iraq as part of the ""axis of evil"" identified in President Bush's January 29, 2002 State of the Union message. The United States said subsequently it supports reform-minded Iranians who want democracy, an apparent shift from the stance of attempting to engage Khatemi's government. President Bush has identified Iran's efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction and delivery means, coupled with its support of terrorist groups, as key U.S. concerns. Iran's ballistic missile program has made major strides over the past few years, with the help of several foreign suppliers, and its nuclear program has made significant strides recently that have drawn statements of U.S. concern. Iran has opposed the U.S.-led Middle East peace process since its inception in October 1991. It continues to provide material support to Hizballah in Lebanon and to Palestinian groups that oppose the Arab-Israeli peace process, such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Some Al Qaeda activists are reportedly in Iran as well, although their relationship with the regime, if any, is unclear. All Iranian factions have publicly supported  Congressional Research Service  ~ The Library of Congress   IB93033  03-13-03  M  OST  RECENT DEVELOP  MENTS  In July 2002, the Administration articulated a shift in policy: supporting Iranians who want reform and democracy, rather than seeking to support Khatemi and his faction. In December 2002, U.S. officials said that Iran is building two previously unknown nuclear sites at Arak and Natanz, which could be used in a nuclear weapons program. A visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency to the Natanz facility on February 21 found that the facility contained a more advanced uranium enrichment program than was expected.  BACKGROUND  AND  ANAL  YSIS  A power struggle in Iran between revolutionary purists and more moderate reformists colors Iran's domestic and foreign policies. Since February 2002 testimony, DCI George Tenet has been saying that Iran's reform movement was ""losing momentum"" to the ""unelected"" hardliners. Since mid-2002, President Mohammad Khatemi has become more vocal in criticizing obstructions by hardliners, and in late August 2002, he proposed new legislation that would strengthen the power of his office; it was passed by the Majlis but still pending before the legislative review body called the Council of Guardians. Khatemi, who was re-elected on June 8, 2001 by a landslide 77% of the vote against nine more conservative candidates, holds a popular mandate for greater domestic freedoms. His reelection victory was larger than his 69% first win in May 1997. His supporters hold about 70% of the seats in the 290-seat Majlis (parliament) following victories in the February 18, 2000 Majlis elections. However, Khatemi's reform program has been largely obstructed by hardliners, including Supreme Leader Ali Khamene'i (successor to Ayatollah Khomeini), who control key revolutionary institutions such as the Council of Guardians. Since April 2000, hardliners in the judiciary have closed more than 60 reformist newspapers and imprisoned or questioned several editors and even some members of the Majlis. About 225,000 candidates nationwide have registered to run for the 170,000 seats on city and town council elections to be held February 28, 2003. Applications are well below the 330,000 candidates that ran in the local elections four years ago, possibly suggesting some frustration that the reformers have not made much progress in that time. In November 2002, a popular history professor and ally of Khatemi, Hashem Aghajari, was convicted by a local (Hamadan) court of apostasy and sentenced to death, prompting several days of student demonstrations and some clashes with hardline security enforcers. Khamene'i ordered the sentence reviewed, and Iran's Supreme Court revoked the sentence in February 2003. Khatemi suffered a political setback in February 28 local elections, with hardliners winning most of the seats in Tehran in a low turnout (14% in Tehran) election that suggested reformist disillusionment at the slow pace of reform thus far.  CRS-1   IB93033  03-13-03  Iran's Strategic Buildup Iran is not considered a major conventional threat to the United States, but some of its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, are making significant progress and could put U.S. allies and forces at risk.  Conventional Weapons Iran's armed forces total about 550,000 personnel, including both the regular military and the Revolutionary Guard, the latter of which is loyal to the hardliners. According to U.S. military officials, Iran's forces could block the Strait of Hormuz at least temporarily, but Iran is largely lacking in ability to project power far beyond its borders. See CRS Report RL31529, Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations, 1994-2001.  Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) It is partly because of Iran's attempts to acquire WMD that January 29, 2002 State of the Union message, labeled Iran part of with Iraq and North Korea. Iran's programs continue to be assisted Russia, China, and North Korea. For further information, see CRS Arms and Weapons of Mass Destruction Suppliers. President Bush, in his an ""axis of evil"" along primarily by entities in Report RL30551, Iran:  Chemical and Biological Weapons. Official U.S. reports state that Iran is seeking to acquire a self-sufficient chemical weapons infrastructure, that it may have some capability for biological weapons deployment, and that it has stockpiled chemical weapons, including blister, blood, and choking agents. This record raises questions about Iran's compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which Iran signed on January 13, 1993, and ratified on June 8, 1997. Missiles. Largely with Russian help, Iran is making progress in its missile program. Two of its first three tests of the 800-mile range Shahab-3 (July 1998, July 2000, and September 2000) were either inconclusive or unsuccessful (the July 2000 test appears to have been a success), but Iran conducted an apparently successful test in late May 2002, and the Defense Department now assesses the missile as operational. Iran might have produced 10 20 of them, according to press reports. Iran is also trying to make a 1,200 mile range Shahab-4, but U.S. officials told journalists in late October 2002 that an Iranian test of an extended-range Shahab had failed. In March 2002, an intelligence community official upgraded the missile threat from Iran, testifying that the United States would ""most likely"" face an intercontinental ballistic missile threat from Iran by 2015. On September 6, 2002, Iran said it successfully tested a 200 mile range ""Fateh 110"" missile, and Iran said in late September 2002 that it has begun production of the missile. Nuclear Program. There are growing concerns about the scope of Iran's nuclear program, despite Iran's occasional voluntary revelations about its facilities. Russia, despite U.S. concerns and protests, is proceeding with its January 1995 contract with Iran to complete a nuclear power plant at Bushehr, and the two countries agreed in December 2002 to have the plant operational by the end of 2003. Russia says that it has reached agreement with Iran to supply fuel for the reactor for ten years and for Russia to reprocess the plant's CRS-2   IB93033  03-13-03  spent nuclear material. In response to allegations by Iran's exiled opposition, Iran acknowledged in December 2002 that it is building two additional facilities, at Arak and Natanz, that could be used for a nuclear weapons program. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) director Mohammad Baradei visited the Natanz site on February 21, 2003, and said that it was a more advanced uranium enrichment facility than was expected. It could produce enriched uranium by 2005. The Arak facility reportedly is a heavy water reactor that could be used to produce plutonium. Khatemi also announced before the visit that Iran is mining its own uranium. The Bush Administration said the sites indicate Iran is planning to try to acquire a nuclear weapon, despite Iran's assertion that the sites are for electricity generation purposes only, and the revelations mean Iran might produce a nuclear weapon sooner than the 8 to 10 years previously thought. During the IAEA visit, Iran refused the IAEA's urging that it sign the ""Additional Protocol"" to the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty, which would allow no notice inspections, but it did pledge to inform the IAEA in advance of constructing any new nuclear facilities.  Iranian Foreign Policy and Involvement in Terrorism Iran's continued support for terrorism contributed to President Bush's strong criticism of Iran in his State of the Union message. The State Department report on international terrorism for 2001, released May 21, 2002, again stated, as it has for most of the past decade, that Iran ""remained the most active state sponsor of terrorism in 2001,"" although the report attributes the terrorist activity to two hardline institutions -- the Revolutionary Guard and the Intelligence Ministry. On the other hand, Iran strongly condemned the September 11 attacks and tacitly supported the U.S. war on the Taliban and Al Qaeda. (See also CRS Report RL31119, Terrorism: Near Eastern Groups and State Sponsors, 2002.)  Persian Gulf Khatemi has largely succeeded in improving relations with Iran's neighbors, particularly the six states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC; Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates). Since he came into office, Iran has reduced support for Shiite Muslim dissident movements in the Gulf states. In early October 2002, Iran and Kuwait signed a defense and intelligence cooperation agreement. See also CRS Report RL31533, Persian Gulf: Issues for U.S. Policy, 2003. Saudi Arabia/Khobar Towers. Iran and Saudi Arabia restored relations in December 1991 (after a 4 year break), and progressively higher level contacts have taken place since December 1997. In May 1999, Khatemi became the first senior Iranian leader to visit Saudi Arabia since the Islamic revolution; he visited again on September 11, 2002, to discuss possible U.S.-Iraq war. Supreme Leader Khamene'i has been invited to visit the Kingdom as well but has not yet done so. In mid-April 2001, Saudi Arabia and Iran formally entered into an anti-crime security pact, suggesting that Saudi Arabia wishes to bury the issue of the June 25, 1996 Khobar Towers housing complex bombing, which killed 19 U.S. airmen. On June 21, 2001, a federal grand jury indicted 14 suspects, 13 Saudis and a Lebanese citizen, for the Khobar bombing. The indictment indicated that Iranian agents were likely involved, but no indictments of any Iranians were announced. In June 2002,  CRS-3   IB93033  03-13-03  Saudi Arabia reportedly sentenced some of the eleven Saudi suspects held there. (See CRS Issue Brief IB93113, Saudi Arabia: Postwar Issues and U.S. Relations.) Gulf Islands Dispute With UAE. Relations between Iran and the UAE became acrimonious in April 1992, when Iran asserted complete control of the Persian Gulf island of Abu Musa, which it and the UAE shared under a 1971 bilateral agreement. (In 1971, Iran, then ruled by the U.S.-backed Shah, completely seized two other islands, Greater and Lesser Tunb, from the emirate of Ras al-Khaymah, which later became part of the UAE. It seized part of Abu Musa from the emirate of Sharjah.) The UAE wants to refer the dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), but Iran insists on resolving the issue bilaterally. Several GCC states have attempted to mediate in recent years and Iran-UAE tensions have eased somewhat, but Iran insists that it has sovereignty over the islands. The United States, which is concerned about Iran's military improvements to the islands, generally supports UAE proposals but takes no position on sovereignty. Iraq. A legacy of the 8-year long Iran-Iraq war (September 1980 - August 1988) is deep lingering suspicion between Iran and Iraq. Some of Iran's actions suggest it is positioning itself to benefit politically in Iraq if the United States ousts Saddam Husayn. Iran, which fears potential encirclement by pro-U.S. regimes, publicly opposes a major U.S. military offensive against Iraq unless it is authorized by the United Nations. Iran has reportedly been offering the United States at least tacit backing if the United States attacks Iraq, perhaps hoping that Saddam's overthrow would put Tehran's proteges in power there. The Washington Post reported on February 8, 2003, that U.S. and Iranian diplomats had met in Europe to discuss tacit cooperation, at least on humanitarian and refugee issues, in the event of war against Iraq. One potential problem for the United States is that Iranian hardliners are politically close to Shiite militants in southern Iraq  the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI) and the Da'wa (Islamic Call) party  who are increasingly open about accepting U.S. backing for efforts to overthrow Iraq's regime but who publicly oppose a major U.S. role in post-war Iraq. A few hundred SCIRI fighters were reported to be moving into northern Iraq in March 2003, perhaps positioning themselves to help seize territory in the event of a U.S.-led offensive. Iran allowed the U.S.-backed Iraqi National Congress (INC), Iraq's main opposition umbrella, to open an office in Tehran in 2001, and it permitted opposition groups to go into northern Iraq in February 2003 to meet. Since early 1998, Iran and Iraq have exchanged significant numbers of prisoners from the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. An exchange of another several hundred prisoners was agreed to on March 13, 2003. An October 2000 visit to Iraq by Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi resulted in apparent agreement to abide by the waterway-sharing and other provisions of their 1975 Algiers Accords, which Iraq had abrogated prior to its September 1980 invasion of Iran. In exchange for a share of the proceeds, Iran's maritime authorities sometimes cooperate with Iraq's illicit export of oil products through the Gulf, although U.S. officials say Iran has been preventing the smuggling in recent months.  Middle East/North Africa Many of the allegations of Iran's support for terrorism center on its assistance to groups opposed to the Arab-Israeli peace process, primarily Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), CRS-4   IB93033  03-13-03  Hizballah, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. U.S. terrorism reports state that, following the start of the September 2000 Palestinian uprising, Iran increased its support for terrorism by encouraging coordination among Palestinian terrorist groups. Iran also incites anti-Israel violence, including hosting conferences of antipeace process organizations (April 24, 2001, and June 2-3, 2002). Khamene'i has continued to call Israel a ""cancerous tumor"" and make other statements suggesting that he seeks Israel's destruction. Khatemi, while publicly pledging support for the anti-peace process groups, has sometimes tried to moderate Iran's position somewhat. On October 15, 2002, the Iranian Foreign Ministry said Iran would not seek to block any final, two-state Israeli-Palestinian settlement. It was viewed as a new development when Israel and the United States asserted in early January 2002 that Iran was the source of a shipment, intercepted by Israel, of 50 tons of arms bought by the Palestinian Authority (PA). Iran has traditionally had few ties to the non-Islamist Palestinian organizations, including elements linked to the PA, that have conducted some of the day-to-day violence against Israel in the current uprising. Lebanon/Hizballah. About 150 Iranian Revolutionary Guards remain in Lebanon to coordinate Iranian arms deliveries to Hizballah, which are offloaded in Damascus and trucked into Lebanon. The shipments have included Stingers obtained by Iran in Afghanistan, mortars that can reach the Israeli city of Haifa if fired from southern Lebanon, and, in 2002, over 8,000 Katyusha rockets, according to press reports. In mid-April 2002, Foreign Minister Kharrazi visited Lebanon and urged Hizballah to exercise restraint on the Israeli-Lebanese border at a time of heightened tensions between Israel and the Palestinians. However, Hizballah is believed to take cues from harder line Iranian elements. On March 11, an Argentinian judge issued arrest warrants for four Iranian diplomats, including former Intelligence Minister Ali Fallahian, for alleged complicity in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, which killed 85. Hizballah is believed to have committed the act, as well as the 1992 bombing of Israel's embassy in that city. Sudan. Sudan's close relations with Iran in the early 1990s contributed to Sudan's placement on the U.S. ""terrorism list"" on August 18, 1993. However, Sudan's alliance with Iran frayed in the mid 1990s as Sudan sought to burnish its international image.  Central and South Asia/Azerbaijan/Former Yugoslavia Iran's policy in Central Asia has thus far emphasized economic cooperation over Islamic ideology, although Iran has become increasingly assertive in its relations with Azerbaijan. In early 1992, Iran led the drive to bring the Central Asian states and Azerbaijan into the Economic Cooperation Organization (founded in 1985 by Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey, as a successor to an organization founded by those states in 1964). Iran is hoping to attract energy pipeline routes through it, rather than through other countries. However, Iran does host at least one anti-Azerbaijan guerrilla leader (Hasan Javadov), and it allegedly harbors leaders of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), including founder Tahir Yuldashev. Tensions with Azerbaijan flared in late July 2001 over energy exploration rights in the Caspian; Iranian warships and combat aircraft threatened a British Petroleum (BP) ship on contract to Azerbaijan out of an area of the Caspian Iran considers its own. The United States called that action provocative, and it offered new border security aid and increased political support to Azerbaijan. Iran and Armenia, an adversary of Azerbaijan, agreed on expanded defense cooperation in early March 2002. Iran-Azerbaijan tensions eased CRS-5   IB93033  03-13-03  somewhat in conjunction with the mid-May 2002 visit of Azerbaijan's President Heydar Aliyev to Iran, although there was little evident progress on a bilateral division of their portions of the Caspian. Al Qaeda/Afghanistan/Pakistan. Iran long opposed the puritanical Sunni Muslim regime of the Taliban in Afghanistan on the grounds that it oppressed Shiite Muslim and other Persian-speaking minorities. Iran nearly launched a military attack against the Taliban in September 1998 after Taliban fighters captured and killed several Iranian diplomats based in northern Afghanistan, and it provided military aid to the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance coalition, made up of mostly Persian-speaking minority groups. Iran -- along with the United States, Russia, and the countries bordering Afghanistan -- attended U.N.-sponsored meetings in New York (the Six Plus Two group) to try to end the internal conflict in Afghanistan. Iran and the United States also participated in a U.N.-sponsored group in Geneva, which includes Italy and Germany. Iran tacitly supported the U.S.-led war on the Taliban and Al Qaeda, but some of Iran's subsequent activities in Afghanistan reflect official suspicion of the United States and the influence of hardliners in Iran's regime. Iran is said to fear the pro-U.S. tilt of the new government of Afghanistan and the waning of Iran's traditional sway in western, central, and northern Afghanistan where Persian-speaking Afghans predominate. There have been press reports and U.S. official statements since in January 2002 that hardliners in Iran are harboring, or at least not aggressively moving to arrest, senior Al Qaeda operatives who have fled Afghanistan (Sayf al-Adl and Abu Hafs the Mauritanian) as well as perhaps a few hundred Al Qaeda fighters that reportedly might include Osama bin Laden's son, Saad bin Laden. The United States reportedly has U.S. special operations forces in Afghanistan to areas near the Iranian border to hunt for Al Qaeda fighters. Reports in September 2002 said Iran is helping Al Qaeda transport some of its gold assets, which it is increasingly using instead of bank accounts. On the other hand, press reports say Iran has been arresting and extraditing Al Qaeda members to Saudi Arabia. Other reports say Iran is arming local Afghan strongmen including Herat governor Ismail Khan, Mazar-e-Sharif governor Abdul Rashid Dostam, and others, and President Bush has warned Iran not to seek to exert influence over the new government of Afghanistan. Apparently seeking to deflect the U.S. criticism, in March 2002 Iran reportedly expelled exiled Pashtun figure Gulbuddin Hikmatyar, an opponent of the new Afghan government. The expulsion followed a February 24, 2002 visit to Iran by Afghan leader Hamid Karzai; the two countries agreed to broad cooperation. (See CRS Report RL30588, Afghanistan: Current Issues and U.S. Policy Concerns.) Former Yugoslavia. On June 26, 1996, and again on May 5, 1997, President Clinton certified to Congress that Bosnia had expelled foreign forces and ended intelligence cooperation with Iran. The certifications were required by P.L. 104-122, an FY1996 supplemental appropriation, and P.L. 104-208, the FY1997 foreign aid appropriation, in order to provide U.S. aid to Bosnia.  CRS-6   IB93033  03-13-03  Human Rights Concerns U.S. and U.N. human rights reports cite Iran for widespread human rights abuses, (especially of the Baha'i faith), including assassinations and executions of regime opponents (Kurds, People's Mojahedin, and others) in Iran and abroad. These reports note that Khatemi's efforts to promote rule of law have met repeated challenges from hardliners. In April 2002, the U.N. Human Rights Commission narrowly voted not to investigate Iran's human rights record during 2002-2003. On January 30, 2003, Iran released the 80-year-old Ayatollah Montazeri, from house arrest; Montazeri was Khomeini's designated successor until being dismissed by Khomeini in 1989, and he later emerged as a critic of the postKhomeini leadership. The release came about a week after European Union parliamentarians criticized Iran for a reported rise in the number of public executions. In the 108th Congress, two resolutions (S.Res. 82 and H.Res. 140) were introduced on March 12, 2003, expressing concern about Iran's human rights practices, particularly its treatment of women. Religious Persecution. I n October 2001, the State Department again named Iran as a ""Country of Particular Concern,"" under the International Religious Freedom Act, and little progress in Iran's performance on this issue was noted in the October 2002 religious freedom report. No sanctions were added, on the grounds that Iran is already subject to extensive U.S. sanctions. Religious persecution continues, especially against the Baha'i community, because Iran's Shiite Muslim clergy views the sect as heretical. Two Baha'is (Dhabihullah Mahrami and Musa Talibi) were sentenced to death in 1996 for apostasy. On July 21, 1998, Iran executed Ruhollah Ruhani, the first Bahai executed since 1992 (Bahman Samandari). The United States condemned the execution. In February 2000, Iran's Supreme Court set aside the death sentences against three Bahais, Sirus Zabihi-Moqaddam, Hedayat Kashefi-Najafabadi, and Manucher Khulusi. On April 21, 1999, the Clinton Administration expressed concern about the sentencing to prison of four Baha'is. Recent resolutions condemning Iran's treatment of the Baha'is, including S.Con.Res. 57, which passed the Senate July 19, 2000, and H.Con.Res. 257, which passed the House on September 19, 2000. Trial of 13 Jews. Although the 30,000 member Jewish community (the largest in the Middle East aside from Israel) enjoys more freedoms than Jewish communities in several other Muslim states, during 1993-1998 Iran executed five Jews allegedly spying for Israel. In June 1999, Iran confirmed that it had arrested 13 Jews -- teachers, shopkeepers, and butchers -- from the Shiraz area that it said were part of an ""espionage ring"" for Israel. After an April - June 2000 trial in which eight of the suspects ""confessed"" to the allegations, ten of the Jews and two Muslims accomplices were convicted (July 1, 2000) and received sentences ranging from 4 years to 13 years. Three Jews were acquitted. On September 21, 2000, a three-judge appeals panel reduced the sentences slightly, now ranging from 2 to 9 years. On February 8, 2001, Iran's Supreme Court let the revised sentences stand. In March 2001, Iran released one of the Jews on the grounds that his sentence included time served; another was released on January 16, 2002. Three more were given early release in late October 2002. Several bills in the 106th Congress called for the release of the detainees and for linking U.S. relations with Iran to the trial's outcome; the Senate passed S.Con.Res. 39 (June 23, 1999) and S.Con.Res. 109 (May 4, 2000). In April 2001, a similar bill, H.Con.Res. 29, was introduced in the 107th Congress.  CRS-7   IB93033  03-13-03  U.S. Policy and Sanctions The February 11, 1979 fall of the Shah of Iran, a key U.S. ally, opened a long rift in U.S.-Iranian relations. On November 4, 1979, radical ""students"" seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held its diplomats hostage until minutes after President Reagan's inauguration on January 20, 1981. The United States broke relations with Iran on April 7, 1980, and the two countries have had no official dialogue since. The exception was the abortive 1985-86 clandestine arms supply relationship with Iran in exchange for some American hostages held by Hizballah in Lebanon (the so-called ""Iran-Contra Affair""). Iran maintains an interests section in Washington (Embassy of Pakistan), staffed by Iranian permanent resident aliens or U.S. citizens of Iranian descent. The U.S. protecting power in Iran is Switzerland. Upon taking office in 1993, the Clinton Administration moved to further isolate Iran as part of a strategy of ""dual containment"" of Iran and Iraq. In 1995 and 1996, the Clinton Administration and Congress added sanctions on Iran in response to growing concerns about Iran's weapons of mass destruction, its support for terrorist groups, and its efforts to subvert the Arab-Israeli peace process. The election of Khatemi in May 1997 precipitated a shift in U.S. policy toward engagement; the Clinton Administration offered Iran official dialogue, with no substantive preconditions. In January 1998, Khatemi publicly agreed to increase ""people-to-people"" exchanges with the United States but ruled out official dialogue. In a June 17, 1998 speech, then Secretary of State Albright stepped up the U.S. outreach effort by calling for mutual confidence building measures that could lead to a ""road map"" for normalization of relations. Encouraged by the reformist victory in Iran's March 2000 parliamentary elections, Secretary Albright gave another speech on March 17, 2000, acknowledging past U.S. meddling in Iran, easing sanctions on some Iranian imports, and promising to work to resolve outstanding claims disputes. Iran welcomed the steps, but called them insufficient to warrant the beginning of a dialogue. In early September 2000 meetings at the United Nations in connection with the Millennium Summit, Secretary Albright and President Clinton sent a positive signal to Iran by attending Khatemi's speeches. Until early 2002, the Bush Administration appeared to be continuing the Clinton Administration efforts, in part by building on the cooperation between the two countries in Afghanistan. The Administration's November 13, 2001 continuation of the 1979 national emergency on Iran said that U.S. ""relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal,"" a far softer statement than previous justifications sighting a continued threat from Iran. Supreme Leader Khamene'i sought to undermine any warming; on October 30, 2001, he threatened to dismiss any Iranian official who tried to forge relations with the United States. His statement came a few weeks after several Members of Congress had dinner in the Senate with Iran's U.N. representative. The thawing in relations has largely reversed since January 2002. Allegations of Iran's sale of arms to the Palestinian Authority and reputed meddling in Afghanistan, and revelations of new undeclared nuclear sites at Arak and Natanz (see above) have caused the Administration and Congress to become more critical of Iran's intentions and actions. As noted above, President Bush named Iran as part of an ""axis of evil"" in his State of the Union message. On July 12, 2002, President Bush issued a statement supporting those Iranians demonstrating for reform and democracy, a message he reiterated on December 20, 2002 when he inaugurated a new U.S. broadcast to Iran, Radio Farda (Tomorrow). Even though CRS-8   IB93033  03-13-03  the Bush Administration might need Iranian cooperation in its efforts to disarm Iraq or change its regime, the statements signaled a shift in U.S. policy from attempting to engage and support Khatemi and his faction to publicly supporting Iranian reformers and activists. This view, based on the conclusion that engaging Khatemi would not produce more moderate Iranian policies on key issues, was mirrored in Congress during 2002 when several Members called for U.S. efforts to promote civil society in Iran. Two resolutions introduced in late July 2002 (S.Res. 306 and H.Res. 504) called for positive U.S. gestures toward ""the people of Iran, and not political figures whose survival depends upon preservation of the current regime."" Some interpreted the U.S. shift as a move toward a regime change policy for Iran.  Economic Sanctions Since the November 4, 1979 seizure of the U.S. hostages in Tehran, economic sanctions have formed a major part of U.S. policy toward Iran. On November 14, 1979, President Carter declared a national emergency with respect to Iran, renewed every year since 1979. Terrorism/Foreign Aid. Following the October 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Lebanon, believed perpetrated by Hizballah, Iran was added to the ""terrorism list"" in January 1984. The designation bans direct U.S. financial assistance and arms sales, restricts sales of U.S. dual use items, and requires the United States to oppose multilateral lending to the designated countries. Separate from its position on the terrorism list, successive foreign aid appropriations laws since the late 1980s ban direct assistance to Iran (loans, credits, insurance, Eximbank credits) and indirect assistance (U.S. contributions to international organizations that work in Iran). Section 307 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (added in 1985) names Iran as unable to benefit from U.S. contributions to international organizations, requiring proportionate cuts if these institutions work in Iran. Iran also has been designated every year since 1997 as not cooperating with U.S. anti-terrorism efforts, under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (P.L. 104-132). That Act penalizes countries that assist or sell arms to terrorism list countries, and another law (the Defense Department Authorization Act of 1987) limits Defense Department contracts with companies controlled by terrorism list states ($100,000 contract limit). U.S. regulations do not bar disaster relief and the United States donated $125,000, through relief agencies, to help victims of two earthquakes in Iran (February and May 1997), and another $350,000 worth of aid to the victims of a June 22, 2002 earthquake. Proliferation Sanctions. Several sanctions laws are unique to Iran. The Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act (P.L. 102-484) requires denial of license applications for exports to Iran of dual use items, and imposes sanctions on foreign countries that transfer to Iran ""destabilizing numbers and types of conventional weapons,"" as well as WMD technology. The Iran Nonproliferation Act (P.L. 106-178) authorizes sanctions on foreign entities that assist Iran's WMD programs. It bans U.S. extraordinary payments to the Russian Aviation and Space Agency in connection with the international space station unless the President can certify that the agency or entities under the Agency's control had not transferred any WMD or missile-related technology to Iran within the year prior. The provision contains certain exceptions to ensure the safety of astronauts who will use the space station and for certain space station hardware. During 2001 and 2002, a number of entities in North Korea, China, India, Armenia, and Moldova have been sanctioned under the Iran Nonproliferation Act, the Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-484), and another law, the Chemical and Biological Warfare Elimination Act of 1991, for sales to Iran. CRS-9   IB93033  03-13-03  Counternarcotics. In February 1987, Iran was first designated as a state that failed to cooperate with U.S. anti-drug efforts or take adequate steps to control narcotics production or trafficking. U.S. and U.N. Drug Control Program (UNDCP) assessments of drug production in Iran prompted the Clinton Administration, on December 7, 1998, to remove Iran from the U.S. list of major drug producing countries. The decision exempts Iran from the annual certification process that kept drug-related U.S. sanctions in place on Iran. Britain reportedly has sold Iran small arms for its anti-drug efforts on the Afghan border. Trade Ban. On May 6, 1995, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12959 banning U.S. trade and investment in Iran, including the trading of Iranian oil overseas by U.S. companies. This followed an earlier March 1995 executive order barring U.S. investment in Iran's energy sector, and, although modified, has been extended each year since. Each March since 1995, most recently on March 13, 2003, the U.S. Administration has renewed a declaration of a state of emergency that triggered the March 1995 investment ban. An August 1997 amendment to the trade ban (Executive Order 13059) prevented U.S. companies from knowingly exporting goods to a third country for incorporation into products destined for Iran. The trade ban was partly intended to blunt criticism that U.S. trade with Iran made U.S. appeals for multilateral containment of Iran less credible. Some goods related to the safe operation of civilian aircraft can be licensed for export to Iran, and in December 1999, the Clinton Administration allowed the repair of engine mountings on seven Iran Air 747s (Boeing). Implementing regulations do not permit U.S. firms to negotiate investment deals with Iran. Following a 1998 application by a U.S. firm to sell Iran agricultural products, and in the context of Clinton Administration and congressional reviews of U.S. unilateral sanctions policies, the Clinton Administration announced in April 1999 that it would license, on a case-by-case basis, commercial sales of food and medical products to certain countries on which unilateral U.S. trade bans are in place (Iran, Libya, and Sudan). Under regulations issued in July 1999, private letters of credit can be used to finance approved sales, but no U.S. government credit guarantees are available and U.S. exporters are not permitted to deal directly with Iranian banks. Iran says the lack of credit makes U.S. sales, particularly of wheat, uncompetitive. The FY2001 agriculture appropriations (P.L. 106-387), contains a provision banning the use of official credit guarantees for food and medical sales to Iran and other countries on the U.S. terrorism list, except Cuba, although allowing for a presidential waiver to permit such credit guarantees. The Clinton Administration did not provide credit guarantees, and the Bush Administration has not done so either. In a March 17, 2000 speech, then Secretary Albright announced an easing of the trade ban to allow U.S. importation of Iranian nuts, dried fruits, carpets, and caviar; regulations governing the imports were issued in April 2000. The United States was the largest market for Iranian carpets before the 1979 revolution, although U.S. anti-dumping tariffs imposed on Iranian pistachio nut imports since 1986 (over 300%, although the Commerce Department is expected to lower this tariff in the near future) are dampening imports of that product. In January 2003, the tariff on roasted pistachios was lowered to 22% and on raw pistachios to 163%. Iranian caviar and carpets are now sold in the United States; the Iranian carpet market could eventually reach an estimated $100 million per year. The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA). The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA, H.R. 3107, P.L. 104-172, signed August 5, 1996), a law that sanctions foreign investment in Iran CRS-10   IB93033  03-13-03  or Libya's energy sector, was to expire on August 5, 2001. H.R. 1954, which renewed ILSA for five years but requires an Administration report on its effectiveness within 24-30 months, was passed by large majorities in both chambers in July 2001. It was signed on August 3, 2001 (P.L. 107-24). In testimony before the House International Relations Committee on June 20, 2002, a senior State Department official said that the Bush Administration probably would waive sanctions on European companies that invest in Iran, in exchange for European assistance in curbing Iran's WMD programs and terrorism. The statement was a response to calls in the 107th Congress (H.Res.434) to sanction Canadian oil company Sheer Energy, which, in May 2002, announced an $80 million contract to develop an Iranian oil field. In October 2002, Norway's Statoil agreed to invest $300 million to develop phases six, seven, and eight of the South Pars gas field. See CRS Report RS20871, The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA). Caspian/Central Asian Energy Routes Through Iran. The U.S. trade ban permits U.S. companies to apply for licenses to conduct ""swaps"" of Caspian Sea oil with Iran, but, as part of a U.S. policy to route Central Asian energy around Iran (and Russia), a Mobil Corporation application to do so was denied in April 1999. The Administration continues to oppose, and to threaten imposing ILSA sanctions on, pipeline projects that route Caspian/Central Asian energy through Iran. U.S. policy has been to strongly favor construction of a pipeline that would cross the Caspian Sea and let out in Ceyhan, Turkey (Baku-Ceyhan pipeline), avoiding Iran or Russia. Four Caspian nations (Turkey, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan) signed an agreement embracing Baku-Ceyhan on November 18, 1999, and regional and corporate support for the project has gained momentum to the point where pipeline construction is expected to begin in earnest soon. Kazakhstan nonetheless is pushing for construction of an oil pipeline across Iran. Despite U.S. pressure not to import Iranian gas, in December 2001 Turkey began doing so through a new crossborder pipeline, under an August 1996 agreement. (See CRS Report 98-86, Iran: Relations With Key Central Asian States.) Europe and Japan's Relations With/Lending to Iran. U.S.-allied differences on Iran narrowed since 1998 in concert with the Clinton Administration's attempt to engage Iran, a policy consistently favored by the European countries as a way to moderate Iran's behavior. During 1992-1997, the European Union (EU) countries maintained a policy of ""critical dialogue"" with Iran. The United States did not oppose those talks but maintained that the EU's dialogue would not change Iranian behavior. The dialogue was suspended immediately following the April 1997 German terrorism trial that found high-level Iranian involvement in assassinating Iranian dissidents in Germany. Alongside the post-1997 U.S. shift toward engagement, the EU-Iran dialogue formally resumed in May 1998. Since then, Khatemi has undertaken state visits to several Western countries, including Italy (March 1999), France (October 1999), Germany (July 2000), and Japan (November 2000). The United States publicly welcomed these visits. On December 12, 2002, Iran and the EU began formal negotiations on a trade pact that would lower the tariffs or increase quotas for Iranian exports to the EU countries, with some linkage to Iran addressing EU concerns on Iran's human rights practices and terrorism sponsorship. The resolution of the ""Rushdie affair"" to Britain's satisfaction sparked improvement in its relations with Iran. Iran maintains that Ayatollah Khomeini's 1989 death sentence against author Salman Rushdie cannot be revoked (his ""Satanic Verses"" novel was labeled blasphemous) because Khomeini is no longer alive to revoke it. However, on September 24, CRS-11   IB93033  03-13-03  1998, Iran's Foreign Minister pledged to Britain that Iran will not seek to implement the sentence and opposes any bounties offered for his death. Britain then upgraded relations with Iran to the ambassadorial level, and Foreign Ministers of the two countries have exchanged several visits. In October 2000, Britain began extending longer term credit (two years or greater) for exports to Iran. Some Iranian clerics (outside the formal government structure) have said the death sentence stands, and the Iranian government has not required the Fifteen Khordad foundation to withdraw its $2.8 million reward for Rushdie's death. Khatemi said on June 4, 2001 that he considers the issue closed. In August 1999, Japan continued a gradual improvement in relations with Iran by announcing a resumption of Japan's official development lending program for Iran to construct a hydroelectric dam over the Karun River. However, the $70 million increment announced was less that Iran had wanted, and Japan said that this tranche would close out Japan's involvement in the project. (In 1993, Japan provided the first $400 million tranche of the overall $1.4 billion official development loan program, but the lending was subsequently placed on hold as the United States sought to persuade its allies to pressure Iran.) In late January 2000, Japan agreed to resume medium- and long-term export credit insurance for exports to Iran, suspended since 1994. Economic relations improved further during Khatemi's November 2000 visit to Tokyo, which resulted in Iran's granting Japanese firms the first right to negotiate to develop the large Azadegan field, and Iran and a Japaneseled consortium are moving forward with preliminary studies of the field. Some press reports suggest that Royal Dutch/Shell might join the Azadegan project, apparently because it can provide needed technology. In exchange, Japan agreed to prepay Iran $1 billion per year for the next 3 years for Iranian oil. Partly at U.S. urging, Japan refused to extend to Iran additional official loans. During 1994-1995, and over U.S. objections at the time, Iran's European and Japanese creditors rescheduled about $16 billion in Iranian debt. These countries (governments and private creditors) rescheduled the debt bilaterally, in spite of Paris Club rules that call for multilateral rescheduling and International Monetary Fund (IMF) involvement. Iran has worked its external debt down from $32 billion in 1997 to about $20 billion as of March 2002, according to Iran's Central Bank. The improved debt picture has led most European export credit agencies, including Germany's Hermes, France's COFACE, and that of Spain, to restore insurance cover for exports to Iran. In July 2002, Iran tapped international capital markets for the first time since the Islamic revolution, selling $500 million in bonds to European banks. At the urging of the U.S. government, in May 2002 Moody's stopped its credit ratings service for Iran's government bonds on the grounds that performing the credit ratings service might violate the U.S. trade ban. Multilateral Lending to Iran. Section 1621 of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-132) amended the Foreign Assistance Act to require the United States to vote against international loans to countries on the U.S. terrorism list. Acting under provisions of successive foreign aid laws, in 1993 the United States voted its 16.5% share of the World Bank against loans to Iran of $460 million for electricity, health, and irrigation projects. To signal opposition to international lending to Iran, the FY1994 foreign aid appropriations act (P.L. 103-87) cut the Administration's request for the U.S. contribution to the World Bank by the amount of those loans. That law, the FY1995 foreign aid appropriation (P.L. 103-326), and the FY1996 foreign aid appropriations (P.L. 104-107),  CRS-12   IB93033  03-13-03  would have significantly reduced U.S. payments to the Bank if it had provided new loans to Iran. By 1999, Iran's moderating image had led the World Bank to consider new loans. In May 2000, the United States was unsuccessful in obtaining further delay on a vote on new lending for Iran, and its allies outvoted the United States to approve $232 million in loans for health and sewage projects. Twenty one of the Bank's twenty four governors voted in favor, and France and Canada abstained. Earlier, Iran also had asked the International Monetary Fund for about $400 million in loans (its quota is about $2 billion) to help it deal with its trade financing shortfalls. However, Iran balked at accepting IMF conditionality, and there was no agreement. Despite the required U.S. opposition, on May 10, 2001, the World Bank's executive directors voted to approve a two-year economic reform plan for Iran that envisions $775 million in new Bank loans. In May 2003, the Bank will consider a $112 million loan to Iran for low- and middle-income housing. WTO. The Bush Administration said in July 2001 that U.S. opposition to Iran's membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) was ""under review,"" but there have been no recent indications that the United States will drop that opposition. On several occasions since then, the WTO, at U.S. urging, has postponed discussion on whether to launch entry talks with Iran. Travel Sanctions. Use of U.S. passports for travel to Iran is permitted, but a State Department travel warning, softened somewhat in April 1998, asks that Americans ""defer"" travel to Iran. Iranians entering the United States are required to be fingerprinted. Assets Disputes/Victims of Terrorism. Iran claims that the United States has frozen vast amounts of Iranian assets, presenting an obstacle to improved relations. A U.S.Iran Claims Tribunal, at the Hague, is arbitrating cases resulting from the break in relations following the Iranian revolution. The major cases yet to be decided center on hundreds of Foreign Military Sales cases between the United States and the Shah's regime, which Iran claims it paid for but were unfulfilled. About $400 million in proceeds from the resale of that equipment is in a DOD account. In April 2000, then Secretary Albright named a representative to negotiate a resolution of the claims issue at the Hague. The assets issue moved to the forefront following several U.S. court judgements against Iran for past acts of terrorism against Americans, filed under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. Since March 1998, U.S. courts have awarded the following: $247 million to the family of Alisa Flatow, killed in Israel in April 1995 in a bombing by Palestinian Islamic Jihad (awarded in March 1998); $65 million to three Americans held hostage in Lebanon - David Jacobsen, Joseph Cicippio, and Frank Reed (August 1998); $324 for Lebanon hostage Terry Anderson (March 2000); $327 million to the families of two Americans killed in a February 1996 Hamas bombing (July 2000); and $355 million to the family of Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, killed by Hizballah in 1989 (September 2000). Former Lebanon hostage Thomas Sutherland won a $353 million judgement against Iran on June 26, 2001. In August 2001, the family of former Lebanon hostage father Lawrence Jenco won a $314.6 million judgment against Iran for his captivity. In June 2001, former hostages Benjamin Weir and Frank Regier sued Iran for over $100 million for their captivity in CRS-13   IB93033  03-13-03  Lebanon. Also in early June 2001, the family of former hostage Peter Kilburn, who was killed in the course of his captivity in Lebanon, filed a suit against both Libya and Iran for more than $200 million. In October 2001, victims of the October 1983 Hizballah bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut filed a $5 billion suit against Iran. On January 23, 2002, a federal judge ordered Iran to pay $42 million to the family of Charles Hegna, who was beaten in the course of a 1984 Hizballah hijacking of Kuwait Air 221. On February 6, 2002, a federal judge awarded $56 million to the family of Ira Weinstein, killed in a 1996 Hamas bus bombing in Israel. On the basis of the sanctity of diplomatic property, the Clinton Administration blocked efforts by the claimants to satisfy their judgments from frozen Iranian assets  diplomatic property in Washington (worth about $22 million) or the DOD account mentioned above. In December 1999, the Clinton Administration also blocked a Flatow effort to seize a $6 million U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal judgement awarded to Iran. A provision of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (H.R. 3244, P.L. 106-386) provides for the use of general revenues to pay 110% of compensatory damage awards to the above and future successful claimants in a total not to exceed the rental proceeds from Iran's diplomatic property and the DOD account. (The tenant of the Iranian Embassy building was evicted for non-payment of rent in March 2002, with rent of about $750,000 overdue.) The provision requires the President to try to recoup the expended funds from Iran as part of an overall reconciliation in relations and assets settlement, although there is no requirement that funds ultimately be withheld from Iran. A provision of the FY2002 Commerce, Justice, State appropriation (P.L. 107-77) requires an Administration legislative proposal on how to compensate successful U.S. claimants in future terrorism-related judgments against Iran. In April 2002, a federal judge ruled that Iran, under the Algiers Accords, had immunity from a lawsuit by the 52 Americans held hostage by Iran for 444 days. With regard to the American hostages, the conference report on the FY2002 defense appropriation (P.L. 107-117, H.Rept.107-350) states that the hostages should be able to collect damages from Iranian assets, notwithstanding U.S.-Iran agreements on the disposition of Iran's assets. Regarding the mistaken U.S. shootdown on July 3,1988 of an Iranian Airbus passenger jet, on February 22, 1996, the United States, responding to an Iranian case before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), agreed to pay Iran up to $61.8 million in compensation ($300,000 per wage earning victim, $150,000 per non wage earner) for the 248 Iranians killed in the shootdown. The funds for this settlement came from a general appropriation for judgments against the United States. The United States previously paid $3 million in death benefits for 47 non-Iranians killed in the attack, but has not compensated Iran for the airplane itself. A different case, pending before the ICJ, involves an Iranian claim for damages to Iranian oil platforms during U.S. naval clashes with Iran in October 1987 and April 1988.  Military Containment U.S. policy has focused on containing the military threat posed by Iran to the United States, U.S. allies in the Persian Gulf, and international shipping. Although containing Iraq has been the primary goal of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf region since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, U.S. military officials note that U.S. forces could potentially be used against Iran,  CRS-14   IB93033  03-13-03  if the President so decides. U.S. military officers note that their encounters with Iranian naval vessels in the Gulf have been more professional since Khatemi took office.  Iran's Opposition Movements It is not official U.S. policy to change Iran's regime, and the United States does not fund Iranian opposition movements. In 1995, the Clinton Administration accepted a House-Senate conference agreement to include $18-$20 million in funding authority for covert operations against Iran in the FY1996 intelligence authorization act (H.R. 1655, P.L. 104-93) -- about $14 million more than requested -- according to a Washington Post report of December 22, 1995. The Clinton Administration reportedly focused the covert aid on changing the regime's behavior, rather than its overthrow. The conference report on H.R. 2267 (H.Rept. 105-405), the FY1998 Commerce/State/ Justice appropriation, provided $4 million for a ""Radio Free Iran,"" to be run by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). The radio, which the Administration called the Farsi service of RFE/RL, began operations in Prague on October 31, 1998, and has become, as of December 2002, Radio Farda (Tomorrow), which broadcasts nearly around the clock. Another $4 million for the radio for FY1999 was provided by the omnibus appropriation (H.R. 4328, P.L. 105-277). Since the late 1980s, the State Department has refused contact with the anti-regime People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI) and its umbrella organization, the National Council of Resistance (NCR). It was designated as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO) in October 1997 under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. In November 2002, a letter signed by about 150 House Members was released, asking the President to remove the PMOI from the FTO list. There are reports Iraq has offered Iran to end support for PMOI forces on Iraqi territory in exchange for a pledge by Iran not to support any U.S.-led war against Iraq. For further information on this group, see CRS Report RL31119, Terrorism: Near Eastern Groups and State Sponsors, 2002. Some Iranian exiles follow the son of the late former Shah, who lives in the United States. On January 24, 2001, the Shah's son, Reza Pahlavi, 40 years old, ended a long period of inactivity by giving a speech in Washington calling for unity in opposition to the current regime and for the institution of a constitutional monarchy and genuine democracy in Iran. He has since broadcast messages into Iran from a station in California, and press reports say a growing number of Iranians are listening to his broadcasts.  CRS-15"

The judiciary is independent.    Elected officials control the police force, which scrupulously observes and enforces the laws that ensure protection of human rights.    Iceland has a mixed, open economy that provides residents with a high standard of living.  The leading exports, fish and other marine products, account for almost 70 percent of export revenues.  An abundance of cheap hydroelectric power provides a comparative advantage for the main manufacturing activity--aluminum smelting.  Aluminum is the second leading export.  Growth was expected to approach 4 percent in 1999.     The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law and judiciary provide effective means of dealing with individual instances of abuse.  Human rights monitors expressed concern about the Government's frequent use of solitary confinement for remand prisoners.  The Government is taking steps to deal with violence against women.  Some societal discrimination against women persists, especially in the area of equal pay.  Instances of suspected trafficking in women were reported.    RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS    Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:     a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing    There were no reports of political or other extrajudicial killings.     b. Disappearance    There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.        c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment    Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment are prohibited by law and do not occur.      Prison conditions generally meet minimum international standards.  Most of the country's small prison population (less than 100 inmates total) is held at Litla Hraun Prison in Reykjavik, which includes a state-of-the-art detention facility opened in 1995.  However, the prison system still uses a substandard jail (Hegningarhusid in downtown Reykjavik) to hold a small number of prisoners, where the individual cells lack toilets and sinks.    Human rights monitors have expressed concern about the use of illegal drugs by some inmates at Litla Hraun Prison and about the lack of social services to help inmates overcome drug addiction and prepare them for eventual release.  Despite the small inmate population at Litla Hraun, the authorities have not been able to stop narcotics from being smuggled into the prison.    In a 1999 report, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) expressed concern during its visit to Litla Hraun prison in 1998 that nearly all detainees still were placed in solitary confinement while their cases were under investigation.  While the average duration of solitary confinement was between 2 and 3 weeks, the CPT noted that in some cases, solitary confinement lasted up to 3 months.  Under the strictest form of solitary confinement, prisoners cannot leave their cells, except briefly to exercise alone or to use the showers, and are not allowed to listen to the radio, watch television, or receive visitors other than their lawyers, the prison doctor, and a chaplain.  In November 1999, the supervising doctor at Litla Hraun wrote to prison authorities, warning that the mental health of several prisoners awaiting trial on drug trafficking charges could be in danger due to the extended time that they were expected to spend in solitary confinement.    In a preliminary response to the CPT report on September 30, 1999, the Government argued that solitary confinement was absolutely necessary in some circumstances to keep suspects from tampering with witnesses, destroying evidence, or hindering the investigation.  On the other hand, it conceded that ""in the vast majority of cases"" incarceration alone was sufficient to protect the integrity of witnesses and evidence.  However, the Prison and Probation Administration's statistics show that solitary confinement has been the rule rather than the exception, with most of those arrested being placed into solitary confinement, at least initially.    In May the European Court of Human Rights ruled in favor of an Icelandic woman who had been denied compensation for wrongful arrest on the grounds that she had not cooperated with police.  The woman was held in solitary confinement for 5 weeks in 1989 in connection with a drug case before being cleared and released.  The Government since has changed the law to make it easier for victims of wrongful arrest to receive compensation, recognizing the principle that all detainees should be presumed innocent until proven guilty.      With the closing of the Sudumuli remand prison in 1996, the Government passed a law in 1998 that allows pretrial detainees to be incarcerated with the general prison population.  Some human rights monitors claim that this law is inconsistent with the country's obligations under the European Human Rights Convention and European prison rules issued by the Council of Europe.     Juveniles who are 15 years of age or older can be sentenced to prison terms, but the vast majority of juvenile offenders are given probation or suspended sentences or agree to attend a treatment program instead of going to jail.  In the rare instances when juvenile offenders are incarcerated, they are confined with the general adult prison population due to the lack of a separate detention facility for juveniles.  In its 1999 report, the CPT stated that it was ""very concerned"" about the current situation and recommended that the Government take ""immediate steps...to ensure that juvenile prisoners are held separately from adults.""  In signing the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1990, the Government entered a reservation on the provision requiring the separation of adult and juvenile prisoners.  Government officials said that it is not practical to establish and operate a separate facility for juvenile prisoners in a small country like Iceland because the requirement to incarcerate a juvenile occurs so infrequently.    The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors.     d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile    The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest, detention, and exile, and the Government observes these prohibitions.     e. Denial of Fair Public Trial    The Constitution and law provide for an independent judiciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice.    There are two levels of courts.  A five-member Judicial Council appointed by the Minister of Justice administers the district courts, while the Supreme Court guards its independence and fairness by administering itself.  All judges, at all levels, serve for life.    The judiciary provides citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process.  Juries are not used, but multijudge panels are common, especially in the Supreme Court, which hears all appeals.  Depending on the seriousness of the case, a Supreme Court panel can include from three to seven judges.  Defendants are presumed innocent.  They are provided access to legal counsel of their own choosing with sufficient time to prepare their defense.  For defendants unable to pay attorneys' fees, the state covers the cost, as set by the court, but defendants are required to reimburse the state.  Defendants have the right to be present at their trial, to confront witnesses, and to participate otherwise in the proceedings.  No groups are barred from testifying, and all testimony is treated alike.  The courts have the discretion to allow the introduction of evidence obtained illegally by the police.  With limited exceptions, trials are public and conducted fairly, with no official intimidation.  Defendants have the right to appeal.    There were no reports of political prisoners.    f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence    The Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.    Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:     a. Freedom of Speech and Press    The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice.  An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.   b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association    The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.     c. Freedom of Religion    Although the official state religion is Lutheranism, the Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government respects this right in practice.  The salaries of Lutheran ministers are paid by the state.  Citizens 16 years of age and above are presumed to be members of the state church and are required to support the church by paying a tax, unless they designate another religious denomination to receive their tax payment.  The religion tax payment of persons who choose not to belong to any specific, organized religious group goes to the University of Iceland.  Religious instruction in Christianity is required in the public schools, although students may be exempted.     A new law passed by Parliament in December 1999 (Law No. 108) sets specific conditions and procedures that religious organizations must follow in order to be recognized officially and registered by the State.  Such recognition is necessary in order for religious organizations other than the state church to receive a per capita share of church tax funds.  The 1999 law is narrower in scope than the 1975 law it replaced and applies only to religious organizations that are seeking to be, or are already, officially recognized and registered.  No restrictions or requirements are placed on unregistered religious organizations, which have the same rights as other groups in society.  The law is considered necessary to deal with frequent attempts by individuals to obtain recognition of religious organizations simply to receive the tax income benefits.      d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation    The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.      Although neither the Constitution nor the 1965 Law on the Supervision of Foreigners includes provisions for granting refugee or asylee status in accordance with the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 protocol, in practice the Government adjudicates cases in accordance with their principles.  The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Committee of the Red Cross, and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees.    However, human rights monitors have expressed concern about the lack of a modern and comprehensive immigration law to govern the processing of asylum seekers and to provide a framework for the handling of foreigners and immigrants in general.  In particular there is concern that the Supervision of Foreigners Law gives police and custom officers at ports of entry too much discretion to deny admission to asylum seekers whose claims they deem to be not ""credible.""      In response the Government states that official discretion is rarely exercised and that none of the 42 individuals who were denied entry to the country during the first 9 months of 2000 requested asylum.  Nevertheless, many government officials agree that a comprehensive and modern immigration law is necessary.    In view of the country's geographic isolation and the lack of direct transportation from any traditional source of refugees, the question of first asylum rarely arises.  However, the Directorate of Immigration (which is responsible for adjudicating applications for asylum) and the Icelandic Red Cross (which houses and assists asylum seekers under a contact with the Government) report that 24 individuals applied for asylum during the year, compared with 17 in 1999.  None was found to qualify for refugee status (several cases were still under consideration or on appeal), but the 1999 application of an individual who claimed to be 17 years old and fleeing persecution in central Africa was approved.  It was the first application for asylum status ever approved.  There were no reports of asylum seekers being detained or forcibly expelled during the year.    The Government accepted 23 UNHCR-designated ""quota"" refugees from the former Yugoslavia during the year, continuing a program begun in 1996 of bringing in 20 to 25 refugees from the region each year.  In 1999 the Government also admitted 75 Kosovar refugees into the country, 37 of whom since returned to Kosovo with the financial support of the Government.  Local government authorities in the towns where refugees settle take a strong interest in helping them adapt to their new environment.  The Icelandic Red Cross, in cooperation with the Refugee Council of the Ministry of Social Affairs, developed a support family program, whereby at least three Icelandic families are enlisted to assist each refugee or refugee family.  The refugees immediately are granted work permits and assisted in finding jobs.  For the first year, they also are given free housing, utilities, and health care and receive a stipend so that they can participate daily in a special half-day language course designed specially for them.  Refugees generally are successful in assimilating into society, but their children generally drop out of school earlier than children of citizens.    Section 3 Respect for Political Rights:  The Right of Citizens to Change Their Government    The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.  The most recent elections to the Althingi (unicameral Parliament) were held in May 1999.    Women are underrepresented in government and politics, but no legal or practical impediments hinder their participation.  Some human rights monitors criticized the Minister of Justice (herself a woman) for filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court during the year by choosing the sole male candidate (who had never served on the bench) over three experienced female district court judges.  Only one of the nine Supreme Court justices is a woman.  Similarly, only 2 of 12 ministerial permanent secretaries (civil servants who function as deputy ministers) are women.    Women have greater representation in politics.  Of the 12 government ministers, 4 are women, and women hold 24 of the 63 seats in Parliament.  There has been a marked increase in the number of female parliamentarians elected since the Women's List (WL), a feminist political party, was founded in 1983.  The WL forced the established political parties to nominate more female candidates or face losing support.  The WL disappeared from the scene as the result of a political party merger, but its legacy survives.  Women's issues have moved into the mainstream of political debate, and all of the major political parties now have at least one woman in a prominent leadership position.      Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights    A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases.  Government officials are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.    Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or Social Status    The country's ethnically homogenous population is strongly egalitarian and opposed to discrimination based on any of these factors.  The law and practice generally reflect this attitude.       Women    Violence against women continued to be a matter of concern.  A public women's shelter offers counseling and protection to victims of domestic violence and their children.  Approximately 340 women used the shelter during the year, 94 of whom sought temporary lodging, while the rest asked for counseling or information.  About 60 children accompanied their mothers to the shelter during the year.  At a rape trauma center, between 300 and 400 women and children seek assistance annually.  Both facilities are financed by national and municipal governments, as well as by private contributors.  The emergency ward of the National Hospital in Reykjavik has a special staff to care for rape victims.  It reports approximately 100 visits per year associated with incidents of sexual abuse.    A police program to train officers in correct interrogation procedures in rape and sexual abuse cases appears to be addressing prior concerns that police indifference and hostility to female victims did not assure proper attention and consideration for victims of such abuses.  Parliament passed legislation in May that gives courts the power to issue restraining orders, an action that human rights monitors praised as a potentially useful legal tool in keeping abusive husbands away from their spouses.    A large majority of victims nevertheless decline to press charges, and even more forgo trial, fearing publicity in this small, tightly knit society.  With an increasing number of interracial marriages, mostly involving Icelandic men and Asian women, there is concern that these new Asian immigrants are not assimilating well into local society and could be vulnerable to mistreatment.  To address this concern, the city of Reykjavik offers these immigrant women emergency accommodation, counseling, and information on legal rights, language training, and Icelandic societal norms.    There were indications that some foreign women were trafficked to work as striptease dancers or prostitutes against their will (see Sections 6.c. and 6.f.).  The sale of sex for money is not illegal per se, but it is against the law for someone to engage in prostitution as his or her main source of income.  It is also illegal to act as an intermediary in the sale or procurement of sex.    The rate of participation by women in the labor market is high.  In part this reflects the country's comprehensive system of subsidized day care, which makes it affordable and convenient for women to work outside the home.  The Act on the Equal Status of Men and Women requires that preference be given to the hiring and promotion of women in areas where they are underrepresented, as long as they are equal in all other respects to their male job seekers.  Despite laws that require equal pay for equal work, a sizeable pay gap continues to exist between men and women.  A survey by a union in Reykjavik showed that women, on average, earned 30 percent less than men.  A 12 percent difference in pay is attributable to the fact that men work 4.2 more hours per week than women, but the rest of the gap is unexplained.    Parliament passed legislation during the year that gives fathers the same right as mothers to paid leave upon the birth of a child.  When the law is fully implemented in 2003, both mother and father will be allowed to take 3 months of paid leave, with an additional 3 months that can be taken by either parent or shared between them.  Previously, a mother was given 6 months of paid maternity leave and the father just 2 weeks.  The new leave requirements apply equally to the public and private sectors.     Children    The Government demonstrates its strong commitment to children's rights through its well-funded systems of public education and medical care.  School attendance is compulsory through the age of 15.  About 85 percent of students continue to upper secondary education, which is financed completely by the State.  The Government provides free prenatal and infant medical care, as well as heavily subsidized childcare.  The Office of the Children's Ombudsman in the Prime Minister's Office has a mandate to protect children's rights, interests, and welfare by, among other things, exerting influence on legislation, government decisions, and public attitudes.      There is no societal pattern of abuse directed against children.  In an effort to improve the rate of prosecution of child sexual abuse and lessen the trauma to the child, the Government in 1998 established the Children's Assessment Center.  The objective of the center is to create a safe and secure environment where child victims feel more comfortable talking about what happened to them and are not subjected to multiple interviews.  The center brings together police, prosecutors, judges, doctors, and officials from child protection services.  However, a 1999 change in the Code of Criminal Procedure inadvertently undermined the center by making judges (instead of the police) responsible for the investigatory interview of abused children and by allowing these interviews to be conducted in specially designed rooms at district courthouses.  In September the Supreme Court upheld the right of a Reykjavik district court judge to hold an investigatory interview in the courthouse rather than at the assessment center.  As of September, only about 20 percent of child sexual abuse cases were being handled through the center, a development that human rights monitors claim is a step backwards in the protection of children's rights.     People with Disabilities    Disabled individuals are not subject to discrimination in employment, education, or the provision of other state services.  A 1992 law calls for the disabled to have the right to ""all common national and municipal services"" and provides that they be given assistance to ""make it possible for them to live and work in normal society with others.""  The law also provides that the disabled should receive preference for a government job when they are qualified equally, or more qualified, than regular applicants.      Building regulations updated in 1998 call for public accommodations--such as hotels, restaurants, banks, and stores--as well as government buildings to be accessible so that persons in wheelchairs have access without assistance.  Building regulations also specify that elevators in such buildings should be large enough to accommodate wheelchairs and that 1 percent of parking spaces (a minimum of one space) should be reserved for disabled use only.  Moreover, the regulations specify that, to the extent possible, the sidewalk outside the main entrance of a public accommodation or government building should be heated so that it remains clear of ice and snow throughout the winter.      The 1997 Planning and Building Act provides that violations of these regulations are punishable by a fine or a jail sentence of up to 2 years.  However, the country's main association for the disabled complains that enforcement is lax and that penalties are rarely assessed for noncompliance.  Access to new buildings tends to be good, while efforts to make old buildings more accessible have lagged.  A government committee is currently doing a systematic survey of all state-owned buildings in the country to evaluate their accessibility.  Since 1995 the Reykjavik city government, in cooperation with local associations representing bicycle riders and the blind, has been systematically beveling sidewalks at intersections throughout the city to facilitate the movement of pedestrians, bicyclists, and disabled persons in wheelchairs.  The city is spending about $175,000 a year on this project, which it aims to have completed by 2006.        In what was heralded as a major human rights victory for the disabled, the Supreme Court ruled in December that the Government's practice of basing a disabled person's social security payment on the income of his or her able-bodied spouse or partner was unconstitutional.  The Court said that such means testing violated constitutional protections regarding equality and support for the disabled and that it was contrary to the country's obligations under the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights.  At year's end, the Government appointed a committee to study the court ruling, a move that the Association of Disabled Persons criticized as a delaying tactic.  It called on the Government to take immediate action to end the means testing and reimburse disabled persons for past reductions in their social security payments.     National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities    Concern was voiced during the year that the rapidly increasing number of foreigners being brought into the country to meet the labor shortage in fish processing and other less desirable occupations could lead to future problems, especially in the event of an economic downturn.  At the end of 1999, 7,271 foreigners were living in Iceland, or about 3 percent of the population, according to the statistics office.  However, persons of foreign origin actually constituted 4 or 5 percent of the population when account is taken of individuals who were born in foreign countries but have since become citizens.  New work and residence permits were issued at a rate of about 150 per month during the year.  Many of these ""temporary"" workers come from Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and the Directorate of Immigration expected most of them to seek to remain permanently rather than return to their countries of origin.    Human rights monitors expressed concern about the establishment in 1997 of an ultra-nationalist organization called the Association of Icelandic Nationalists, whose motto is ""Iceland for Icelanders.""  The avowed aim of the association is to prevent further settlement of foreigners of other than European origin in the country.  Some human rights monitors claim that the Government is not living up its obligations under Article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination because there is no law that prohibits organizations that promote and incite racial discrimination.     Section 6 Worker Rights     a. The Right of Association    Workers make extensive use of the right provided by the Constitution to establish organizations, draw up their own constitutions and rules, choose their own leaders and policies, and publicize their views.  The resulting organizations are controlled neither by the Government nor by any single political party.  Unions take active part in Nordic, European, and other international trade union bodies.  With the exception of limited categories of workers in the public sector whose services are essential to public health or safety, unions have had and used the right to strike for many years.  Approximately 80 percent of all eligible workers belong to unions.  During the year, 3 major strikes took place:  A 2-week strike in the spring by most of the unskilled and semiskilled labor unions outside of Reykjavik, a 2-month strike during the summer by the main bus drivers' union, and a 2-month strike at the end of the year by secondary school teachers.  The teachers' strike, which was the longest such strike in the country's history, led some students to leave school and take up full-time jobs.     b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively    Union membership is not impeded in law or practice.  Employers are required to withhold union dues (1 percent of gross pay) from the pay of all employees, whether or not they are union members.  This is because union dues help support, among other things, disability, strike, and pension funds to which all workers are entitled.      The various trade unions and management organizations periodically negotiate collective bargaining agreements that set specific terms for workers' pay, hours, and other conditions. New collective bargaining agreements were negotiated in the spring of 2000, and most will expire in either 2003 or 2004.  The Government played only a minor role in the bargaining process, providing mediation assistance in a few cases (through the State Mediator's Office) while generally encouraging wage restraint to limit inflation.  The new contacts provide that if inflation exceeds expectations during the first year, the unions have the right to seek renegotiation of the wage terms.  In recent years, the Government has played almost no role in the private sector collective bargaining process, other than generally to encourage wage restraint that would help to limit inflation.      Labor courts effectively adjudicate disputes over contracts and over the rights provided for in the 1938 Act on Trade Unions and Industrial Disputes, which prohibits antiunion discrimination.  By law employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union activities.  In practice the charges are difficult to prove.    In 1996 Parliament passed legislation updating the labor laws and bringing them into compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights.     There are no export processing or other special economic zones.      c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor    Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law and does not occur; however, some women reportedly were coerced to work as striptease dancers or prostitutes (see Sections 5 and 6.f.), and work permit practices could leave workers vulnerable to abuse by employers (see Section 6.e.).  The law prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, and the Government enforces this prohibition effectively.    d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment    The law prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, and the Government enforces this prohibition effectively (see Section 6.c.).  The law requires children to attend school until the age of 16 and prohibits the employment of younger children in factories, on ships, or in other places that are hazardous or require hard labor.  This prohibition is observed in practice.  Children 14 or 15 years old may be employed part time or during school vacations in light, nonhazardous work.  Their work-hours must not exceed the ordinary work hours of adults in the same occupation.  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration enforces child labor regulations.    The Government ratified ILO Convention 182 on the worst forms of child labor in May.     e. Acceptable Conditions of Work    No minimum wage is mandated legislatively, but the minimum wages negotiated in the various collective bargaining agreements apply automatically to all employees in those occupations, whether they are union members or not.  Union membership is so extensive and effective that labor contracts afford even the lowest paid workers a sufficient income for a decent standard of living for themselves and their families.    Workers are protected by laws that effectively provide for their health and safety as well as for unemployment insurance, paid vacations, pensions, and reasonable working conditions and hours.  The standard legal workweek is 40 hours, which includes nearly 3 hours of paid breaks.  Work exceeding 8 hours in a workday must be compensated as overtime.  Under changes that took effect during the year, workers are entitled to 11 hours of rest (up from 10 hours previously) within each 24-hour period and to a day off every week.  Under defined special circumstances, the 11-hour rest period can be reduced to 8 hours, but the worker must then be compensated with 1.5 hours of rest for every hour he received less than 11 hours.  The day off can be postponed by a week, in which case the worker has a right to 2 additional hours off in the following week.  Health and safety standards are set by Parliament and administered and enforced by the Ministry of Social Affairs through its Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which can close down workplaces until safety and health standards are met.  Workers have a collective, not an individual, right to refuse to work in a place that does not meet the criteria of occupational safety and health.  Firing workers who report unsafe or unhealthy conditions is illegal.    However, in the case of newly arrived foreign workers or refugees (i.e., those who have been in the country for less than 3 years), human rights monitors expressed concern that the Government's practice of issuing the applicable work permit to the employer rather than to the individual concerned could leave the worker vulnerable to abuse by the employer.     f. Trafficking in Persons    The law does not specifically criminalize trafficking in persons; however, a number of provisions in the Penal Code can be used to prosecute such cases.       Although no charges have ever been filed, trafficking in women is suspected in connection with the hundreds of foreign women who enter the country to work in striptease clubs.  The main concern is that some of the women, especially those from Eastern and Central Europe, are being brought to Iceland under false pretenses and then coerced to work as striptease dancers or prostitutes.  The police believe that the foreign women also may be used to bring illegal drugs into the country.    Parliament passed legislation in May that closed a loophole that allowed striptease dancers to enter the country and perform without a work permit for up to 4 weeks under an exemption given for ""artists.""  Now any foreign woman (except those from the Nordic area and countries of the European Economic Area) seeking to come to the country to work as a striptease dancer must first obtain work and residence permits, which are typically valid for 3 months.  However, the Government has not yet put any numerical limits or other controls on the issuance of work permits for foreign striptease dancers.  The clubs are allowed to bring in as many as they want.  One check is provided by the Icelandic Federation of Labor.  The Federation reviews the work permit applications and labor contacts for striptease dancers (under the law, all work permit applications must be reviewed and approved by the ""relevant"" labor union) and ensures that the dancers are afforded the minimal labor protections and benefits.      The number of women entering the country for such work, while still based on anecdotal evidence, has fallen to a few hundred since they can now stay longer legally.  By year's end, there had been no arrests in connection with these activities.

GX045-02-0853614	Iceland Country Reports on Human Rights Practices   -   2002 Released by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor March 31, 2003 Iceland is a constitutional republic and a parliamentary democracy in which citizens periodically choose their representatives in free and fair multiparty elections. The judiciary is independent.    Elected officials maintained effective control of the police forces, which were responsible for internal security. There were no military forces. There were no reports that security forces committed human rights abuses.    The mixed, open economy provided residents with a high standard of living. The country had a population of approximately 286,000. The gross domestic product (GDP) during the year was approximately $8 billion; GDP growth was approximately 2 percent. Fish and other marine products accounted for about 40 percent of the country's exports. Aluminum was the second leading export.    The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law and judiciary provided effective means of dealing with individual instances of abuse. Human rights monitors expressed concern about the Government's policy on dissent by foreign visitors and on protections of citizens' privacy. Violence against women remained a problem that the Government took steps to address. Some societal discrimination against women persisted, especially in the area of equal pay. There were reports of trafficking in women for prostitution. Iceland was invited as a participant to the second Ministerial Meeting of the Community of Democracies in Seoul, Republic of Korea, in November.    RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS Section 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:     a. Arbitrary or Unlawful Deprivation of Life    There were no reports of the arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of life committed by the Government or its agents.    b. Disappearance    There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances. c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment    The law prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that government officials employed them.    Prison conditions generally met international standards. Most of the country's prison population of fewer than 110 inmates were held at Litla Hraun Prison, which included a state-of-the-art detention facility. However, the prison system used a substandard jail (Hegningarhusid, built in 1874), where the 16 individual cells lacked toilets and sinks. In most cases, prisoners were kept in Hegningarhusid Prison only a short time for evaluation and processing before being transferred to another facility. Some prisoners with short sentences (less than 30 days) elected to serve their time there to be closer to friends and family.    Human rights observers expressed concern about the use of illegal drugs by some inmates at Litla Hraun Prison and about the lack of social services to help inmates overcome drug addiction and prepare them for eventual release. For humanitarian reasons, authorities have not instituted stringent controls on visitation that could stop narcotics from being smuggled into the prison.    In 2001 in response to the Council of Europe's 1999 finding that authorities used solitary confinement excessively, the Ombudsman of the Parliament investigated its use as a punishment for violations of prison regulations. He concluded that the Ministry of Justice needed to adopt clearer guidelines to prevent the arbitrary use of solitary confinement by prison authorities. By year's end, the Ministry had not done so. During the year, 94 of 108 persons placed in custody spent some time in isolation. The average time spent in isolation was approximately 14 days.    There was a separate minimum-security prison for women inmates. However, because so few women were incarcerated, some men who have been convicted of nonviolent crimes were held there as well. Juvenile offenders 15 years of age or older could be sentenced to prison terms, but the vast majority were given probation, suspended sentences, or attended a treatment program instead of going to jail. In the rare instances when juvenile offenders were incarcerated, they were held with adults since there was no separate facility for juveniles. The Government argued that such separation was not practical since the need to incarcerate a juvenile occurred infrequently.    The law allows pretrial detainees to be held with the general prison population; some human rights observers criticized this law. In 2001 the Government budgeted planning funds for a new remand prison just outside of Reykjavik; however, construction had not begun by year's end.    The Government permitted prison visits by independent human rights observers. The Icelandic Red Cross carried out regular prison visits to counsel prisoners and address their individual concerns. The independent Ombudsman of Parliament monitored prison conditions during the year.    d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile    The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention, and the Government generally observed these prohibitions; however, followers of the Falun Gong religious movement complained in June that the Government detained them for several hours before admitting them to the country (see Section 2.b.). Officials said that the names of Falun Gong practitioners were gathered by police with the help of police in countries where these persons had been involved in civil disturbances. Police may only make arrests where there is a strong suspicion of a crime having been committed or where a person refused to obey police orders to move. There were no reports of arbitrary arrests. All persons placed under arrest were presented with a form for their signature that outlines their rights and options. Within 24 hours of the arrest they appear before a judge who rules on whether they need to remain in custody during the investigation. They were entitled to legal counsel.    The law prohibits forced exile, and the Government did not employ it.    e. Denial of Fair Public Trial    The Constitution and the law provide for an independent judiciary, and the Government generally respected this provision in practice.  There were two levels of courts. A five-member Judicial Council appointed by the Minister of Justice administered the eight district courts, and the Supreme Court administers itself. All judges, at all levels, served for life.    The law provides for the right to a fair trial, and an independent judiciary generally enforced this right. Juries were not used, but multijudge panels were common, particularly in the Supreme Court, which heard all appeals. Depending upon the seriousness of the case, a Supreme Court panel could have from three to seven judges. Defendants were presumed innocent and generally were tried without delay. They were provided access to legal counsel of their own choosing with sufficient time in general to prepare their defense. For defendants unable to pay attorneys' fees, the State covered the cost, as set by the court; however, defendants were required to reimburse the State. Defendants had the right to be present at their trial, to confront witnesses, and to participate in the proceedings. No groups were barred from testifying, and all testimony was treated alike. The courts had the discretion to allow the introduction of evidence obtained illegally by the police. With limited exceptions, trials were public and conducted fairly, with no official intimidation. Defendants had the right to appeal, and appeals were handled expeditiously.    There were no reports of political prisoners.    f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence    The Constitution prohibits such actions, and the Government generally respected these prohibitions in practice.    Scientists and privacy advocates criticized the Ministry of Health and Social Security's national medical data program as a threat to citizens' privacy. The Government maintained access to health records under the 1998 Act on the Health Sector Database without prior affirmative consent by citizens. Its purpose was national health planning and policy. The program is expected to be completed in 2003. During the year, approximately seven percent of citizens exercised their option not to participate in the program.    Section 2.   Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:    a. Freedom of Speech and Press    The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the press, and the Government generally respected these rights in practice. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combined to ensure freedom of speech and of the press. The law bans the production, exhibition, distribution, or sale of violent motion pictures, which strive to show mistreatment or the brutal killing of men or animals. A six-member Motion Picture Review Committee, appointed by the Minister of Education and Culture, reviewed all motion pictures before they were shown and rated their suitability for children.    The country had three national daily newspapers, numerous radio stations, and two television stations that broadcast news, one of which was state owned but journalistically independent. There were also numerous Internet magazines devoted to news and political debate.    Internet access was available and unrestricted.    The Government did not restrict academic freedom.    b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association    The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and association, and the Government generally respected these rights in practice; however, during the June visit of Chinese President Jiang Zemin, the Government attempted to prohibit approximately 100-120 Falun Gong practitioners from entering the country. Authorities asserted that they lacked the capacity, including facilities and officers, to maintain order and handle the assembly of hundreds of foreign followers of the spiritual movement, which is illegal in China. On June 11, police detained approximately 70 Falun Gong followers on their arrival at Keflavik International Airport; they were released late that night. The detainees did not allege mistreatment. Falun Gong representatives demanded an apology from the Government, which met them after significant pressure. On June 14, approximately 500 persons assembled peacefully in front of the parliament building (see Section 2.c.) to protest Chinese policies and Government actions against Falun Gong demonstrators. The Government's treatment of Falun Gong members provoked heavy criticism within the country from politicians, the media, and the public.    c. Freedom of Religion    The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respected this right in practice. The State financially supported and promoted the official religion, Lutheranism. The State directly paid the salaries of the 146 ministers in the State Lutheran Church, and these ministers were considered to be public servants under the Ministry of Justice and Ecclesiastical Affairs (MOJ); however, the Church was autonomous in its internal affairs. The Government did not pay Lutheran ministers in the nonstate churches, also known as Free Churches.    All citizens 16 years of age and older had to pay a church tax of approximately $73 (isk 6,800) per year. For persons who were not registered as belonging to a religious organization, or who belonged to one that was not registered and recognized officially by the Government, the tax payment went to the University of Iceland, a secular institution.    The law sets specific conditions and procedures that religious organizations must follow to be registered by the Government. Such recognition was necessary for religious organizations other than the state church to receive a per capita share of church tax funds from the Government. The law applies only to religious organizations that are seeking to be, or are already, officially recognized and registered. No restrictions or requirements were placed on unregistered religious organizations, which had the same rights as other groups in society.    By law religious instruction in Christianity is required in the public schools; however, students may be exempted.    In June Falun Gong followers from China experienced entry difficulty and detention in connection with the visit of Chinese President Jiang Zemin (see Section 2.b.).    For a more detailed discussion see the  2002 International Religious Freedom Report .    d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation    The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government generally respected them in practice.    Although neither the Constitution nor the law includes provisions for the granting of refugee or asylum status in accordance with the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, in practice the Government adjudicated cases in accordance with their provisions. The Government cooperated with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. In May the Government adopted the Act on Foreigners, which is scheduled to enter into force in January 2003. There was concern that the 1965 Supervision of Foreigners Law gives police and customs officers at ports of entry too much discretion to deny admission to asylum seekers whose claims they deem not credible. The new law will provide guidelines on the granting of asylum and refugee status, particularly that only the Directorate of Immigration will have the discretion to deny admission to asylum seekers.    In 2001 the country became part of the Schengen free travel area, resulting in the elimination of formal border controls on the movement of persons into the country from other Schengen countries.    The Government has not formulated a policy of first asylum. Because of the country's geographic isolation, the question of first asylum rarely has arisen; however, the Directorate of Immigration and the Icelandic Red Cross (which housed and assisted asylum seekers under a Government contract) reported that 94 persons had applied for asylum by October, compared with 52 in 2001. Of these 33 were sent to other countries and 60 withdrew their applications or disappeared. At year's end, the applications of 18 persons still were being processed. Most asylum seekers applied for asylum after entering the country, rather than in the international sector (airside) of the airport. Official asylum procedures require that asylum seekers who are admitted into the country be turned over immediately to the Icelandic Red Cross and the Directorate of Immigration for processing and care. Processing of asylum cases could take 1 year or more, during which time asylum seekers were eligible for state-subsidized health care but could not work or enroll their children in public schools.    In June Falun Gong supporters visiting from China were detained for a brief period (see Section 2.b.).    The Government planned to receive 10 to 15 UNHCR-designated quota refugees during the year, substantially fewer than in previous years. However, no refugees were accepted during the year due to a reduction in funding.    There were no reports of the forced return of persons to a country where they feared persecution.    Section 3.   Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Government    The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair elections held on the basis of universal suffrage. The last elections to the Althingi, the unicameral legislature, were held in 1999.    A center-right coalition has governed since 1991. The next national elections are scheduled for May 2003. There were 23 women in the 63-member Parliament, 3 women in the 12-member Cabinet, and 2 on the 9-member Supreme Court. In April the Government gave foreigners who have resided in the country legally for 5 years or more the right to vote in municipal elections.    Section 4.   Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights    A number of domestic and international human rights groups generally operated without government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials were cooperative and responsive to their views. An independent Ombudsman, elected by the Parliament, monitors national and local authorities to ensure equal protection of persons residing in the country, whether citizens or aliens. Complaints may be lodged with the Ombudsman regarding decisions, procedures, and conduct of public officials and government agencies. The Ombudsman may demand official reports, documents, and records and may summon officials to give testimony. The Ombudsman has access to official premises. While the Ombudsman's conclusions are not binding on the authorities, his recommendations normally have been followed, and he made annual reports of his work to the Parliament. There was also a Children's Ombudsman (see Section 5).    Section 5.   Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Disability, Language, or Social Status    The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on these factors. The population was strongly egalitarian and opposed discrimination based on any of these factors.  Women    The law prohibits domestic violence and rape, including spousal rape. Violence against women continued to be a problem, with gang rapes reportedly becoming more frequent during the year. Police statistics indicated that the incidence of violence against women--including rape and sexual assault--was low; however, the number of women seeking assistance at the public women's shelter, the counseling center, and the emergency ward of the National Hospital indicated that many incidents go unreported. Each year about 100 women ask for temporary lodging at the women's shelter, while 300 to 400 women and children seek assistance at the counseling center. During the year, they had 410 visitors, 225 of whom came to the center for the first time.   The Government helped finance various facilities and organizations that provided assistance to victims of violence. The City of Reykjavik, in addition to partially funding such services, provided help to immigrant women in abusive relationships, offering emergency accommodation, counseling, and information on legal rights. Courts could issue restraining orders. Victims of sexual crimes were entitled, under the Criminal Code, to lawyers to advise them of their legal rights and help them pursue cases against the alleged assailants. However, a large majority of victims declined to press charges or chose to forgo trial, in part to avoid unwanted publicity in a small, tightly knit society. Some local human rights monitors also attributed underreporting to the fact that convictions traditionally yield light sentences: The maximum penalty for rape is 16 years' imprisonment, but the actual sentences imposed typically are much closer to the minimum sentence of 1 year.   Prostitution is not illegal, but it is illegal to engage in prostitution as a main source of income. It is also illegal to act as an intermediary in the sale or procurement of sex. There were reports that some foreign women were trafficked to work as striptease dancers (see Section 6.f.).    The rate of participation by women in the labor market was high at over 80 percent. In part this reflected the country's comprehensive system of subsidized day care, which made work outside the home more affordable and convenient for parents. The law requires that preference be given to hiring and promoting women in areas where they are underrepresented, as long as they are equal in all other respects to male job seekers. Despite laws that require equal pay for equal work, a pay gap existed between men and women. According to one of the largest labor unions, women on average earned 16 percent less than men in 2001. A 12 percent difference in pay may be attributable to the fact that men work on average 4.2 hours more a week than women.    Fathers had the same right as mothers to paid leave upon the birth of a child. Under the law, which is expected to be fully implemented in 2003, both mothers and fathers would be allowed to take 3 months of paid leave (at 80 percent of the normal salary), with an additional 3 months that can be taken by either parent or shared between them. Previously a mother was given 6 months of paid maternity leave and the father just 2 weeks. The new leave requirements apply equally to the public and private sectors.    Children    The Government was strongly committed to children's rights and welfare; it amply funded a system of public education and health care. School attendance was compulsory through the age of 15 and free through public university level. Approximately 85 percent of students continued to upper secondary education, which was financed completely by the Government. The Government provided free prenatal and infant medical care, as well as heavily subsidized childcare. The Children's Ombudsman, appointed by the Prime Minister but independent from the Government, fulfilled its mandate to protect children's rights, interests, and welfare by, among other things, exerting influence on legislation, government decisions, and public attitudes. When investigating complaints, the Ombudsman had access to all of the country's public and private institutions and associations that house children or otherwise care for them. However, the Ombudsman's conclusions were not legally binding on parties to disputes. The government-funded Agency for Child Protection coordinated the work of approximately 40 committees around the country that were responsible for managing child protection issues (for example, adoption and foster care) in their local areas. In June, Law number 80/2002 article 7 went into effect, raising the minimum size of child protection areas from 200 to 1,500 inhabitants. The change was made to address concerns about conflicts of interest and improper influence. The law also took away the committees' power to terminate parental rights and provided that longer-term care decisions must be adjudicated in court. The Agency also operated eight treatment centers and a diagnostic facility for abused and troubled minors.    There was no societal pattern of abuse directed against children. In an effort to improve the rate of prosecution of child sexual abuse and lessen the trauma to the child, the Government established the Children's Assessment Center (Barnahus). The center, which handled 100 to 125 cases annually, was intended to create a safe and secure environment where child victims feel more comfortable talking about what happened to them. The center brought together police, prosecutors, judges, doctors, and officials from child protection services. Under a 2000 Supreme Court ruling, a district court judge could hold an investigatory interview in the courthouse rather than at the center. Human rights observers criticized this ruling as a step backward in the protection of children's rights.    Human rights observers also criticized the establishment of a national health database that included children. Medical records of children under the age of 18 automatically were entered into the database unless their legal guardians requested otherwise. On reaching the age of 18, a person could elect to discontinue their inclusion in the database, but information already stored could not be withdrawn (see Section 1.f.).    Persons with Disabilities    There was no reported discrimination against persons with disabilities in employment, education, or the provision of other state services. The law provides that such persons have the right to all common national and municipal services and provides that they be given assistance to make it possible for them to live and work normally in society. The law also provides that persons with disabilities receive preference for a government job when they are qualified equally, or more qualified, than regular applicants.    Building regulations require that public accommodations and government buildings, including elevators, be accessible to persons in wheelchairs. The regulations also specify that one percent of parking spaces (a minimum of one space) be reserved for persons with disabilities. The regulations also specify that, to the extent possible, the sidewalk outside the main entrance of such a building be heated so that it remains clear of ice and snow. Violations of these regulations are punishable by a fine or a jail sentence of up to 2 years; however, the main association for persons with disabilities has complained that enforcement is lax and that penalties rarely are assessed for noncompliance.    In 2000 the Supreme Court ruled that the reduction of social security payments to persons with disabilities based on the income of their spouses violated constitutional protections regarding equality and support for persons with disabilities. In response, Parliament in 2001 increased the minimum payment to persons with disabilities who have able-bodied spouses, but continued to subject benefits to a modified means test. The Association of Disabled Persons protested that the legislation did not comply with the Supreme Court ruling and challenged the law in court. The case was on appeal at year's end.   While significant progress has been made in addressing the concerns and needs of persons with physical disabilities, some mental health advocates criticized the Government for not devoting sufficient attention and resources to the care of persons with mental disabilities.    National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities    There is no law that prohibits organizations that promote and incite racial discrimination. The Prime Minister and others expressed concern that the rapidly increasing number of foreigners entering the country to meet labor shortages could lead to future problems, especially in the event of an economic downturn. According to the National Statistical Office, at the end of 2001, 9,850 foreigners were living in the country, approximately 3 percent of the population. Many temporary workers come from Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and the Directorate of Immigration expected most to seek to remain permanently rather than return to their countries of origin. The term nbar--newcomer--has taken on a negative connotation according to human rights observers and is increasingly applied to immigrants of color. Asian women in public at night reportedly were taunted on the assumption that they were prostitutes, and minority children were teased for allegedly having been purchased on the Internet. In September a Gallup Poll revealed that only 27 percent of citizens aged 45 to 54 had positive feelings toward foreigners; however, nearly half the 16- to 24-year-olds had positive feelings.    The City of Reykjavik, together with three other municipalities and the Icelandic Red Cross, operated an Intercultural Center that helps foreigners adjust to living in the country. The center offered free translation, education, research, and advice services. The Ministry of Social Affairs operated a Multicultural Center in Isafjordur that facilitated the interaction of citizens with foreign nationals and provided support services for foreign nationals in rural municipalities.    Human rights observers continued to express concern about a tiny ultranationalist organization, Iceland for Icelanders, which was founded in 1997 with the goal of limiting the further settlement of foreigners in the country to persons of European origin. In 2001 the Supreme Court fined the deputy leader of the organization for making disparaging remarks about foreigners in a newspaper interview.    Section 6.  Worker Rights    a. The Right of Association    The Constitution provides for the right of workers to establish unions, draw up their own constitutions and rules, choose their own leaders and policies, and publicize their views, and workers exercised these rights. Labor unions were independent of the Government and political parties. Approximately 85 percent of all eligible workers belonged to unions.    Labor courts effectively adjudicated disputes over contracts and over the rights provided by the law, which prohibits antiunion discrimination. By law employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union activities; however, in practice the charges often were difficult to prove.    Unions were permitted to affiliate internationally, and they took active part in Nordic, European, and other international trade union bodies.    b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively    Union membership is not impeded by law or practice. Employers were required to withhold union dues (one percent of gross pay) from the pay of all employees, whether or not they were union members, to help support disability, strike and pension funds and other benefits to which all workers are entitled. Trade unions and management organizations periodically negotiate collective bargaining agreements that set specific terms for workers' pay, hours, and other conditions. Collective bargaining agreements were negotiated in 2000, and most are scheduled to expire in 2003 and 2004. The Government played a minor role in the bargaining process, providing mediation assistance in a few cases (through the State Mediator's Office).    The Icelandic Federation of Labor (IFL) lost two lawsuits in 2001 in which it charged that Parliament's intervention in the fish industry strike violated the seamen's constitutional rights to associate freely and to bargain collectively (see Section 6.a.). In December 2001, the IFL made the same complaints to the International Labor Organization (ILO). The Government answered ILO questions in August, and the case remained open at the end of the year.    With the exception of limited categories of workers in the public sector whose services are essential to public health or safety, unions have the right to strike. There were no strikes during the year. There were no export processing zones.    c. Prohibition of Forced or Bonded Labor    The law prohibits forced or bonded labor, including by children, and there were no reports that such practices occurred. Work permit practices left newly arrived foreign workers vulnerable to abuse by employers (see Section 6.e.).    d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment    The law prohibits the employment of children younger than age 16 in factories, on ships, or in other places that are hazardous or require hard labor; this prohibition is observed in practice. Children 14 or 15 years old may be employed part time or during school vacations in light, nonhazardous work. Their work hours must not exceed the ordinary work hours of adults in the same occupation. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration enforced child labor regulations effectively.    e. Acceptable Conditions of Work    No minimum wage is mandated by law, but the minimum wages negotiated in various collective bargaining agreements applied automatically to all employees in those occupations, whether they were union members or not. Labor contracts provided a decent standard of living for a worker and family.    The standard legal workweek was 40 hours, which included nearly 3 hours of paid breaks a week. Work exceeding 8 hours in a workday must be compensated as overtime. Workers were entitled to 11 hours of rest within each 24-hour period and to a day off every week. Under defined special circumstances, the 11-hour rest period could be reduced to 8 hours, but workers would then have to be compensated with 1.5 hours of rest for every hour received less than 11 hours. The day off could be postponed by 1 week, in which case the worker had a right to 2 additional hours off the following week.    Health and safety standards were set by Parliament and administered and enforced by the Ministry of Social Affairs through its Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which could close down workplaces until safety and health standards were met. Workers had a collective, not an individual, right to refuse to work in a place that did not meet occupational safety and health criteria. Firing workers who report unsafe or unhealthy conditions was illegal.    The Government's practice of issuing work permits for newly arrived foreign workers or refugees to the employer rather than to the employee made workers vulnerable to abuse by the employer in some instances (see Section 5).    f. Trafficking in Persons    The law does not prohibit specifically trafficking in persons, although a number of legal provisions may be used to prosecute such cases. There were reports that women were trafficked to and within the country.    Article 206 of the Constitution specifies imprisonment for a conviction of facilitating a minor's entry or departure from the country if the purpose was commercial sex or if the victim was unaware of the genuine purpose, as through fraud. Criminal procedures also provide that victims may testify at government expense against traffickers. However, no person has ever been arrested or charged with trafficking in persons.    The 1984 Extradition Law provides that a person may be extradited as long as the offense involved would be punishable by more than 1 year's imprisonment. Article 206 of the general penal code provides for a sentence of up to 4 years imprisonment for an offense tantamount to trafficking in persons; therefore the law would allow the extradition of persons who were charged with trafficking in other countries.    Evidence of trafficking has been reported by police, NGOs, researchers and foreign diplomats, mainly in connection with foreign women who entered the country to work in striptease clubs. There was an assumption that some women travelling to Iceland to work in the country's striptease clubs were victims of trafficking. Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia and the former Soviet Union were the main countries of origin for these dancers, but there were no statistics on the number or origin of women actually trafficked. While most attention has been focused on the country as a possible destination point for trafficked women, there have been some cases during the year that indicated that the country was also being used as a transit point for the movement of trafficked women between Europe and North America. There were no reliable estimates on how many women this may have involved.    Parliament in 2000 closed a loophole that allowed striptease dancers to enter the country as artists and perform without a work permit for up to 4 weeks. Subsequently, in order to work as a striptease dancer, any foreigner from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) was required first to obtain a work permit, which was typically valid for 3 months. Due to the action of government authorities in denying work and residence permits, the influx of nightclub dancers from outside the EEA slowed considerably in the second half of 2001. During the year the number of foreign dancers plummeted following a ban by Reykjavik authorities on private dances that served as a front for prostitution. At the end of the year, club owners were contesting the ban in the courts.    There were two cases since 2001 of foreign striptease dancers complaining to police that a club owner had pressured them into prostitution. The police investigation, which involved a total of six women from Estonia and Denmark, concluded without any charges being brought against the club owner. Foreign embassies reported that they had helped to repatriate women who realized upon arrival that they had been deceived concerning the work that they were expected to perform. Many employers required their dancers to live in small, crowded group houses provided by the clubs. Some clubs allegedly restricted their dancers' movement, enforced a curfew, and kept dancers under constant surveillance, confiscating their passports and airline tickets and warning them not to fraternize with persons outside work. The club owners reportedly limited the dancers' stay in the country to minimize the number of contacts that the women could make, moving them quickly to the next country and job.    Victims of trafficking could seek help at the women's shelter, counseling center, and hospital, all of which were government funded. There were no domestic NGOs dedicated solely to assisting victims of trafficking, nor was there an established government assistance program. Some NGOs provided government-supported counseling and shelter to women and children who were victims of violence or sexual abuse. The Icelandic Human Rights Center, which is also government funded, assisted with trafficking cases and made referrals (see Section 5).    There were no ongoing information, public awareness, or other antitrafficking programs during the year.
GX048-67-2130742	"United States Embassy Stockholm                                                       Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2001                   Released by the Bureau of Democracy,                   Human Rights, and Labor                   U.S. Department of State                                                        ICELAND                                          March 2002                                                                              Index  |   Introduction  |  Preface  |   Overview  |   Africa  |  East Asia  |   Europe  |   The West  |   Near East  |  South Asia  |   Appendices                        Iceland is a constitutional republic and a parliamentary democracy in which citizens periodically choose their representatives in free and fair multiparty elections.  The Government respects the constitutional provisions for an independent judiciary in practice.    Elected officials control the police force, which is responsible for internal security and observes and enforces the laws that ensure the protection of human rights.   The country has a population of approximately 286,000.  The mixed, open economy provides residents with a high standard of living.  The gross domestic product during the year was estimated at $8 billion.  Fish and other marine products account for almost two-thirds of the country's revenue from goods exports.  An abundance of inexpensive hydroelectric power provides a comparative advantage for aluminum smelting, the main manufacturing activity.  Aluminum is the second leading export.  Growth was estimated to be approximately 2 percent during the year.   The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law and judiciary provide effective means of dealing with individual instances of abuse.  Human rights monitors expressed concern about the Government's frequent use of solitary confinement for remand prisoners.  The Government is taking steps to deal with violence against women.  Some societal discrimination against women persists, especially in the area of equal pay.  There were reports of trafficking in women for prostitution.   RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS   Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:    a. Arbitrary or Unlawful Deprivation of Life   There were no reports of the arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of life committed by the Government or its agents.     b. Disappearance   There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.   c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment   The law prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that government officials employed them.     Prison conditions generally meet international standards.  Most of the country's prison population of less than 100 inmates are held at Litla Hraun Prison, which includes a state-of-the-art detention facility.  However, the prison system still uses a substandard jail (Hegningarhusid, built in 1874), where the 16 individual cells lack toilets and sinks.  In most cases, prisoners are kept in Hegningarhusid Prison only a short time for evaluation and processing before being transferred to another facility, and some prisoners with short sentences (less than 30 days) elect to serve their time there to be closer to friends and family.   Human rights monitors have expressed concern about the use of illegal drugs by some inmates at Litla Hraun Prison and about the lack of social services to help inmates overcome drug addiction and prepare them for eventual release.  Despite the small inmate population at Litla Hraun, the authorities have not been able to stop narcotics from being smuggled into the prison.   In a 1999 report, the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) expressed concern that nearly all detainees at Litla Hraun continued to be placed in solitary confinement while their cases were under investigation.  While the average duration of solitary confinement was between 2 and 3 weeks, the CPT noted that in some cases, solitary confinement lasted up to 3 months.  Under the strictest form of solitary confinement, prisoners cannot leave their cells, except briefly to exercise alone or to use the showers, and are not allowed to listen to the radio, watch television, or receive visitors other than their lawyers, the prison doctor, and a chaplain.  In 1999 the supervising doctor at Litla Hraun wrote to prison authorities, warning that the mental health of several prisoners awaiting trial on drug trafficking charges could be in danger due to the extended time that they spent in solitary confinement.  During the year, the ombudsman of the Parliament investigated the use of solitary confinement as a punishment for violations of prison regulations.  He concluded that the Ministry of Justice needed to adopt clearer guidelines to prevent the arbitrary use of solitary confinement by prison authorities.   Despite the Government's admission that ""in the vast majority of cases"" incarceration alone was sufficient to protect the integrity of the investigative process, witnesses, and evidence,  the Prison and Probation Administration's statistics show that solitary confinement was the rule rather than the exception, and that most of those arrested were placed into solitary confinement, at least initially.  During the first 11 months of the year, 78 of the 86 persons arrested and held on remand were put into solitary confinement, each for an average of 4 weeks.  The police decide whether persons should be put in solitary confinement, but the accused may appeal this decision to the courts, which have the final say.  Inmates occasionally have appealed solitary confinement, but the courts in general have allowed the police considerable leeway during the first 2 to 3 weeks of incarceration.  The courts have been less willing to allow continued solitary confinement after that time.   A 1998 law allows pretrial detainees to be incarcerated with the general prison population; some human rights monitors have criticized this law.  During the year, the Government budgeted planning funds for a new remand prison just outside of Reykjavik; however, construction had not begun by year's end.    Juveniles who are 15 years of age or older may be sentenced to prison terms, but the vast majority of juvenile offenders are given probation, suspended sentences, or attend a treatment program instead of going to jail.  In the rare instances when juvenile offenders are incarcerated, they are confined with the adult prison population since there is no separate detention facility for juveniles.  The Government has argued that such separation is not practical since the need to incarcerate a juvenile occurs so infrequently.    There is a separate minimum-security prison for women inmates.  But because so few women are incarcerated, some men who have been convicted of nonviolent crimes are held there as well (with the approval of the women inmates).   The Government permits prison visits by independent human rights monitors, including by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).    d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile   The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention, and the Government generally observes these prohibitions.  There was a report that police detained an asylum seeker at the airport during the year contrary to established procedures for asylum processing (see Section 2.d.).   The law prohibits forced exile, and the Government does not employ it.    e. Denial of Fair Public Trial   The Constitution and the law provide for an independent judiciary, and the Government generally respects this provision in practice.     There are two levels of courts.  A five-member Judicial Council appointed by the Minister of Justice administers the eight district courts, and the Supreme Court administers itself.  All judges, at all levels, serve for life.    The law provides for the right to a fair trial, and an independent judiciary generally enforces this right.  Juries are not used, but multijudge panels are common, especially in the Supreme Court, which hears all appeals.  Depending on the seriousness of the case, a Supreme Court panel can include from three to seven judges.  Defendants are presumed innocent and generally are tried without delay.  They are provided access to legal counsel of their own choosing with sufficient time in general to prepare their defense.  For defendants unable to pay attorneys' fees, the state covers the cost, as set by the court; however, defendants are required to reimburse the state.  Defendants have the right to be present at their trial, to confront witnesses, and to participate in the proceedings.  No groups are barred from testifying, and all testimony is treated alike.  The courts have the discretion to allow the introduction of evidence obtained illegally by the police.  With limited exceptions, trials are public and conducted fairly, with no official intimidation.  Defendants have the right to appeal, and appeals are handled expeditiously.   There were no reports of political prisoners.   f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence   The Constitution prohibits such actions, and the Government generally respects these prohibitions in practice.    Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:    a. Freedom of Speech and Press   The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the press, and the Government generally respects these rights in practice.  An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.   The law bans the production, exhibition, distribution, or sale of ""violent"" movies, which ""strive to show mistreatment or the brutal killing of men or animals.""  A six-member Motion Picture Review Committee, appointed by the Minister of Education and Culture, reviews all movies before they are shown and rates their suitability for children.  The committee has banned or required edits of several dozen films over the past 6 years.   Internet access is available and unrestricted.    b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association   The Constitution provides for the freedoms of assembly and association, and the Government generally respects these rights in practice.    c. Freedom of Religion   The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respects this right in practice; however, the State financially supports and promotes an official religion, Lutheranism.     The salaries of the 146 ministers in the Lutheran state church are paid directly by the state, and these ministers are considered to be public servants under the Ministry of Justice and Ecclesiastical Affairs.  The Government does not pay Lutheran ministers in the nonstate churches.                               All citizens 16 years of age and above must pay a church tax of approximately $5.50 (554.24 krona) per month.  Individuals may direct their tax payments to any of the two dozen religious denominations and organizations officially recognized by the Government, including the State Lutheran Church.  For individuals who are not registered as belonging to a religious organization, or who belong to one that is not registered and recognized officially by the Government, the tax payment goes to the University of Iceland, a secular institution.   Children at birth are presumed to have the same religious affiliation as their mother and are registered as such.  Parents control the religious affiliation of their children until they reach the age of 16, but parents must ""consult"" their children about any changes in the children's affiliation after the age of 12.   By law religious instruction in Christianity is required in the public schools; however, students may be exempted.   By law religious organizations must follow specific conditions and procedures in order to be recognized officially and registered by the Government.  Such recognition is necessary for religious organizations other than the state church to receive a per capita share of church tax funds from the Government.  The law applies only to religious organizations that are seeking to be, or are already, officially recognized and registered.  No restrictions or requirements are placed on unregistered religious organizations, which have the same rights as other groups in society.    d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation   The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government generally respects them in practice.    Although neither the Constitution nor the law includes provisions for the granting of refugee or asylum status in accordance with the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, in practice the Government adjudicates cases in accordance with their provisions.  The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the ICRC, and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees.  Human rights monitors have expressed concern about the lack of comprehensive legislation to govern the processing of asylum seekers and to provide a framework for the handling of foreigners and immigrants in general.  In particular there is concern that the 1965 Supervision of Foreigners Law gives police and custom officers at ports of entry too much discretion to deny admission to asylum seekers whose claims they deem to be not credible.  During the year, the police at the international airport in Keflavik reported that they denied entry to 21 asylum seekers on that basis.   The question of first asylum rarely arises.  However, the Directorate of Immigration and the Icelandic Red Cross (which houses and assists asylum seekers under a contract with the Government) reported that 51 individuals applied for asylum during the year, compared with 24 in 2000.  Most asylum seekers applied for asylum after entering the country, rather than at the airport; none were found to qualify for refugee status, but several cases were still under consideration at year's end.  Only one asylum application has ever been approved, that of a 17-year-old individual who claimed to be fleeing from persecution in Central Africa.  During the year, there was a report that police detained for 3 days an Iraqi man who claimed asylum upon arrival at the airport, before returning him to the United Kingdom--his last stop before coming to Iceland.  This was contrary to established asylum procedures, which require that asylum seekers who are admitted into the country be turned over immediately to the Red Cross and the Directorate of Immigration for processing and care.  Iceland became part of the Schengen free travel area on March 25, which resulted in the elimination of formal border controls on the movement of persons into Iceland from other Schengen countries.   The Government accepted 23 UNHCR-designated ""quota"" refugees from the former Yugoslavia during the year, continuing a program begun in 1996 of resettling 20 to 25 refugees from the region each year.  Local government authorities in the towns where refugees settle take a strong interest in helping them adapt to their new environment.  The Icelandic Red Cross, in cooperation with the Refugee Council of the Ministry of Social Affairs, has developed a family support program whereby at least three Icelandic families are enlisted to assist each refugee or refugee family.  The refugees are granted work permits and assisted in finding jobs.  For the first year, they also are given free housing, utilities, and health care and receive a stipend so that they can participate daily in a special half-day language course.    There were no reports of the forced return of persons to a country where they feared persecution.   Section 3 Respect for Political Rights:  The Right of Citizens to Change Their Government   The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair elections held on the basis of universal suffrage.  The latest elections to the Althingi (unicameral Parliament) were held in May 1999.   The percentage of women in government and politics does not correspond to their percentage of the population, but no legal or practical impediments hinder their participation.  Women hold 23 of the 63 seats in Parliament.  Of the 12 government ministers, 3 are women, and 2 of 12 ministerial permanent secretaries (civil servants who function as deputy ministers) are women.  Of the nine Supreme Court justices, two are women.  There has been a marked increase in the number of female parliamentarians elected since the Women's List (WL), a feminist political party, was founded in 1983.  The WL, which no longer exists because of a political party merger, forced the established political parties to nominate more female candidates or face losing support.  As a result, women's issues moved into the mainstream of political debate, and all of the major political parties have at least one woman in a prominent leadership position.    Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights   A number of domestic and international human rights groups in general operate without government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases.  Government officials are cooperative and responsive to their views.   Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or Social Status   The law prohibits discrimination based on these factors, and the Government enforces this prohibition in practice.  The population is strongly egalitarian and opposed to discrimination based on any of these factors.      Women   Violence against women continued to be a matter of concern.  Police statistics show that the incidence of violence against women--including rape and sexual assault--is low; however, the number of women seeking assistance at the public women's shelter, the counseling center, and the emergency ward of the National Hospital indicates that many incidents go unreported.  Each year approximately 100 women ask for temporary lodging at the women's shelter, while 300 to 400 women and children seek assistance at the counseling center.  The hospital emergency ward, which has a special staff to care for rape victims, reports that during the year, 134 women sought care associated with sexual assault or abuse.  The law prohibits domestic violence and rape, including spousal rape.   The Government takes violence against women seriously; it helps finance various facilities and organizations that provide assistance to victims.  The City of Reykjavik, in addition to partially funding such services, provides special help to immigrant women who find themselves in abusive relationships, offering emergency accommodation, counseling, and information on legal rights.  In 2000 Parliament passed legislation that gives the courts the power to issue restraining orders, which has been a useful legal tool in protecting women from abusive husbands and boyfriends.  In 1999 the Government amended the Criminal Code to provide victims of sexual crimes with lawyers to advise them of their legal rights and help them pursue cases against the alleged assailants.   Nonetheless a large majority of victims decline to press charges or choose to forgo trial, in part to avoid unwanted publicity in a small, tightly knit society.  Some local human rights monitors also attribute underreporting to the fact that convictions traditionally yield light sentences:  The maximum penalty for rape is 16 years, but the actual sentences imposed typically are much closer to the minimum sentence of 1 year.   The sale of sex for money is not illegal per se, but it is against the law for someone to engage in prostitution as his or her main source of income.  It is also illegal to act as an intermediary in the sale or procurement of sex.  There were indications that some foreign women were trafficked to work as striptease dancers or prostitutes (see Sections 6.c. and 6.f.).   The rate of participation by women in the labor market is high.  In part this reflects the country's comprehensive system of subsidized day care, which makes it affordable and convenient for women to work outside the home.  The law requires that preference be given to hiring and promoting women in areas where they are underrepresented, as long as they are equal in all other respects to male job seekers.  Despite laws that require equal pay for equal work, a sizeable pay gap continues to exist between men and women:  A 2000 survey by a union in Reykjavik showed that women, on average, earned 30 percent less than men.  A 12 percent difference in pay may be attributable to the fact that men work on average 4.2 more hours per week than women, but the rest of the gap is unexplained.   In 2000 Parliament passed legislation that gives fathers the same right as mothers to paid leave upon the birth of a child.  Under the law, which is expected to be fully implemented in 2003, both mothers and fathers will be allowed to take 3 months of paid leave (at 80 percent of the normal salary), with an additional 3 months that can be taken by either parent or shared between them.  Previously a mother was given 6 months of paid maternity leave and the father just 2 weeks.  The new leave requirements apply equally to the public and private sectors.      Children   The Government is strongly committed to children's rights and welfare; it amply funds a system of public education and health care.  School attendance is compulsory through the age of 15 and free through public university level.  Approximately 85 percent of students continue to upper secondary education, which is financed completely by the Government.  The Government provides free prenatal and infant medical care, as well as heavily subsidized childcare.  The Office of the Children's Ombudsman in the Prime Minister's Office has a mandate to protect children's rights, interests, and welfare by, among other things, exerting influence on legislation, government decisions, and public attitudes and has done so.   The government-funded Agency for Child Protection coordinates the work of 56 committees around the country that are responsible for managing child protection issues (for example, adoption and foster care) in their local areas.  The agency also investigates reports of child abuse through a specially designed ""Children's House"" (Barnahusid) and operates treatment centers for abused and troubled minors.   There is no societal pattern of abuse directed against children.   In an effort to improve the rate of prosecution of child sexual abuse and lessen the trauma to the child, the Government established the Children's Assessment Center in 1998.  The objective of the center is to create a safe and secure environment where child victims feel more comfortable talking about what happened to them and are not subjected to multiple interviews.  The center brings together police, prosecutors, judges, doctors, and officials from child protection services.  However, a 1999 change in the Criminal Code made judges (instead of the police) responsible for the investigatory interview of abused children and allowed these interviews to be conducted in specially designed rooms at district courthouses.  In 2000 the Supreme Court upheld the right of a Reykjavik district court judge to hold an investigatory interview in the courthouse rather than at the center, which has led to a significant decrease in the child sexual abuse cases being handled through the center.  Human rights monitors criticized this as a step backward in the protection of children's rights.     Persons with Disabilities   Persons with disabilities are not subject to discrimination in employment, education, or the provision of other state services.  The law provides that such persons have the right to ""all common national and municipal services"" and provides that they be given assistance to ""make it possible for them to live and work in normal society with others.""  The law also provides that persons with disabilities should receive preference for a government job when they are qualified equally, or more qualified, than regular applicants.   Building regulations updated in 1998 call for public accommodations--such as hotels, restaurants, banks, and stores--as well as government buildings to be accessible so that persons in wheelchairs have access without assistance.  Building regulations also specify that elevators in such buildings should be large enough to accommodate wheelchairs and that 1 percent of parking spaces (a minimum of one space) should be reserved for disabled use.  Moreover, the regulations also specify that, to the extent possible, the sidewalk outside the main entrance of a public accommodation or government building should be heated so that it remains clear of ice and snow throughout the winter.  The law provides that violations of these regulations are punishable by a fine or a jail sentence of up to 2 years; however, the country's main association for persons with disabilities complains that enforcement is lax and that penalties rarely are assessed for noncompliance.     Access to new buildings tends to be good, while efforts to make old buildings more accessible have lagged.  A government committee was surveying systematically all state-owned buildings in the country to evaluate their accessibility.  The Reykjavik city government, in cooperation with local associations representing bicycle riders and the blind, has been beveling sidewalks at intersections throughout the city to facilitate the movement of pedestrians, bicyclists, and persons in wheelchairs.  The city is spending approximately $175,000 (17.5 million krona) a year on this project, which it aims to have completed by 2006.       In 2000 the Supreme Court ruled that the extent to which the State was reducing social security payments to persons with disabilities based on the income of their able-bodied spouses was unconstitutional.  The Court stated that the significant cuts in social security payments as a result of means testing violated constitutional protections regarding equality and support for persons with disabilities.  In reaction to the ruling, Parliament passed legislation in January that increased the minimum payment to persons with disabilities who have able-bodied spouses.  However, their social security benefits continued to be subject to a modified form of means testing.  The Association of Disabled Persons protested that the legislation did not comply with the Supreme Court ruling and challenged the new law in court.  There was no ruling by year's end.   While significant progress has been made in the last few years in addressing the concerns and needs of persons with physical disabilities, some mental health advocates fault the Government for not devoting sufficient attention and resources to the care of persons with mental disabilities.     National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities   Concern has been voiced, including by the Prime Minister, that the rapidly increasing number of foreigners being brought into the country to meet the labor shortage in fish processing and other less desirable occupations could lead to future problems, especially in the event of an economic downturn.  At the end of 2000, 8,824 foreigners were living in the country, or approximately 3 percent of the population, according to the National Statistical Office.  However, persons of foreign origin constituted 4 or 5 percent of the population when account was taken of individuals who were born in foreign countries but have since become citizens.  New work and residence permits were issued at a rate of approximately 150 per month during the year.  Many of these ""temporary"" workers come from Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and the Directorate of Immigration expected most of them to seek to remain permanently rather than return to their countries of origin.  According to a 2000 opinion poll, 85 percent of foreigners were content with living in Iceland, and 40 percent were ""unlikely"" to return to their country of origin.   For several years, the City of Reykjavik has operated a highly regarded Intercultural Center that helps foreigners adjust to living in the country.  In December the City of Reykjavik, in cooperation with surrounding towns and local NGO's, opened a larger and better staffed International House to replace the Intercultural Center.   Human rights monitors continued to express concern about an ultranationalist organization called ""Iceland for Icelanders,"" which was founded in 1997 with the goal of limiting the further settlement of foreigners in the country to persons of European origin.  In April the deputy leader of the organization was indicted for making disparaging remarks about foreigners in a newspaper interview.  In October he was found guilty and fined $300 (30,000 krona).  There is no law that prohibits organizations that promote and incite racial discrimination.   Section 6 Worker Rights    a. The Right of Association   Workers make extensive use of the right provided by the Constitution to establish unions, draw up their own constitutions and rules, choose their own leaders and policies, and publicize their views.  The resulting organizations are independent of the Government and political parties.  Approximately 85 percent of all eligible workers belong to unions.    With the exception of limited categories of workers in the public sector whose services are essential to public health or safety, unions have the right to strike.  During the year, there were minor strikes by air traffic controllers, hospital nurses, nurse assistants, physical therapists, municipal employees, and music teachers.  In April and May, there was also a 6-week seamen's strike, which brought the fishing industry to a standstill.  Concerned about the strike's effect on the economy, Parliament passed a law in May ordering the seamen to return to work and providing that the dispute be referred to binding arbitration.  The arbitration panel handed down its decision in June, which was accepted by all parties (see Section 6.b.).   Unions are permitted to affiliate internationally, and they take active part in Nordic, European, and other international trade union bodies.    b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively   Union membership is not impeded by law or practice.  Employers are required to withhold union dues (1 percent of gross pay) from the pay of all employees, whether or not they are union members, to help support, among other benefits, disability, strike, and pension funds to which all workers are entitled.    The various trade unions and management organizations periodically negotiate collective bargaining agreements that set specific terms for workers' pay, hours, and other conditions.  Collective bargaining agreements were negotiated in 2000, and most will expire in either 2003 or 2004.  The Government played only a minor role in the bargaining process, providing mediation assistance in a few cases (through the State Mediator's Office) while generally encouraging wage restraint to limit inflation.  The new contracts provide that if inflation exceeds expectations during the first year, the unions have the right to seek renegotiation of the wage terms.    The Icelandic Federation of Labor (IFL) filed lawsuits in June and again in November charging that Parliament's intervention in the fish industry strike violated the seamen's constitutional rights to associate freely and to bargain collectively (see Section 6.a.).  The case was ongoing at year's end.  In December the IFL also filed a complaint about the Government's action with the International Labor Organization.     Labor courts effectively adjudicate disputes over contracts and over the rights provided for under the law, which prohibits antiunion discrimination.  By law employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union activities; however, in practice the charges often are difficult to prove.   There are no export processing or other special economic zones.    c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor   Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law; however, some women reportedly were trafficked into the country to work as striptease dancers or prostitutes (see Sections 5 and 6.f.).  In addition work permit practices left newly arrived foreign workers vulnerable to abuse by employers (see Section 6.e.).     The law prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, and there were no reports that such practices occur.   d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment   The law prohibits the employment of children younger than age 16 in factories, on ships, or in other places that are hazardous or require hard labor; this prohibition is observed in practice.  Children 14 or 15 years old may be employed part time or during school vacations in light, nonhazardous work.  Their work hours must not exceed the ordinary work-hours of adults in the same occupation.  The Occupational Safety and Health Administration enforces child labor regulations effectively.   The Government ratified ILO Convention 182 on the worst forms of child labor in 2000, and it entered into force in May.   The law prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, and such practices are not known to occur (see Section 6.c.).    e. Acceptable Conditions of Work   No minimum wage is mandated by law, but the minimum wages negotiated in various collective bargaining agreements apply automatically to all employees in those occupations, whether they are union members or not.  Labor contracts afford even the lowest paid workers a sufficient income for a decent standard of living for themselves and their families.   Workers are protected by laws that effectively provide for their health and safety as well as for unemployment insurance, paid vacations, pensions, and reasonable working conditions and hours.  The standard legal workweek is 40 hours, which includes nearly 3 hours of paid breaks per week.  Work exceeding 8 hours in a workday must be compensated as overtime.  Under changes that took effect during 2000, workers are entitled to 11 hours of rest (up from 10 hours previously) within each 24-hour period and to a day off every week.  Under defined special circumstances, the 11-hour rest period can be reduced to 8 hours, but workers must then be compensated with 1.5 hours of rest for every hour received less than 11 hours.  The day off can be postponed by a week, in which case the worker has a right to 2 additional hours off in the following week.  Health and safety standards are set by Parliament and administered and enforced by the Ministry of Social Affairs through its Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which can and does close down workplaces until safety and health standards are met.  Workers have a collective, not an individual, right to refuse to work in a place that does not meet the criteria of occupational safety and health.  Firing workers who report unsafe or unhealthy conditions is illegal.   Human rights monitors expressed concern that in the case of newly arrived foreign workers or refugees (i.e., those who have been in the country for less than 3 years), the Government's practice of issuing applicable work permits to the employer rather than to the employee has left the worker vulnerable to abuse by the employer in some instances (see Section 5).    f. Trafficking in Persons   The law does not prohibit specifically trafficking in persons, although a number of legal provisions may be used to prosecute such cases; trafficking was suspected in connection with the hundreds of foreign women who entered the country to work in striptease clubs.  The main concern was that some of the women, especially those from Eastern and Central Europe, were being brought to Iceland under false pretenses and then coerced to work as striptease dancers or prostitutes.  While most attention has been focused on Iceland as a possible destination point for trafficked women, there were some cases during the year that indicated that the country was also being used as a transit point for the movement of trafficked women between mainland Europe and North America.  There were no reliable estimates on how many women this may involve.   In May, for the first time, formal charges of coercion were filed against a club.  Four striptease dancers from Estonia told police that a club owner had pressured them into prostitution.  Two Danish dancers lodged a similar complaint against the same employer.  As of year's end, the cases remained under investigation, and no arrests had been made.   Parliament passed legislation in 2000 that closed a loophole that allowed striptease dancers to enter the country and perform without a work permit for up to 4 weeks under an exemption given for ""artists.""  Any foreigner (except those from the European Economic Area) seeking to come to the country to work as a striptease dancer must first obtain a work permit, which is typically valid for 3 months.  However, the Government has not yet put any numerical limits or other controls on the issuance of work permits for foreign striptease dancers.  The clubs are allowed to bring in as many dancers as they want.   For the first several months that the new system was in place, the IFL vetted the work permit applications of foreign striptease dancers and ensured that their contracts afforded the minimal labor protections.  However, the IFL announced in March that it would no longer take part in this process.  Citing the suspicious circumstances under which these dancers come and work in Iceland, the IFL said it did not want to assist unwittingly in human trafficking.  However, the Directorate of Labor decided that under the existing law, it had no choice but to continue issuing the work permits, even without the review of the IFL.   Human right monitors were critical of the fact that the striptease clubs continued to operate with few, if any, restrictions on their operations.  There are no regulations, for example, mandating a minimal distance between dancers and patrons.  A study on prostitution, commissioned by the Ministry of Justice and released in March, concluded that organized prostitution existed at some, if not all, of the striptease clubs.  In the absence of national legislation, some municipalities have taken action on their own to prohibit the opening of striptease clubs within their jurisdictions.  The City of Reykjavik was moving to restrict the location of new clubs to designated areas only.  However, the changes were not expected to be retroactive and would not affect the existing clubs, most of which were located downtown.   Victims may seek assistance at the women's shelter, counseling center, and hospital, which are all government funded (see Section 5).

GX052-31-9919825	U.S. Department of State     Iceland Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 1996     Released by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, January 30, 1997.        ICELAND     Iceland is a constitutional republic and a multiparty parliamentary democracy. Its people participate in high percentages in regular, free, and fair elections which determine the distribution of power among political parties and leaders.     Elected officials control the police force, which scrupulously observes and enforces the laws that ensure protection of human rights.     Iceland has a mixed, open economy, in which citizens have the right to hold private property. It provides residents with a high standard of living. The leading export, marine products, accounts for almost 80 percent of export revenues.     The Government fully respects the human rights of its citizens, and the law and judiciary provide effective means of dealing with instances of individual abuse. There is some societal discrimination against women, which the Government has begun to address.     RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS      Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from :     a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing     There were no reports of political or other extrajudicial killings.     b. Disappearance     There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.     c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment     Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment are prohibited by law and do not occur. Prison conditions are good, but most prisons are full, and many are antiquated. The Government has begun a construction program to alleviate these difficulties.     d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile     The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.     e. Denial of Fair Public Trial     The Constitution and law provide for an independent judiciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice. The Ministry of Justice administers the lower court system, while the Supreme Court guards its independence and fairness. Juries are not used, but multijudge panels are common, especially in the appeals process. All judges, at all levels, serve for life.     The judiciary provides citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process. Defendants are presumed innocent. They are guaranteed the right of access to legal counsel of their own choosing in time to prepare their defense. For defendants unable to pay attorneys' fees, the State assumes the cost. Defendants have the right to be present at their trial, to confront witnesses, and to participate otherwise in the proceedings. No groups are barred from testifying, and all testimony is treated alike. Trials are public and are conducted fairly, with no official intimidation. Defendants have the right to appeal.     There were no reports of political prisoners.     f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence     The Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.     Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including :     a. Freedom of Speech and Press     The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.     b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association     The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.     c. Freedom of Religion     Although the official state religion is Lutheranism, the Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government respects this right in practice.     d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation     The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government respects them in practice. The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. There were no reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status. The issue of the provision of first asylum did not arise in 1996. The Government responded to the UNHCR's request that it take in refugees from the former Yugoslavia by accepting 31 in 1996. The Icelandic Red Cross and the town of Isafjordur, where the refugees were settled, made significant efforts to begin incorporating them into Icelandic society.     Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Government      The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair elections held on the basis of universal suffrage. The most recent elections to the Althing (unicameral Parliament) were held in April 1995.     There are no legal or practical impediments to women's participation in government and politics. There is an active feminist political party, the Women's List, which won 3 of 63 seats in the 1995 parliamentary elections.     Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights      A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.     Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or Social Status      The culture of the ethnically homogeneous population is strongly egalitarian and opposed to discrimination based on any of these factors. Government legislation and practice generally reflect this attitude.     Women     Increased governmental awareness of violence against women, resulting from extensive media coverage, has led to stiffening of sentencing for sex offenders. The tougher sentencing derives from improved action by the courts in more strictly enforcing existing laws. A police program to train officers in correct interrogation procedures in rape and sexual abuse cases appears to be addressing prior concerns that police indifference and hostility to female victims did not assure victims of such abuses proper attention and consideration.     There is a public women's shelter that offers protection to approximately 350 women and 200 children per year; these figures are virtually unchanged since 1995. There is also a rape trauma center sponsored and operated by women's organizations; some 400 women and children seek assistance annually. Both facilities are funded by national and municipal governments, and private contributions. The Reykjavik City Hospital emergency ward has an all-female staff to care for rape victims. During the year the emergency ward reported 76 visits associated with incidents of rape or sexual abuse. Hospital officials estimate that only 55 percent of these victims press charges and only a handful of cases actually go to trial, attributing this to fear of publicity in such a small, tight-knit society.     The Women's List political movement and the female Mayor of Reykjavik have kept women's issues in the forefront of public debate. The 1996 Conservative Independence Party convention focused on increasing the political participation of women and on women's issues in general. While major political institutions and businesses remain male dominated, the Government is taking steps to enforce legislation requiring equal pay for equal work. The 20 percent gap in earnings between men and women in comparable jobs narrowed somewhat nationally but dropped significantly in Reykjavik to 10 to 15 percent.     Since 1991 complaints regarding the Equal Rights Law have been referred to a special committee under the Equal Rights Affairs Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs. However, the committee has only advisory powers, and its recommendations to employers do not have the force of law. Few complaints are made to the committee.     Children     The Government demonstrates its strong commitment to children's rights through its well-funded systems of public education and medical care. The Government provides free prenatal and infant medical care, as well as heavily subsidized children's care. Compulsory education ends in the 10th grade. About 85 percent of students continue to upper secondary education, which is financed completely by the State. In 1994 the Government created the Office of the Children's Ombudsman in the Prime Ministry, with a mandate to protect children's rights, interests, and welfare by, among other things, exerting influence on legislation, government decisions, and public attitudes. The Parliament ratified the Hague Convention on Child Abduction which entered into force in December. This action is expected to facilitate the handling of international child custody cases.     There is no societal pattern of abuse directed against children.     People with Disabilities     Disabled individuals are not subject to discrimination in employment, education, or provision of other state services. The Government has legislated accessibility to public buildings for the disabled.     Section 6 Worker Rights      a. The Right of Association     Workers make extensive use of the right to establish organizations, draw up their own constitutions and rules, choose their own leaders and policies, and publicize their views. The resulting organizations are controlled neither by the Government nor any single political party. Unions take active part in Nordic, European, and international trade union bodies. With the exception of limited categories of workers in the public sector whose services are essential to public health or safety, unions have had and used the right to strike for many years. Some 76 percent of all eligible workers belong to unions.     b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively     There are no impediments to union membership in law or in practice. Virtually all unions exercise their right to bargain collectively. The central labor and management organizations periodically negotiate collective bargaining agreements that set nationwide standards and specific terms for workers' pay, workhours, and other conditions. The Government often plays a role in the negotiations, and sometimes undertakes commitments in order to bring the two sides together. Labor courts effectively adjudicate disputes over contracts and over the rights provided for in the 1938 Act on Trade Unions and Industrial Disputes, which prohibits antiunion discrimination.     By law, employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union activities. In practice, the charges are difficult to prove.     In May the Parliament passed legislation updating the labor laws and bringing them into compliance with the European human rights convention.     There are no export processing or other special economic zones.     c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor     Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law and does not occur.     d. Minimum Age for Employment of Children     The law requires children to attend school until the age of 16 years and prohibits employment of children under that age in factories, on ships, or in other places that are hazardous or require hard labor. This prohibition is observed in practice. Children 14 or 15 years old may be employed part-time or during school vacations in light, nonhazardous work. Their workhours must not exceed the ordinary workhours of adults in the same occupation. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration enforces child labor regulations.     e. Acceptable Conditions of Work     Although there is no minimum wage law, union membership is so extensive and effective as to ensure that labor contracts afford even the lowest paid workers a sufficient income for a decent standard of living for themselves and their families.     Workers are protected by laws that effectively ensure their health and safety as well as provide for unemployment insurance, paid vacations, pensions, and reasonable working conditions and hours. The standard legal workweek is 40 hours. Work exceeding 8 hours in a workday must be compensated as overtime. Workers are entitled to 10 hours of rest within each 24-hour period and to a day off every week. Under defined special circumstances the 10-hour rest period can be reduced to 8, and the day off can be postponed by a week, in which case the worker has a right to 2 additional hours off in the following week.     Health and safety standards are set by the Althing and administered and enforced by the Ministry of Social Affairs through its Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

GX020-10-14482079	[Print Friendly Version]      The Relationship Between the U.S. and the Kyrgyz Republic President George W. Bush Joint Statement With President Askar Akayev of the Kyrgyz Republic Washington, DC September 23, 2002   Released by the White House, Office of the Press Secretary   We declare our commitment to strengthen the long-term, strategic partnership and cooperation between our nations, desiring to promote a shared vision for the 21st century of a peaceful, prosperous, and sovereign Kyrgyz Republic that is increasingly integrated into the global economy and the community of democratic nations.   We reaffirm our deep appreciation for the strong relations that have been established between our two countries based on mutual respect and the common goals of stability, peace, and prosperity. We will advance our cooperation on democratic political and free-market economic reforms, and the development of the resources of the Kyrgyz Republic and its people. We affirm that these political and economic reforms are a necessary condition to ensure political, social, and economic stability; sustainable development; prosperity; and national security.   We recognize that the threats of terrorism, trafficking of narcotics, and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction endanger the security not only of the United States and the Kyrgyz Republic, but also of the Central Asian region and the world at large. We, therefore, seek to develop our security cooperation to address these challenges and foster cooperation among the United States and the Kyrgyz Republic, its Central Asian neighbors, the other regional powers, and our European partners.   Recognizing the essential role that the Kyrgyz Republic plays in the war against terrorism, we declare our intention to cooperate in this war to its conclusion and within the framework of the international coalition. We emphasize our support for the Afghan Transitional Administration and the goal that it be at peace internally and with its neighbors and integrated into the regional and international economic structures. We also express our readiness to support Afghanistan's reconstruction and the development of its natural and human resources.   In the spirit of partnership, the Kyrgyz Republic and the United States intend to strengthen joint activity to ensure security and stability in Central Asia. We agree that the expansion of trade and economic ties among the states of Central Asia, and deepening of regional integration in important areas such as the environment, water resources, and transportation systems, are a basis for regional security and prosperity. The United States is enhancing assistance programs to the Kyrgyz Republic to strengthen border security and to increase the defensive capabilities of the Armed Forces of the Kyrgyz Republic.   We recognize that free-market economies, democratic political systems, and the rule of law provide the most effective means to advance the welfare of our citizens and the stability of our societies. The United States and the Kyrgyz Republic pledge to develop further our bilateral trade and investment relations, including through expanded contacts between the business communities of our countries. We are united in our mutual efforts to cooperate to accelerate the development of an attractive, transparent, and predictable investment climate in the Kyrgyz Republic. Achieving this goal requires the removal of legislative and administrative barriers to investment, strengthening respect for contracts and the rule of law, reducing corruption, and enhancing the Kyrgyz Republic's strong record on economic reform.   We reaffirm our commitment to work diligently and on a regular and sustained basis in the areas specified in the Memorandum of Understanding signed in Washington on February 15, 2002, with the goal of strengthening the economic component of our bilateral cooperation. In accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding, both sides have agreed that a high-level Kyrgyz government delegation will visit Washington in October 2002 for the purpose of further identifying realistic and achievable objectives aimed at accelerating economic reforms and development in the Kyrgyz Republic.   Recognizing that democracy is a cornerstone of long-term stability, we reaffirm our desire to strengthen democratic institutions and processes, such as civil society, independent media, local government, political pluralism, and free and fair elections. We also reaffirm our mutual commitments to advance the rule of law and promote freedom of religion and other universal human rights as enshrined by the founding documents of the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, of which we are both members. Finally, we confirm our mutual efforts to enhance understanding between the citizens of our two countries by promoting people-to-people exchanges, initiatives of non-governmental organizations, and contacts between business people.

GX053-54-9014528	"Iceland Country Reports on Human Rights Practices   -   2000 Released by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor February 23, 2001   Iceland is a constitutional republic and a parliamentary democracy in which citizens periodically choose their representatives in free and fair multiparty elections. The judiciary is independent.   Elected officials control the police force, which scrupulously observes and enforces the laws that ensure protection of human rights.   Iceland has a mixed, open economy that provides residents with a high standard of living. The leading exports, fish and other marine products, account for almost 70 percent of export revenues. An abundance of cheap hydroelectric power provides a comparative advantage for the main manufacturing activity--aluminum smelting. Aluminum is the second leading export. Growth was expected to approach 4 percent in 1999.    The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law and judiciary provide effective means of dealing with individual instances of abuse. Human rights monitors expressed concern about the Government's frequent use of solitary confinement for remand prisoners. The Government is taking steps to deal with violence against women. Some societal discrimination against women persists, especially in the area of equal pay. Instances of suspected trafficking in women were reported.   RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS   Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:   a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing   There were no reports of political or other extrajudicial killings.   b. Disappearance   There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.   c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment   Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment are prohibited by law and do not occur.    Prison conditions generally meet minimum international standards. Most of the country's small prison population (less than 100 inmates total) is held at Litla Hraun Prison in Reykjavik, which includes a state-of-the-art detention facility opened in 1995. However, the prison system still uses a substandard jail (Hegningarhusid in downtown Reykjavik) to hold a small number of prisoners, where the individual cells lack toilets and sinks.   Human rights monitors have expressed concern about the use of illegal drugs by some inmates at Litla Hraun Prison and about the lack of social services to help inmates overcome drug addiction and prepare them for eventual release. Despite the small inmate population at Litla Hraun, the authorities have not been able to stop narcotics from being smuggled into the prison.   In a 1999 report, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) expressed concern during its visit to Litla Hraun prison in 1998 that nearly all detainees still were placed in solitary confinement while their cases were under investigation. While the average duration of solitary confinement was between 2 and 3 weeks, the CPT noted that in some cases, solitary confinement lasted up to 3 months. Under the strictest form of solitary confinement, prisoners cannot leave their cells, except briefly to exercise alone or to use the showers, and are not allowed to listen to the radio, watch television, or receive visitors other than their lawyers, the prison doctor, and a chaplain. In November 1999, the supervising doctor at Litla Hraun wrote to prison authorities, warning that the mental health of several prisoners awaiting trial on drug trafficking charges could be in danger due to the extended time that they were expected to spend in solitary confinement.   In a preliminary response to the CPT report on September 30, 1999, the Government argued that solitary confinement was absolutely necessary in some circumstances to keep suspects from tampering with witnesses, destroying evidence, or hindering the investigation. On the other hand, it conceded that ""in the vast majority of cases"" incarceration alone was sufficient to protect the integrity of witnesses and evidence. However, the Prison and Probation Administration's statistics show that solitary confinement has been the rule rather than the exception, with most of those arrested being placed into solitary confinement, at least initially.   In May the European Court of Human Rights ruled in favor of an Icelandic woman who had been denied compensation for wrongful arrest on the grounds that she had not cooperated with police. The woman was held in solitary confinement for 5 weeks in 1989 in connection with a drug case before being cleared and released. The Government since has changed the law to make it easier for victims of wrongful arrest to receive compensation, recognizing the principle that all detainees should be presumed innocent until proven guilty.    With the closing of the Sudumuli remand prison in 1996, the Government passed a law in 1998 that allows pretrial detainees to be incarcerated with the general prison population. Some human rights monitors claim that this law is inconsistent with the country's obligations under the European Human Rights Convention and European prison rules issued by the Council of Europe.    Juveniles who are 15 years of age or older can be sentenced to prison terms, but the vast majority of juvenile offenders are given probation or suspended sentences or agree to attend a treatment program instead of going to jail. In the rare instances when juvenile offenders are incarcerated, they are confined with the general adult prison population due to the lack of a separate detention facility for juveniles. In its 1999 report, the CPT stated that it was ""very concerned"" about the current situation and recommended that the Government take ""immediate steps...to ensure that juvenile prisoners are held separately from adults."" In signing the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1990, the Government entered a reservation on the provision requiring the separation of adult and juvenile prisoners. Government officials said that it is not practical to establish and operate a separate facility for juvenile prisoners in a small country like Iceland because the requirement to incarcerate a juvenile occurs so infrequently.   The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors.   d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile   The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest, detention, and exile, and the Government observes these prohibitions.   e. Denial of Fair Public Trial   The Constitution and law provide for an independent judiciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice.   There are two levels of courts. A five-member Judicial Council appointed by the Minister of Justice administers the district courts, while the Supreme Court guards its independence and fairness by administering itself. All judges, at all levels, serve for life.   The judiciary provides citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process. Juries are not used, but multijudge panels are common, especially in the Supreme Court, which hears all appeals. Depending on the seriousness of the case, a Supreme Court panel can include from three to seven judges. Defendants are presumed innocent. They are provided access to legal counsel of their own choosing with sufficient time to prepare their defense. For defendants unable to pay attorneys' fees, the state covers the cost, as set by the court, but defendants are required to reimburse the state. Defendants have the right to be present at their trial, to confront witnesses, and to participate otherwise in the proceedings. No groups are barred from testifying, and all testimony is treated alike. The courts have the discretion to allow the introduction of evidence obtained illegally by the police. With limited exceptions, trials are public and conducted fairly, with no official intimidation. Defendants have the right to appeal.   There were no reports of political prisoners.   f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence   The Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.   Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:   a. Freedom of Speech and Press   The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.   b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association   The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.   c. Freedom of Religion   Although the official state religion is Lutheranism, the Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government respects this right in practice. The salaries of Lutheran ministers are paid by the state. Citizens 16 years of age and above are presumed to be members of the state church and are required to support the church by paying a tax, unless they designate another religious denomination to receive their tax payment. The religion tax payment of persons who choose not to belong to any specific, organized religious group goes to the University of Iceland. Religious instruction in Christianity is required in the public schools, although students may be exempted.    A new law passed by Parliament in December 1999 (Law No. 108) sets specific conditions and procedures that religious organizations must follow in order to be recognized officially and registered by the State. Such recognition is necessary in order for religious organizations other than the state church to receive a per capita share of church tax funds. The 1999 law is narrower in scope than the 1975 law it replaced and applies only to religious organizations that are seeking to be, or are already, officially recognized and registered. No restrictions or requirements are placed on unregistered religious organizations, which have the same rights as other groups in society. The law is considered necessary to deal with frequent attempts by individuals to obtain recognition of religious organizations simply to receive the tax income benefits.    d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation   The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.    Although neither the Constitution nor the 1965 Law on the Supervision of Foreigners includes provisions for granting refugee or asylee status in accordance with the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 protocol, in practice the Government adjudicates cases in accordance with their principles. The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Committee of the Red Cross, and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees.   However, human rights monitors have expressed concern about the lack of a modern and comprehensive immigration law to govern the processing of asylum seekers and to provide a framework for the handling of foreigners and immigrants in general. In particular there is concern that the Supervision of Foreigners Law gives police and custom officers at ports of entry too much discretion to deny admission to asylum seekers whose claims they deem to be not ""credible.""    In response the Government states that official discretion is rarely exercised and that none of the 42 individuals who were denied entry to the country during the first 9 months of 2000 requested asylum. Nevertheless, many government officials agree that a comprehensive and modern immigration law is necessary.   In view of the country's geographic isolation and the lack of direct transportation from any traditional source of refugees, the question of first asylum rarely arises. However, the Directorate of Immigration (which is responsible for adjudicating applications for asylum) and the Icelandic Red Cross (which houses and assists asylum seekers under a contact with the Government) report that 24 individuals applied for asylum during the year, compared with 17 in 1999. None was found to qualify for refugee status (several cases were still under consideration or on appeal), but the 1999 application of an individual who claimed to be 17 years old and fleeing persecution in central Africa was approved. It was the first application for asylum status ever approved. There were no reports of asylum seekers being detained or forcibly expelled during the year.   The Government accepted 23 UNHCR-designated ""quota"" refugees from the former Yugoslavia during the year, continuing a program begun in 1996 of bringing in 20 to 25 refugees from the region each year. In 1999 the Government also admitted 75 Kosovar refugees into the country, 37 of whom since returned to Kosovo with the financial support of the Government. Local government authorities in the towns where refugees settle take a strong interest in helping them adapt to their new environment. The Icelandic Red Cross, in cooperation with the Refugee Council of the Ministry of Social Affairs, developed a support family program, whereby at least three Icelandic families are enlisted to assist each refugee or refugee family. The refugees immediately are granted work permits and assisted in finding jobs. For the first year, they also are given free housing, utilities, and health care and receive a stipend so that they can participate daily in a special half-day language course designed specially for them. Refugees generally are successful in assimilating into society, but their children generally drop out of school earlier than children of citizens.   Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Government   The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair elections held on the basis of universal suffrage. The most recent elections to the Althingi (unicameral Parliament) were held in May 1999.   Women are underrepresented in government and politics, but no legal or practical impediments hinder their participation. Some human rights monitors criticized the Minister of Justice (herself a woman) for filling a vacancy on the Supreme Court during the year by choosing the sole male candidate (who had never served on the bench) over three experienced female district court judges. Only one of the nine Supreme Court justices is a woman. Similarly, only 2 of 12 ministerial permanent secretaries (civil servants who function as deputy ministers) are women.   Women have greater representation in politics. Of the 12 government ministers, 4 are women, and women hold 24 of the 63 seats in Parliament. There has been a marked increase in the number of female parliamentarians elected since the Women's List (WL), a feminist political party, was founded in 1983. The WL forced the established political parties to nominate more female candidates or face losing support. The WL disappeared from the scene as the result of a political party merger, but its legacy survives. Women's issues have moved into the mainstream of political debate, and all of the major political parties now have at least one woman in a prominent leadership position.    Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights   A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.   Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or Social Status   The country's ethnically homogenous population is strongly egalitarian and opposed to discrimination based on any of these factors. The law and practice generally reflect this attitude.    Women   Violence against women continued to be a matter of concern. A public women's shelter offers counseling and protection to victims of domestic violence and their children. Approximately 340 women used the shelter during the year, 94 of whom sought temporary lodging, while the rest asked for counseling or information. About 60 children accompanied their mothers to the shelter during the year. At a rape trauma center, between 300 and 400 women and children seek assistance annually. Both facilities are financed by national and municipal governments, as well as by private contributors. The emergency ward of the National Hospital in Reykjavik has a special staff to care for rape victims. It reports approximately 100 visits per year associated with incidents of sexual abuse.   A police program to train officers in correct interrogation procedures in rape and sexual abuse cases appears to be addressing prior concerns that police indifference and hostility to female victims did not assure proper attention and consideration for victims of such abuses. Parliament passed legislation in May that gives courts the power to issue restraining orders, an action that human rights monitors praised as a potentially useful legal tool in keeping abusive husbands away from their spouses.   A large majority of victims nevertheless decline to press charges, and even more forgo trial, fearing publicity in this small, tightly knit society. With an increasing number of interracial marriages, mostly involving Icelandic men and Asian women, there is concern that these new Asian immigrants are not assimilating well into local society and could be vulnerable to mistreatment. To address this concern, the city of Reykjavik offers these immigrant women emergency accommodation, counseling, and information on legal rights, language training, and Icelandic societal norms.   There were indications that some foreign women were trafficked to work as striptease dancers or prostitutes against their will (see Sections 6.c. and 6.f.). The sale of sex for money is not illegal per se, but it is against the law for someone to engage in prostitution as his or her main source of income. It is also illegal to act as an intermediary in the sale or procurement of sex.   The rate of participation by women in the labor market is high. In part this reflects the country's comprehensive system of subsidized day care, which makes it affordable and convenient for women to work outside the home. The Act on the Equal Status of Men and Women requires that preference be given to the hiring and promotion of women in areas where they are underrepresented, as long as they are equal in all other respects to their male job seekers. Despite laws that require equal pay for equal work, a sizeable pay gap continues to exist between men and women. A survey by a union in Reykjavik showed that women, on average, earned 30 percent less than men. A 12 percent difference in pay is attributable to the fact that men work 4.2 more hours per week than women, but the rest of the gap is unexplained.   Parliament passed legislation during the year that gives fathers the same right as mothers to paid leave upon the birth of a child. When the law is fully implemented in 2003, both mother and father will be allowed to take 3 months of paid leave, with an additional 3 months that can be taken by either parent or shared between them. Previously, a mother was given 6 months of paid maternity leave and the father just 2 weeks. The new leave requirements apply equally to the public and private sectors.   Children   The Government demonstrates its strong commitment to children's rights through its well-funded systems of public education and medical care. School attendance is compulsory through the age of 15. About 85 percent of students continue to upper secondary education, which is financed completely by the State. The Government provides free prenatal and infant medical care, as well as heavily subsidized childcare. The Office of the Children's Ombudsman in the Prime Minister's Office has a mandate to protect children's rights, interests, and welfare by, among other things, exerting influence on legislation, government decisions, and public attitudes.    There is no societal pattern of abuse directed against children.   In an effort to improve the rate of prosecution of child sexual abuse and lessen the trauma to the child, the Government in 1998 established the Children's Assessment Center. The objective of the center is to create a safe and secure environment where child victims feel more comfortable talking about what happened to them and are not subjected to multiple interviews. The center brings together police, prosecutors, judges, doctors, and officials from child protection services. However, a 1999 change in the Code of Criminal Procedure inadvertently undermined the center by making judges (instead of the police) responsible for the investigatory interview of abused children and by allowing these interviews to be conducted in specially designed rooms at district courthouses. In September the Supreme Court upheld the right of a Reykjavik district court judge to hold an investigatory interview in the courthouse rather than at the assessment center. As of September, only about 20 percent of child sexual abuse cases were being handled through the center, a development that human rights monitors claim is a step backwards in the protection of children's rights.   People with Disabilities   Disabled individuals are not subject to discrimination in employment, education, or the provision of other state services. A 1992 law calls for the disabled to have the right to ""all common national and municipal services"" and provides that they be given assistance to ""make it possible for them to live and work in normal society with others."" The law also provides that the disabled should receive preference for a government job when they are qualified equally, or more qualified, than regular applicants.    Building regulations updated in 1998 call for public accommodations--such as hotels, restaurants, banks, and stores--as well as government buildings to be accessible so that persons in wheelchairs have access without assistance. Building regulations also specify that elevators in such buildings should be large enough to accommodate wheelchairs and that 1 percent of parking spaces (a minimum of one space) should be reserved for disabled use only. Moreover, the regulations specify that, to the extent possible, the sidewalk outside the main entrance of a public accommodation or government building should be heated so that it remains clear of ice and snow throughout the winter.    The 1997 Planning and Building Act provides that violations of these regulations are punishable by a fine or a jail sentence of up to 2 years. However, the country's main association for the disabled complains that enforcement is lax and that penalties are rarely assessed for noncompliance. Access to new buildings tends to be good, while efforts to make old buildings more accessible have lagged. A government committee is currently doing a systematic survey of all state-owned buildings in the country to evaluate their accessibility. Since 1995 the Reykjavik city government, in cooperation with local associations representing bicycle riders and the blind, has been systematically beveling sidewalks at intersections throughout the city to facilitate the movement of pedestrians, bicyclists, and disabled persons in wheelchairs. The city is spending about $175,000 a year on this project, which it aims to have completed by 2006.    In what was heralded as a major human rights victory for the disabled, the Supreme Court ruled in December that the Government's practice of basing a disabled person's social security payment on the income of his or her able-bodied spouse or partner was unconstitutional. The Court said that such means testing violated constitutional protections regarding equality and support for the disabled and that it was contrary to the country's obligations under the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights. At year's end, the Government appointed a committee to study the court ruling, a move that the Association of Disabled Persons criticized as a delaying tactic. It called on the Government to take immediate action to end the means testing and reimburse disabled persons for past reductions in their social security payments.   National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities   Concern was voiced during the year that the rapidly increasing number of foreigners being brought into the country to meet the labor shortage in fish processing and other less desirable occupations could lead to future problems, especially in the event of an economic downturn. At the end of 1999, 7,271 foreigners were living in Iceland, or about 3 percent of the population, according to the statistics office. However, persons of foreign origin actually constituted 4 or 5 percent of the population when account is taken of individuals who were born in foreign countries but have since become citizens. New work and residence permits were issued at a rate of about 150 per month during the year. Many of these ""temporary"" workers come from Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and the Directorate of Immigration expected most of them to seek to remain permanently rather than return to their countries of origin.   Human rights monitors expressed concern about the establishment in 1997 of an ultra-nationalist organization called the Association of Icelandic Nationalists, whose motto is ""Iceland for Icelanders."" The avowed aim of the association is to prevent further settlement of foreigners of other than European origin in the country. Some human rights monitors claim that the Government is not living up its obligations under Article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination because there is no law that prohibits organizations that promote and incite racial discrimination.    Section 6 Worker Rights   a. The Right of Association   Workers make extensive use of the right provided by the Constitution to establish organizations, draw up their own constitutions and rules, choose their own leaders and policies, and publicize their views. The resulting organizations are controlled neither by the Government nor by any single political party. Unions take active part in Nordic, European, and other international trade union bodies. With the exception of limited categories of workers in the public sector whose services are essential to public health or safety, unions have had and used the right to strike for many years. Approximately 80 percent of all eligible workers belong to unions. During the year, 3 major strikes took place: A 2-week strike in the spring by most of the unskilled and semiskilled labor unions outside of Reykjavik, a 2-month strike during the summer by the main bus drivers' union, and a 2-month strike at the end of the year by secondary school teachers. The teachers' strike, which was the longest such strike in the country's history, led some students to leave school and take up full-time jobs.   b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively   Union membership is not impeded in law or practice. Employers are required to withhold union dues (1 percent of gross pay) from the pay of all employees, whether or not they are union members. This is because union dues help support, among other things, disability, strike, and pension funds to which all workers are entitled.    The various trade unions and management organizations periodically negotiate collective bargaining agreements that set specific terms for workers' pay, hours, and other conditions. New collective bargaining agreements were negotiated in the spring of 2000, and most will expire in either 2003 or 2004. The Government played only a minor role in the bargaining process, providing mediation assistance in a few cases (through the State Mediator's Office) while generally encouraging wage restraint to limit inflation. The new contacts provide that if inflation exceeds expectations during the first year, the unions have the right to seek renegotiation of the wage terms. In recent years, the Government has played almost no role in the private sector collective bargaining process, other than generally to encourage wage restraint that would help to limit inflation.    Labor courts effectively adjudicate disputes over contracts and over the rights provided for in the 1938 Act on Trade Unions and Industrial Disputes, which prohibits antiunion discrimination. By law employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union activities. In practice the charges are difficult to prove.   In 1996 Parliament passed legislation updating the labor laws and bringing them into compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights.     There are no export processing or other special economic zones.   c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor   Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law and does not occur; however, some women reportedly were coerced to work as striptease dancers or prostitutes (see Sections 5 and 6.f.), and work permit practices could leave workers vulnerable to abuse by employers (see Section 6.e.). The law prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, and the Government enforces this prohibition effectively.   d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment   The law prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, and the Government enforces this prohibition effectively (see Section 6.c.). The law requires children to attend school until the age of 16 and prohibits the employment of younger children in factories, on ships, or in other places that are hazardous or require hard labor. This prohibition is observed in practice. Children 14 or 15 years old may be employed part time or during school vacations in light, nonhazardous work. Their work-hours must not exceed the ordinary work hours of adults in the same occupation. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration enforces child labor regulations.   The Government ratified ILO Convention 182 on the worst forms of child labor in May.   e. Acceptable Conditions of Work   No minimum wage is mandated legislatively, but the minimum wages negotiated in the various collective bargaining agreements apply automatically to all employees in those occupations, whether they are union members or not. Union membership is so extensive and effective that labor contracts afford even the lowest paid workers a sufficient income for a decent standard of living for themselves and their families.   Workers are protected by laws that effectively provide for their health and safety as well as for unemployment insurance, paid vacations, pensions, and reasonable working conditions and hours. The standard legal workweek is 40 hours, which includes nearly 3 hours of paid breaks. Work exceeding 8 hours in a workday must be compensated as overtime. Under changes that took effect during the year, workers are entitled to 11 hours of rest (up from 10 hours previously) within each 24-hour period and to a day off every week. Under defined special circumstances, the 11-hour rest period can be reduced to 8 hours, but the worker must then be compensated with 1.5 hours of rest for every hour he received less than 11 hours. The day off can be postponed by a week, in which case the worker has a right to 2 additional hours off in the following week. Health and safety standards are set by Parliament and administered and enforced by the Ministry of Social Affairs through its Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which can close down workplaces until safety and health standards are met. Workers have a collective, not an individual, right to refuse to work in a place that does not meet the criteria of occupational safety and health. Firing workers who report unsafe or unhealthy conditions is illegal.   However, in the case of newly arrived foreign workers or refugees (i.e., those who have been in the country for less than 3 years), human rights monitors expressed concern that the Government's practice of issuing the applicable work permit to the employer rather than to the individual concerned could leave the worker vulnerable to abuse by the employer.   f. Trafficking in Persons   The law does not specifically criminalize trafficking in persons; however, a number of provisions in the Penal Code can be used to prosecute such cases.      Although no charges have ever been filed, trafficking in women is suspected in connection with the hundreds of foreign women who enter the country to work in striptease clubs. The main concern is that some of the women, especially those from Eastern and Central Europe, are being brought to Iceland under false pretenses and then coerced to work as striptease dancers or prostitutes. The police believe that the foreign women also may be used to bring illegal drugs into the country.   Parliament passed legislation in May that closed a loophole that allowed striptease dancers to enter the country and perform without a work permit for up to 4 weeks under an exemption given for ""artists."" Now any foreign woman (except those from the Nordic area and countries of the European Economic Area) seeking to come to the country to work as a striptease dancer must first obtain work and residence permits, which are typically valid for 3 months. However, the Government has not yet put any numerical limits or other controls on the issuance of work permits for foreign striptease dancers. The clubs are allowed to bring in as many as they want. One check is provided by the Icelandic Federation of Labor. The Federation reviews the work permit applications and labor contacts for striptease dancers (under the law, all work permit applications must be reviewed and approved by the ""relevant"" labor union) and ensures that the dancers are afforded the minimal labor protections and benefits.    The number of women entering the country for such work, while still based on anecdotal evidence, has fallen to a few hundred since they can now stay longer legally. By year's end, there had been no arrests in connection with these activities.   [End.]"

PORTUGAL     The Portuguese Republic is a constitutional democracy with a President, an independent judiciary, a Prime Minister, and a Legislative Assembly freely elected by secret ballot in multiparty elections.   Internal security is primarily the responsibility of the Ministries of Justice and Internal Administration. Security forces are controlled by, and responsive to, the Government.   Portugal has a market-based economy and is a member of the European Union. An increasing proportion of the labor force is employed in services, while employment in agriculture continues to decline and has been static or declining slightly in the industrial sector.   Citizens enjoy a broad range of civil and other human rights, which the Government generally respects. Civil rights are outlined in the Constitution with specific reference to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The principal human rights problem is the occasional beating of detainees or prisoners by police or prison personnel. Credible although infrequent reports of this problem continued, as did reports of poor conditions in prisons. Violence against women, child labor, and discrimination against Roma are problems.   RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS    Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom from:    a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing    There were no reports of political or other extrajudicial killings.   A Public Security Police officer in the city of Evora was detained in December 1996 after fatally shooting a suspected   ___________________    * A separate report on Macau, recognized by both China and Portugal as Chinese territory under Portuguese administration, follows this report.   burglar at the time of arrest. The police officer's apprehension and his subsequent beating at the hands of inmates were protested by police across the country. These events led to the dismissal of the head of the Public Security Police for failing to maintain discipline and to the appointment in January of the first nonmilitary chief of that organization. The inspector general of the Interior Ministry is investigating the   suspicious deaths of two other detainees in late 1996.   The trial of a National Republican Guard (GNR) officer, Fernando Alexio dos Santos, who confessed to the highly publicized 1996 killing and decapitation of a detainee, resulted in a sentence in December of 17 years in prison. Another GNR member who was present at the killing was sentenced to 6 years in prison, and a third soldier received a 5-year suspended sentence. Four other accused GNR members were found innocent.   b. Disappearance    There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.   c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment    The Constitution forbids torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and the use of evidence obtained under torture in criminal proceedings. An independent Ombudsman, chosen by the Legislative Assembly (parliament), investigates complaints of mistreatment by police and prison authorities. The police inspector general conducts internal investigations in cases of alleged mistreatment.   In December 1996, delegates from Amnesty International (AI) met with the President and with senior government ministers to discuss continuing mistreatment of detainees by the police. AI and the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment cite kicking, punching, and beating with truncheons or other blunt objects as the most common forms of mistreatment. Both organizations were critical of the slow pace of investigations into allegations of mistreatment. According to civil rights groups, the victims of abuse are often African immigrants and other non-Europeans.   However, the inspector general of the Interior Ministry released a report in November citing improvements in the treatment of detainees by the police. In 200 surprise visits to jails and prisons by inspectors, no recent cases of police violence were uncovered. The report added that ""this is the opposite of 1996, one of the worst years for police brutality...."" Police officers receive training in human rights and proper investigative procedure.   The 1996 case of a magistrate who claimed to be mistreated by the GNR ended with the magistrate's dismissal from his position and his conviction on charges of drunk driving and assault of a police officer, for which he was fined.   The case of Paulo Portugal of Almada, who brought charges against six GNR officers for alleged brutality in 1991, was finally resolved in 1996, when the judge ruled in May that all charges--including countercharges by the GNR officers--be dropped.   Prison conditions are poor. The Council of Europe Committee and the national director of prisons identified overcrowding as the main problem, which the Government plans to remedy through a combination of new prisons and the increased use of noncustodial penalties. A 1996 report by the independent Ombudsman identified sanitary conditions, medical care, security, and food quality as problem areas. Prisoners complain of insufficient heating during the cool, wet winters.   The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors. Human rights organizations report no difficulties in gaining access to inmates at detention facilities.   d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile    Under the law, an investigating judge determines whether an arrested person should be detained, released on bail, or released outright. Persons may not be held more than 48 hours without appearing before an investigating judge. Investigative detention is limited to a maximum of 6 months for each suspected crime. If a formal charge has not been filed within that period, the detainee must be released. In cases of serious crimes, for example, murder or armed robbery, or of more than one suspect, investigative detention may last for up to 2 years and may be extended by a judge to 3 years in extraordinary circumstances. A suspect in investigative detention must be brought to trial within 18 months of being formally charged. If a suspect is not in detention, there is no specified period for going to trial. A detainee has access to lawyers; the State assumes the cost if necessary.   Exile is illegal and is not practiced.   e. Denial of Fair Public Trial    The judiciary is independent and impartial. The court system, laid out in the Constitution, consists of a Constitutional Court, a Supreme Court of Justice, and judicial courts of first and second instance. There is also a supreme court of administration, which deals with administrative and tax disputes, and which is supported by lower administrative courts. An audit court is in the Ministry of Finance.   All trials are public except those which may offend the dignity of the victim, such as in cases of sexual abuse of children. The accused is presumed innocent. In trials for serious crimes, a panel of three judges presides. For lesser crimes, a single judge presides. At the request of the accused, a jury may be used in trials for major crimes; in practice, requests for jury trials are extremely rare.   The judicial system provides citizens with a fair legal process. It has been much criticized, however, for a large backlog of pending trials resulting from inefficient functioning of the courts.   There were no reports of political prisoners.   f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence    The Constitution forbids such practices, and the Government respects these provisions in practice. Violations are subject to effective legal sanctions.   Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:    a. Freedom of Speech and Press    Freedom of speech and the press is provided for in the Constitution, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and the press, including academic freedom.   b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association    The law provides for these rights, and the authorities generally respect these provisions.   c. Freedom of Religion    The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government respects these rights in practice. Although the overwhelming majority of citizens are Roman Catholic, the President underscored the importance of religious tolerance and diversity through such gestures as attending in March the opening of an Ismailite center in Lisbon.   d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation    The Constitution and laws provide for these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.   The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. Persons who qualify as refugees are entitled to residence permits. The issue of first asylum did not arise in 1997. There were no reports of forced expulsions of persons having a valid claim to refugee status.   However, the Government almost never rules that an asylum seeker has a ""valid"" claim. During 1997, 220 persons filed for asylum, most of them from Zaire, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, and none were found to have valid claims. Persons arriving at the airport were returned either to their country of origin or to the country from which their flights originated. Persons already in the country were given 15 days to depart voluntarily. Of these, most remained in the country clandestinely.   Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Government    Portugal is a multiparty, parliamentary democracy. The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair elections on the basis of universal suffrage.   Women  and minorities have full political rights. Women head 2 of 17 ministries: Health and Environment. Women are represented in all major political parties but constitute only 13 percent of the deputies in the legislature, where 3 of the 15 committees are chaired by women. Race is rarely an issue in politics. Persons of minority origin have achieved prominence in politics.   Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights    A number of local and international groups operate freely, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials are generally cooperative, although most groups complain of slow investigations or remedial actions.   Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or Social Status    The Constitution forbids discrimination based on ancestry, sex, race, language, origin, religion, political or ideological convictions, education, economic situation, or social condition, and the Government enforces these prohibitions.   Women    Domestic and other violence against women is reportedly a common but hidden problem for which few seek legal recourse. The Portuguese Association for the Support of Victims received 400 calls for assistance during 1996. With greater publicity and a new toll-free telephone line, over 700 women sought help or shelter from the Association in 1997. The law provides for criminal penalties in cases of violence by a spouse. However, traditional societal attitudes discourage many battered women from recourse to the judicial system.   In March the Government enacted the ""Global Plan for Equal Opportunity,"" which is aimed at improving social, political, and workplace conditions for women. The new law also addresses violence against women and provides funds for new women's shelters, a hot line for battered women, and training for police officials. The Government's high commissioner for the promotion of equality and of the family conducted an awareness campaign to raise the profile of domestic abuse. A subsidiary organization, the Commission on Equality and the Rights of Women, initiated a program in Lisbon to provide free legal advice to victims of abuse. The judicial system shows no apparent reluctance to prosecute suspects accused of abusing women.   In March a special parliamentary session was held to discuss the problem of trafficking in women. Speakers noted that trafficking involves both Portuguese women being taken abroad, usually to Spain, and foreign women being brought into Portugal. Press reports indicate that about half of the women in organized prostitution rings are foreign nationals, usually from Latin America or central Europe. The deaths of eight women in an arson attack on a nightclub by a rival nightclub owner focused public attention on the problem. Prostitution is closely linked to other types of organized crime, especially international narcotics trafficking. Specific legislation prohibits forced prostitution and trafficking in human beings. ""The Nest,"" a nongovernmental organization, operates economic and social recovery programs for prostitutes.   The Civil Code provides for full legal equality for women. Sexual harassment, an issue gaining public attention, is covered in the Penal Code as a sex crime, but only if perpetrated by a superior and in the workplace. As in the case of violence, socially ingrained attitudes discourage many women from taking advantage of their legal protection.   The Commission on Equality in the Workplace and in Employment, made up of representatives of the Government, employers' organizations, and labor unions, is empowered to examine complaints of sexual harassment but receives few. It does review numerous complaints of discrimination by employers against pregnant workers and new mothers, who are protected by law.   Women  are increasingly represented in universities, business, science, and the professions. Traditional attitudes of male dominance persist but are changing gradually.   Children    Nine years of education are compulsory. A study by the European Commission indicated that only 50 percent of children receive preschool education, compared with at least 75 percent in most European Union countries. To counter this problem, the Ministry of Education instituted a pilot project on early childhood education in the Algarve region. The Ministry plans to expand the program to the national level, if it proves successful during the 1997 school year. The Government's goal is to provide preschool education for 60 to 70 percent of 3- and 4-year-olds and 90 percent of 5-year-olds by the year 2000.   The National Children's Rights Commission was inaugurated in January with the mission of implementing the principles of the International Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Commission operates under the aegis of the High Commissioner for the Promotion of Equality and of the Family and includes representatives from the Ministries of Justice, Health, Education, and Solidarity, as well as from leading nongovernmental organizations. The quasi-independent Institute for the Support of Children organized a network of 48 nongovernmental organizations dedicated to helping at-risk youth. The University of Minho's Institute for the Study of Children is a research center dedicated solely to the study of children's issues.   There is no societal pattern of abuse of children, although child labor remains a problem (see Section 6.d.). A pedophile ring was uncovered in Madeira in the fall involving Madeiran children and Madeiran, Belgian, and Dutch adults.   People with Disabilities    There is no discrimination against disabled persons in employment, education, or the provision of other state services. Their access to public facilities is mandated by legislation, which is generally complied with. However, no such legislation covers private businesses or other facilities.   National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities    The principal minority groups are immigrants, legal and illegal, from Portugal's former African colonies. There is also a resident Romani population. Fifteen skinheads were convicted in June for the 1995 beating death of a Cape Verdean immigrant; they received jail sentences ranging from 2 to 18 years. The law permits victims and antiracism associations to participate in race-related criminal trials by lodging criminal complaints, retaining their own lawyers, and calling witnesses.   A Romani family forced to move in 1996 in the face of local hostility was evicted by another municipal government following complaints by local residents that alleged Romani involvement in criminal activity. In April all adult members of this family were jailed on drug charges, although one package of alleged narcotics was later revealed to be flour. The family patriarch accused the police of unfairly targeting him because a family member had earlier implicated 13 National Republican Guard members in narcotics trafficking. Press coverage of the incident focused on the fact that the Government's High Commissioner for Immigration and Ethnic Minorities submitted a report to the Prime Minister that called on the central Government to act against popular militias, which are groups of citizens who engage in intimidation of Romani communities with the aim of forcing them to abandon settlements.   Section 6 Worker Rights    a. The Right of Association    Workers in both the private and public sectors have the right to associate freely and to establish committees in the workplace to defend their interests. The Constitution provides for the right to establish unions by profession or industry. Trade union associations have the right to participate in the preparation of labor legislation. Strikes are constitutionally permitted for any reason, including political causes; they are common and generally are resolved through direct negotiations. The authorities respect all provisions of the law on labor's rights.   Two principal labor federations exist. There are no restrictions on the formation of additional labor federations. Unions function without hindrance by the Government and are closely associated with political parties. There are no restrictions on the ability of unions to join federations or on federations affiliating with international labor bodies.   b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively    Unions are free to organize without interference by the Government or by employers. Collective bargaining is provided for in the Constitution and is practiced extensively in the public and private sectors.   Collective bargaining disputes rarely lead to prolonged strikes. Should a long strike occur in an essential sector such as health, energy, or transportation, the Government may order the workers back to work for a specific period. This did not occur in 1997. The Government has rarely invoked this power, in part because most strikes are limited to 1 to 3 days. The law requires a ""minimum level of service"" to be provided during strikes in essential sectors, but this requirement has been infrequently applied. When it has, minimum levels of service have been established by agreement between the Government and the striking unions, although unions have complained, including to the International Labor Organization, that the minimum levels have been set too high. When collective bargaining fails, the Government may appoint a mediator, at the request of either management or labor.   The law prohibits antiunion discrimination, and the authorities enforce this prohibition in practice. Complaints are promptly examined by the General Directorate of Labor.   There are no export processing zones.   c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor    Forced labor, including by children, is prohibited and does not occur.   d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment    On January 1, the minimum working age was raised from 15 to 16 years. The Government prohibits forced and bonded child labor and enforces this prohibition effectively (see Section 6.c.).   The two main labor federations and observers from other European countries have charged that a number of companies in the footwear, textile, construction, and hotel industries exploit child labor. The Ministry of Employment's Inspectorate General of Labor (IGT) reports that hundreds of children under age 16 are employed illegally, mainly in the northern cities of Porto and Braga, but that the number is declining. Union observers agree that the number of illegally employed children is falling but believe that the Government should allocate more resources to combat the problem.   The Government created the National Commission to Combat Child Labor (CNCTI) in 1996 with the aim of eradicating child labor. The Commission coordinates the efforts of the four ministries with primary responsibility for combating child labor: Employment, Education, Social Security, and Justice. It has stiffened sanctions against companies caught violating the minimum working age law, developed alternative curriculums for schools to retain students, and targeted subsidies for poor families vulnerable to the temptation to permit their underage children to work. The ""medium-term social pact"" signed by business, labor, and government representatives in 1996 contains a specific commitment to support CNCTI's operations.   In 1997 the CNCTI, the Ministry of Employment, and the General Union of Workers (UGT) undertook a public education campaign targeted at high-risk communities to convince parents to keep their children in school. The Ministry of Employment published a ""blacklist"" of companies caught illegally employing children and denied those companies access to European Union funding or benefits.   e. Acceptable Conditions of Work    Minimum wage legislation covers full-time workers as well as rural workers and domestic employees ages 18 years and over. For 1997 the monthly minimum wage was about $315 (Esc 56,700) and was generally enforced. Along with widespread rent controls, basic food and utility subsidies, and phased implementation of a minimum guaranteed income, the minimum wage affords a basic standard of living for a worker and family. Average monthly earnings range from about $460 (Esc 83,469) for skilled and low-level personnel to about $1,580 (Esc 284,263) for higher management personnel.   Employees generally receive 14 months' pay for 11 months' work: 1 month's pay for a Christmas bonus, 1 for a vacation subsidy, and 1 for 22 days of annual leave. The maximum legal workday is 8 hours and the maximum workweek is 40 hours. For public sector employees, the maximum workweek is 39 hours, with a reduction to 35 hours to be phased in by 1999. There is a maximum of 2 hours of paid overtime per day and 200 hours of overtime per year, with a minimum of 12 hours between workdays. The Ministry of Employment and Social Security monitors compliance through its regional inspectors.   Employers are legally responsible for accidents at work and are required by law to carry accident insurance. An existing body of legislation regulates safety and health, but labor unions continue to argue for stiffer laws. The General Directorate of Hygiene and Labor Security develops safety standards, and the General Labor Inspectorate is responsible for their enforcement, but the Inspectorate lacks sufficient funds and inspectors to combat the problem of work accidents effectively. A relatively large proportion of accidents is in the construction industry. Poor environmental controls in textile production also cause considerable concern. While the ability of workers to remove themselves from situations where these hazards exist is limited, it is difficult to fire workers for any reason. Workers injured on the job rarely initiate lawsuits.

ICELAND     Iceland is a constitutional republic and a multiparty parliamentary democracy. Its people participate in high percentages in regular, free, and fair elections which determine the distribution of power among political parties and leaders. The judiciary is independent.   Elected officials control the police force, which scrupulously observes and enforces the laws that ensure protection of human rights.   Iceland has a mixed, open economy, in which citizens have the right to hold private property. It provides residents with a high standard of living. The leading export, marine products, accounts for almost 80 percent of export revenues.   The Government generally respects the human rights of its citizens, and the law and judiciary provide effective means of dealing with instances of individual abuse. There is some societal discrimination against women, which the Government has begun to address.   RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS    Section 1 Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:    a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing    There were no reports of political or other extrajudicial killings.   b. Disappearance    There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.   c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment    Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment are prohibited by law and do not occur.   Prison conditions are good, and while many prisons are near capacity, the Government is actively modernizing and expanding existing facilities.   d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile    The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.   e. Denial of Fair Public Trial    The Constitution and law provide for an independent judiciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice.   The Ministry of Justice administers the lower court system, while the Supreme Court guards its independence and fairness. Juries are not used, but multijudge panels are common, especially in the appeals process. All judges, at all levels, serve for life.   The judiciary provides citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process. Defendants are presumed innocent. They are guaranteed the right of access to legal counsel of their own choosing in time to prepare their defense. For defendants unable to pay attorneys' fees, the State assumes the cost. Defendants have the right to be present at their trial, to confront witnesses, and to participate otherwise in the proceedings. No groups are barred from testifying, and all testimony is treated alike. Trials are public and are conducted fairly, with no official intimidation. Defendants have the right to appeal.   There were no reports of political prisoners.   f. Arbitrary Interference With Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence    The Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities generally respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to effective legal sanction.   Section 2 Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:    a. Freedom of Speech and Press    The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.   b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association    The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.   c. Freedom of Religion    Although the official state religion is Lutheranism, the Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government respects this right in practice.   d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation    The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government respects them in practice. The Government cooperates with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. There were no reports of forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status. The issue of the provision of first asylum did not arise in 1996. In addition to the 31 refugees from the former Yugoslavia that Iceland accepted in 1996, 19 refugees mostly from Croatia's Krajina region were settled in the southern town of Hofn in August. Local government authorities have played a major role in helping the refugees adapt to their new environment, including providing Icelandic language classes and jobs.   Section 3 Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Government    The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair elections held on the basis of universal suffrage. The most recent elections to the Althingi (unicameral Parliament) were held in April 1995.   There are no legal or practical impediments to women's participation in government and politics. There is one woman in the cabinet. There is an active feminist political party, the Women's List, which won 3 of 63 seats in the 1995 parliamentary elections.   Section 4 Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights    A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.   Section 5 Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or Social Status    The culture of the ethnically homogeneous population is strongly egalitarian and opposed to discrimination based on any of these factors. Government legislation and practice generally reflect this attitude.   Women    Increased governmental awareness of violence against women, resulting from extensive media coverage, has led to stiffening of sentencing for sex offenders. The tougher sentencing derives from improved action by the courts in more strictly enforcing existing laws. A police program to train officers in correct interrogation procedures in rape and sexual abuse cases appears to be addressing prior concerns that police indifference and hostility to female victims did not assure victims of such abuses proper attention and consideration.   There is a public women's shelter that offers protection to approximately 350 women and 200 children per year; these figures are virtually unchanged since 1995. There is also a rape trauma center sponsored and operated by women's organizations; some 400 women and children seek assistance annually. Both facilities are funded by national and municipal governments, and private contributions. The Reykjavik City Hospital emergency ward has an all-female staff to care for rape victims. During the year the emergency ward reported 77   visits associated with incidents of rape or sexual abuse ,  71 by women and 6 by men . . Hospital officials estimate that only 55 percent of these victims press charges and only a handful of cases actually go to trial, attributing this to fear of publicity in such a small, tightly-knit society.   The Women's List political movement and the female Mayor of Reykjavik have kept women's issues in the forefront of public debate. While major political institutions and businesses remain male dominated, the Government is taking steps to enforce legislation requiring equal pay for equal work. The 20 percent gap in earnings between men and women in comparable jobs narrowed somewhat nationally but dropped significantly in Reykjavik to 10 to 15 percent.   Since 1991 complaints regarding the Equal Rights Law have been referred to a special committee under the Equal Rights Affairs Office of the Ministry of Social Affairs. However, the committee has only advisory powers, and its recommendations to employers do not have the force of law. Few complaints are made to the committee.   Children    The Government demonstrates its strong commitment to children's rights through its well-funded systems of public education and medical care. The Government provides free prenatal and infant medical care, as well as heavily subsidized children's care. Compulsory education ends in the 10th grade. About 85 percent of students continue to upper secondary education, which is financed completely by the State. In 1994 the Government created the Office of the Children's Ombudsman in the Prime Ministry, with a mandate to protect children's rights, interests, and welfare by, among other things, exerting influence on legislation, government decisions, and public attitudes. The Parliament ratified the Hague Convention on Child Abduction which entered into force in December. This action is expected to facilitate the handling of international child custody cases.   There is no societal pattern of abuse directed against children.   People with Disabilities    Disabled individuals are not subject to discrimination in employment, education, or provision of other state services. The Government has legislated accessibility to public buildings for the disabled.   Section 6 Worker Rights    a. The Right of Association    Workers make extensive use of the right to establish organizations, draw up their own constitutions and rules, choose their own leaders and policies, and publicize their views. The resulting organizations are controlled neither by the Government nor by any single political party. Unions take active part in Nordic, European, and international trade union bodies. With the exception of limited categories of workers in the public sector whose services are essential to public health or safety, unions have had and used the right to strike for many years. Some 76 percent of all eligible workers belong to unions.   b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively    There are no impediments to union membership in law or in practice. Virtually all unions exercise their right to bargain collectively. The central labor and management organizations periodically negotiate collective bargaining agreements that set nationwide standards and specific terms for workers' pay, work hours, and other conditions. The Government often plays a role in the negotiations, and sometimes undertakes commitments in order to bring the two sides together. Labor courts effectively adjudicate disputes over contracts and over the rights provided for in the 1938 Act on Trade Unions and Industrial Disputes, which prohibits antiunion discrimination.   By law, employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union activities. In practice, the charges are difficult to prove.   In 1996 the Parliament passed legislation updating the labor laws and bringing them into compliance with the European human rights convention.   There are no export processing or other special economic zones.   c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor    Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law and does not occur.   The law prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, and the Government enforces this prohibition effectively.   d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment    The law prohibits forced and bonded labor by children and the Government enforces this prohibition effectively (see Section 6.c.).   The law requires children to attend school until the age of 16 years and prohibits employment of children under that age in factories, on ships, or in other places that are hazardous or require hard labor. This prohibition is observed in practice. Children 14 or 15 years old may be employed part-time or during school vacations in light, nonhazardous work. Their work-hours must not exceed the ordinary work-hours of adults in the same occupation. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration enforces child labor regulations.   e. Acceptable Conditions of Work    Although there is no minimum wage law, union membership is so extensive and effective as to ensure that labor contracts afford even the lowest paid workers a sufficient income for a decent standard of living for themselves and their families.   Workers are protected by laws that effectively ensure their health and safety as well as provide for unemployment insurance, paid vacations, pensions, and reasonable working conditions and hours. The standard legal workweek is 40 hours. Work exceeding 8 hours in a workday must be compensated as overtime. Workers are entitled to 10 hours of rest within each 24-hour period and to a day off every week. Under defined special circumstances the 10-hour rest period can be reduced to 8, and the day off can be postponed by a week, in which case the worker has a right to 2 additional hours off in the following week.   Health and safety standards are set by the Althingi and administered and enforced by the Ministry of Social Affairs through its Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

GX020-29-14656980	"[Print Friendly Version]      Fact Sheet Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs Washington, DC November 27, 2002 Frequently Asked Questions About U.S. Policy In Central Asia   Q: Why is Central Asia important to the United States?   A:  The U.S. Government learned a harsh lesson after we disengaged from Afghanistan in the early 1990s. We must not allow countries to become breeding grounds for extremism and terrorism. To prevent these destructive forces from taking root in Central Asia, we have intensified our efforts to help the countries of this area become stable, prosperous, and fully integrated members of the world community and the global economy.   Our new relationship with the countries of the region includes not only increased military and counterterrorism cooperation, but also intense diplomatic engagement to press for fundamental political, economic, and societal reforms and to develop increased respect for human rights in accord with these countries United Nations and Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) obligations. We have emphasized repeatedly that security, stability, and prosperity in the region is inextricably linked to democratic and economic reforms, a healthy respect for human rights, rule of law, and a willingness to work together to solve regional problems. Our goals in the region include the growth of independent media, political pluralism, and the development of a vibrant civil society. We continually make the case to these governments that a transition to democratic values and free-market economic development -- not increased repression -- are the best ways to ensure that their citizens do not turn to extremist and terrorist alternatives active in the region.    Moreover, Central Asia has world-class energy reserves. We want to facilitate the export of this energy to world markets to diversify world energy supplies. This would lead to greater stability in international energy markets and make world consumers less dependent on any one energy source.    For all of these reasons, the U.S. Government is committed to be fully engaged in Central Asia for the long term.   Q: What have the Central Asian states done to support the war on terrorism and Operation Enduring Freedom?   A:  Soon after September 11, 2001, all of the governments in the region offered generous assistance to prosecute the war against terrorism. All the Central Asian states quickly joined the coalition and offered ""whatever you need."" As we began to establish facilities to prosecute the war in Afghanistan, Russian President Putin affirmed his support for the increased U.S. presence in the region to combat terrorism, noting that it was in Russia's interest to do so.    Uzbekistan and Tajikistan were the first to offer the use of their facilities to U.S. and coalition troops. Both played central roles as staging areas for our crucial early operations against al-Qa'ida and the Taliban. The bombing campaign in Afghanistan began on October 7, 2001, literally an hour after Uzbekistan and the United States signed the Status of Forces Agreement that provided the legal basis for the United States to carry out search and rescue missions from Karshi-Khanabad airbase.   All governments in the region provided blanket overflight rights, and Turkmenistan and Tajikistan facilitated the transfer of humanitarian aid into Afghanistan in the first few months of the effort. While several countries offered airbases for the long-term prosecution of the war, Manas, the civilian airport serving Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, was chosen to be the primary base for coalition air support for our troops in Afghanistan. We also obtained agreement to refuel aircraft at the Dushanbe and Ashgabat airports. Kazakhstan provided landing rights for coalition aircraft forced to divert from Manas due to inclement weather or technical emergencies.   All the countries of Central Asia have assured us of their continued cooperation in the global war on terrorism and until Afghanistan achieves stability.     Q: Does the U.S. plan to keep major bases in the region long-term?    A:  We do not intend to establish permanent military bases in Central Asia. We are seeking long-term security relationships and access to military bases for the foreseeable future. Our current military presence in the region is likely to remain constant as long as our operations continue in Afghanistan.   Q: What is the terrorist threat in Central Asia? Are there terrorist groups in Central Asia?    A:  The terrorist threat in Central Asia comes mainly from extremist groups that developed their presence in the region after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 and that identify their political causes with Islam. The most active of these groups is the  Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU),  by some reports now the Islamic Movement of Central Asia. The State Department designated the IMU a Foreign Terrorist Organization in September 2000 after it conducted violent attacks against the governments of Central Asia. It has publicly called for the overthrow of the Government of Uzbekistan and has claimed responsibility for violent attacks in the territories of Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. Although they operated mainly from their bases in Afghanistan, the IMU also had established bases in Tajikistan prior to Operation Enduring Freedom; however, the government of Tajikistan pushed the vast majority of IMU fighters out of the country early in 2002. The IMU's actions over the years have resulted in the deaths of civilians, as well as Uzbek and Kyrgyz military personnel, and kidnappings of citizens and foreign nationals, including citizens of the United States.    The IMU established close political and military ties to al-Qa'ida and received al-Qa'ida funds. The IMU fought for the Taliban in Afghanistan against coalition forces in Operation Enduring Freedom. Although disrupted and degraded as a cohesive organization by coalition operations in Afghanistan, remnants of the IMU continue to pose a terrorist threat to friends and allies in Central Asia and coalition forces operating in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the region. The United States re-designated the IMU as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in September 2002.    The East Turkistan Uighur movement has also produced a terrorist group, the  East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM) . ETIM is a violent group believed responsible for committing numerous acts of terrorism in China, including bombings of buses, movie theaters, department stores, markets, and hotels; assassinations; and arson. From 1990 to 2001, members of ETIM reportedly committed over 200 acts of terrorism in China, resulting in at least 162 deaths and over 440 injuries. It includes components in Turkey, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the Xinjiang Province of China. Its objective is the creation of a fundamentalist Muslim state called ""East Turkistan.""    Although ETIM originally did not target U.S. nationals or other foreigners within China or plan attacks outside of China, there is evidence that ETIM members have changed tactics. In May, Kyrgyzstan deported two suspected ETIM members to China on the grounds that they were planning terrorist attacks, including assaults on foreign embassies. The United States has designated the ETIM as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.    The United States is also closely monitoring the  Hizb ut-Tahrir al Islami (HT)  movement, which has called for the overthrow of the governments of Central Asia. Despite its inflammatory rhetoric, it professes non-violence. Because there is little if any evidence that HT has committed acts of violence to achieve its political goals, the United States has not designated it a Foreign Terrorist Organization.   Q: If the Hizb ut-Tahrir (HT) is not a terrorist group and professes non-violence, why is the United States concerned about it?       A:  HT is a secretive, cell-based, transnational organization with support among Muslims in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, and with an organizational base in London. It has urged the overthrow of governments across the Islamic world and the establishment of a borderless, theocratic Islamic caliphate.    HT was founded in the Middle East in the 1950s. It promotes a utopian view of political Islam under which social problems like corruption and poverty would be eradicated by the strict application of  sharia  (Islamic law). HT uses a mixture of local history, arguments about socio-economic and political conditions, and advocacy for international religious solidarity to promote its cause.   HT is organized in secretive, five-member cells whose members later form their own groups or  halkas . Only the leader of each  halka  has a connection to a higher  halka . Public expression of its views usually is conducted through leaflets, and recruitment generally is conducted through friends and family, mirroring traditional social constructs. Members often emphasize the ""inner jihad,"" or a psychological transformation, as the impetus for joining the group. This method has helped HT spread rapidly, especially in Kyrgyzstan. HT, at least in Uzbekistan, has a core of well-educated members. More recently it has expanded membership to rural areas and the less educated.   In Central Asia, HT members are generally ethnic Uzbeks, but recently the group has been active recruiting members in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, perhaps due to pressure on its members by the Government of Uzbekistan. Outside Uzbekistan, HTs appeal has centered on discontent with Kyrgyz and Tajik government policies toward religious practices. Some HT activity has been noticed in southern Kazakhstan.   HTs rhetoric since the beginning of Operation Enduring Freedom and the Global War on Terrorism has turned more militant. HT leaflets have praised martyrdom operations against Israel and denounced coalition forces from Central Asia. HT leaflets have also claimed that the United States and the United Kingdom are at war with Islam, and have called for all Muslims to defend the faith and engage in jihad against these countries. Although there is no confirmed evidence of HTs involvement in violent actions or intention as an organization to commit them, it clearly incites violence. It also serves to indoctrinate dissatisfied and unemployed youth into radical Islam, who may then be recruited by more violent groups. While all of the Central Asian states are taking active measures to halt the spread of HT, there is little indication that HTs attractiveness will ebb in the foreseeable future.    Even though HT advocates the overthrow of existing secular systems, we advise officials in Central Asia that they should prosecute their citizens for illegal acts, not for their beliefs. We regularly remind these officials that indiscriminate activities alienate their citizens from the state and could have the unintended consequence of promoting the growth of HT.   Q:   Some allege that the United States turns a blind eye to repression in Central Asia in return for security cooperation. Isn't it true that the human rights situation has worsened since the United States increased its military presence in the region?   A:  No, this is not true. In fact, Kazakhstan -- where the United States has had the least military involvement -- has had the some of the most negative trends on human rights and political freedoms in the past year, even though its human rights situation is better overall then other countries in the region. By contrast, Uzbekistan -- with perhaps the most direct U.S. military involvement -- has made real progress, even as we recognize that Uzbekistan's human rights record requires significant improvement. Tajikistan has also made a great deal of progress on human rights, and by most accounts has no political prisoners. Kyrgyzstan has had a mixed year that included the killing of five activitists on March 17 by police during demonstrations, but recent trends have been decidedly more positive.    We believe the perception that the U.S. security relations in the region have emboldened leaders to crack down on human rights stems from activists' ideals not being met quickly. We deeply sympathize with their goals, but we must emphasize that changing long-ingrained patterns of behavior requires deep commitment and intense work over a long period of time.    Q: What specifics can you give about the human rights situation in Central Asia?   A:  The regional human rights picture in Central Asia is without doubt a mixed one, with limited but real progress in Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan; stasis in Turkmenistan; and some specific backsliding in Kazakhstan.   Uzbekistan has in the last year registered its first independent human rights non-governmental organization (NGO), worked with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to restart prison visits, ended direct censorship of the mass media, ceased its monopoly on Internet service provision, convicted and charged eight police officers in separate instances of the torture death of prisoners, and invited the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture to visit the country.    In the Kyrgyz Republic, which has perhaps the most active civil society in Central Asia, President Akayev began dialogue this summer with the moderate opposition following the unfortunate events in Aksyy, and we hope it will lead to real democratic transition when Akayev's term ends in 2005. He has also initiated a process that, if followed through, will fundamentally shift the balance of power in the country to more democratic norms.   The Government of Tajikistan dropped charges against an exiled opposition journalist, ended its monopoly on the Internet, reduced the price of registering local NGOs, allowed ICRC access to prisons, and registered the first independent FM radio station in the country's history. The French NGO, Reporters Without Borders, recently judged Tajikistan's mass media to be the most free in Central Asia.    Kazakhstan, which has generally been ahead of its Central Asian neighbors in political reform and human rights, has not performed as well during much of 2002. It has selectively charged and convicted key opposition leaders for corruption, sentencing them to long prison terms. Independent media outlets and journalists have suffered intimidation and violence, and a new law has made it difficult for smaller political parties to register legally. In the positive column, however, new opposition media are reporting objectively and without interference, including on sensitive issues like alleged corruption by high officials.   Q: What has the United States done to promote human rights and religious freedoms in Central Asia?   A:  The U.S. Government maintains an intense dialogue with the governments of each of the countries in the region on human rights and democratization and continues to be a frequent, and sometimes public, critic of each of the five Central Asian states' records in this area. We report objectively and in great detail in the annual  Human Rights Report , the  Trafficking in Persons Report , and the  International Religious Freedom Report .   Recognizing that significant political change will take time, we have designed our assistance programs to promote the development of democratic freedoms. In the last fiscal year we spent about $50 million in Central Asia specifically on democracy programs. This includes everything from NGO support and Internet access for the region's citizens to promoting rule of law, judicial reform, grassroots political development, and the ability of local governments to be responsive to citizens' needs.    Q:   Can you cite any progress on political reform?   A:  Progress on political reform and democratization continues to be slow, with fundamental, across-the-board change not likely until there is a generational shift in leadership or dramatic expansion of prosperity. There has, however, been forward movement, and we are beginning to see positive steps toward democratic pluralism.    Tajikistan has incorporated its former Islamic opposition movements into its government. Kyrgyzstan has established a Constitutional Council, with participation by political opposition groups and private sector representatives, which could lead to a more democratic balance of power. Uzbekistan has allowed the banned Birlik opposition political party to hold six regional congresses, prerequisites for Birlik to register as an officially recognized political party. The situation in Turkmenistan has remained static, although there is a growing civil society focused primarily on citizens' concerns such as environmental and women's issues, which are elements of grassroots democracy. In Kazakhstan, Ak Zhol has garnered enough signatures to register as a legal political party. It has also launched its own mass media, which appear to be reporting objectively and fairly and without government interference.   Q: Has there been any progress on economic reforms?   A:  Eleven years after independence, the states of Central Asia have had varied success in overhauling their former Soviet command economies. Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan have done well implementing economic reforms, but Tajikistan and Uzbekistan are only now beginning this difficult process.    Despite its relative lack of natural resources and its geographic isolation (doubly land-locked), Kyrgyzstan has achieved sustained economic growth and a small reduction in poverty through economic reform and World Trade Organization membership.    Kazakhstan had led the region in economic reform, especially in the banking and finance sectors, but endemic corruption threatens to harm its business climate and limit foreign investment.    Uzbekistan has taken steps to implement economic reforms and build its relationship with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), but progress has been slow because powerful entrenched interests oppose economic reform. We are working intensively with the Government of Uzbekistan to encourage it to meet all of the IMF preconditions for beginning negotiations on a Stand-By Agreement, which will help it move forward with economic reform.   The Government of Tajikistan, after recovering from its civil war, has renewed its relationship with the IMF through completing a Staff Monitored Program. The pace of economic reform should accelerate as the government becomes increasingly more stable.    Turkmenistan has made little progress on economic reforms, and the state still controls the vast majority of all economic activity. Ashgabat's misguided economic policies are seriously harming its economy. Direct foreign investment in this potentially wealthy (because of vast natural gas deposits) nation is negligible, and the education and healthcare sectors are rapidly declining.   Q: Two countries of Central Asia have been singled out in the Trafficking in Persons Report. What is the trafficking situation like in Central Asia?   A:  The 2002 Trafficking in Persons Report designated Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan as Tier-3 countries and Kazakhstan as a Tier-2 country. Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan were not ranked because of insufficient information. Tier-3 countries are those that do not comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking as defined by the U.S. Trafficking Victims Act of 2000 and that have yet to make efforts to bring themselves into compliance with U.S. law and international standards. Tier-2 countries are those that do not comply with these minimum standards but are making significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance.    Since the release of the report, we have had intensive consultations with most of the countries of Central Asia on improving their efforts to eliminate trafficking in their countries. Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, in particular, have developed action plans, which include new legislation and concrete programs to fight trafficking. We are working with Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to develop similar action plans. Through these programs, we hope to generate the political will to establish effective cooperation and the law enforcement mechanisms to combat this illegal activity. Awareness of this problem is still new in the region, but we are finding a strong will to take measures to attack this scourge. The United States is focusing its efforts both on governments and civil society.   Q: What are the prospects for energy development in Central Asia?    A:  Central Asia has enormous potential for energy development. Kazakhstan has the potential to be one of the five top exporters of oil by 2015. Its production in 2002 will likely exceed 900,000 barrels a day, increasing to as much as 5 million barrels per day in 2015, more than Kuwait or Iran. Turkmenistan has one of the world's largest deposits of natural gas -- estimated at 101 trillion cubic feet -- and oil production of about 160,000 barrels per day. While the Caspian region will not rival total Middle East production, it is on track to become the largest non-Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) source of production growth in the next decade. Also, there is enormous potential for hydropower in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, which could contribute to meeting energy needs in Central Asia, Afghanistan, and parts of South Asia.    Because the Caspian Basin is land-locked, producers there face monumental challenges getting their hydrocarbon resources to world markets. To support these countries in achieving their potential and strengthening their sovereignty and prosperity, the United States has promoted the development of multiple export routes. We have had some notable successes. The Caspian Pipeline Consortium pipeline opened in 2001 and is shipping Kazakh oil from Tengiz to the Black Sea. The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline, which will ship one million barrels of oil per day from the Caspian to the Mediterranean, received final approval on August 1, 2002, and broke ground for construction on September 18. The Kazakhs are ready to start negotiations on sending future oil shipments into that line. We expect that the Shah Deniz natural gas pipeline, to be constructed parallel to BTC, will be sanctioned early in 2003. Also, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, and Afghanistan are working with the Asian Development Bank and World Bank to determine the commercial feasibility of a trans-Afghan gas pipeline to meet energy needs primarily in South Asia.

GX062-80-1683159	"Iceland Human Rights Practices, 1995                   Iceland Human Rights Practices, 1995         U.S. Department of State                  Title:  Iceland Human Rights Practices, 1995   Author:  U.S. Department of State    Date:  March 1996                                          ICELAND      Iceland is a constitutional republic and a multiparty parliamentary  democracy.  Its people participate in high percentages in regular, free,  and fair elections which determine the distribution of power among  political parties and leaders.    Elected officials control the police force, which scrupulously observes  and enforces the laws that ensure protection of human rights.    Iceland has a mixed, open economy, in which citizens have the right to  hold private property.  It provides residents with a high standard of  living.  The leading export, marine products, accounts for almost 80  percent of export revenues.    The Government fully respects the human rights of its citizens, and the  law and judiciary provide effective means of dealing with instances of  individual abuse.  There is some societal discrimination against women.    RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS    Section 1   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom  from:       a.   Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing    There were no reports of political or other extrajudicial killings.       b.   Disappearance    There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.       c.   Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or  Punishment    Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment  are prohibited by law and do not occur.  Prison conditions are good, but  most prisons are full, and many are antiquated.  The Government has  begun a construction program to alleviate these difficulties.        d.   Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile    The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile, and  the Government observes this prohibition.       e.   Denial of Fair Public Trial    The Constitution and law provide for an independent judiciary, and the  Government respects this provision in practice.  The Ministry of Justice  administers the lower court system, while the Supreme Court guards its  independence and fairness.  Juries are not used, but multijudge panels  are common, especially in the appeals process.  All judges, at all  levels, serve for life.    The judiciary provides citizens with a fair and efficient judicial  process.  Defendants are presumed innocent.  They are guaranteed the  right of access to legal counsel of their own choosing, in time to  prepare their defense.  For defendants unable to pay attorneys' fees,  the State assumes the cost.  Defendants have the right to be present at  their trial, to confront witnesses, and to participate otherwise in the  proceedings.  No groups are barred from testifying, and all testimony is  treated alike.  Trials are public and are conducted fairly, with no  official intimidation.  Defendants have the right to appeal.    There were no reports of political prisoners.       f.   Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or  Correspondence    The Constitution prohibits such practices, government authorities  generally respect these prohibitions, and violations are subject to  effective legal sanction.    Section 2    Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:       a.   Freedom of Speech and Press    The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the press, and  the Government respects these rights in practice.  An independent press,  an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system  combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic  freedom.       b.   Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association    The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government respects  them in practice.       c.   Freedom of Religion    Although the official state religion is Lutheran, the Constitution  provides for freedom of religion, and the Government respects this right  in practice.       d.   Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel,  Emigration, and Repatriation    The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government respects  them in practice.  The Government cooperates with the U.N. High  Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations in  assisting refugees.  There were no reports of forced expulsion of those  having a valid claim to refugee status.    Section 3   Respect for Political Rights:  The Right of Citizens to  Change Their Government    The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their  government peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice  through periodic, free, and fair elections held on the basis of  universal suffrage.  The most recent elections to the Althing  (unicameral Parliament) were held on April 8.    There are no legal or practical impediments to women's participation in  government and politics.  Two of the four top governmental positions-- the President and the Speaker of the Althing--are occupied by women  (both positions are largely ceremonial, however).  There is an active  feminist political party, the Women's List, which won 3 of 63 seats in  the 1995 parliamentary elections.      Section 4   Governmental Attitude Regarding International and  Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights    A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction,  investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases.   Government officials are generally cooperative and responsive to their  views.    Section 5   Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability,  Language, or Social Status    The culture of the ethnically homogeneous population is strongly  egalitarian and opposed to discrimination based on any of these factors.   Government legislation and practice generally reflect this attitude, but  credible reports indicate that both the police and the court system are  hostile or indifferent to rape victims (see below).       Women    Violence against women received increasing public attention, due largely  to the efforts of the Women's List political movement, which continued  to raise it in political debate.  A public women's shelter offers  protection to approximately 350 women and 180 children per year; these  figures are virtually the same as in 1994, indicating a leveling off of  an initial surge in demand for services of the shelter.  There is also a  rape trauma center sponsored and operated by women's organizations; some  400 women and children annually seek assistance there.  Both facilities  are funded by national and municipal governments and private  contributions.  The Reykjavik     City Hospital emergency ward now has an all-female staff to care for  rape victims.    Studies indicate that only a small percentage of cases involving  domestic violence or sexual abuse (rape, attempted rape, or harassment)  are reported to the police.  Women's organizations assert that both the  state investigative police and the court system are hostile or  indifferent to victims of domestic violence or sexual abuse; that female  victims who lodge charges of such offenses are often subjected to  humiliating police interrogation; and that judges are unduly lenient  with sex offenders (the typical prison term for a convicted rapist is 1  or 2 years).  The police have introduced a program to train officers in  correct interrogation procedures, and other government agencies are  paying closer attention to the problem of violence against women.  In  September an all-male committee, working under the auspices of the  Social Affairs Ministry, launched a 2-week campaign, ""Men against  Violence,"" highlighting men's responsibility for the majority of  domestic and sexual violence, and sponsoring seminars on the problem and  ways to eliminate it.    Major economic and political institutions remain male-dominated.   Legislation requiring equal pay for equal work is evidently not being  adequately implemented.  Studies have consistently revealed an average  difference of 40 percent in the earnings of men and women in comparable  jobs; when allowance is made for the longer average working hours (and  overtime) among men, there remains a 20-percent gap.    Since 1991 complaints regarding the Equal Rights Law have been referred  to a special committee under the Equal Rights Affairs Office of the  Ministry of Social Affairs.  The committee has only advisory powers, and  its recommendations to any employer do not have the force of law.  Only  a few complaints have been made to the committee.  Women's groups  speculate that many women are reluctant to come forward with complaints  in Iceland's small, intimate communities and traditionally stoic  culture.  Also, Iceland's largely male-led labor unions have not  actively supported individual women who wish to exercise their right to  take action on such matters.       Children    Great respect for children's rights is evident in the law and in  government policy.  In 1994 the Government created the Office of the  Children's Ombudsman in the Prime Ministry, with a mandate to protect  children's rights, interests, and welfare by, among other things,  exerting influence on legislation, government decisions, and public  attitudes.  Some international custody cases involving Icelanders have  been complicated by the fact that, although Iceland is a signatory to  the Hague Convention on Child Abduction, it has not been brought into  force.  The Foreign Minister opined that Iceland's practices in this  area lay it open to criticism for possible violations of human rights.   In 1994 the Foreign Minister submitted a bill in the Parliament to bring  the Convention into force, but it was not voted on before the end of the  session.  The bill was reintroduced early in the new parliamentary term,  which began in October.       People with Disabilities    Disabled individuals are not subject to discrimination in employment,  education, or provision of other state services.  The Government has  legislated accessibility to public buildings for the disabled.    Section 6   Worker Rights       a.   The Right of Association    Workers make extensive use of the right to establish organizations, draw  up their own constitutions and rules, choose their own leaders and  policies, and publicize their views.  The resulting organizations are  not controlled by the Government or any single political party.  Unions  take active part in Nordic, European, and international trade union  bodies.  With the exception of limited categories of workers in the  public sector whose services are essential to public health or safety,  unions have had and used the right to strike for many years.  Some 76  percent of all eligible workers belong to unions.       b.   The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively    There are no impediments to union membership in law or in practice.   Virtually all unions exercise their right to bargain collectively.  The  central labor and management organizations periodically negotiate  collective bargaining agreements that set nationwide standards and  specific terms for workers' pay, workhours, and other conditions.  The  Government often plays a role in the negotiations, and sometimes  undertakes commitments in order to bring the two sides together.  Labor  courts effectively adjudicate disputes over contracts and over the  rights provided for in the 1938 Act on Trade Unions and Industrial  Disputes, which prohibits antiunion discrimination.    By law, employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required  to reinstate workers fired for union activities.  In practice, the  charges are difficult to prove.    In June 1993, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that the  Government had violated the 11th article of the European Human Rights  Charter, concerning the right of free association, by obliging taxi  drivers to be members of a union.  The new     Parliament is continuing to consider legislation to comply with this  judgment.    There are no export processing or other special economic zones.       c.   Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor    Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law, and does not occur.       d.   Minimum Age for Employment of Children    The law requires children to attend school until the age of 16 and  prohibits employment of children under that age in factories, on ships,  or in other places that are hazardous or require hard labor.  This  prohibition is observed in practice.  Children age 14 or 15 may be  employed part-time or during school vacations in light, nonhazardous  work; their workhours must not exceed the ordinary workhours of adults  in the same occupation.  The Occupational Safety and Health  Administration enforces child labor regulations.       e.   Acceptable Conditions of Work    Although there is no minimum wage law, union membership is so extensive  and effective as to ensure that labor contracts afford even the lowest- paid workers a sufficient income for a decent standard of living for  themselves and their families.      Workers are protected by laws that effectively ensure their health and  safety as well as provide for unemployment insurance, paid vacations,  pensions, and reasonable working conditions and hours.  The standard  legal workweek is 40 hours.  Worktime exceeding 8 hours in a workday  must be compensated as overtime.  Workers are entitled to 10 hours of  rest within each 24-hour period and to a day off every week.  Under  defined special circumstances the 10-hour rest period can be reduced to  8, and the day off can be postponed by a week, in which case the worker  has a right to 2 additional hours off in the following week.    Health and safety standards are set by the Althing and administered and  enforced by the Ministry of Social Affairs through its Occupational  Safety and Health Administration.

GX020-37-9102751	U.S. Mission Home  |   What's new                  United States         Embassy    Tokyo, Japan                                      Transcript: Franks Says No Permanent U.S. Military Bases  in Central Asia   Following is a transcript of the press conference provided  by the U.S. Embassy Tashkent:   (begin transcript)   PRESS CONFERENCE WITH GENERAL TOMMY R. FRANKS  COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND (CENTCOM)   January 24, 2002  Tashkent, Uzbekistan   GENERAL FRANKS: Good morning. It's great to be with you again. I always enjoy  visiting Tashkent. We've been in the region since Monday evening and have had an  opportunity to visit with many of the local leaders here in Tashkent. We've had  a chance to meet with President Karimov as well as Minister {of Defense}  Gulyamov. And in fact it's a pleasure to be back.   The purpose of my visit was to congratulate the President on the fact that  the corridor {from Termez} is now open toward Mazar-e-Sharif. You'll recall that  when I was last here in November we were hopeful that we would be able to get  the Friendship Bridge open and establish that corridor. Now that that's done I  simply wanted to come and express my appreciation to him.   I am pleased at this point with our efforts as a part of the global war to  counter terrorism. I believe that certain aspects of this campaign up to this  point have been successful and I'm pleased with that. We also recognize that a  great deal of work needs to be done. Certainly the Taliban has been destroyed as  a functioning government inside Afghanistan, and the terrorist organizations  inside that country have been fragmented and in a large part destroyed up to  this point.   Our efforts as we go forward will continue to be aimed at the destruction of  remaining pockets or pools of Taliban fighters and Al Qaida located still inside  Afghanistan. And of course the terrorist organization in this region with which  we remain familiar, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, continues to be on our  list to be sought out.   So we will continue our efforts to destroy the remaining remnants of that  organization. Our people will continue to exploit sites inside Afghanistan for  intelligence information, which we will continue to put together in our efforts  to prevent future global terrorist strikes. We will continue to screen and  interrogate detainees for the same purpose. And I have mentioned to all of you  before, we don't know how long this will take. I am pleased to tell you that the  support we have received across the region has been considerable. It has in fact  met our every need and we look forward to being the recipients of that continued  support.   And with that I'll pause and would be pleased to take your questions.   QUESTION FROM RADIO BBC: Today among the CIS countries it became known that  the United States and Uzbekistan have signed an agreement on the lease of  Khanabad airbase for 25 years. Is that true? Please comment on this. The second  question is: do you believe that the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan still  threatens this country? And do you have any information on the location of the  leaders of this movement?   GENERAL FRANKS: On the second question regarding the Islamic Movement of  Uzbekistan, I think that the terrorists that we have seen centered in  Afghanistan over the past several years will remain a danger as long as even  individually they are moving in the area. And so I will not minimize the  potential danger associated with the IMU. I'll just simply say that we will  continue to rout them out until we have the very last of them. My belief is that  the leadership of the IMU has in fact been destroyed.   On the first question, I understand about Kharshi-Khanabad. No, as a matter  of fact there is not an agreement that will permit the use of Kharshi-Khanabad  airbase for 25 years. What we have said all along is that we do not anticipate a  permanent presence in any of the countries in the region, although we have  enjoyed wonderful cooperation with all the states in the region. I would  anticipate that Uzbekistan as well as the other nations in the region will  continue to cooperate with us. But we have not at all made any long-term  arrangements for a presence either in Uzbekistan or in any of the other states  in Central Asia.   QUESTION FROM TURKESTAN PRESS: I'm glad to welcome you again to Uzbekistan,  and I would like you to comment on the plan of contacts you have signed with the  Ministry of Defense of Uzbekistan.   GENERAL FRANKS: Military-to-military relationships. What we do with our  partner and cooperating nations is, at the beginning of each year, the two sides  get together and decide what the military-to-military exchanges, education and  security assistance may be for the coming year. And that was the document that I  signed Tuesday at the Ministry of Defense. It's a very good, a very cooperative  document that sort of provides us a roadmap for the year 2002.   QUESTION FROM KOMERSANT - RUSSIA: The first question is: how do you comment  on the leaflets that appeared in Kyrgyzstan and which call for opposition  against the deployment of U.S. military bases in the region? The second question  is: in Kazakhstan the Kazakh military has prepared a military detachment which  they proposed to the United States military be used in the operations and to be  deployed in Kabul. Will you accept this offer?   GENERAL FRANKS: On the International Security Assistance Force offer that was  mentioned by Kazakhstan, I really don't have any information on it because the  lead nation for that force is the United Kingdom. So I can't even speculate  about the countries that have offered to participate in that.   With respect to the question about the leaflets or pamphlets inside  Kyrgyzstan having something to do with our force positioning in the Manas  airfield, the only thing that I can say is that yesterday I visited Bishkek. I  had the opportunity to meet with President Akayev and I also had the opportunity  to visit the Lower House of the Kyrgyz Parliament. And what I found was very  uniform cooperation. I walked away from those meetings with a sense that in fact  our forces would be very welcome inside Kyrgyzstan.   QUESTION: The first question is: please comment on the terrorist attacks on  the American Center in Calcutta, India. And the second question is: please  comment on the means of settling the dispute between India and Pakistan over the  Kashmir problem.   GENERAL FRANKS: On the subject of India and Pakistani relations I would say  that at this point I have been pleased with the work I have seen done on both  sides. I think that the dialogue between India and Pakistan, the identification  of extremists within Pakistan in cooperation with the leadership of India makes  me hopeful that that crisis can move forward positively. With respect to the  attack on targets inside India, the only comment that I would make is that I  think that we have great confidence in the law enforcement capability within  India. We place our confidence in them and I believe the law enforcement  activity will conduct the appropriate investigation of that incident.   And I have a brief follow-up if I may. With respect to the specific question  on Kashmir, along the line of contact and the line of control, of course we have  seen tension for many years. The only comment that I can actually make about  that is that I am hopeful that as a part of this dialogue and discussion between  India and Pakistan that we can move something forward on the Kashmir issue in  the future.   QUESTION FROM THE FINANCIAL TIMES OF LONDON: General, you said that you are  planning to rout out the IMU. I was wondering if you could go into a little more  detail on exactly what that involves. For instance would it potentially include  U.S. troop involvement in the former Soviet Union in going after IMU potential  bases here and cells and whatnot?   GENERAL FRANKS: On the IMU, my comments will focus on Afghanistan because I  believe that's where the remnants of IMU, Al Qaida and perhaps some other groups  remain. And our operations within Afghanistan will continue to be conducted in  cooperation and in coordination with Chairman Karzai and the interim government  of Afghanistan. The operations had to do with taking the intelligence  information that we receive, identifying potential locations of remnants of  terrorist organizations, perhaps the IMU, perhaps Al Qaida, perhaps small  numbers of hard core Taliban. Then in cooperation with the Afghans, we move our  forces to confirm or deny the presence of these puddles or of these groups and  where we find them, we take them down.   And so that will be the approach that we take. I don't have any comment to  make about states in the region, because we have not had requests for assistance  by the coalition in the Central Asian states and so we will just continue our  cooperation as we have had in the past until we have routed out the remainder of  these people where we find them.   And a brief follow-up to that one if I may. As I mentioned earlier, we have  cooperative relationships and military to military programs with each of the  nations in Central Asia. Those arrangements for cooperation have to do with the  sharing of intelligence. They have to do with the sharing of training. And so  these cooperative arrangements provide opportunities for us to work with all of  the military forces in the region to provide assistance where it is requested,  to enable forces in each of the nations of Central Asia to be able to work on  the IMU problem if there is perceived to be one in any of the states locally.   QUESTION FROM ITAR-TASS: Tuesday you signed a document with the Uzbek  military. Is it a document between Central Command and the Uzbek Ministry of  Defense? Or is it a document between the U.S. Department of Defense and the  Uzbek Ministry of Defense? Could you elaborate on the most important articles in  the document and what kind of military cooperation is envisioned in the  framework of this document for 2002?   GENERAL FRANKS: Thank you. The military cooperation document was between the  United States Central Command and the Ministry of Defense of Uzbekistan. And  described in the document are visits by the American military to Uzbekistan for  discussions and conferences with their counterparts, as well as visits by Uzbek  military to the United States for discussions, seminars and so forth.   Also included in the Memorandum of Agreement are training events. For  example, where American small units will come and train alongside their Uzbek  counterparts on several occasions this year. Also mentioned in the  military-to-military document are opportunities for Uzbek officers to receive  training inside the United States. And finally, there is also mentioned in the  document, partner relationships between some units in the United States and some  Uzbek units.   QUESTION FROM NOVI DIEN: Yesterday you visited Bishkek. Could you please  elaborate on the talks you had with the Kyrgyz President and what issues were  discussed during your meeting? The second question is: Senator Daschle was  visiting Uzbekistan last week and was talking about the State of the Union  address that the President will make to Congress and the nation. Could you  please explain what kind of statement this will be?   GENERAL FRANKS: On the second question, President Bush will address a joint  session of Congress on the 29th of the month, and I honestly have no idea what  he'll talk about. I think we are all anxious to hear it ourselves. So I really  don't know what he'll say.   With respect to my meeting with President Akayev, essentially I told him,  'thank you' for Kyrgyzstan's support of Operation Enduring Freedom. As I had  said to President Karimov, I think considerable work has been done and I  congratulated President Karimov in our meeting for the cooperation and the  support and the assistance given by Uzbekistan.   When I was in Kyrgyzstan meeting with President Akayev I did essentially the  same thing. Kyrgyzstan has provided support, verbal and tangible, to this  operation and I very simply wanted to say thank you and extend the appreciation  of my government to Kyrgyzstan.   And one additional comment I'd like to make also. As I have talked with my  friends and professional associates across Central Asia, I have made a point  with respect to my relationship and our relationship with Russia and with the  Russians in the region. And some of my friends have asked me if there is a  competition in our relationship? And I've offered two points. The first one is  that in fact we have at my headquarters representatives of 26 nations who  provide liaison and with whom we provide discussion every day. And one of these  liaison cells is from Russia. So as we have gone through Operation Enduring  Freedom we have had an opportunity every day to coordinate our activities in the  region and inside Afghanistan.   And I have pointed out some of the contributions the Russians have made to  the situation in Afghanistan by giving examples. One example that I have used is  a Russian hospital, which is currently operating in Kabul. We have cooperated  with the Russians in placing this hospital there, and it's a very good thing  because it is providing medical support and assistance to literally thousands of  Afghans. That sort of effort is to be greatly appreciated. And I expect that  cooperation to continue.   And in fact this young lady has been standing here a long time, so we'll take  one last question.   QUESTION FROM BBC NEWS: Thank you. A quick question. You mentioned earlier  that you believe the leadership of the IMU had been destroyed. I wondered if you  could explain what evidence you have to support that. In particular relating to  the reported death of Juma Namangani?   GENERAL FRANKS: Perhaps I have a not very satisfying answer for you. As we  have gone through Operation Enduring Freedom we have never made it a practice to  describe the sources of information or the way we receive, the way we process,  and the way we use intelligence. So I'll only answer your question by saying the  information that I have reflects that Namangani is dead and I'll stay with that.   Thanks to all of you for your hospitality. Thanks very much for coming. And  we'll see all of you again soon.

GX020-45-4912158	"[Print Friendly Version]      Media Note Office of the Spokesman Washington, DC January 15, 2002 Religious Leaders from Kyrgyzstan Examine Islam in the United States  A group of six religious leaders from Kyrgyzstan, including Imams and heads of Islamic institutions, have begun a 14-day professional program ""Islam in the United States,"" sponsored by the International Visitor Program of the Departments Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. This program is designed to strengthen the participants understanding of the relationship between religion and government in the United States and to deepen their awareness that religious diversity is a result of this nations history of tolerance and religious freedom.    The participants will gain an understanding of the first amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits our governments intervention in religious affairs, as well as U.S. policy and official statements related to Islam. Intended to establish links between the Islamic community in the United States and Muslims in Kyrgyzstan, the program will reflect not only that Islam and democracy are compatible, but that the United States respects Islam and acknowledges the important contributions of Muslims in this country. Islam is the single most widely practiced faith in Kyrgyzstan. (U.S. State Department estimates are that up to 80% of the population is Muslim, 17% is Russian Orthodox, and 3% is Jewish, Buddhist, or Catholic.)    In Washington, DC  (January 14-16) , Los Angeles  (January 17-23) , and Houston, Texas  (January 23- 26)  the participants (see attached list) will meet with American Muslims, consult with experts at university studies centers, and visit a range of religious institutions. The group will gain first-hand exposure to American religious diversity and to community interfaith initiatives aimed at building religious tolerance.   The program topics include the relationship between religion and government in the United States; the history and development of Islam in the United States; the implications and contributions of religious diversity in U.S. society and approaches to encouraging religious tolerance in religiously diverse communities; and current issues in U.S. policy and the Islamic world.   The International Visitor Program of the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs brings participantscurrent or potential leaders in government, politics, the media, education and other fieldsto the United States from all over the world each year to meet and confer with their professional counterparts and to experience the United States firsthand.

GX002-45-12878663	[Print Friendly Version]      Restructuring and Reducing Iraqi Debt President George W. Bush Washington, DC December 5, 2003 Iraq is moving toward freedom, stability and prosperity. In order to support this effort, I am pleased to announce today that in response to a request from the Iraqi Governing Council for assistance, I have appointed James A. Baker III to be my personal envoy on the issue of Iraqi debt. Secretary Baker will report directly to me and will lead an effort to work with the world's governments at the highest levels with international organizations and with the Iraqis in seeking the restructuring and reduction of Iraq's official debt. The future of the Iraqi people should not be mortgaged to the enormous burden of debt incurred to enrich Saddam Hussein's regime. This debt endangers Iraq's long-term prospects for political health and economic prosperity. The issue of Iraqi debt must be resolved in a manner that is fair and that does not unjustly burden a struggling nation at its moment of hope and promise. James Baker's vast economic, political and diplomatic experience as a former Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury will help to forge an international consensus for an equitable and effective resolution of this issue.

The transition from communism has been slow and troubled in Kyrgyzstan. Despite the exceptional progress of the past five years, the country remains very poor by any European standard. Macroeconomic stability and democratic politics have not transformed yet into tangible economic and social improvements. Kyrgyzstanns are frustrated and angered by the influence of organized crime and endemic corruption. In a nut shell, democracy and market economy in Kyrgyzstan are stuck in their adolescence.       The invitation to join NATO extended to the country on November 21, 2002 and the Roadmap for EU accession released by the Union in December are the two key events that will shape the development environment in the next 4-5 years. Acting already as a ""de facto ally"", Kyrgyzstan becomes even more important as an anchor of stability in the region and as a development model for its neighbors. By virtue of its geographic position the country has an important role in preventing gray arms transfers, supporting the war on terrorism, and in countering significant international criminal activities including trafficking in people, drugs and weapons. The growing international importance of Kyrgyzstan to U.S. national interests makes it crucial for them to address development constraints while proving the country as a reliable NATO partner.       Within this international context, several alarming political trends have characterized Kyrgyzstan for the past two years: a growing gap between popular expectations and the political elite's agenda, plunging trust in the public institutions, and general disengagement from public life. In addition to this mounting political apathy, the ruling majority is further troubled by internal disagreement and poor coordination among the state institutions. Major deficiencies in enforcing the rule of law exacerbate this plummeting public trust in the state institutions. The Kyrgyzstann judiciary remains weak, poorly administered, under-funded, and low in morale. Crime and corruption continue to be major problems, with excessive discretionary power at all levels, over-bureaucratized and ineffective administrative systems, legislative gaps, weak law enforcement, and insufficiently developed oversight mechanisms. With regard to local governance, the significant policy advances in fiscal decentralization made during the past year remain to be translated into specific legislative measures and state budgets. While the Kyrgyzstann Government remains committed to the reform, the pace is still slow. The upcoming municipal elections in late 2003 may further delay the process.

GX023-48-5661466	"Iceland Country Reports on Human Rights Practices   -   1999 Released by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor February 23, 2000 Iceland is a constitutional republic and a parliamentary democracy in which citizens periodically choose their representatives in free and fair multiparty elections. The judiciary is independent.   Elected officials control the police force, which scrupulously observes and enforces the laws that ensure protection of human rights.   Iceland has a mixed, open economy that provides residents with a high standard of living. The leading exports, fish and other marine products, account for almost 70 percent of export revenues. An abundance of cheap hydroelectric power provides a comparative advantage for the main manufacturing activity--aluminum smelting. Aluminum is the second leading export. Growth was expected to exceed 5 percent in 1999.   The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law and judiciary provide effective means of dealing with individual instances of abuse. Human rights monitors expressed concern about the Government's frequent use of solitary confinement for remand prisoners. The Government is taking steps to deal with violence against women. Some societal discrimination against women persists, especially in the area of equal pay. Instances of suspected trafficking in women were reported.   RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS    Section 1: Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:   a. Political and Other Extrajudicial Killing   There were no reports of political or other extrajudicial killings.   b. Disappearance   There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances.   c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment   Torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment are prohibited by law and do not occur.   Prison conditions generally meet minimum international standards.   In a February report, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) expressed concern during its visit to the main prison (Litla Hraun) in Reykjavik in 1998 that nearly all detainees still were being placed in solitary confinement while their cases were under investigation. While the average duration of solitary confinement was between 2 and 3 weeks, the CPT noted that in some cases, solitary confinement lasted up to 3 months. While in solitary confinement, prisoners cannot leave their cells, except for short periods of time to exercise alone or to use the showers, and are not allowed to listen to the radio, watch television, or receive visitors other than their lawyers and prison officials. In November the supervising doctor at Litla Hraun wrote to prison authorities, warning that the mental health of several prisoners awaiting trial on drug trafficking charges could be in danger due to the extended time that they were expected to spend in solitary confinement.   In a preliminary response to the CPT report on September 30, the Government argued that solitary confinement was absolutely necessary in some circumstances to keep suspects from tampering with witnesses, destroying evidence, or hindering the investigation. On the other hand, it conceded that ""in the vast majority of cases"" incarceration alone was sufficient to protect the integrity of witnesses and evidence. However, the Prison and Probation Administration's own statistics show that solitary confinement was the rule rather than the exception during the first 9 months of the year: more than 90 percent of the 87 persons taken into custody were put into solitary confinement at least initially.   With the closing of the Sudumuli remand prison in 1996, the Government passed a law in 1998 that allows pretrial detainees to be incarcerated with the general prison population. Some human rights monitors claim that this law is inconsistent with the country's obligations under the European Human Rights Convention and European prison rules issued by the Council of Europe. Construction of a new prison in Reykjavik is planned for these detainees.   Juveniles who are 15 years of age or older can be sentenced to prison terms, but the vast majority of juvenile offenders are given probation or suspended sentences, or agree to attend a treatment program instead of going to jail. In the rare instances when juvenile offenders are incarcerated, they must be confined with the general adult prison population due to the lack of a separate detention facility for juveniles. In its February report, the CPT stated that it was ""very concerned"" about the current situation and recommended that the Government take ""immediate steps...to ensure that juvenile prisoners are held separately from adults.""   The Government permits prison visits by human rights monitors.   d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile   The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest, detention, or exile, and the Government observes this prohibition.   e. Denial of Fair Public Trial   The Constitution and law provide for an independent judiciary, and the Government respects this provision in practice.   There are two levels of courts. The Ministry of Justice administers the district courts, while the Supreme Court guards its independence and fairness by administering itself. All judges, at all levels, serve for life.   The judiciary provides citizens with a fair and efficient judicial process. Juries are not used, but multijudge panels are common, especially in the appeals process. Depending on the seriousness of the charges, a panel can include from three to five judges. Defendants are presumed innocent. They are provided access to legal counsel of their own choosing with sufficient time to prepare their defense. For defendants unable to pay attorneys' fees, the State assumes the cost. Defendants have the right to be present at their trial, to confront witnesses, and to participate otherwise in the proceedings. No groups are barred from testifying, and all testimony is treated alike. Trials are public and are conducted fairly, with no official intimidation. Defendants have the right to appeal.   There were no reports of political prisoners.   f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence   The Constitution prohibits such practices, and the Government generally respect these prohibitions. Violations are subject to effective legal sanction.   Section 2: Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:   a. Freedom of Speech and Press The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the press, and the Government respects these rights in practice. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combine to ensure freedom of speech and of the press, including academic freedom.   b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association   The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.   c. Freedom of Religion   Although the official state religion is Lutheranism, the Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government respects this right in practice. The salaries of Lutheran ministers are paid by the state. Citizens 16 years of age and above are presumed to be members of the state church and are required to support the church by paying a tax, unless they designate another religious denomination to receive their tax payment. The religion tax payment of persons who choose not to belong to any specific, organized religious group goes to the University of Iceland. Religious instruction in Christianity is required in the public schools, although students may be exempted.   d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation   The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government respects them in practice.   Although neither the Constitution nor the law include provisions for granting refugee or asylee status in accordance with the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, in practice the Government adjudicates cases in accordance with their principles. The Government cooperates with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Committee of the Red Cross, and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. There were no reports of the forced expulsion of those having a valid claim to refugee status. In view of the country's geographic isolation and the lack of direct transportation from any traditional source of refugees, the question of first asylum rarely arises. However, the Government reported that 13 individuals arrived during the year and requested asylum. None was found to qualify for refugee status (several cases were still under review), but some were granted temporary entry on humanitarian grounds. Some human rights monitors criticized the arrest and prolonged detention of a Kurdish asylum-seeker, but the Directorate of Immigration, which has responsibility for processing applications for asylum, stated that it had no choice but to turn the individual over to the police for investigation because he had no identity or travel documents and refused to cooperate with the authorities.   The Directorate of Immigration, which traditionally was a part of the national police force, became an independent agency on October 1. The Directorate is responsible for issuing passports, visas, and residence permits and for processing applications for asylum, while the police and customs now have responsibility for manning passport control points for those coming into and going out of the country. However, the police and customs are required to consult with the Directorate of Immigration about individuals arriving without valid visas or passports before refusing them entry. Human rights monitors say that it appears that some of the individuals who were refused entry upon arrival at the international airport during the year were not afforded their legal right to appeal their denial of admission.   In addition to accepting 20 to 25 UNHCR-designated ""quota"" refugees, the Government admitted 72 Kosovar refugees into the country during the year. Local government authorities in the towns where refugees settle take a strong interest in helping them adapt to their new environment. The Icelandic Red Cross, in cooperation with the Refugee Council of the Ministry of Social Affairs, developed a support family program, whereby at least three Icelandic families are enlisted to assist each refugee or refugee family. The refugees immediately are granted work permits and assisted in finding jobs. For the first year, they also are given free housing, utilities, and health care and receive a stipend so that they can participate in a special half-day Icelandic language course every day that is designed especially for them. Refugees generally are successful in assimilating into society, but their children drop out of school earlier than children of citizens.   Section 3: Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Government   The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair elections held on the basis of universal suffrage. The most recent elections to the Althingi (unicameral Parliament) were held in May.   Women are underrepresented in government and politics, but no legal or practical impediments hinder their participation. Of the 12 government ministers, 4 are women, and women hold 23 of the 63 seats in Parliament. The Women's List (WL), an activist feminist political party whose establishment in 1983 led to a significant increase in the number of female parliamentarians, joined an electoral alliance with other left-leaning parties in the May elections. The WL plans to merge eventually with the other left-leaning political parties to form a single entity to challenge the more conservative parties. Women's issues have moved into the mainstream of political debate, and all of the major political parties now have at least one woman in a prominent leadership position.   Section 4: Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights   A number of human rights groups operate without government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials are generally cooperative and responsive to their views.   Section 5: Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or Social Status   The country's ethnically homogenous population is strongly egalitarian and opposed to discrimination based on any of these factors. The law and practice generally reflect this attitude. However, concern is voiced that the rapidly increasing number of foreigners being brought into the country to meet the labor shortage in fish processing and other less desirable occupations could lead to future problems, especially in the event of an economic downturn. Some 14,000 people of foreign origin now live in the country (approximately 2 percent of the population). During the last half of the year, the Directorate of Immigration was issuing new residence and work permits at the rate of more than 200 per month. Many of these ""temporary"" workers come from Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and the Directorate of Immigration expects most of them to seek to remain permanently rather than return to their countries of origin.   Women   Violence against women continued to be a matter of concern. A public women's shelter offers counseling and protection to victims of domestic violence and their children. Approximately 400 women and 150 children came to the shelter during the year, 100 of whom sought shelter while the rest asked for counseling or information. At a rape trauma center, 400 women and children seek assistance annually. Both facilities are financed by national and municipal governments, as well as by private contributors. The Reykjavik City Hospital emergency ward has a special staff to care for rape victims. It reports approximately 100 visits per year associated with incidents of sexual abuse.   A police program to train officers in correct interrogation procedures in rape and sexual abuse cases appears to be addressing prior concerns that police indifference and hostility to female victims did not assure proper attention and consideration for victims of such abuses.   Many victims nevertheless decline to press charges, and even more forgo trial, fearing publicity in this small, tightly knit society. With an increasing number of interracial marriages, mostly involving Icelandic men and Asian women, there is concern that these new Asian immigrants are not assimilating well into local society. Concern that these women might be vulnerable to mistreatment led the city of Reykjavik to begin offering them emergency accommodation and assistance, which includes information on legal rights, language training, and an introduction to Icelandic society and norms.   There were indications that some women were trafficked to work as striptease dancers or prostitutes against their will (see Section 6.f.).   In the labor market, the rate of participation by women is high. In part this reflects the country's comprehensive system of subsidized day care, which makes it affordable and convenient for women to work outside the home. Despite laws that require equal pay for equal work, a sizeable pay gap continues to exist between men and women. A survey by a union in Reykjavik showed that women, on average, earned 30 percent less than men. A 12 percent difference in pay is attributable to the fact that men work 4.2 more hours per week than women, but the rest of the gap is unexplained.   Children   The Government demonstrates its strong commitment to children's rights through its well-funded systems of public education and medical care. School attendance is compulsory through the age of 15. About 85 percent of students continue to upper secondary education, which is financed completely by the state. The Government provides free prenatal and infant medical care, as well as heavily subsidized children's care. In 1994 the government created the Office of the Children's Ombudsman in the Prime Minister's Office, with a mandate to protect children's rights, interests, and welfare by, among other things, exerting influence on legislation, government decisions, and public attitudes.   There is no societal pattern of abuse directed against children.   In an effort to improve the rate of prosecution of child sexual abuse and lessen the trauma to the child, the Government in 1998 established the Children's Assessment Center. The objective of the Center is to create a safe and secure environment where child victims feel more comfortable talking about what happened to them and are not subjected to multiple interviews. The Center brings together police, prosecutors, judges, doctors, and counselors, as well as officials from the Child Protection Agency of the Ministry of Social Affairs. Prior to the establishment of the Center, barely half of the cases dealt with by the Child Protection Agency were sent to the police for investigation, just a third went to the prosecutor, and only 10 percent ever went to trial. Now some 75 percent of cases are sent to the police for investigation, and the authorities anticipate a corresponding increase in the percentage of cases being prosecuted and sent to trial.   People with Disabilities   Disabled individuals are not subject to discrimination in employment, education, or the provision of other state services. A 1992 law calls for the disabled to have the right to ""all common national and municipal services"" and provides that they be given assistance to ""make it possible for them to live and work in normal society with others."" The law also provides that the disabled should receive preference for a government job when they are equally qualified, or more qualified, than regular applicants. Building regulations updated in 1998 call for public buildings to be accessible. However, the country's main association for the disabled complains that the provisions related to building access often are ignored because there is no penalty for noncompliance. Access to new buildings tends to be good, while efforts to make old buildings more accessible have lagged.       Section 6: Worker Rights   a. The Right of Association   Workers make extensive use of the right provided by the Constitution to establish organizations, draw up their own constitutions and rules, choose their own leaders and policies, and publicize their views. The resulting organizations are controlled neither by the Government nor by any single political party. Unions take active part in Nordic, European, and other international trade union bodies. With the exception of limited categories of workers in the public sector whose services are essential to public health or safety, unions have had and used the right to strike for many years. Approximately 80 percent of all eligible workers belong to unions. No strikes occurred during the year, but there were a handful of work stoppages.   b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively   Union membership is not impeded in law or practice. Employers are required to withhold union dues (1 percent of gross pay) from the pay of all employees, whether they are members of the union or not. This is because union dues help support, among other things, an illness fund to which everyone is entitled.   The various trade unions and management organizations periodically negotiate collective bargaining agreements that set specific terms for workers' pay, hours, and other conditions. The current 3-year collective bargaining agreements expire in February 2000. In recent years, the Government has played almost no role in the private-sector collective bargaining process, other than generally to encourage wage restraint that would help to limit inflation.   Labor courts effectively adjudicate disputes over contracts and over the rights provided for in the 1938 Act on Trade Unions and Industrial Disputes, which prohibits antiunion discrimination. By law employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union activities. In practice the charges are difficult to prove.   In 1996 the Parliament passed legislation updating the labor laws and bringing them into compliance with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. There are no export processing or other special economic zones. c. Prohibition of Forced or Compulsory Labor   Forced or compulsory labor is prohibited by law and does not occur; however, some women reportedly were coerced to work as striptease dancers or prostitutes (see Section 6.f.), and work permit practices could leave workers vulnerable to abuse by employers (see Section 6.e.). The law prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, and the Government enforces this prohibition effectively.   d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment   The law prohibits forced and bonded labor by children, and the Government enforces this prohibition effectively (see Section 6.c.). The law requires children to attend school until the age of 16 and prohibits the employment of younger children in factories, on ships, or in other places that are hazardous or require hard labor. This prohibition is observed in practice. Children 14 or 15 years old may be employed part time or during school vacations in light, nonhazardous work. Their work-hours must not exceed the ordinary work-hours of adults in the same occupation. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration enforces child labor regulations.   e. Acceptable Conditions of Work   No minimum wage is mandated legislatively, but the minimum wages negotiated in the various collective bargaining agreements apply automatically to all employees in those occupations, whether they are union members or not. Union membership is so extensive and effective that labor contracts afford even the lowest paid workers a sufficient income for a decent standard of living for themselves and their families.   Workers are protected by laws that effectively provide for their health and safety as well as for unemployment insurance, paid vacations, pensions, and reasonable working conditions and hours. The standard legal workweek is 40 hours. Work exceeding 8 hours in a workday must be compensated as overtime. Workers are entitled to 10 hours of rest within each 24-hour period and to a day off every week. Under defined special circumstances, the 10-hour rest period can be reduced to 8, and the day off can be postponed by a week, in which case the worker has a right to 2 additional hours off in the following week.   Health and safety standards are set by the Althingi and administered and enforced by the Ministry of Social Affairs through its Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which can close down workplaces until safety and health standards are met. Workers have a collective, not an individual, right to refuse to work in a place that does not meet the criteria of occupational safety and health. Firing workers who report unsafe or unhealthy conditions is illegal.   However, in the case of newly arrived foreign workers or refugees (i.e., those who have been in the country for less than 3 years), human rights monitors expressed concern that the Government's practice of issuing the applicable work permit to the employer rather than to the individual concerned could leave the worker vulnerable to abuse by the employer.   f. Trafficking in Persons   The law does not specifically criminalize trafficking in persons; however, a number of provisions in the Penal Code can be used to prosecute such cases.   Trafficking in women is suspected in connection with the growing number of foreign women who enter the country to work in striptease clubs. With the recent opening of several new striptease clubs (there are now 11 clubs altogether), the police expressed concern about the 500 women who entered the country during the year to work in these establishments. It is suspected that some of the women--especially those from Eastern and Central Europe and the former Soviet Union--were coerced to work as striptease dancers or prostitutes against their will.   Regulation of these clubs has been lacking, in part because striptease dancers can enter the country and perform without a work permit for up to a month under an exemption given for ""artists."" The Government plans to close this legal loophole.   By year's end, there had been no arrests in connection with these activities.   [end of document]"
GX034-90-8879283	"International Security  |  Arms Control                               14 March 2003        Bush Meets with Victims of Saddam's Chemical Attacks    Tells them the Iraqi people will soon be freed   By Alicia K. Langley  Washington File Staff Writer      Washington  -- President Bush met in the Oval Office March 14 for 20 minutes with three Iraqis affected by Saddam Hussein's chemical attacks in Iraq in the late 1980s.    The three, Idres Hawarry, Della Jaff and Katrin Michael, who now live in the United States, said that although they did most of the talking during their visit to the Oval Office, Bush gave them hope by implying that the Iraqi people would soon be freed from tyranny.    They told him about their personal experiences during Saddam Hussein's chemical attacks in northern Iraq in 1987 and 1988.    Each said they live with harrowing memories as a result of the chemical attacks that were launched against 40 Kurdish villages and thousands of innocent civilians in 1987 and 1988. The worst of these attacks devastated the Iraqi city of Halabja on March 16, 1988.    Michael said she was affected by cyanide and mustard gases that left her blind for three days. She received treatment, but continues to have breathing difficulties. She told reporters after meeting with Bush that her message to Saddam is ""not to use any chemical weapons against any people.""    Hawarry has family that still live in Iraq. ""I worry about them and I pray for them,"" he said.    Jaff, a self-described activist living now in Reston, Virginia, said she would return to Iraq to help rebuild her country. She was not in Halabja during the chemical attacks, but when she heard about the destruction and massive death toll, she said she suffered psychologically.    Five thousand civilians, many of them women, children, and the elderly, died within hours of the attack on Halabja. Ten thousand more were blinded, maimed, disfigured, or otherwise severely and irreversibly debilitated, while thousands more died of horrific complications, diseases, and birth defects in the years after, according to information collected by the U.S. State Department.    That information shows that Saddam Hussein used Halabja as testing grounds to gauge the ability of his chemical agents to kill, maim and terrorize population centers. The State Department says Iraqi soldiers in protective gear returned to Halabja to study the effectiveness of their weapons and attacks, and divided the city into grids, determining the number and the location of the dead and the extent of injuries.

It continues to provide material support to Hizballah in Lebanon and to Palestinian groups that oppose the Arab-Israeli peace process, such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Some Al Qaeda activists are reportedly in Iran as well, although their relationship with the regime, if any, is unclear. Iran's human rights practices, particularly its treatment of the Baha'i and the Jewish communities, are frequently criticized by U.S. officials and Members of Congress. The Bush Administration has continued most aspects of the containment policies toward Iran that characterized preceding administrations. During the first term of the Clinton Administration, as part of a policy of ""dual containment"" of Iran and Iraq, President Clinton imposed a ban on U.S. trade and investment in Iran in 1995, and a 1996 law imposed sanctions on foreign investment in Iran's energy sector (Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, ILSA). In keeping with a 1997 policy shift toward engagement, the Clinton Administration and Congress later eased sanctions to allow U.S. exports to Iran of food and medical supplies and importation from Iran of goods such as carpets and caviar. The United States has consistently worked with its allies to prevent arms and advanced technology sales to Iran and to limit Iran's influence over regional energy flows. U.S. purchases of Iranian crude oil and U.S. company investments in Iran remain barred. ILSA was renewed for another 5 years on August 3, 2001 (H.R. 1954, P.L. 107-24).  During the late 1990s, signs of moderation in Iran had stimulated the United States to try to engage Iran in broad, official talks. Iran, still split between conservatives and reformers loyal to President Mohammad Khatemi, remains distrustful of the United States and has not accepted. Relations took another downturn when Iran was grouped with North Korea and Iraq as part of the ""axis of evil"" identified in President Bush's January 29, 2002 State of the Union message. The grouping came despite Iran's tacit cooperation with the United States against the Taliban in the post-September 11, 2001 war in Afghanistan. Iran was also quietly helpful in the U.S. effort to oust Iraq's Saddam Hussein in 2003, although Iran might be attempting to support Shiite Islamic factions there that would greatly boost Iran's influence in post-war Iraq. The Bush Administration has warned Iran not to meddle in post-war Iraq, but has sought to dampen speculation that the United States might move against Iran militarily as part of a next step in the ""war on terrorism."" President Bush has identified Iran's efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction and delivery means, coupled with its support of terrorist groups, as key U.S. concerns. In particular, Iran's nuclear program has made major strides recently and prompted a level of Administration concern that some describe as alarm. The Bush Administration has identified Iran's modernization of its conventional forces as a potential threat to U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf, but others argue that the buildup has been minor and that Iran still is relatively poorly equipped.  Congressional Research Service  ~ The Library of Congress   IB93033  04-25-03  M  OST  RECENT DEVELOP  MENTS  In December 2002, U.S. officials said that Iran is building two previously unknown nuclear sites at Arak and Natanz, which could be used in a nuclear weapons program. A visit by the International Atomic Energy Agency to the Natanz facility on February 21 found that the facility contained a more advanced uranium enrichment program than was expected. On April 23, Administration officials warned Iran not to meddle in post-Saddam Iraq by supporting Shiite Islamist organizations seeking power there, although without specifically threatening military action if Iran defied the warning.  BACKGROUND  AND  ANAL  YSIS  A power struggle in Iran between revolutionary purists and more moderate reformists colors Iran's domestic and foreign policies. Since February 2002 testimony, DCI George Tenet has been saying that Iran's reform movement is ""losing momentum"" to the ""unelected"" hardliners. Since mid-2002, President Mohammad Khatemi has become more vocal in criticizing obstructions by hardliners, and in late August 2002, he proposed new legislation that would strengthen the power of his office; it was passed by the Majlis but still pending before the legislative review body called the Council of Guardians. Khatemi, who was re-elected on June 8, 2001 by a landslide 77% of the vote against nine more conservative candidates, remains popular, by most accounts. His reelection victory was larger than his 69% first win in May 1997. His supporters have held about 70% of the seats in the 290-seat Majlis (parliament) since their victory in the February 18, 2000 Majlis elections. However, Khatemi's reform program has been largely obstructed by hardliners, including Supreme Leader Ali Khamene'i (successor to Ayatollah Khomeini), who control key revolutionary institutions such as the Council of Guardians. Since early 2000, hardliners in the judiciary have closed more than 60 reformist newspapers and imprisoned or questioned several editors and even some members of the Majlis. Khatemi suffered a political setback in February 28, 2003, local elections, with hardliners winning most of the seats in Tehran in a low turnout (14% in Tehran) election that suggested reformist disillusionment at the slow pace of reform thus far. The arrests and trials of reformists are one example of Khatemi's difficulty. In November 2002, a popular history professor and ally of Khatemi, Hashem Aghajari, was convicted by a local (Hamadan) court of apostasy and sentenced to death, prompting several days of student demonstrations and some clashes with hardline security enforcers. Khamene'i ordered the sentence reviewed; Iran's Supreme Court revoked the sentence in February 2003.  Iran's Strategic Buildup Iran is not considered a major conventional threat to the United States, but some of its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, are making significant progress and could put U.S. allies and forces at risk. CRS-1   IB93033  04-25-03  Conventional Weapons Iran's armed forces total about 550,000 personnel, including both the regular military and the Revolutionary Guard, the latter of which is loyal to the hardliners. According to U.S. military officials, Iran's forces could block the Strait of Hormuz at least temporarily, but Iran is largely lacking in ability to project power far beyond its borders. See CRS Report RL31529, Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations, 1994-2001.  Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) It is partly because of Iran's attempts to acquire WMD that January 29, 2002 State of the Union message, labeled Iran part of with Iraq and North Korea. Iran's programs continue to be assisted Russia, China, and North Korea. For further information, see CRS Arms and Weapons of Mass Destruction Suppliers. President Bush, in his an ""axis of evil"" along primarily by entities in Report RL30551, Iran:  Nuclear Program. Concerns are growing about the scope of Iran's nuclear program, despite Iran's occasional voluntary revelations about its facilities. In response to allegations by Iran's exiled opposition, Iran acknowledged in December 2002 that it is building two additional facilities, at Arak and Natanz, that could be used for a nuclear weapons program. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) director Mohammad Baradei visited the Natanz site on February 21, 2003, and said that it was a more advanced uranium enrichment facility than was expected. It could produce enriched uranium by 2005. The Arak facility reportedly is a heavy water reactor that could be used to produce plutonium. Khatemi also announced before the visit that Iran is mining its own uranium. The Bush Administration said the sites indicate Iran is planning to try to acquire a nuclear weapon, despite Iran's assertion that the sites are for electricity generation purposes only, and the revelations mean Iran might produce a nuclear weapon sooner than the 8 to 10 years previously thought. During the IAEA visit, Iran refused the IAEA's urging that it sign the ""Additional Protocol"" to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which would allow no-notice inspections, but it did pledge to inform the IAEA in advance of constructing any new nuclear facilities. The Arak and Natanz revelations have overshadowed the previous focus of U.S. concern: Russia's work, under a January 1995 contract with Iran, to complete a nuclear power plant at Bushehr. The plant is to be operational by the end of 2003. Russia says that it has reached agreement with Iran to supply fuel for the reactor for ten years and for Russia to reprocess the plant's spent nuclear material. Chemical and Biological Weapons. Official U.S. reports state that Iran is seeking a self-sufficient chemical weapons infrastructure, mainly from Chinese sources, and that it has stockpiled chemical weapons, including blister, blood, and choking agents. This raises questions about Iran's compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which Iran signed on January 13, 1993, and ratified on June 8, 1997. The reports say Iran may have some capability to produce biological agents, but that its ability to weaponize them is limited. Missiles. Largely with Russian help, Iran is making progress in its missile program. Two of its first three tests of the 800-mile range Shahab-3 (July 1998, July 2000, and September 2000) were either inconclusive or unsuccessful (the July 2000 test appears to have been a success), but Iran conducted an apparently successful test in late May 2002, and the CRS-2   IB93033  04-25-03  Defense Department now assesses the missile as operational. Iran might have produced 10 20 of them, according to press reports. Iran is also trying to make a 1,200 mile range Shahab-4, but U.S. officials told journalists in late October 2002 that an Iranian test of an extended-range Shahab had failed. In March 2002, an intelligence community official upgraded the missile threat from Iran, testifying that the United States would ""most likely"" face an intercontinental ballistic missile threat from Iran by 2015. On September 6, 2002, Iran said it successfully tested a 200 mile range ""Fateh 110"" missile, and Iran said in late September 2002 that it has begun production of the missile.  Iranian Foreign Policy and Involvement in Terrorism Iran's continued support for terrorism contributed to President Bush's strong criticism of Iran in his 2002 State of the Union message. The State Department report on international terrorism for 2001, released May 21, 2002, again stated, as it has for most of the past decade, that Iran ""remained the most active state sponsor of terrorism in 2001,"" although the report attributes the terrorist activity to two hardline institutions -- the Revolutionary Guard and the Intelligence Ministry. On the other hand, Iran strongly condemned the September 11 attacks and tacitly supported the U.S. war on the Taliban and Al Qaeda. (See also CRS Report RL31119, Terrorism: Near Eastern Groups and State Sponsors, 2002.)  Persian Gulf Khatemi has largely succeeded in improving relations with Iran's neighbors, particularly the six states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC; Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates). Since he came into office, Iran has reduced support for Shiite Muslim dissident movements in the Gulf states. In early October 2002, Iran and Kuwait signed a defense and intelligence cooperation agreement. See also CRS Report RL31533, Persian Gulf: Issues for U.S. Policy, 2003. Saudi Arabia/Khobar Towers. Iran and Saudi Arabia restored relations in December 1991 (after a 4 year break), and progressively higher level contacts have taken place since December 1997. In May 1999, Khatemi became the first senior Iranian leader to visit Saudi Arabia since the Islamic revolution; he visited again on September 11, 2002, to discuss possible U.S.-Iraq war. Supreme Leader Khamene'i has been invited to visit the Kingdom as well but has not yet done so. These exchanges suggest that Saudi Arabia has tried to move beyond the issue of the June 25, 1996 Khobar Towers housing complex bombing, which killed 19 U.S. airmen, and was believed orchestrated by Iranian agents. On June 21, 2001, a federal grand jury indicted 14 suspects, 13 Saudis and a Lebanese citizen, for the Khobar bombing. The indictment indicated that Iranian agents were likely involved, but no indictments of any Iranians were announced. In June 2002, Saudi Arabia reportedly sentenced some of the eleven Saudi suspects held there. (See CRS Issue Brief IB93113, Saudi Arabia: Postwar Issues and U.S. Relations.) Gulf Islands Dispute With UAE. Relations between Iran and the UAE have been strained since April 1992, when Iran asserted complete control of the Persian Gulf island of Abu Musa, which it and the UAE shared under a 1971 bilateral agreement. (In 1971, Iran, then ruled by the U.S.-backed Shah, completely seized two other islands, Greater and Lesser CRS-3   IB93033  04-25-03  Tunb, from the emirate of Ras al-Khaymah, and it seized part of Abu Musa that year from the emirate of Sharjah.) The UAE wants to refer the dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), but Iran insists on resolving the issue bilaterally. Several GCC states have attempted to mediate in recent years and Iran-UAE tensions have eased somewhat, but Iran insists that it has sovereignty over the islands. The United States, which is concerned about Iran's military improvements to the islands, generally supports UAE proposals but takes no position on sovereignty. Iraq. A legacy of the 8-year long Iran-Iraq war (September 1980 - August 1988) is deep lingering suspicion between Iran and Iraq, and Iran appears to be benefitting politically from the ouster of Saddam Hussein. Iran, which fears potential encirclement by pro-U.S. regimes, publicly opposed a major U.S. military offensive against Iraq because it was not authorized by the United Nations. However, Iran offered the United States at least tacit backing for the war, in the hope that Saddam's overthrow would put Tehran's proteges in power there. Several press reports said that U.S. and Iranian diplomats met in Europe prior to the war to discuss tacit cooperation on humanitarian and refugee issues. Tehran is now benefitting from its long-term support for Shiite militants in southern Iraq -- the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI) and the Da'wa (Islamic Call) party. In the political vacuum left by the ousting of the Baath regime of Iraq, these and similar parties have seized control over many of the towns and cities of southern Iraq. SCIRI loyalists from its armed wing called the ""Badr Corps"" were reported in late April to be moving into southern Iraq to help SCIRI become the dominant political force there and to prepare for the return to Iraq of SCIRI leader Mohammad Baqr al-Hakim. Some Badr fighters moved into northern Iraq in March 2003. The upsurge of Shiite activism after the fall of Saddam Hussein prompted an April 23, 2002, warning from the White House to Iran not to meddle in Iraq's affairs, although no specific consequences were mentioned. Iran denied that it is ""meddling"" in Iraq's affairs, saying that longtime Iraqi activists were returning to Iran to participate in the politics of post-Saddam Iraq. (For more information on Shiite and other groups contending for power in post-war Iraq, see CRS Report RL31339, Iraq: U.S. Regime Change Efforts and Post-War Governance. ) Overt the past five years Saddam Hussein had sought to improve relations with Iran to reduce Iraq's regional isolation. Since early 1998, Iran and Iraq exchanged almost all remaining prisoners from the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. An October 2000 visit to Iraq by Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi resulted in apparent agreement to abide by the waterway-sharing and other provisions of their 1975 Algiers Accords, which Iraq had abrogated prior to its September 1980 invasion of Iran. In exchange for a share of the proceeds, Iran's naval forces sometimes cooperated with Iraq's illicit export of oil through the Gulf, although U.S. officials say Iran was preventing the smuggling in recent months.  Middle East/North Africa Many of the U.S. concerns about Iran's support for terrorism center on its assistance to groups opposed to the Arab-Israeli peace process, primarily Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Hizballah, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. U.S. terrorism reports state that, following the start of the September 2000 Palestinian uprising, Iran increased its support for terrorism by encouraging coordination among Palestinian terrorist groups. Iran also incites anti-Israel violence, including hosting CRS-4   IB93033  04-25-03  conferences of anti-peace process organizations (April 24, 2001, and June 2-3, 2002). Khamene'i has continued to call Israel a ""cancerous tumor"" and make other statements suggesting that he seeks Israel's destruction. Khatemi, while publicly pledging support for the anti-peace process groups, has sometimes tried to moderate Iran's position somewhat. On October 15, 2002, the Iranian Foreign Ministry said Iran would not seek to block any final, two-state Israeli-Palestinian settlement. It was viewed as a new development when Israel and the United States asserted in early January 2002 that Iran was the source of a shipment, intercepted by Israel, of 50 tons of arms bought by the Palestinian Authority (PA). Iran has traditionally had few ties to the non-Islamist Palestinian organizations, including elements linked to the PA, that have conducted some of the day-to-day violence against Israel in the current uprising. Lebanon/Hizballah. About 150 Iranian Revolutionary Guards remain in Lebanon to coordinate Iranian arms deliveries to Hizballah, which are offloaded in Damascus and trucked into Lebanon. The shipments have included Stingers obtained by Iran in Afghanistan, mortars that can reach the Israeli city of Haifa if fired from southern Lebanon, and, in 2002, over 8,000 Katyusha rockets, according to press reports. In mid-April 2002, Foreign Minister Kharrazi visited Lebanon and urged Hizballah to exercise restraint on the Israeli-Lebanese border at a time of heightened tensions between Israel and the Palestinians. However, Hizballah is believed to take cues from harder line Iranian elements. On March 11, an Argentinian judge issued arrest warrants for four Iranian diplomats, including former Intelligence Minister Ali Fallahian, for alleged complicity in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, which killed 85. Hizballah is believed to have committed the act, as well as the 1992 bombing of Israel's embassy in that city. Sudan. Sudan's close relations with Iran in the early 1990s contributed to Sudan's placement on the U.S. ""terrorism list"" on August 18, 1993. However, Sudan's alliance with Iran frayed in the mid 1990s as Sudan sought to burnish its international image.  Central and South Asia/Azerbaijan/Former Yugoslavia Iran's policy in Central Asia has thus far emphasized economic cooperation over Islamic ideology, although Iran has become increasingly assertive in its relations with Azerbaijan. In early 1992, Iran led the drive to bring the Central Asian states and Azerbaijan into the Economic Cooperation Organization (founded in 1985 by Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey, as a successor to an organization founded by those states in 1964). Iran is hoping to attract energy pipeline routes through it, rather than through other countries. However, Iran does host at least one anti-Azerbaijan guerrilla leader (Hasan Javadov), and it allegedly harbors leaders of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), including founder Tahir Yuldashev. Tensions with Azerbaijan flared in late July 2001 over energy exploration rights in the Caspian; Iranian warships and combat aircraft threatened a British Petroleum (BP) ship on contract to Azerbaijan out of an area of the Caspian Iran considers its own. The United States called that action provocative, and it offered new border security aid and increased political support to Azerbaijan. Iran and Armenia, an adversary of Azerbaijan, agreed on expanded defense cooperation in early March 2002. Iran-Azerbaijan tensions eased somewhat in conjunction with the mid-May 2002 visit of Azerbaijan's President Heydar Aliyev to Iran, although there was little evident progress on a bilateral division of their portions of the Caspian. CRS-5   IB93033  04-25-03  Al Qaeda/Afghanistan/Pakistan. Iran long opposed the puritanical Sunni Muslim regime of the Taliban in Afghanistan on the grounds that it oppressed Shiite Muslim and other Persian-speaking minorities. Iran nearly launched a military attack against the Taliban in September 1998 after Taliban fighters captured and killed several Iranian diplomats based in northern Afghanistan, and it provided military aid to the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance coalition, made up of mostly Persian-speaking minority groups. Iran -- along with the United States, Russia, and the countries bordering Afghanistan -- attended U.N.-sponsored meetings in New York (the Six Plus Two group) to try to end the internal conflict in Afghanistan. Iran and the United States also participated in a U.N.-sponsored group in Geneva, which includes Italy and Germany. Iran tacitly supported the U.S.-led war on the Taliban and Al Qaeda, but some of Iran's subsequent activities in Afghanistan reflect official suspicion of the United States and the influence of hardliners in Iran's regime. Iran is said to fear the pro-U.S. tilt of the new government of Afghanistan and the waning of Iran's traditional sway in western, central, and northern Afghanistan where Persian-speaking Afghans predominate. There have been press reports and U.S. official statements since in January 2002 that hardliners in Iran are harboring, or at least not aggressively moving to arrest, senior Al Qaeda operatives who have fled Afghanistan (Sayf al-Adl and Abu Hafs the Mauritanian) as well as perhaps a few hundred Al Qaeda fighters that reportedly might include Osama bin Laden's son, Saad bin Laden. The United States reportedly has U.S. special operations forces in Afghanistan to areas near the Iranian border to hunt for Al Qaeda fighters. On the other hand, press reports say Iran has been arresting and extraditing Al Qaeda members to Saudi Arabia. Other reports say Iran is arming local Afghan strongmen including Herat governor Ismail Khan, Mazar-e-Sharif governor Abdul Rashid Dostam, and others, and President Bush has warned Iran not to seek to exert influence over the new government of Afghanistan. Apparently seeking to deflect the U.S. criticism, in March 2002 Iran reportedly expelled exiled Pashtun figure Gulbuddin Hikmatyar, an opponent of the new Afghan government. The expulsion followed a February 24, 2002 visit to Iran by Afghan leader Hamid Karzai; the two countries agreed to broad cooperation. (See CRS Report RL30588, Afghanistan: Current Issues and U.S. Policy Concerns.) Former Yugoslavia. On June 26, 1996, and again on May 5, 1997, President Clinton certified to Congress that Bosnia had expelled foreign forces and ended intelligence cooperation with Iran. The certifications were required by P.L. 104-122, an FY1996 supplemental appropriation, and P.L. 104-208, the FY1997 foreign aid appropriation, in order to provide U.S. aid to Bosnia.  Human Rights Concerns U.S. and U.N. human rights reports cite Iran for widespread human rights abuses, (especially of the Baha'i faith), including assassinations and executions of regime opponents (Kurds, People's Mojahedin, and others) in Iran and abroad. These reports note that Khatemi's efforts to promote rule of law have met repeated challenges from hardliners, and the U.S. State Department report for 2002, released in March 2003, said Iran's human rights situation had deteriorated further in the past year. However, in April 2002, the U.N. Human Rights Commission narrowly voted not to investigate Iran's human rights record during CRS-6   IB93033  04-25-03  2002-2003. On January 30, 2003, Iran released the 80-year-old Ayatollah Montazeri, from house arrest; Montazeri was Khomeini's designated successor until being dismissed by Khomeini in 1989, and he later emerged as a critic of the post-Khomeini leadership. In the 108th Congress, two resolutions (S.Res. 82 and H.Res. 140) were introduced on March 12, 2003, expressing concern about Iran's human rights practices, particularly its treatment of women. Religious Persecution. I n October 2001, the State Department again named Iran as a ""Country of Particular Concern,"" under the International Religious Freedom Act, and little progress in Iran's performance on this issue was noted in the October 2002 religious freedom report. No sanctions were added, on the grounds that Iran is already subject to extensive U.S. sanctions. Religious persecution continues, especially against the Baha'i community, because Iran's Shiite Muslim clergy views the sect as heretical. Two Baha'is (Dhabihullah Mahrami and Musa Talibi) were sentenced to death in 1996 for apostasy. On July 21, 1998, Iran executed Ruhollah Ruhani, the first Bahai executed since 1992 (Bahman Samandari). The United States condemned the execution. In February 2000, Iran's Supreme Court set aside the death sentences against three Bahais, Sirus Zabihi-Moqaddam, Hedayat Kashefi-Najafabadi, and Manucher Khulusi. On April 21, 1999, the Clinton Administration expressed concern about the sentencing to prison of four Baha'is. Recent resolutions condemning Iran's treatment of the Baha'is, including S.Con.Res. 57, which passed the Senate July 19, 2000, and H.Con.Res. 257, which passed the House on September 19, 2000. Trial of 13 Jews. Although the 30,000 member Jewish community (the largest in the Middle East aside from Israel) enjoys more freedoms than Jewish communities in several other Muslim states, during 1993-1998 Iran executed five Jews allegedly spying for Israel. In June 1999, Iran confirmed that it had arrested 13 Jews -- teachers, shopkeepers, and butchers -- from the Shiraz area that it said were part of an ""espionage ring"" for Israel. After an April - June 2000 trial in which eight of the suspects ""confessed"" to the allegations, ten of the Jews and two Muslims accomplices were convicted (July 1, 2000) and received sentences ranging from 4 years to 13 years. Three Jews were acquitted. On September 21, 2000, a three-judge appeals panel reduced the sentences slightly, now ranging from 2 to 9 years. On February 8, 2001, Iran's Supreme Court let the revised sentences stand. In March 2001, Iran released one of the Jews on the grounds that his sentence included time served; another was released on January 16, 2002. Three more were given early release in late October 2002. Iran said on April 24, 2003, that the remaining five had been released. Several bills in the 106th Congress called for the release of the detainees and for linking U.S. relations with Iran to the trial's outcome; the Senate passed S.Con.Res. 39 (June 23, 1999) and S.Con.Res. 109 (May 4, 2000). In April 2001, a similar bill, H.Con.Res. 29, was introduced in the 107th Congress.  U.S. Policy and Sanctions The February 11, 1979 fall of the Shah of Iran, a key U.S. ally, opened a long rift in U.S.-Iranian relations. On November 4, 1979, radical ""students"" seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held its diplomats hostage until minutes after President Reagan's inauguration on January 20, 1981. The United States broke relations with Iran on April 7, 1980, and the two countries have had no official dialogue since. The exception was the abortive 1985-86 clandestine arms supply relationship with Iran in exchange for some American hostages held CRS-7   IB93033  04-25-03  by Hizballah in Lebanon (the so-called ""Iran-Contra Affair""). Iran maintains an interests section in Washington (Embassy of Pakistan), staffed by Iranian permanent resident aliens or U.S. citizens of Iranian descent. The U.S. protecting power in Iran is Switzerland. Upon taking office in 1993, the Clinton Administration moved to further isolate Iran as part of a strategy of ""dual containment"" of Iran and Iraq. In 1995 and 1996, the Clinton Administration and Congress added sanctions on Iran in response to growing concerns about Iran's weapons of mass destruction, its support for terrorist groups, and its efforts to subvert the Arab-Israeli peace process. The election of Khatemi in May 1997 precipitated a shift in U.S. policy toward engagement; the Clinton Administration offered Iran official dialogue, with no substantive preconditions. In January 1998, Khatemi publicly agreed to increase ""people-to-people"" exchanges with the United States but ruled out official dialogue. In a June 1998 speech, then Secretary of State Albright stepped up the U.S. outreach effort by calling for mutual confidence building measures that could lead to a ""road map"" for normalization of relations. Encouraged by the reformist victory in Iran's March 2000 parliamentary elections, Secretary Albright gave another speech on March 17, 2000, acknowledging past U.S. meddling in Iran, easing sanctions on some Iranian imports, and promising to work to resolve outstanding claims disputes. Iran welcomed the steps, but called them insufficient to warrant the beginning of a dialogue. In early September 2000 meetings at the United Nations in connection with the Millennium Summit, Secretary Albright and President Clinton sent a positive signal to Iran by attending Khatemi's speeches. Until early 2002, the Bush Administration appeared to be continuing the Clinton Administration efforts, in part by building on the cooperation between the two countries in Afghanistan. The Administration's November 13, 2001 continuation of the 1979 national emergency on Iran said that U.S. ""relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal,"" a far softer statement than previous justifications sighting a continued threat from Iran. Supreme Leader Khamene'i sought to undermine any warming; on October 30, 2001, he threatened to dismiss any Iranian official who tried to forge relations with the United States. His statement came a few weeks after several Members of Congress had dinner in the Senate with Iran's U.N. representative. The thawing in relations halted in January 2002. Allegations that month of Iran's sale of arms to the Palestinian Authority and reputed meddling in Afghanistan, and late 2002 revelations of new undeclared nuclear sites at Arak and Natanz (see above) have caused the Administration and Congress to become more critical of Iran's intentions and actions. As noted above, President Bush named Iran as part of an ""axis of evil"" in his State of the Union message. On July 12, 2002, President Bush issued a statement supporting those Iranians demonstrating for reform and democracy, a message he reiterated on December 20, 2002 when he inaugurated a new U.S. broadcast to Iran, Radio Farda (Tomorrow). The statements signaled a shift in U.S. policy from attempting to engage and support Khatemi and his faction to publicly supporting Iranian reformers and activists. This view, based on the conclusion that engaging Khatemi would not produce more moderate Iranian policies on key issues, was mirrored in Congress during 2002 when several Members called for U.S. efforts to promote civil society in Iran. Two resolutions introduced in late July 2002 (S.Res. 306 and H.Res. 504) called for positive U.S. gestures toward ""the people of Iran, and not political figures whose survival depends upon preservation of the current regime."" Some interpreted the U.S. shift as a move toward a regime change policy for Iran. CRS-8   IB93033  04-25-03  The aftermath of the U.S.-led war on Iraq has led to speculation that Iran might be a future target of U.S. military action. The Bush Administration has not threatened military action against Iran, either in response to assertions it is meddling in post-war Iraq or to try to force it to end its nuclear program. However, experts say that the Administration is considering a number of options, most of which are diplomatic but some of which might include certain military actions, to address Iran's suspected nuclear weapons program.  Economic Sanctions Since the November 4, 1979 seizure of the U.S. hostages in Tehran, economic sanctions have formed a major part of U.S. policy toward Iran. On November 14, 1979, President Carter declared a national emergency with respect to Iran, renewed every year since 1979. Terrorism/Foreign Aid. Following the October 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Lebanon, believed perpetrated by Hizballah, Iran was added to the ""terrorism list"" in January 1984. The designation bans direct U.S. financial assistance and arms sales, restricts sales of U.S. dual use items, and requires the United States to oppose multilateral lending to the designated countries. Separate from its position on the terrorism list, successive foreign aid appropriations laws since the late 1980s ban direct assistance to Iran (loans, credits, insurance, Eximbank credits) and indirect assistance (U.S. contributions to international organizations that work in Iran). Section 307 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (added in 1985) names Iran as unable to benefit from U.S. contributions to international organizations, requiring proportionate cuts if these institutions work in Iran. Iran also has been designated every year since 1997 as not cooperating with U.S. anti-terrorism efforts, under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (P.L. 104-132). That Act penalizes countries that assist or sell arms to terrorism list countries, and another law (the Defense Department Authorization Act of 1987) limits Defense Department contracts with companies controlled by terrorism list states ($100,000 contract limit). U.S. regulations do not bar disaster relief and the United States donated $125,000, through relief agencies, to help victims of two earthquakes in Iran (February and May 1997), and another $350,000 worth of aid to the victims of a June 22, 2002 earthquake. Proliferation Sanctions. Several sanctions laws are unique to Iran. The Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act (P.L. 102-484) requires denial of license applications for exports to Iran of dual use items, and imposes sanctions on foreign countries that transfer to Iran ""destabilizing numbers and types of conventional weapons,"" as well as WMD technology. The Iran Nonproliferation Act (P.L. 106-178) authorizes sanctions on foreign entities that assist Iran's WMD programs. It bans U.S. extraordinary payments to the Russian Aviation and Space Agency in connection with the international space station unless the President can certify that the agency or entities under the Agency's control had not transferred any WMD or missile-related technology to Iran within the year prior. The provision contains certain exceptions to ensure the safety of astronauts who will use the space station and for certain space station hardware. During 2001 and 2002, a number of entities in North Korea, China, India, Armenia, and Moldova were sanctioned under the Iran Nonproliferation Act, the IranIraq Arms Nonproliferation Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-484), and another law, the Chemical and Biological Warfare Elimination Act of 1991, for sales to Iran. Counternarcotics. In February 1987, Iran was first designated as a state that failed to cooperate with U.S. anti-drug efforts or take adequate steps to control narcotics production CRS-9   IB93033  04-25-03  or trafficking. U.S. and U.N. Drug Control Program (UNDCP) assessments of drug production in Iran prompted the Clinton Administration, on December 7, 1998, to remove Iran from the U.S. list of major drug producing countries. The decision exempts Iran from the annual certification process that kept drug-related U.S. sanctions in place on Iran. Britain reportedly has sold Iran small arms for its anti-drug efforts on the Afghan border. Trade Ban. On May 6, 1995, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12959 banning U.S. trade and investment in Iran, including the trading of Iranian oil overseas by U.S. companies. This followed an earlier March 1995 executive order barring U.S. investment in Iran's energy sector. The trade ban was partly intended to blunt criticism that U.S. trade with Iran made U.S. appeals for multilateral containment of Iran less credible. Each March since 1995, most recently on March 13, 2003, the U.S. Administration has renewed a declaration of a state of emergency that triggered the March 1995 investment ban. An August 1997 amendment to the trade ban (Executive Order 13059) prevented U.S. companies from knowingly exporting goods to a third country for incorporation into products destined for Iran. Some goods related to the safe operation of civilian aircraft can be licensed for export to Iran, and in December 1999, the Clinton Administration allowed the repair of engine mountings on seven Iran Air 747s (Boeing). Implementing regulations do not permit U.S. firms to negotiate investment deals with Iran. Following a 1998 application by a U.S. firm to sell Iran agricultural products, and in the context of Clinton Administration and congressional reviews of U.S. unilateral sanctions policies, the Clinton Administration announced in April 1999 that it would license, on a case-by-case basis, commercial sales of food and medical products to certain countries on which unilateral U.S. trade bans are in place (Iran, Libya, and Sudan). Under regulations issued in July 1999, private letters of credit can be used to finance approved sales, but no U.S. government credit guarantees are available and U.S. exporters are not permitted to deal directly with Iranian banks. Iran says the lack of credit makes U.S. sales, particularly of wheat, uncompetitive. The FY2001 agriculture appropriations (P.L. 106-387), contained a provision banning the use of official credit guarantees for food and medical sales to Iran and other countries on the U.S. terrorism list, except Cuba, although allowing for a presidential waiver to permit such credit guarantees. Neither the Clinton Administration nor the Bush Administration has provided the credit guarantees. In the March 2000 speech mentioned above, the trade ban was eased to allow U.S. importation of Iranian nuts, dried fruits, carpets, and caviar; regulations governing the imports were issued in April 2000. The United States was the largest market for Iranian carpets before the 1979 revolution, although U.S. anti-dumping tariffs imposed on Iranian pistachio nut imports in 1986 (over 300%) dampened imports of that product. In January 2003, the tariff on roasted pistachios was lowered to 22% and on raw pistachios to 163%. Iranian caviar and carpets are now sold in the United States. The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA). The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA, H.R. 3107, P.L. 104-172, signed August 5, 1996) is a law that sanctions foreign investment in Iran or Libya's energy sector. It was to sunset on August 5, 2001, but it was renewed for another five years (H.R. 1954, P.L. 107-24, signed August 3, 2001). The renewal law requires an Administration report on its effectiveness within 24-30 months (as early as August 2003). No sanctions have been imposed under ILSA, although three companies involved in one project (South Pars) were deemed in violation in September 1998; sanctions were waived. CRS-10   IB93033  04-25-03  A number of other investments have remained ""under review"" for ILSA sanctions since 1999. In the 107th Congress, H.Res.434 called on the President to sanction Canadian oil company Sheer Energy, which, in May 2002, announced an $80 million contract to develop an Iranian oil field. In October 2002, Norway's Statoil agreed to invest $300 million to develop phases six, seven, and eight of the South Pars gas field. See CRS Report RS20871, The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA). Caspian/Central Asian Energy Routes Through Iran. The U.S. trade ban permits U.S. companies to apply for licenses to conduct ""swaps"" of Caspian Sea oil with Iran, but, as part of a U.S. policy to route Central Asian energy around Iran (and Russia), a Mobil Corporation application to do so was denied in April 1999. The Bush Administration continues to oppose, and to threaten imposing ILSA sanctions on, pipeline projects that route Caspian/Central Asian energy through Iran. U.S. policy has been to strongly favor construction of a pipeline that would cross the Caspian Sea and let out in Ceyhan, Turkey (Baku-Ceyhan pipeline), avoiding Iran or Russia. Four Caspian nations (Turkey, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan) signed an agreement embracing Baku-Ceyhan on November 18, 1999, and regional and corporate support for the project has gained momentum to the point where pipeline construction is expected to begin in earnest soon. Kazakhstan nonetheless has been pushing for construction of an oil pipeline across Iran. Despite U.S. pressure not to import Iranian gas, in December 2001 Turkey began doing so through a new cross-border pipeline, under an August 1996 agreement. (See CRS Report 98-86, Iran: Relations With Key Central Asian States.) Europe and Japan's Relations With/Lending to Iran. U.S.-allied differences on Iran narrowed in the late 1990s in concert with the Clinton Administration's attempt to engage Iran, a policy consistently favored by the European countries as a way to moderate Iran's behavior. During 1992-1997, the European Union (EU) countries maintained a policy of ""critical dialogue"" with Iran. The United States did not oppose those talks but maintained that the EU's dialogue would not change Iranian behavior. The dialogue was suspended immediately following the April 1997 German terrorism trial (""Mykonos trial"") that found high-level Iranian involvement in assassinating Iranian dissidents in Germany. Alongside the post-1997 U.S. shift toward engagement, the EU-Iran dialogue formally resumed in May 1998. Since then, Khatemi has undertaken state visits to several Western countries, including Italy (March 1999), France (October 1999), Germany (July 2000), and Japan (November 2000). The United States publicly welcomed these visits. On December 12, 2002, Iran and the EU began formal negotiations on a trade pact that would lower the tariffs or increase quotas for Iranian exports to the EU countries, with some linkage to Iran addressing EU concerns on Iran's human rights practices and terrorism sponsorship. The resolution of the ""Rushdie affair"" to Britain's satisfaction sparked improvement in its relations with Iran. Iran maintains that Ayatollah Khomeini's 1989 death sentence against author Salman Rushdie cannot be revoked (his ""Satanic Verses"" novel was labeled blasphemous) because Khomeini is no longer alive to revoke it. However, on September 24, 1998, Iran's Foreign Minister pledged to Britain that Iran will not seek to implement the sentence and opposes any bounties offered for his death. Britain then upgraded relations with Iran to the ambassadorial level, and Foreign Ministers of the two countries have exchanged several visits. In October 2000, Britain began extending longer term credit (two years or greater) for exports to Iran. Some Iranian clerics (outside the formal government structure) have said the death sentence stands, and the Iranian government has not required CRS-11   IB93033  04-25-03  the Fifteen Khordad foundation to withdraw its $2.8 million reward for Rushdie's death. Khatemi said on June 4, 2001 that he considers the issue closed. In August 1999, Japan continued a gradual improvement in relations with Iran by announcing a resumption of Japan's official development lending program for Iran to construct a hydroelectric dam over the Karun River. However, the $70 million increment announced was less that Iran had wanted, and Japan said that this tranche would close out Japan's involvement in the project. (In 1993, Japan provided the first $400 million tranche of the overall $1.4 billion official development loan program, but the lending was subsequently placed on hold as the United States sought to persuade its allies to pressure Iran.) In late January 2000, Japan agreed to resume medium- and long-term export credit insurance for exports to Iran, suspended since 1994. Economic relations improved further during Khatemi's November 2000 visit to Tokyo, which resulted in Iran's granting Japanese firms the first right to negotiate to develop the large Azadegan field, and Iran and a Japaneseled consortium are moving forward with preliminary studies of the field. Some press reports suggest that Royal Dutch/Shell might join the Azadegan project, apparently because it can provide needed technology. In exchange, Japan agreed to prepay Iran $1 billion per year for the next 3 years for Iranian oil. Partly at U.S. urging, Japan refused to extend to Iran additional official loans. During 1994-1995, and over U.S. objections at the time, Iran's European and Japanese creditors rescheduled about $16 billion in Iranian debt. These countries (governments and private creditors) rescheduled the debt bilaterally, in spite of Paris Club rules that call for multilateral rescheduling and International Monetary Fund (IMF) involvement. Iran has worked its external debt down from $32 billion in 1997 to about $20 billion as of March 2002, according to Iran's Central Bank. The improved debt picture has led most European export credit agencies, including Germany's Hermes, France's COFACE, and that of Spain, to restore insurance cover for exports to Iran. In July 2002, Iran tapped international capital markets for the first time since the Islamic revolution, selling $500 million in bonds to European banks. At the urging of the U.S. government, in May 2002 Moody's stopped its credit ratings service for Iran's government bonds on the grounds that performing the credit ratings service might violate the U.S. trade ban. Multilateral Lending to Iran. Section 1621 of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-132) amended the Foreign Assistance Act to require the United States to vote against international loans to countries on the U.S. terrorism list. Acting under provisions of successive foreign aid laws, in 1993 the United States voted its 16.5% share of the World Bank against loans to Iran of $460 million for electricity, health, and irrigation projects. To signal opposition to international lending to Iran, the FY1994 foreign aid appropriations (P.L. 103-87) cut the Administration's request for the U.S. contribution to the World Bank by the amount of those loans. That law, as well as the foreign aid appropriations for FY1995 (P.L. 103-326) and FY1996 (P.L. 104-107), would have significantly reduced U.S. payments to the Bank if it had provided new loans to Iran. By 1999, Iran's moderating image had led the World Bank to consider new loans. In May 2000, the United States was unsuccessful in obtaining further delay on a vote on new lending for Iran, and its allies outvoted the United States to approve $232 million in loans for health and sewage projects. Twenty one of the Bank's twenty four governors voted in favor, and France and Canada abstained. Earlier, Iran also had asked the International CRS-12   IB93033  04-25-03  Monetary Fund for about $400 million in loans (its quota is about $2 billion) to help it deal with its trade financing shortfalls. However, Iran balked at accepting IMF conditionality, and there was no agreement. Despite the required U.S. opposition, on May 10, 2001, the World Bank's executive directors voted to approve a two-year economic reform plan for Iran that envisions $775 million in new Bank loans. In May 2003, the Bank will consider a $112 million loan to Iran for low- and middle-income housing. WTO. The Bush Administration said in July 2001 that U.S. opposition to Iran's membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) was ""under review,"" but there have been no recent indications that the United States will drop that opposition. On several occasions since then, the WTO, at U.S. urging, has postponed discussion on whether to launch entry talks with Iran. Travel Sanctions. Use of U.S. passports for travel to Iran is permitted, but a State Department travel warning, softened somewhat in April 1998, asks that Americans ""defer"" travel to Iran. Iranians entering the United States are required to be fingerprinted. Assets Disputes/Victims of Terrorism. Iran views the issue of disputed claims and blocked assets as an obstacle to improved relations. A U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal, at the Hague, is arbitrating cases resulting from the break in relations following the Iranian revolution. The major cases yet to be decided center on hundreds of Foreign Military Sales cases between the United States and the Shah's regime, which Iran claims it paid for but were unfulfilled. About $400 million in proceeds from the resale of that equipment is in a DOD account, and about $22 million in diplomatic property remains blocked. The assets issue moved to the forefront following several U.S. court judgements against Iran for past acts of terrorism against Americans, filed under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. For information on suits against Iran that have been filed, their outcomes, and legislation regarding these suits, see CRS Report RL31258, Suits Against Terrorism States by Victims of Terrorism. Regarding the mistaken U.S. shootdown on July 3,1988 of an Iranian Airbus passenger jet, on February 22, 1996, the United States, responding to an Iranian case before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), agreed to pay Iran up to $61.8 million in compensation ($300,000 per wage earning victim, $150,000 per non wage earner) for the 248 Iranians killed in the shootdown. The funds for this settlement came from a general appropriation for judgments against the United States. The United States previously paid $3 million in death benefits for 47 non-Iranians killed in the attack, but has not compensated Iran for the airplane itself. A different case, pending before the ICJ, involves an Iranian claim for damages to Iranian oil platforms during U.S. naval clashes with Iran in October 1987 and April 1988.  Military Containment U.S. policy has focused on containing the military threat posed by Iran to the United States, U.S. allies in the Persian Gulf, and international shipping. Although containing Iraq has been the primary goal of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf region since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, U.S. military officials note that U.S. forces could potentially be used against Iran, if the President so decides. U.S. military officers note that their encounters with Iranian naval vessels in the Gulf have been more professional since Khatemi took office. It is CRS-13   IB93033  04-25-03  possible that the U.S. military posture in the Gulf might change in the aftermath of the war against Iraq, probably to lower force levels. Such a reduction might, in the view of some experts, reduce U.S. military containment against Iran.  Iran's Opposition Movements Although the Bush Administration seeks to strengthen the voices of reform, it is not declared U.S. policy to change Iran's regime, and the United States does not fund Iranian opposition movements. In 1995, the Clinton Administration accepted a House-Senate conference agreement to include $18-$20 million in funding authority for covert operations against Iran in the FY1996 intelligence authorization act (H.R. 1655, P.L. 104-93) -- about $14 million more than requested -- according to a Washington Post report of December 22, 1995. The Clinton Administration reportedly focused the covert aid on changing the regime's behavior, rather than its overthrow. The conference report on H.R. 2267 (H.Rept. 105-405), the FY1998 Commerce/State/ Justice appropriation, provided $4 million for a ""Radio Free Iran,"" to be run by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). The radio, which the Administration called the Farsi service of RFE/RL, began operations in Prague on October 31, 1998, and has become, as of December 2002, Radio Farda (Tomorrow), which broadcasts nearly around the clock. Another $4 million for the radio for FY1999 was provided by the omnibus appropriation (H.R. 4328, P.L. 105-277). Since the late 1980s, the State Department has refused contact with the anti-regime People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI) and its umbrella organization, the National Council of Resistance (NCR). It was designated as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO) in October 1997 under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, and the NCR was named as an alias of the PMOI in the October 1999 re-designations. In November 2002, a letter signed by about 150 House Members was released, asking the President to remove the PMOI from the FTO list. U.S. forces attacked PMOI military installations in Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom and subsequently agreed to a ceasefire with PMOI military elements in Iraq. The PMOI says the agreement allows their forces to retain some weaponry, a development that drew protest from Tehran, which wants the group removed from its bases in Iraq permanently. For further information on this group, see CRS Report RL31119, Terrorism: Near Eastern Groups and State Sponsors, 2002. Some Iranian exiles follow the son of the late former Shah, who lives in the United States. On January 24, 2001, the Shah's son, Reza Pahlavi, 40 years old, ended a long period of inactivity by giving a speech in Washington calling for unity in opposition to the current regime and for the institution of a constitutional monarchy and genuine democracy in Iran. He has since broadcast messages into Iran from a station in California, and press reports say a growing number of Iranians are listening to his broadcasts.  CRS-14"

Bush 20 September 2001  behind the overall global terrorist threat, state sponsors still represent a key impediment to the international campaign against terrorism. In certain areas, including Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza Strip, state sponsors remain an important driving force behind terrorism. Iran continues its firm support for Hizballah, HAMAS, and the Palestine Islamic Jihad. Iraq employs terrorism against dissident Iraqi groups opposed to Saddam Hussein's regime. Syria continued its support for Hizballah and allowed HAMAS, the Palestine Islamic Jihad, and other Palestinian rejectionist groups to maintain offices in Damascus. Cuba Since September 11, Fidel Castro has vacillated over the war on terrorism. In October, he labeled the US-led war on terrorism ""worse than the original attacks, militaristic, and fascist."" When this tactic earned ostracism rather than praise, he undertook an effort to demonstrate Cuban support for the international campaign against terrorism and signed all 12 UN counterterrorism conventions as well as the Ibero-American declaration on terrorism at the 2001 summit. Although Cuba decided not to protest the detention of suspected terrorists at the US Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, it continued to denounce the global effort against terrorism--even by asserting that the United States was intentionally targeting Afghan children and Red Cross hospitals. Cuba's signature of UN counterterrorism conventions notwithstanding, Castro continued to view terror as a legitimate revolutionary tactic. The Cuban Government continued to allow at least 20 Basque ETA members to reside in Cuba as privileged guests and provided some degree of safehaven and support to members of the Colombian FARC and ELN groups. In August, a Cuban spokesman revealed that Sinn Fein's official repre-  President Bush put state supporters of terrorism on notice in his 20 September address to the joint session of Congress: ""Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists."" The seven designated state sponsors--Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria, and Sudan--clearly heard the President's message. While some of these countries appear to be reconsidering their present course, none has yet taken all necessary actions to divest itself fully of ties to terrorism. Sudan and Libya seem closest to understanding what they must do to get out of the terrorism business, and each has taken measures pointing it in the right direction. Iran, North Korea, and Syria have, in some narrow areas, made limited moves to cooperate with the international community's campaign against terrorism. Iran and Syria, however, seek to have it both ways. On the one hand, they clamped down on certain terrorist groups, such as al-Qaida. On the other hand, they maintained their support for other terrorist groups, such as HAMAS and Hizballah, insisting they were national liberation movements. North Korea's initial positive moves halted abruptly. Until all states that support or tolerate terrorism cease their sponsorship, whether by choice or coercion, they remain a critical foundation for terrorist groups and their operations. Even though the year 2001 saw a continuation of a slow trend away from state sponsorship as the guiding force  63   State Sponsor: Implications Designating countries that repeatedly support international terrorism (i.e., placing a country on the ""terrorism list"") imposes four main sets of US Government sanctions: 1. A ban on arms-related exports and sales, 2. Controls over exports of dual use items, requiring 30-day Congressional notification for goods or services that could significantly enhance the terrorist list country's military capability or ability to support terrorism, 3. Prohibitions on economic assistance; and 4. Imposition of miscellaneous financial and other restrictions, including  Requiring the United States to oppose loans by the World Bank and other international financial institutions;  Lifting the diplomatic immunity to allow families of terrorist victims to file civil lawsuits in US courts;  Denying companies and individuals tax credits for income earned in terrorist list countries;  Denial of duty-free treatment for goods exported to the United States;  Authority engaging in terrorism lis Department to prohibit any US person from a financial transaction with t government without a Treasury license;   Prohibition of Defense Department contracts above $100,000 with companies controlled by terrorist list states.  sentative for Cuba and Latin America, Niall Connolly, who was one of three Irish Republican Army members arrested in Colombia on suspicion of providing explosives training to the FARC, had been based in Cuba for five years. In addition, the recent arrest in Brazil of the leader of a Chilean terrorist group, the Frente Patriotico Manuel Rodriguez (FPMR), has raised the strong possibility that in the mid-1990s, the Cuban Government harbored FPMR terrorists wanted for murder in Chile. The arrested terrorist told Brazilian authorities he had traveled through Cuba on his way to Brazil. Chilean investigators had traced calls from FPMR relatives in Chile to Cuba following an FPMR prison break in 1996, but the Cuban Government twice denied extradition requests, claiming that the wanted persons were not in Cuba and the phone numbers were incorrect. Numerous US fugitives continued to live on the island, including Joanne Chesimard, wanted in the United States for the murder in 1973 of a New Jersey police officer and living as a guest of the Castro regime since 1979.  Iran Iran remained the most active state sponsor of terrorism in 2001. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) continued to be involved in the planning and support of terrorist acts and supported a variety of groups that use terrorism to pursue their goals. Although some within Iran would like to end this support, hardliners who hold the reins of power continue to thwart any efforts to moderate these policies. Since the outbreak of the intifadah, support has intensified for Palestinian groups that use violence against Israel. During the past year, however, Iran appears to have reduced its involvement in other forms of terrorist activity. There is no evidence of Iranian sponsorship or foreknowledge of the September 11 attacks in the United States. President Khatami condemned the attacks and offered condolences to the American people.  64   United States and its allies at the Bonn Conference in late 2001 to help in the formation of the Afghan Interim Authority. Tehran pledged to close its borders with Afghanistan and Pakistan to prevent the infiltration of Taliban and al-Qaida escapees. There are, however, reports that Arab Afghans, including al-Qaida members, used Iran as a transit route to enter and leave from Afghanistan. Iraq Iraq was the only Arab-Muslim country that did not condemn the September 11 attacks against the United States. A commentary of the official Iraqi station on September 11 stated that America was ""...reaping the fruits of [its] crimes against humanity."" Subsequent commentary in a newspaper run by one of Saddam's sons expressed sympathy for Usama Bin Ladin following initial US retaliatory strikes in Afghanistan. In addition, the regime continued to provide training and political encouragement to numerous terrorist groups, although its main focus was on dissident Iraqi activity overseas. Iraq provided bases to several terrorist groups including the Mujahedin-e-Khalq (MEK), the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), the Palestine Liberation Front (PLF), and the Abu Nidal organization (ANO). In 2001, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) raised its profile in the West Bank and Gaza Strip by carrying out successful terrorist attacks against Israeli targets. In recognition of the PFLP's growing role, an Iraqi Vice President met with former PFLP Secretary General Habbash in Baghdad in January 2001 and expressed continued Iraqi support for the intifadah. Also, in mid-September, a senior delegation from the PFLP met with an Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister. Baghdad also continued to host other Palestinian rejectionist groups, including the Arab Liberation Front, and the 15 May Organization. Meanwhile, Czech police continued to provide protection to the Prague office of the US Governmentfunded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), which produces Radio Free Iraq programs and  The Karine-A at the port in Elat. Israel claims the ship contained 50 tons of mostly Iranian-supplied weapons for use by militants against Israelis.  During 2001, Iran sought a high-profile role in encouraging anti-Israeli activity by way of increasing its support for anti-Israeli terrorist groups. Supreme Leader Khamenei continued to refer to Israel as a ""cancerous tumor"" that must be removed. Matching this rhetoric with action, Iran continued to provide Lebanese Hizballah and the Palestinian rejectionist groups--notably HAMAS, the Palestine Islamic Jihad, and the PFLP-GC--with varying amounts of funding, safehaven, training, and weapons. It also encouraged Hizballah and the rejectionist Palestinian groups to coordinate their planning and to escalate their activities. In addition, Iran provided limited support to terrorist groups in the Gulf, Africa, Turkey, and Central Asia. This support is at a considerably lower level than that provided to the groups opposed to Israel and has been decreasing in recent years. The Iranian Government took no direct action in 2001 to implement Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa against Salman Rushdie, but the decree has not been revoked nor has the $2.8 million bounty for his death been withdrawn. Moreover, on the anniversary of the fatwa in February, some hardline Iranians stressed again that the decree is irrevocable and should be carried out. During Operation Enduring Freedom, Tehran informed the United States that, in the event US warplanes went down inside Iran, Iranian forces would assist downed air crews in accordance with international convention. Iran also worked with the  65   Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear (CBRN) Terrorism The September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon confirmed the resolution and capability of terrorists to plan, organize, and execute attacks to produce mass casualties. In the wake of these unprecedented attacks, terrorists increasingly may look to use chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) materials--many of which can cause significant casualties--to rival the events of September 11. Such materials, information about the technology required to create them, and information about how to deliver the materials continue to be available through a variety of means. Usama Bin Ladin has professed the acquisition of ""weapons of mass destruction"" (WMD) to be a ""religious duty"" and he has threatened to use such weapons. Reports that documents retrieved from al-Qaida facilities in Afghanistan contain information on CBRN materials underscore Bin Ladin's rhetoric. The threat is not limited to Bin Ladin and al-Qaida. Other information indicates interest in acquiring and using CBRN materials by a small but growing number of other terrorist groups. The use by HAMAS of poisons and pesticides to coat shrapnel in improvised explosive devices is one example. The recent arrest in Italy of a group which had in its possession a compound that could produce hydrogen cyanide (HCN) gas under certain circumstances, along with maps of the underground utility systems near the US Embassy, is also demonstrative of terrorist intentions to employ CBRN materials in their activities. CBRN terrorism events to date have generally involved crude and improvised delivery means that have been effective but only marginally so. The lethal materials employed in some events (with the exception of the anthrax used in the incidents in the United States) also have been crudely manufactured. Other events have featured materials (toxic industrial chemicals and materials, poisons and pesticides, radiological source materials embedded in legitimate measuring instruments, etc.) that have been acquired legitimately or illegitimately and used for purposes other than those for which they were intended. While terrorist events involving these materials and improvised delivery systems can be lethal and can cause significant damage and disruption, they pale in comparison to the number of casualties and damage levels that could occur should terrorists ever acquire militarized Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) and the systems to deliver them. Preventing the proliferation of WMD, relevant materials, and related technologies, while long a pillar of national security, has become an even more urgent global priority since September 11. President George Bush made clear in his 29 January 2002 State of the Union address that the United States has as one of two great objectives to ""...prevent the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the world."" Nations around the world have joined the United States in calling for greater efforts to prevent terrorist acquisition of WMD, relevant materials, and related technologies. The United States is working within appropriate multilateral nonproliferation and other international forums and is encouraging countries worldwide to adopt more stringent nonproliferation policies and programs to help ensure that terrorists or the states who sponsor and support them cannot acquire WMD, materials, or related technologies. Active involvement by the nonproliferation communities in the United States and other nations is a welcome addition to the capabilities of the international Coalition engaged in the war on terrorism. Such cooperative activities should help buttress existing international counterterrorism strategies and programs for combating CBRN terrorism in the areas of diplomacy, intelligence sharing, cooperative law enforcement arrangements, technology exchange, security and force protection, and training that have been traditionally undertaken.  66   employs expatriate journalists. The police presence was augmented in 1999 and 2000, following reports that the Iraqi Intelligence Service might retaliate against RFE/RL for broadcasts critical of the Iraqi regime. As concerns over the facility's security mounted through 2000, the Czechs expelled an Iraqi intelligence officer in April 2001. The Iraqi regime has not met a request from Riyadh for the extradition of two Saudis who had hijacked a Saudi Arabian Airlines flight to Baghdad in 2000. Disregarding its obligations under international law, the regime granted political asylum to the hijackers and gave them ample opportunity to voice their criticisms of alleged abuses by the Saudi Government in the Iraqi Government-controlled and international media. Libya Following the September 11 terrorist attacks, Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi issued a statement condemning the attacks as horrific and gruesome and urging Libyans to donate blood for the US victims. On 16 September he declared that the United States had justification to retaliate for the attacks. Since September 11, Qadhafi has repeatedly denounced terrorism. Libya appears to have curtailed its support for international terrorism, although it may maintain residual contacts with a few groups. Tripoli has, in recent years, sought to recast itself as a peacemaker, offering to mediate a number of conflicts such as the military standoff between India and Pakistan that began in December 2001. In October, Libya ransomed a hostage held by the Abu Sayyaf Group, although it claimed that the money was not a ransom and would be used for ""humanitarian assistance."" Libya's past record of terrorist activity continued to hinder Qadhafi's efforts to shed Libya's pariah status. In January, a Scottish court found Libyan intelligence agent Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi guilty of murder, concluding that in 1988 he planted an explosive device on Pan Am Flight 103 whose detonation resulted in the murder of all 259 passengers and crew on board as well as 11 persons on the ground in Lockerbie, Scotland. The judges found that Megrahi had acted ""in furtherance of the  A woman puts up news posters in Lockerbie on 31 January 2001. The court found Abdel Basset al-Megrahi guilty of murder, concluding he caused an explosive device to detonate on board the airliner in 1988, resulting in the deaths of 259 persons on board as well as 11 residents of Lockerbie, Scotland.  purposes of...Libyan Intelligence Services."" His codefendant, Libyan Arab Airlines employee Al-Amin Khalifa Fhima, was acquitted on the grounds that the prosecution failed to prove his role in the bombing ""beyond a reasonable doubt."" At year's end, Libya had yet to comply fully with the remaining UN Security Council requirements related to Pan Am 103, including accepting responsibility for the actions of its officials, fully disclosing all that it knows about the bombing, and paying appropriate compensation to the victims' families. Libya's hesitation to do so may have reflected a hope that Meghahi's appeal would overturn his conviction. (On 14 March 2002, a Scottish appellate court upheld Megrahi's conviction.) In November, a German court convicted four defendants in the bombing in 1986 of La Belle Discotheque in West Berlin. In rendering his decision, the judge stated that Libyan Government officials had clearly orchestrated the attack. In response to the court's findings, the German Government called on Libya to accept responsibility for the attack and provide compensation to the victims. Two US servicemen and one Turkish civilian died in the bombing, and more than 200 persons were wounded.  67   North Korea The Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK) response to international efforts to combat terrorism has been disappointing. In a statement released after the September 11 attacks, the DPRK reiterated its public policy of opposing terrorism and any support for terrorism. It also signed the UN Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, acceded to the Convention Against the Taking of Hostages, and indicated its willingness to sign five others. Despite the urging of the international community, however, North Korea did not take substantial steps to cooperate in efforts to combat terrorism, including responding to requests for information on how it is implementing the UN Security Council resolutions, and it did not respond to US proposals for discussions on terrorism. It did not report any efforts to search for and block financial assets as required by UN Security Council Resolution 1373. Similarly, the DPRK did not respond positively to the Republic of Korea's call to resume dialogue, where counterterrorism is an agenda item, nor to the United States in its call to undertake dialogue on improved implementation of the agreed framework. In light of President Bush's call to recognize the dangerous nexus between Weapons of Mass Destruction and terrorism, this latter failure, with its implications for nuclear development and proliferation, was especially troublesome. In addition, Pyongyang's provision of safehaven to four remaining Japanese Communist League-Red Army Faction members who participated in the hijacking of a Japanese Airlines flight to North Korea in 1970 remained problematic in terms of support for terrorists. Moreover, some evidence suggested the DPRK may have sold limited quantities of small arms to terrorist groups during the year. Sudan The counterterrorism dialogue begun in mid-2000 between the US and Sudan continued and intensified during 2001. Sudan condemned the September 11 attacks and pledged its commitment to combating terrorism and fully cooperating with the United States in the campaign against terrorism. The Sudanese Government has stepped up its counterterrorism cooperation with various US agencies, and Sudanese  authorities have investigated and apprehended extremists suspected of involvement in terrorist activities. In late September, the United Nations recognized Sudan's positive steps against terrorism by removing UN sanctions. Sudan, however, remained a designated state sponsor of terrorism. A number of international terrorist groups including al-Qaida, the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, Egyptian al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, the Palestine Islamic Jihad, and HAMAS continued to use Sudan as a safehaven, primarily for conducting logistics and other support activities. Press speculation about the extent of Sudan's cooperation with the United States probably has led some terrorist elements to depart the country. Unilateral US sanctions remained in force. Syria Syria's president, Bashar al-Asad, as well as senior Syrian officials, publicly condemned the September 11 attacks. The Syrian Government also cooperated with the United States and with other foreign governments in investigating al-Qaida and some other terrorist groups and individuals. The Government of Syria has not been implicated directly in an act of terrorism since 1986, but it continued in 2001 to provide safehaven and logistics support to a number of terrorist groups. Ahmad Jibril's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine--General Command (PFLP-GC), the Palestine Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Abu Musa's Fatah-the-Intifadah, George Habash's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and HAMAS continued to maintain offices in Damascus. Syria provided Hizballah, HAMAS, PFLP-GC, the PIJ, and other terrorist organizations refuge and basing privileges in Lebanon's Beka'a Valley, under Syrian control. Damascus, however, generally upheld its September 2000 antiterrorism agreement with Ankara, honoring its 1998 pledge not to support the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Damascus served as the primary transit point for the transfer of Iranian-supplied weapons to Hizballah. Syria continued to adhere to its longstanding policy of preventing any attacks against Israel or Western targets from Syrian territory or attacks against Western interests in Syria.  68"

During high-level discussions with a wide array of senior government officials and private sector political, financial and economic experts, Secretary O'Neill will focus on how to accelerate private sector investment, growth, and job creation to raise living standards in this region. He will examine, first-hand, bilateral and multilateral assistance efforts, and will emphasize the importance of measuring results to ensure that we direct assistance where it is most effective. He will pay particular emphasis on efforts to provide financing to new small and medium-sized businesses. He will highlight the role of regional integration and trade in spurring growth, both within the region as well as with large markets to the East and West.   Following on the heels of his trip to Africa, Secretary ONeill will continue to share his views on and learn more about development and Millennium Challenge Account issues - leadership and governance, market reforms, and health and education - and how they apply to governments, businesses, and people in these four nations.   Further, Secretary O'Neill will continue to build and deepen our relations with our allies in this region in the economic front on the war against terrorism. Economic development and strong democratic institutions are strong safeguards to prevent extremism from taking root.   This is Secretary O'Neill's first visit to the region.   Undersecretary for International Affairs John Taylor will accompany Secretary O'Neill.

GX236-27-5713629	"Order Code RL31119  CRS Report for Congress Received through the CRS Web  Terrorism: Near Eastern Groups and State Sponsors, 2001  September 10, 2001  Kenneth Katzman Specialist in Middle Eastern Affairs Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division  Congressional Research Service ~ The Library of Congress   Terrorism: Near Eastern Groups and State Sponsors, 2001 Summary Signs continue to point to a decline in state sponsorship of terrorism, as well as a rise in the scope of threat posed by the independent network of exiled Saudi dissident Usama bin Ladin. During the 1980s and the early 1990s, Iran and terrorist groups it sponsors were responsible for the most politically significant acts of Middle Eastern terrorism. Although Iran continues to actively sponsor terrorist groups, since 1997 some major factions within Iran have sought to change Iran's image to that of a more constructive force in the region. Pressured by international sanctions and isolation, Sudan and Libya appear to have sharply reduced their support for international terrorist groups, and Sudan has told the United States it wants to work to achieve removal from the ""terrorism list."" Usama bin Ladin's network, which is independently financed and enjoys safe haven in Afghanistan, poses an increasingly significant threat to U.S. interests in the Near East and perhaps elsewhere. The primary goals of bin Ladin and his cohort are to oust pro-U.S. regimes in the Middle East and gain removal of U.S. troops from the region. Based on U.S. allegations of past plotting by the bin Ladin network, suggest that the network wants to strike within the United States itself. The Arab-Israeli peace process is a longstanding major U.S. foreign policy interest, and the Administration and Congress are concerned about any terrorist groups or state sponsors that oppose the Arab-Israeli peace process. Possibly because of a breakdown in the Palestinian-Israeli peace process in September 2000, Palestinian Islamic organizations such as Hamas have stepped up operations against Israelis, after a few years of diminished terrorist activity. Some observers blame Palestinian Authority President Yasir Arafat, accusing his regime of ending efforts to constrain these and other groups. Others assert that Israel's actions against the Palestinians have been provocative and have contributed to increased Palestinian support for violence against Israel. There is no consensus on the strategies for countering terrorism in the Near East. The United States, in many cases, differs with its allies on how to deal with state sponsors of terrorism; most allied governments believe that engaging these countries diplomatically might sometimes be more effective than trying to isolate or punish them. The United States is more inclined than its European allies to employ sanctions, military action, and legal pressure to compel state sponsors and groups to abandon terrorism. In a few cases since 1998, the United States has pursued an engagement strategy by easing sanctions or conducting dialogue with those state sponsors willing to distance themselves from international terrorism. The United States also believes that greater counterterrorism cooperation with allies and other countries, including Russia, is yielding benefits in reducing the threat from terrorism.   Contents Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 Radical Islamic Groups . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

It is offered as essential background for policymakers. This report is an annual analysis of Near Eastern terrorist groups and countries on the U.S. ""terrorism list,"" a list of countries that the Secretary of Commerce and Secretary of State have determined provide repeated support for international terrorism.2 Five out of the seven states currently on the terrorism list are located in the Near East region -- Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Sudan. (The other two are Cuba and North Korea, which will not be covered in this report). The composition of the list has not changed since Sudan was added in 1993. The groups analyzed in this report include, but are not limited to, those designated as ""Foreign Terrorist Organizations"" (FTO's), pursuant to the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-132). The last section of the report discusses significant themes in U.S. unilateral and multilateral efforts to combat terrorism in or from the region. The State Department's annual report on international terrorism, entitled Patterns of Global Terrorism: 20003 is a significant source for this report; other sources include press reports and conversations with U.S. counter-terrorism officials, experts, investigative journalists, and foreign diplomats. Near Eastern terrorist groups and their state sponsors have been the focus of U.S. counter-terrorism policies for several decades. Since the 1970s, many of the most high-profile acts of terrorism against American citizens and targets have been conducted by these groups, sometimes with the encouragement or at the instigation of their state sponsors. Few recent terrorist attacks  either in or outside the Near East region  compare in scale to the August 7, 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 224 persons, including 12 Americans. The October 12, 2000 bombing of the U.S. destroyer Cole in the harbor of Aden, Yemen, killed 17 U.S. Navy personnel, nearly sank the ship, and caused at least a temporary halt in growing U.S. military relations with Yemen. According to Patterns of Global Terrorism: 2000 (available on the U.S. Department of State's web site at [http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/pgtrpt/2000/]; hereafter cited as Patterns 2000),  1 2  This report was prepared with the assistance of Patricia Niehoff.  The determinations are made in accordance with Section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 50 U.S.C. 2405(j). 3  State Department Publication 10822, released April 2001.   CRS-2 worldwide terrorism-related casualties increased to 405 in 2000 from 233 in 1999, but the number of attacks increased only slightly, from 392 in 1999 to 423 in 2000. Of these 2000 totals, only 16 of the 423 attacks and 19 of the 405 casualties occurred in the Middle East, although Patterns covered only three months of the Palestinian uprising that began in late September 2000. Since 2001 began, there have been dozens of terrorism-related Israeli casualties resulting from Palestinian suicide bomb attacks. Thirty-one of attacks and 12 of the deaths during 2000 occurred in Eurasia (Central Asia, the Caucasus, and Russia). The terrorist groups analyzed often differ in their motivations, objectives, ideologies, and levels of activity. The Islamist groups remain generally the most active, stating as their main objective the overthrow of secular, pro-Western governments, the derailment of the Arab-Israeli peace process, the expulsion of U.S. forces from the region, or the end of what they consider unjust occupation of Muslim lands. Some groups, such as the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), fight for cultural and political rights or the formation of separate ethnically-based states. Table 1 below shows the 19 Near Eastern groups currently designated by the State Department as FTO's. The designations were mostly made when the FTO list was inaugurated in October 1997 and revised in October 1999. A revised list is due out in October 2001. A group can be added to the list at any time; Al-Qaida (the bin Ladin network) was added on August 21, 1998 and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan was designated on September 25, 2000. Under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, the designation of a group as an FTO blocks its assets in the United States and makes it a criminal offense for U.S. persons to provide it with material support or resources, such as financial contributions. Executive order 12947 of January 23, 1995, also bars U.S. dealings (contributions to or financial transactions) with any individuals named as ""Specially Designated Terrorists (SDTs)."" An SDT, according to the Executive order, is a person found to pose a significant risk of disrupting the Middle East peace process, or to have materially supported acts of violence toward that end. In contrast to Patterns 2000, this report analyzes the following: ! The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which has not been the subject of a separate section in Patterns since Patterns 1995, is analyzed in this report because of the debate over whether or not PLO leader Yasir Arafat is taking sufficient steps to prevent terrorism by other groups in areas under the control of the Palestinian Authority. Since late 2000, there has been discussion about the degree to which certain PLO factions are involved in violence against Israel and whether or not they should be named as FTO's. ! When the FTO list was reviewed and re-issued in October 1999, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) was dropped, largely because it has reconciled with Arafat. The group's past involvement in terrorism, and the recent revival of its operations against Israel, are discussed in this report. ! T his report, in contrast to last year's, contains a section on the Abu Sayyaf Group operating in the Philippines, as well as analysis of several Pakistani   CRS-3 Islamist groups that are fighting Indian cont rol of part of Kashmir Province. These groups are discussed in this report, even though they operate outside the Near East region, because of their alleged connections to the bin Ladin network and the Taliban of Afghanistan.

Having accomplished its main goal of ousting Israel from southern Lebanon, some in the organization want it to change from a guerrilla and terrorist organization into a mainstream political movement, focusing mainly on its work in parliament (it holds 8 out of 128 total seats) and its charity and reconstruction works with Lebanon's Shiite community. Hardliners in Hizballah want it to battle Israeli forces over the border and in the disputed Shib'a farms area.5 Other hardliners in the organization believe that the Israeli withdrawal validated its guerrilla strategy and are helping Palestinian groups apply similar tactics against Israeli forces in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Although initially encouraged by Hizballah's relative restraint following the Israeli withdrawal, Israel and the United States remain wary of Hizballah. Hizballah's 15 year military campaign against Israeli and Israeli surrogate forces in southern Lebanon  activity that is not technically considered terrorism by the U.S. State Department  often included rocket attacks on Israeli civilians. Even though the United Nations has certified that Israel's withdrawal is complete, Hizballah has asserted that Israel still occupies some Lebanese territory (the Shib'a farms) and, on that basis, has conducted a few military attacks on Israel since the withdrawal. In October 2000, Hizballah captured three Israeli soldiers in the Shib'a farms area and kidnapped an Israeli noncombatant whom it had lured to Lebanon. Hizballah has indicated a willingness to return these captives in exchange for several Lebanese prisoners captured or kidnaped by Israel since the late 1980s. Founded in 1982 by Lebanese Shiite clerics inspired by the Islamic revolutionary ideology of Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini, Hizballah's original goal was to establish an Islamic republic in Lebanon. During the 1980s, Hizballah was a principal sponsor of anti-Western, and particularly anti-U.S., terrorism. It is known or suspected to have been involved in suicide truck bombings of the U.S. Embassy (April 1983), the U.S. Marine barracks (October 1983, killing 220 Marine, 18 Navy and 3 Army personnel), and the U.S. Embassy annex (September 1984), all in Beirut. It also hijacked TWA Flight 847 in 1985, killing a Navy diver, Robert Stethem, who was on board, and its  For other names under which Hizballah or the other groups discussed in this paper operate, see U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control.

August 7, 2001, by Alfred Prados. 5  4   CRS-5 factions were responsible for the detention of most, if not all, U.S. and Western hostages held in Lebanon during the 1980s and early 1990s. Eighteen Americans were held hostage in Lebanon during that period, three of whom were killed. In the early 1990s, Hizballah also demonstrated an ability to conduct terrorism far from the Middle East. In May 1999, Argentina's Supreme Court, after an official investigation, formally blamed Hizballah for the March 17, 1992 bombing of Israel's embassy in Buenos Aires and issued an arrest warrant for Hizballah terrorist leader Imad Mughniyah. Hizballah did not claim responsibility for the attack outright, but it released a surveillance tape of the embassy, implying responsibility. In May 1998, FBI Director Louis Freeh told Argentina the FBI believes that Hizballah, working with Iranian diplomats, was also responsible for the July 18, 1994 bombing of the Argentine-Jewish Mutual Association (AMIA) building in Buenos Aires that left 86 dead.6 In July 1999, Argentine investigators brought charges against 20 suspected Argentine collaborators in the AMIA bombings, and the trial is set to begin in September 2001. Hizballah has continued to conduct surveillance of the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon and its personnel, according to recent Patterns reports, but no major terrorist attacks have been attributed to it since 1994. However, according to numerous press reports and Hizballah leaders' own statements, the organization is helping Palestinian groups fight against Israel in the latest Palestinian uprising, which began in September 2000. In late August 2001, Jordanian officials discovered a cache of rockets at a Hizballahowned location in Jordan, igniting fears that Hizballah might fire rockets on Israel from there or might provide the weapons to Palestinian militants there or in the West Bank.7 Hizballah's Persian Gulf Connections. Hizballah maintains connections with similar groups in the Persian Gulf. Saudi and Bahraini investigations of antiregime unrest have revealed the existence of local chapters of Hizballah composed of Shiite Muslims, many of whom have studied in Iran's theological seminaries and received terrorist training there and in Lebanon. Saudi and U.S. officials believe that Saudi Shiite Muslims with connections to Lebanese Hizballah were responsible for the June 25, 1996 bombing of the Khobar Towers housing complex for U.S. military personnel, near Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. This allegation was reaffirmed in the June 2001 U.S. indictments of 14 Khobar suspects. According to Patterns 1998, in November 1998 Bahraini authorities uncovered an alleged bomb plot that they blamed on persons linked to Bahraini and Lebanese Hizballah. Patterns 1999 reiterates that Hizballah receives ""substantial"" amounts of financial assistance, weapons, and political and organizational support from both Syria and Iran, although it does not mention specific figures. Then Secretary of State Christopher said on May 21, 1996 that Iran gave Hizballah about $100 million per year, a figure that U.S. officials have not since deviated from. About 150 of Iran's Revolutionary Guards remain in Lebanon to coordinate Iran's aid to Hizballah. Syria permits Iran to supply weapons to Hizballah through the international airport in 6 7  FBI Ties Iran to Argentine Bombing in `94. Washington Post, August 8, 1998. Slavin, Barbara.

Specially Designated Terrorists (SDTs).8 Hizballah members named as SDTs include: (1) Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah, who is about 43 and has led Hizballah since 1993; (2) Imad Mughniyah, the 39 year old Hizballah intelligence officer and alleged holder of some Western hostages in the 1980s; (3) Shaykh Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah, the 64-year-old senior Shiite cleric and leading spiritual figure of Hizballah; and (4) Subhi Tufayli, the 54 year old former Hizballah Secretary General who leads a radical breakaway faction of Hizballah. Blocked Assets. According to the Treasury Department's ""Terrorist Assets Report"" for 2000, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has seized $283,000 in assets belonging to 18 persons arrested in North Carolina in July 2000 on suspicion of smuggling goods to generate funds for Hizballah.  Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) Prior to the September 2000 outbreak of the Palestinian uprising, it appeared that the bulk of the leadership of the Sunni Muslim Palestinian group Hamas (Islamic Resistance Movement) was accommodating Yasir Arafat's leadership of the Palestinian Authority (PA). Hamas leaders also appeared resigned to an eventual final peace agreement between Israel and the PA, although they continued to criticize Arafat as too eager to compromise with Israel. Since the uprising began, Hamas and its smaller ally, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), have escalated terrorist attacks against Israelis. Hamas claimed responsibility for the June 1, 2001 suicide bombing of the ""Dolphinarium"" discotheque in Tel Aviv, which killed 21, and for an August 9, 2001 suicide bombing at a pizza restaurant in Jerusalem that killed 18, including one American. PIJ has conducted several recent suicide bombings, many of which killed only the bomber(s). Many experts believe that the renewed terrorist activity is at least partly attributable to a breakdown in security cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority  cooperation that was widely credited with keeping terrorist attacks to a minimum in the preceding few years. The renewed terrorist threat has led Israel to adopt a policy  criticized by the United States and many other countries  of assassinating Hamas and PIJ activists to preempt their suspected attacks. Hamas was formed by Muslim Brotherhood activists during the early stages of the earlier Palestinian uprising (intifada) in 1987. Its spiritual leader, Shaykh Ahmad Yassin, who is paralyzed, was released from prison by Israel in October 1997. He seems to serve as a bridge between Hamas' two main components -- the extremists who orchestrate terrorist attacks (primarily through a clandestine wing, the Izz adDin al-Qassam Brigades), and the more moderate elements affiliated with Hamas' social services, charity, and educational institutions. PIJ was, in part, inspired by the Iranian revolution of 1979 even though PIJ is a Sunni Muslim, not a Shiite Muslim organization. PIJ remains almost purely a guerrilla organization, with no overt component. It is led by Ramadan Abdullah Shallah, a Gaza-born, 43 year old  The list of SDTs is contained in the Office of Foreign Assets Control factsheet ""Terrorism: What You Need to Know About U.S. Sanctions.""  8   CRS-7 academic who previously was an adjunct professor at the University of South Florida. He was chosen leader in 1995 after his predecessor, Fathi al-Shiqaqi was assassinated, allegedly by Israeli agents. Recent Patterns reports characterizes Hamas' strength as ""an unknown number of hardcore members [and] tens of thousands of supporters and sympathizers,"" and PIJ's strength as ""unknown."" Hamas receives funding from Iran, from wealthy private benefactors in the Persian Gulf monarchies, and Palestinian expatriates, according to Patterns 2000, which adds that the group conducts fundraising and propaganda activities in Western Europe and North America. Many individual donors appear to believe their contributions go to charitable activities for poor Palestinians served by Hamas' social services network, and are not being used for terrorism. PIJ is politically closer to Iran than is Hamas, and apparently derives most of its funding from state sponsors, especially Iran. PIJ receives some logistical support from Syria, according to Patterns 2000. Hamas and PIJ have not targeted the United States or Americans directly, although Americans have died in attacks by these groups, along with Israelis and often the bombers themselves. Five out of the 65 killed in a series of four Hamas/PIJ bombings in Israel during February - March 1996 were American citizens. These bombings had the apparent effect of shifting public opinion toward Benjamin Netanyahu in Israeli national elections on May 29, 1996, possibly proving decisive in his election victory as Prime Minister over then Labor Party leader Shimon Peres. Neither group conducted major attacks in the run-up to the May 1999 Israeli elections, although they did carry out attacks in an attempt to derail the negotiation and implementation of the October 23, 1998 Israeli-Palestinian Wye River Memorandum. In total, the two groups have conducted about 80 suicide bombings or attempted suicide bombings, killing more than 450 Israelis, since the signing of the Israeli-PLO Declaration of Principles in 1993.9 Blocked Assets. The United States has blocked the assets of some alleged Hamas/PIJ leaders, using the authority of President Clinton's January 23, 1995 Executive order on Middle East terrorism. As of the end of 2000, a total of about $17,000 in PIJ assets in the United States were blocked, consisting of a bank account belonging to PIJ leader Shallah.10 SDTs. Several Hamas and PIJ activists have been named as SDTs. They include: (1) Hamas founder Shaykh Ahmad Yassin; (2) PIJ leader Ramadan Abdullah Shallah; (3) PIJ ideologist Abd al-Aziz Awda; (4) Hamas political leader Musa Abu Marzuq, who was barred from returning to Jordan when that country shut Hamas's offices in Amman in August 1999; and (5) alleged U.S. fundraiser for Hamas, Mohammad Salah.

Office of Foreign Assets Control, U.S. Department of Treasury. January 2001.  10   CRS-8  The Islamic Group and Al-Jihad Egyptian security authorities continue to gain the upper hand in their battle against the opposition Islamic Group and its ally, Al-Jihad,11 groups that, over the past several decades, periodically have gone underground and then resurfaced. There have been no large scale terrorist attacks by these groups since the Islamic Group's November 17, 1997 attack on tourists near Luxor, and no attacks inside Egypt at all since August 1998. The gunmen in the Luxor attack killed 58 tourists and wounded 26 others, and then committed suicide or were killed by Egyptian security forces. Sensing that they are on the defensive and that terrorism has made them unpopular, in late 1997 leaders of both groups, including their common spiritual leader, the 63 year old blind cleric Shaykh Umar Abd al-Rahman, declared a ceasefire with the Egyptian government. Muhammad Hamza, who is in operational control of the Islamic Group in Egypt while Abd al-Rahman remains incarcerated in the United States, has abided by the truce. Despite the decline of the groups' activities within Egypt, factions of the groups that are in exile have gravitated to the network of Usama bin Ladin. Several SDTs from the Islamic Group and Al-Jihad now serve in bin Ladin's inner circle as his top lieutenants, including Ayman al-Zawahiri, Rifai Taha Musa, and Abu Hafs Masri (Mohammad Atef). These leaders forswear any truce with the Egyptian government and also seek, in concert with bin Ladin, to attack U.S. interests directly. Abd al-Rahman was not convicted specifically for the February 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York, but he was convicted for related unsuccessful plots in the New York area, and those convicted in the Trade Center bombing were allegedly associated with him. There has been much speculation about the relationship, if any, between Abd al-Rahman and bin Ladin. Both recruited fighters for the Afghan conflict against the Soviet Union through centers in the United States and elsewhere, but it is not clear that the two men had any direct contact with each other in Afghanistan. The two also had close connections to the Islamic government of Sudan, although Abd al-Rahman left Sudan in 1990, before bin Ladin relocated there. Abd al-Rahman's two sons reportedly have been in or around Afghanistan since the war ended in 1989. Before the February 1993 World Trade Center bombing, some of Abd al-Rahman's aides reportedly had personal contact with bin Ladin associates in the United States.12 Although their recruiting presence has raised questions as to whether or not the United States gave bin Ladin or Abd alRahman assistance during the Afghan war, the Central Intelligence Agency has told CRS that it found no evidence that the Agency provided any direct assistance to either of them. The U.S. assistance program for the anti-Soviet groups in Afghanistan focused primarily on indigenous Afghan mujahedin and not Arab volunteers such as those sponsored by bin Ladin or Abd al-Rahman. The Islamic Group and Al-Jihad formed in the early 1970s as offshoots of the Muslim Brotherhood, which opted to work within the political system after being 11 12  A faction of the Jihad operates under the name ""Vanguards of Conquest.""

Both seek to replace Egypt's proWestern, secular government with an Islamic state. Al-Jihad was responsible for the assassination of President Anwar Sadat in October 1981. The Islamic Group has been responsible for several attacks on high-ranking Egyptian officials, including the killing of the People's Assembly Speaker in October 1990 and the wounding of the Minister of Information in April 1993. The Islamic Group also has a nonviolent arm which recruits and builds support openly in poor neighborhoods in Cairo, Alexandria and throughout southern Egypt, and runs social service programs. Al-Jihad has operated only clandestinely, focusing almost exclusively on assassinations. SDTs. The following Egyptian Islamist figures have been named as SDTs: (1) Shaykh Umar Abd al-Rahman, who was acquitted in 1984 of inciting Egyptian President Anwar Sadat's assassination, is in a medical detention facility in Missouri following his October 1995 conviction for planning terrorist conspiracies in the New York area; (2) Ayman al-Zawahiri, about 50, who is a top lieutenant of bin Ladin (see below) and was convicted in Egypt for the Sadat assassination;13 (3) Rifa'i Taha Musa, about 47, another top aide to bin Ladin; (4) Abbud al-Zumar, leader of the remnants of the original Jihad who is serving a 40 year sentence in Egypt; (5) Talat Qasim, about 44, a propaganda leader of the Islamic Group; and (6) Muhammad Shawqi Islambouli, about 46, the brother of the lead gunman in the Sadat assassination. Islambouli, a military leader of the Islamic Group, also is believed to be associated with bin Ladin in Afghanistan.  Al-Qaida (Usama bin Ladin Network) Over the past six years, Al-Qaida (Arabic for ""the base""), the network of Usama bin Ladin, has evolved from a regional threat to U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf to a global threat to U.S. citizens and national security interests. In building this network, bin Ladin has assembled a coalition of disparate radical Islamic groups of varying nationalities to work toward common goals  the expulsion of non-Muslim control or influence from Muslim-inhabited lands. The network's ideology, laid out in several pronouncements signed by bin Ladin and his allies, has led bin Ladin to support Islamic fighters or terrorists against Serb forces in Bosnia; against Soviet forces in Afghanistan and now Russian forces in Chechnya; against Indian control over part of Kashmir; against secular or pro-Western governments in Egypt, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, and Uzbekistan; and against U.S. troops and citizens in the Persian Gulf, Somalia, Yemen, Jordan, and against the U.S. mainland itself. The backbone of the Saudi dissident's network is the ideological and personal bond among the Arab volunteers who were recruited by bin Ladin for the fight against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan (1979-1989). Financially, it draws on the personal fortune of bin Ladin, estimated at about $300 million, but also reportedly including funding from many other sources. Al-Qaida now encompasses members and factions of several major Islamic militant organizations, including Egypt's Islamic Group and Al-Jihad, Algeria's Armed Islamic Group, Pakistan's Harakat ulMujahidin, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, and opposition groups in Saudi Arabia. The network reportedly also has links to the Abu Sayyaf Islamic separatist Egypt's Most Wanted. The Estimate, December 19, 1997. P.8.  13   CRS-10 group in the Philippines. Although there are few evident links to Hamas, bin Ladin was a follower of Dr. Abdullah al-Azzam, a Palestinian of Jordanian origin who was influential in the founding of both Hamas and al-Qaida. Reflecting its low level of early activity, al-Qaida was not discussed in U.S. government reports until Patterns 1993. That report, which did not mention a formal group name, said that several thousand non-Afghan Muslims fought in the war against the Soviets and the Afghan Communist government during 1979 to 1992.14 Although the Taliban movement of Afghanistan, which controls about 90% of that country, gives bin Ladin and his subordinates safehaven, bin Ladin does not appear to be acting on behalf of the Taliban, or vice versa. Bin Ladin's network has been connected to a number of acts of terrorism. Bin Ladin himself has been indicted by a U.S. court for involvement in several of them. They include the following: ! Bin Ladin has claimed responsibility for the December 1992 attempted bombings against 100 U.S. servicemen in Yemen -- there to support U.N. relief operations in Somalia (Operation Restore Hope). No one was killed. ! In press interviews, bin Ladin has openly boasted that he provided weapons to anti-U.S. militias in Somalia during Operation Restore Hope and that his loyalists fought against U.S. forces there. His involvement with the Somali militias appears to have strengthened his view that terrorism and lowtechnology combat can succeed in causing the United States to withdraw from military involvement abroad. ! The four Saudi nationals who confessed to the November 13, 1995 bombing of a U.S. military training facility in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, admitted on Saudi television to being inspired by bin Ladin and other Islamic radicals. Three of the confessors were veterans of conflicts in Afghanistan, Bosnia, and Chechnya. ! According to Patterns 1997, members of bin Ladin's organization might have aided the Islamic Group assassination attempt against Egyptian President Mubarak in Ethiopia in June 1995. ! There is no direct evidence that bin Ladin was involved in the February 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. However, Patterns 1999 says that bin Ladin's network was responsible for plots in Asia believed orchestrated by Ramzi Ahmad Yusuf, who was captured in Pakistan, brought to the United States, and convicted in November 1997 of masterminding the Trade Center bombing. The plots in Asia, all of which failed, were: to assassinate the Pope during his late 1994 visit to the Philippines and President Clinton during his visit there in early 1995; to bomb the U.S. and Israeli embassies in Manila in late 1994; and to bomb U.S. trans-Pacific flights.  14  Patterns of Global Terrorism: 1993. Released April 1994. p.4.   CRS-11 ! The August 7, 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 224 persons, including 12 American citizens, occurred just after a six month period in which bin Ladin had issued repeated and open threats, including a February 1998 pronouncement calling for the killing of U.S. civilians and servicemen worldwide. On August 20, 1998, the United States launched cruise missiles on bin Ladin's training camps in eastern Afghanistan, based on U.S. evidence of his network's involvement in the bombings. The United States also struck a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan that the Administration alleged was linked to bin Ladin and was producing chemical weapons agents. U.S. officials add that the bombings were intended to disrupt planning for a new attack. For their alleged role in the bombings, 17 alleged members of al-Qaida have been indicted by a U.S. court, including bin Ladin. Four of the six in U.S. custody have been tried and convicted; three are in custody in Britain. ! In December 1999, U.S. and Jordanian law enforcement authorities uncovered and thwarted two alleged plots  one in the United States and one in Jordan  to attack U.S. citizens celebrating the new millennium. The United States plot, allegedly to bomb Los Angeles international airport, was orchestrated by a pro-bin Ladin cell of Algerian Armed Islamic Group members coming from Canada. In June 2000, Jordan tried 28 who allegedly were planning to attack tourists during millennium festivities in that country, but 15 of those charged are still at large. Also in June 2000, Lebanon placed 29 alleged followers of bin Ladin on trial for planning terrorist attacks in Jordan. The presence of bin Ladin cells in Jordan and Lebanon  coupled with Israeli arrests of alleged bin Ladin operatives in the West Bank and Gaza Strip  suggests that Al-Qaida might plan acts of terrorism in connection with the Palestinian uprising. ! Patterns 2000 says that ""supporters"" of bin Ladin are suspected in the October 12, 2000 bombing of the destroyer U.S.S. Cole in the harbor of the port of Aden, Yemen. The blast, which severely damaged the ship, killed 17 and injured 39 Navy personnel.  Since the August 1998 U.S. retaliatory strikes on the Afghan camps and the Sudan pharmaceutical plant, the Taliban leadership has tried to dissociate itself from bin Ladin by asserting that he is no longer its guest. However, Taliban officials have rebuffed repeated U.S. requests to extradite him, claiming that the United States has not provided the Taliban with convincing evidence that bin Ladin might have been involved in anti-U.S. terrorism. Adding to the U.S. concerns, several hundred U.S. shoulder-held anti-aircraft weapons (""Stingers"") are still at large in Afghanistan, and, because of bin Ladin's financial resources, it is highly likely he has acquired some of them. U.S. officials say bin Ladin's fighters have experimented with chemical weapons and might be trying to purchase nuclear or other weapons of mass   CRS-12 destruction materials.15 From those comments, it is reasonable to assume that bin Ladin's organization has at least a rudimentary chemical weapons capability.16 SDTs/August 20, 1998 Executive Order. President Clinton's August 20, 1998 Executive Order 13099 amended an earlier January 23, 1995 Executive order (12947) by naming al-Qaida and its aliases (the World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders, the Islamic Army for the Liberation of the Holy Places, the Islamic Salvation Foundation, and the Group for the Preservation of the Holy Sites), as an FTO. The effect of the order was to ban U.S. financial transactions with bin Ladin's organization and to allow U.S. law enforcement to freeze any bin Ladin assets in the United States that can be identified. The order also named bin Ladin as an SDT, along with Rifai Taha Musa, of the Egyptian Islamic Group (see that section above) and another associate, Abu Hafs al-Masri (Mohammad Atef). Atef and AlJihad guerrilla leader Ayman al-Zawahiri (see above) were indicted along with bin Ladin on November 4, 1998 for the Kenya/Tanzania bombings; both are viewed as potential successors to bin Ladin.17 A $5 million reward is offered for the capture of Atef, who, according to the U.S. indictment against him, was sent by bin Ladin to Somalia in 1992 to determine how to combat U.S. troops sent there for Operation Restore Hope. Zawahiri, a medical doctor, met bin Ladin in the late 1980s in Afghanistan and is considered his closest adviser on policy and strategy. Blocked Assets. No assets have been firmly linked to bin Ladin, in the United States or elsewhere, and hence none are frozen at this time, according to the Treasury Department's report on terrorist assets for 2000. U.S. officials say they are encouraging other governments to help dismantle bin Ladin's financial empire and they have persuaded Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to end the handling of some of bin Ladin's money by a few of their banks.18 About $254 million in assets of the Taliban movement are blocked under Executive order 13129, issued in July 1999 on the grounds that the Taliban continued to harbor bin Ladin.

In 1989, after the Afghan war ended, he returned to Saudi Arabia to work in his family's business, the Bin Ladin Construction group, although his radical Islamic contacts caused him to run afoul of Saudi authorities. In 1991, bin Ladin relocated to Sudan with the approval of Sudan's National Islamic Front (NIF) leader Hasan al-Turabi. There, in concert with NIF leaders, he built a network of businesses, including an Islamic bank, an import-export firm, and firms that exported agricultural products. An engineer by training, bin Ladin also used his family connections in the construction business to help Sudan build roads and airport facilities. The businesses in Sudan, some of which apparently are still operating, enabled him to offer safehaven and employment in Sudan to al-Qaida members, promoting their involvement in radical Islamic movements in their countries of origin (especially Egypt) as well as anti-U.S. terrorism. He reportedly has some business interests in Yemen as well and is believed to have investments in European and Asian firms. Bin Ladin has said publicly that, while he was in Sudan, there were a few assassination attempts against him. In the early 1990s, he founded a London-based group, the Advisory and Reform Committee, that distributed literature against the Saudi regime. As a result of bin Ladin's opposition to the ruling Al Saud family, Saudi Arabia revoked his citizenship in 1994 and his family disavowed him, although some of his brothers reportedly have maintained contact with him. He has no formal role in the operations of the Bin Ladin Construction group, which continues to receive contracts from the Saudi government and from other Arab countries. In May 1996, following strong U.S. and Egyptian pressure, Sudan expelled him, and he returned to Afghanistan, under protection of the dominant Taliban movement. On June 7, 1999, bin Ladin was placed on the FBI's ""Ten Most Wanted List,"" and a $5 million reward is offered for his capture. Bin Ladin is estimated to have about $300 million in personal financial assets with which he funds his network of as many as 3,000 Islamic militants. Al-Qaida cells have been identified or suspected in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Yemen, Jordan, Egypt, Libya, Lebanon, Algeria, Tunisia, Mauritania, Sudan, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Chechnya, , Somalia, Eritrea, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia, other parts of Africa, Malaysia, the Philippines, Uruguay, Ecuador, Bosnia, Kosovo, Albania, the United Kingdom, Canada, and allegedly inside the United States itself.

According to Patterns 2000, a GIA splinter group, the Salafi Group for Call and Combat, is now the more active armed group inside Algeria, although it is considered somewhat less violent in its tactics than is the GIA. Led by Antar Zouabri, the GIA is highly fragmented,19 in part because it does not have an authoritative religious figure who can hold its various factions together and arbitrate disputes. Some GIA members in exile appear to have gravitated to bin Ladin's network, according to information coming out of the thwarted December 1999 plot to detonate a bomb in the United States.20 As noted above, it now appears that the target of the plot was Los Angeles international airport. Founded by Algerian Islamists who fought in Afghanistan, the GIA formed as a breakaway faction of the then legal Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) political party in 1992, after the regime canceled the second round of parliamentary elections on fears of an FIS victory. According to Patterns 2000, the GIA has killed over 100 expatriates in Algeria (mostly Europeans) since 1992, but, in a possible indication of regime counterterrorism success, no foreigners have been killed in Algeria since 1997. Over the past six years, the GIA has conducted a campaign of civilian massacres, sometimes wiping out entire villages in their areas of operations, in an effort to intimidate rival groups and to demonstrate that the government lacks control over the country. The GIA conducted its most lethal terrorist attack on December 31, 1997, when it killed 400 Algerian civilians in a town 150 miles southwest of Algiers, according to Patterns 1997. It should be noted that there are allegations that elements of the regime's security forces and other opposition groups have also conducted civilian massacres. Among its acts outside Algeria, the GIA hijacked an Air France flight to Algiers in December 1994, and the group is suspected of bombing the Paris subway system on December 3, 1996, killing four. Patterns 2000 repeats previous descriptions of the GIA's strength as probably between several hundred to several thousand. The organization receives financial and logistical aid from Algerian expatriates, many of whom reside in Western Europe and in Canada.  Harakat ul-Mujahidin/Islamist Groups in Pakistan The Harakat ul-Mujahidin (HUM) is a Pakistan-based Islamic militant group that seeks to end Indian control of Muslim-inhabited parts of the divided region of Kashmir. It is composed of militant Islamist Pakistanis and Kashmiris, as well as Arab veterans of the Afghan war against the Soviet Union who view the Kashmir struggle as a ""jihad"" (Islamic crusade). The HUM was included in the original October 1997 FTO designations when its name was Harakat al-Ansar. It subsequently changed its  19  For more information, see CRS Report 98-219.

Radical Islamic Network May Have Come to U.S. New York Times, December 31, 1999.   CRS-15 name to Harakat ul-Mujahidin, possibly in an attempt to avoid the U.S. sanctions that accompanied its designation as an FTO. Under its new name, the group was redesignated as an FTO in October 1999. An offshoot of the HUM kidnapped and reportedly later killed five Western tourists in Kashmir in 1995. The HUM is believed responsible for the December 1999 hijacking of an Indian airliner because the hijackers demanded the release of an HUM leader, Masood Azhar, in exchange for the release of the jet and its passengers (one of whom was killed by the hijackers). The group appears to be allied with or part of bin Ladin's militant Islamic network, although its goal is the expulsion of Indian troops that occupy parts of Kashmir  it does not appear to be part of bin Ladin's more far-reaching struggle against the United States. A senior leader of the HUM, Fazlur Rehman Khalil, signed bin Ladin's February 1998 pronouncement calling for terrorist attacks on American troops and civilians and, according to Patterns 1999, some HUM fighters were killed in the August 20, 1998 U.S. retaliatory strikes on bin Ladin's training camps in Afghanistan. Khalil stepped down in February 2000 as leader of the HUM in favor of his second-in-command, Faruq Kashmiri. Kashmiri is not viewed as closely linked to bin Ladin as is Khalil, and the move could suggest that the HUM wants to distance itself from bin Ladin. Khalil remains as Secretary General of the organization. Other Islamist Groups in Pakistan. The HUM fights alongside other Pakistani Islamist groups that have not been named as FTOs. They include the following: ! Jaish-e-Mohammed (JEM, Army of Mohammed). This is a more radical splinter group of the HUM formed by Masood Azhar (see above) in February 2000. The group is analyzed in a section of Patterns 2000 but it is not named as an FTO. The group, which attracted a large percentage (up to 75%) of HUM fighters who defected to it when it was formed, is politically aligned with bin Ladin, the Taliban, and the pro-Taliban Islamic Scholars Society (Jamiat-i Ulema-i Islam) party of Pakistan. It probably receives some funds from bin Ladin, according to Patterns 2000. ! Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (Army of the Righteous) is analyzed separately in Patterns 2000 as ""one of the three largest and best trained groups fighting in Kashmir against India."" Led by Professor Hafiz Mohammed Saeed and operating through a missionary organization known as the MDI (Center for Islamic Call and Guidance), its fighters are Pakistanis from religious schools throughout Pakistan, as well as Arab volunteers for the Kashmir ""jihad."" ! A few other Kashmir-related groups are mentioned in press reports or in Patterns 2000, but they are not analyzed separately in the report or discussed in depth. One is the Harakat-ul Jihad Islami (Islamic Jihad Movement), many of whose fighters defected to the Jaish-e-Mohammed when it was formed. Another group, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, has called for attacks on the United States and declared itself an ally of bin Ladin. The Hizb-ul Mujahedin (Mujahedin Party) is an older, more established, and somewhat more moderate group with few apparent links to bin Ladin or to Arab volunteers for the Kashmir struggle.   CRS-16  Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) The Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) was named as an FTO on September 25, 2000 after kidnaping four U.S. citizens who were mountain climbing in Kyrgyzstan in August 2000. The IMU's primary objective is to replace the secular, authoritarian government of Uzbekistan's President Islam Karimov with an Islamic regime, and it is believed responsible for setting off five bombs in Tashkent, Uzbekistan on February 16, 1999. One of the bombs exploded in a government building just minutes before Karimov was to attend a meeting there. The government of Uzbekistan blamed the plot on two IMU leaders, Tahir Yuldashev and Juma Namangani, both of whom are reported to enjoy safehaven in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan.21 Among its insurgency operations, in August 1999, Namangani led about 800 IMU guerrillas in an unsuccessful attempt to establish a base in Kyrgyzstan from which to launch cross-border attacks into Uzbekistan. In the course of their operations, the IMU guerrillas kidnaped four Japanese geologists and eight Kyrgyz soldiers. In early August 2000, about 100 guerrillas presumably linked to the IMU seized several villages just inside Uzbekistan, on the Uzbekistan-Tajikistan border. At the same time, a related group of guerrillas battled security forces in neighboring Kyrgyzstan. Some press reports indicate that bin Ladin contributes funds to the IMU,22 although Patterns 2000 says only that the IMU receives ""support from other Islamic extremist movements in Central Asia.""  Abu Sayyaf Group The Abu Sayyaf Group, which is a designated FTO, is an Islamic separatist organization operating in the southern Philippines. Although it is not known to operate in the Near East region, Abu Sayyaf is discussed in this report because of its alleged ties to Islamic extremists based in Afghanistan, possibly including bin Ladin. The group, led by Khadafi Janjalani, raises funds for operations and recruitment by kidnaping foreign hostages. As of late August 2001, it was holding about 20 hostages, including two American citizens, in the southern Philippines. It has also expanded its kidnapings into Malaysia and is suspected of shipping weapons to Muslim extremists in Indonesia.23  Islamic Army of Aden The Islamic Army of Aden, also called the Aden-Abyan Islamic Army, is a Yemen-based radical Islamic organization. It has not been designated by the State Department as an FTO and it is not analyzed separately in Patterns 2000, although it is mentioned in that report's discussion of terrorism in Yemen.

Dow Jones Newswire, August 21, 2001.   CRS-17 the group, but it advocates the imposition of Islamic law in Yemen and the lifting of international sanctions against Iraq, and opposes the use of Yemeni ports and bases by U.S. or other Western countries. Some of the group's members are suspected of having links to bin Ladin, and the group was one of three to claim responsibility for the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole on October 12, 2000. However, some experts, note that the Islamic Army of Aden is not, as a whole, closely linked to bin Ladin and is therefore not the likely perpetrator of that attack. The group first achieved notoriety in December 1998, when it kidnaped sixteen tourists, including two Americans. Three British and one Australian tourist were killed in the course of a rescue attempt by Yemeni security forces; the rest were saved. The group's leader at the time, Zein al-Abidine al-Midhar (Abu Hassan), admitted to the kidnaping and was executed by the Yemeni government in October 1999. No new leader has been publicly identified. Yemen's President Ali Abdullah al-Salih has publicly vowed to eradicate terrorism from Yemen and there is no evidence that the government, as a matter of policy, supports radical Islamist groups or alleged bin Ladin sympathizers living in Yemen. However, there are areas of Yemen under tenuous government control and experts believe that the Yemeni government has, to some extent, tolerated the presence of Islamic extremists in Yemen. Some government workers are believed to have personal ties to individual Islamists there. Yemen has interrogated many people and made a number of arrests in the Cole attack, but some U.S. law enforcement officials are unsatisfied with its cooperation in that investigation. The former South Yemen (People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, PDRY) was on the U.S. terrorism list during 1979-1990 for supporting leftwing Arab terrorist groups, but was removed from the list when South Yemen merged with the more conservative North Yemen in 1990 to form the Republic of Yemen.  Radical Jewish Groups: Kach and Kahane Chai Some radical Jewish groups are as opposed to the Arab-Israeli peace process as are radical Islamic groups. The Jewish groups, which derive their support primarily from Jewish settlers in the occupied territories, have been willing to engage in terrorism to try to derail the process. The incidents involving these Jewish groups have declined in recent years, although settlers possibly linked to Kach and Kahane Chai have attacked Palestinians throughout the latest Palestinian uprising that began in September 2000. Kach was founded by Rabbi Meir Kahane, who was assassinated in the United States in 1990.24 Kahane Chai (Kahane Lives) was founded by Kahane's son, Binyamin, following his father's assassination. Binyamin Kahane and his wife were killed on December 31, 2000 by a Palestinian group calling itself the ""Martyr's of AlAqsa."" The two Jewish movements seek to expel all Arabs from Israel and expand 24  El Sayyid Nosair, a radical Islamist associated with Shaykh Abd al-Rahman and others involved in the World Trade Center bombing, was convicted of weapons possession for the attack on Kahane, but not the murder itself.   CRS-18 Israel's boundaries to include the occupied territories and parts of Jordan. They also want strict implementation of Jewish law in Israel. To try to accomplish these goals, the two groups have organized protests against the Israeli government, and threatened Palestinians in Hebron and elsewhere in the West Bank. On March 13, 1994, the Israeli Cabinet declared both to be terrorist organizations under a 1948 Terrorism Law. The declaration came after the groups publicly stated their support for a February 25, 1994 attack on a Hebron mosque by a radical Jewish settler, Baruch Goldstein, who was a Kach affiliate and an immigrant from the United States. The attack killed 29 worshipers and wounded about 150. Patterns 2000 says that the numerical strength of Kach and Kahane Chai is unknown and repeats previous assertions that both receive support from sympathizers in the United States and Europe. Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was killed by Israeli extremist Yigal Amir in November 1995, shortly after signing the Oslo II interim agreement with the Palestinians. Neither Amir nor his two accomplices were known to be formal members of Kach or Kahane Chai, although Amir appears to espouse ideologies similar to those of the two groups. Blocked Assets. According to the Terrorist Assets Report for 2000, about $200 belonging to Kahane Chai has been blocked since 1995.  Leftwing and Nationalist Groups Some Middle Eastern terrorist groups are guided by Arab nationalism or leftwing ideologies rather than Islamic fundamentalism. With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the loss of much of their backing from state sponsors, the leftwing and nationalist groups became progressively less active since the late 1980s and were largely eclipsed by militant Islamic groups. However, some of the leftwing nationalist groups have reactivated their terrorist and commando operations during the Palestinian uprising.  Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) The PLO formally renounced the use of terrorism in 1988, and it reaffirmed that commitment as part of its September 1993 mutual recognition agreement with Israel. The PLO has not been named an FTO by the State Department and Patterns 1995 was the last Patterns report to contain a formal section analyzing the PLO. The PLO is analyzed in this CRS report because of the debate in Congress and among observers over whether or not the PLO, as the power behind the Palestinian Authority (PA), is taking sufficient steps to prevent Hamas, PIJ, and others from conducting terrorist attacks against Israelis. This debate has intensified since the Palestinian uprising began in September 2000  the uprising has been accompanied by a significant increase in the frequency of Hamas and PIJ terrorist attacks. Patterns 2000 generally credits the PA with working with Israel to disrupt Hamas and PIJ attacks against Israel in the first half of 2000, but the report notes Israel's dissatisfaction with PA anti-terrorism cooperation after the uprising began. Patterns 2000, and an Administration report to Congress on PLO compliance with its commitments (covering June - December 2000) cite Israeli allegations that factions   CRS-19 of the PLO encouraged or participated in violence against Israel. The factions mentioned include the Fatah movement, a wing of Fatah called the ""Tanzim"" (Organization) and a PLO security apparatus called Force 17. The PLO compliance report added that Israeli officials are divided on the degree to which senior PLO and PA officials were willing or able to halt violence by these factions. Neither report clearly states whether or not the U.S. government concurs with the Israeli allegations, although U.S. officials acknowledge that the inclusion of the Israeli views in these reports suggests a degree of U.S. concurrence. On the basis of these allegations, some Members of Congress maintain that some or all of Fatah, the Tanzim, and Force 17 should be designated as FTO's. Although some Israelis no longer view Arafat as a partner for peace, others note than many Palestinians have looked to Arafat and the PLO for leadership for more than three decades and that there is no viable alternative to him. Yasir Arafat, who was born August 1, 1929, used the backing of his Fatah guerrilla organization to become chairman of the PLO in 1969. After the PLO and other Palestinian guerrillas were forced out of Jordan in 1970 and 1971, cross border attacks on Israel became more difficult, and some constituent groups under the PLO umbrella resorted to international terrorism. In the wake of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, international efforts to promote Arab-Israeli peace caused Arafat to limit terrorist attacks largely to targets within Israel, Lebanon, and the occupied territories.  Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine -- General Command (PFLP-GC) Ahmad Jibril, a former captain in the Syrian army, formed the PFLP-GC in October 1968 as a breakaway faction of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP, see below), which he considered too willing to compromise with Israel. He also believed that a conventional military arm was needed to complement terrorist operations, and the group operates a small tank force at its bases in Lebanon, according to observers. During Israel's occupation of a strip of southern Lebanon, which ended in May 2000, Jibril's several hundred guerrillas fought against Israeli forces alongside Hizballah. Recent Patterns reports have not attributed any significant terrorist attacks to the PFLP-GC in the past few years. In May 2001, Jibril claimed responsibility for shipping a boatload of weapons to the Palestinians in the occupied territories, although the shipment was intercepted by Israel's navy. Probably because of Jibril's service in the Syrian military, Syria has always been the chief backer of the PFLP-GC, giving it logistical and military support. In the late 1980s, the PFLP-GC also built a close relationship with Iran, and it receives Iranian financial assistance. There have been persistent reports that Iran approached the PFLP-GC to bomb a U.S. passenger jet in retaliation for the July 3, 1988 U.S. Navy's downing of an Iranian passenger airplane (Iran Air flight 655). The PFLP-GC allegedly pursued such an operation and abandoned it or, according to other speculation, handed off the operation to Libya in what became a successful effort to bomb Pan Am flight 103 in December 1988.25 Patterns 2000 drops assertions in  25  Closing In on the Pan Am Bombers. U.S. News and World Report, May 22, 1989. p.23.   CRS-20 previous Patterns reports that Libya, formerly a major financier of the group, retains ties to the PFLP-GC. SDTs. Jibril, who is about 63, and his deputy, Talal Muhammad Naji (about 70), have been named as SDTs.  Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) The PFLP's opposition to Arafat and to eventual peace with Israel appears to be weakening. The PFLP opposed the Palestinians' decision to join the Madrid peace process and suspended its participation in the PLO after the September 1993 IsraelPLO Declaration of Principles. In August 1999, in apparent recognition of Arafat's growing control over Palestinian territory, the PFLP held reconciliation talks with him. Arafat reportedly invited the PFLP to send a delegate to the U.S.-brokered summit talks with Israel at Camp David in July 2000, but the PFLP refused. Its terrorist wing had been almost completely inactive in the four years prior to the latest Palestinian uprising, but since then has conducted five car bombings and a few other attacks on Israelis, according to Israeli officials. Patterns 2000 repeats previous estimates of the PFLP's strength as about 800, and says that the group receives logistical assistance and safehaven from Syria. The PFLP is headquartered in Damascus and it reportedly has training facilities in Syrian-controlled areas of Lebanon. The PFLP was founded in December 1967, following the Arab defeat in the Six Day War with Israel in June of that year, by Marxist-Leninist ideologue and medical doctor George Habash, a Christian. The PFLP was active in international terrorism during the late 1960s and the 1970s; on September 6, 1970, PFLP guerrillas simultaneously hijacked three airliners and, after evacuating the passengers, blew up the aircraft. SDTs. George Habash is the only PFLP leader named as an SDT. Habash, who is about 75 years old, suffered a stroke in 1992 and was replaced as PFLP SecretaryGeneral in July 2000 by his longtime deputy Abu Ali Mustafa, also known as Mustafa al-Zubari. In October 1999, in the wake of the PFLP's reconciliation talks with Arafat, Israel allowed Mustafa to return to Palestinian-controlled territory from exile. Mustafa, who was about 63, was killed on August 27, 2001 by an Israeli missile strike on his West Bank office. After the Israeli attack, the United States reiterated its opposition to Israel's policy of targeted killings as an excessive use of force and unhelpful to efforts to quiet the ongoing violence.  Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP)26 The DFLP, still led by its 67-year-old founder Nayif Hawatmeh, abandoned its call for the destruction of Israel in the 1980s. However, it sought stringent conditions for Palestinian participation in the October 1991 Madrid peace conference and opposed the September 1993 Israel-PLO mutual recognition accords. Although it still The DFLP has splintered into factions, but the one headed by Nayif Hawatmeh dominates the organization and is the one discussed in this paper. 26   CRS-21 opposes the interim agreements reached between Israel and the Palestinians since 1993, the DFLP began reconciling with Arafat in August 1999 and stated that it might recognize Israel if there were a permanent Israeli-Palestinian peace. In response to the DFLP's apparent moderation, the State Department removed the group from the list of FTOs when that list was revised in October 1999. Also that month, Israel permitted Hawatmeh to relocate to the Palestinian-controlled areas, although he apparently has not moved there permanently. Patterns 1999 is the first Patterns report to exclude the group from its analysis of terrorist organizations. In July 2000, the DFLP was part of the Palestinian delegation to the U.S.-brokered Israeli-Palestinian final status summit negotiations at Camp David. However, since the Palestinian uprising began in September 2000, the group has claimed responsibility for a few attacks on Israeli military patrols and settlers in the occupied territories, and has openly encouraged the Palestinian uprising. Two commandos from the group attacked a heavily fortified Israeli military position in the Gaza Strip on August 25, 2001, and killed three Israeli soldiers; the two guerrillas were killed in the exchange of fire. The DFLP formed in 1969 as an offshoot of the PFLP. The DFLP's most noted terrorist attack was the May 1974 takeover of a school in Maalot, in northern Israel, in which 27 schoolchildren were killed and 134 people wounded. It thereafter confined itself largely to small-scale border raids into Israel and infrequent attacks on Israeli soldiers, officials, and civilians in Israel and the occupied territories. Recent Patterns reports estimate the total strength (for all major factions) of the DFLP is about 500. The DFLP may still receive some financial assistance from Syria, where it has its headquarters.  Palestine Liberation Front (PLF) The PLF, founded in 1976 as a splinter faction of the PFLP-GC, has greatly declined as a terrorist threat. The group's last major attack was a failed raid on the Israeli resort town of Eilat in May 1992. The leader of the most prominent PLF faction, Abu Abbas (real name, Muhammad Zaydun), has always enjoyed close personal ties to Arafat. Abbas at first opposed Arafat's decision to seek peace with Israel, but, since the mid-1990s, he has accommodated to that decision. In April 1996, Abu Abbas voted to amend the PLO Charter to eliminate clauses calling for Israel's destruction. In April 1998, Israel allowed Abu Abbas to relocate to the Gaza Strip from Iraq, where he had settled after his expulsion from Damascus in 1985. During its period of terrorist activity, the PLF conducted several high-profile attacks. Its most well-known operation was the October 1985 hijacking of the Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro, in which the group murdered disabled U.S. citizen Leon Klinghoffer and held the other passengers hostage for two days. Abu Abbas and his team surrendered to Egyptian forces in exchange for a promise of safe passage. They were apprehended at a NATO airbase in Italy after U.S. aircraft forced down the Egyptian airliner flying them to safehaven. Abu Abbas, who was not on board the Achille Lauro during the hijacking, was released by the Italian government but later sentenced in absentia. A warrant for his arrest is outstanding in Italy but the Justice Department dropped a U.S. warrant in 1996 for lack of evidence. The four other   CRS-22 hijackers were convicted and sentenced in Italy.27 (On April 30, 1996, the Senate voted 99-0 on a resolution (S.Res. 253) seeking Abu Abbas' detention and extradition to the United States.) On May 30, 1990, the PLF unsuccessfully attempted a seaborne landing, from Libya, on a Tel Aviv beach. Arafat refused to condemn the raid and, as a consequence, the United States broke off its dialogue with the PLO, which had begun in 1988. The dialogue resumed in September 1993, following the mutual Israeli-PLO recognition agreement. SDTs. Abu Abbas, who was born in 1948, has been named an SDT. He underwent guerrilla training in the Soviet Union.28  Abu Nidal Organization (ANO) The international terrorist threat posed by the Abu Nidal Organization has receded because of Abu Nidal's reported health problems (leukemia and a heart condition), internal splits, friction with state sponsors, and clashes with Arafat loyalists. It still has a few hundred members and a presence in Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon, but it has not attacked Western targets since the late 1980s. During the 1970s and 1980s, the ANO carried out over 90 terrorist attacks in 20 countries, killing about 300 people. One of its most well-known operations was a December 27, 1985 attack at airports in Rome and Vienna, in which 18 died and 111 were injured. One month earlier, ANO members hijacked Egypt Air 648, resulting in the deaths of 60 people. On September 6, 1986, ANO gunmen killed 22 at a synagogue (Neve Shalom) in Istanbul. The group is suspected of assassinating top Arafat aides in Tunis in 1991 and a Jordanian diplomat in Lebanon in January 1994. Also known as the Fatah Revolutionary Council, the ANO was created in 1974 when Abu Nidal (real name, Sabri al-Banna), then Arafat's representative in Iraq, broke with the PLO over Arafat's willingness to compromise with Israel. U.S. engagement with Iraq in the early stages of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war contributed to Iraq's expulsion of Abu Nidal to Syria in November 1983, but Syria expelled the group four years later to reduce scrutiny on the country as a sponsor of terrorism. Abu Nidal left his next home, Libya, in April 1998, after a schism between pro and anti-Arafat members of Abu Nidal's group. He relocated to Cairo, where he stayed until December 1998, when more infighting caused his presence in Egypt to become public, and therefore a foreign policy problem for Egypt. He has been in Iraq since, but there is no hard evidence that Abu Nidal is reviving his international terrorist network on his own or on Baghdad's behalf. 29 SDTs. Abu Nidal, who was born in 1937 in Jaffa (part of what is now Israel), is the only ANO member named an SDT. He faces no legal charges in the United States, according to an ABC News report of August 25, 1998, but he is wanted in Britain and Italy. His aide, Nimer Halima, was arrested in Austria in January 2000.  Of the four, one is still in jail, two were paroled in 1991, and one, Yusuf al-Mulqi, escaped in 1996 while on prison leave. 28 29  27  Holmes, Paul. Achille Lauro Mastermind Looks Back at 50.

Ibid.   CRS-23  Other Non-Islamist Organizations Three groups designated as FTOs primarily are attempting to influence the domestic political structures or the foreign policies of their countries of origin. Two of them operate against the government of Turkey and the other against the government of Iran.  Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK)30 The PKK appears to be in transition from a guerrilla and terrorist organization to a political movement. It was founded in 1974 by political science student Abdullah Ocalan, with the goal of establishing a Marxist Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey, where there is a predominantly Kurdish population. It claims to have changed its goals somewhat to focus on greater cultural and political rights within Turkey. The PKK generally targeted government forces and civilians in eastern Turkey, but it has operated elsewhere in the country and attacked Turkish diplomatic and commercial facilities in several Western European cities in 1993 and 1995. The United States sides with Turkey in viewing the PKK as a terrorist organization, but wants to see a peaceful resolution of the conflict, and encourages Turkey to provide greater cultural and linguistic rights to the Kurds. The PKK's transition accelerated in October 1998 when Turkish military and diplomatic pressure forced Syria to expel PKK leader Ocalan and the PKK. Ocalan, who is about 52, sought refuge in several countries, but Turkey captured him in Kenya in early 1999 and tried him. On June 29, 1999, a Turkish court sentenced him to death for treason and the murder of about 30,000 Turks since 1984, although the implementation of the sentence has been suspended pending appeals to the European Court of Human Rights. In August 1999, he called on his supporters to cease armed operations against the Turkish government, a decision affirmed at a PKK congress in January 2000. PKK violence against the Turkish government has since subsided, but not ended, and many of the PKK's estimated 5,000 fighters remain encamped and active across the border in Iran and Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq.  Revolutionary People's Liberation Party/Front (DHKP/C) The DHKP/C is becoming more active after a long period of virtual dormancy. This Marxist organization, still commonly referred to by its former name, Dev Sol, was formed in 1978 to oppose Turkey's pro-Western tilt and its membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Since the late 1980s, the DHKP/C (which corresponds to its acronym in Turkish) has concentrated attacks on Turkish military and security officials, but it has since 1990 attacked foreign interests, according to Patterns 2000. The group assassinated two U.S. military contractors in Turkey to protest the Gulf War against Iraq and it rocketed the U.S. consulate in Istanbul in 1992. An attempt by the group to fire an anti-tank weapon at the 30  For more information on the PKK, see CRS Report 94-267, Turkey's Kurdish Imbroglio and U.S. Policy, by Carol Migdalovitz,, Mar. 18, 1994. The PKK is distinct from Iranian and Iraqi Kurdish organizations that the State Department does not consider terrorist and which, in the case of Iraqi Kurds, benefit from U.S. support.   CRS-24 consulate in June 1999 was thwarted by Turkish authorities. Also foiled was a planned attack by the group in August 2000 on Incirlik air base, which hosts U.S. aircraft patrolling a ""no fly zone"" over northern Iraq. The group attacked an Istanbul police station, killing one police officer, in January 2001.  The People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI) The People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI), the dominant organization within a broader National Council of Resistance (NCR), has leftwing roots but it is not composed of an ethnic minority. It was formed in the 1960's as an opponent of the Shah's authoritarian and pro-Western rule and allied with the clerics who overthrew the Shah. In 1981, the PMOI turned against the Islamic revolutionary regime of Ayatollah Khomeini when Iran's clerics excluded the PMOI and other groups from major roles in the new government, but the PMOI was defeated and its leaders fled Iran. The group claims that it has abandoned its leftwing past and that it is committed to free markets and democracy. However, the State Department noted in a 1994 congressionally-mandated report that there is no record of an internal debate over the change in ideology, and there is reason to doubt the organization's sincerity. The group publicly supports the Arab-Israeli peace process and the rights of Iran's minorities. The State Department's longstanding mistrust of the group is based not only on the group's leftist past, but on its killing of several U.S. military officers and civilians during the struggle against the Shah, its support for the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979, its authoritarian internal structure, and its use of Iraq as base for its several thousand member military wing. The State Department named the PMOI an FTO in October 1997 on the grounds that it kills civilians in the course of its antiregime operations inside Iran. In one of its most high-profile attacks, the group claimed responsibility for the April 10, 1999 assassination in Tehran of a senior Iranian military officer. However, the group does not appear to purposely target civilians. In the October 1999 revision of the FTO list, the NCR was named as an alias of the PMOI, meaning that FTO-related sanctions now apply to the NCR as well. The NCR's offices in the United States have not been closed by U.S. law enforcement authorities, but seven of its members were arrested in California in March 2001 for soliciting donations for the group, a violation of FTO sanctions regulations. Other supporters of the group often operate under the names of local Iranian expatriate organizations. Some Members of Congress have questioned the State Department's designation of the group as an FTO, and stated that the group merits U.S. support as an alternative to the current regime in Tehran. The PMOI is led by Masud and Maryam Rajavi. Masud, the PMOI Secretary General, leads the PMOI's military forces based in Iraq. His wife Maryam, who is now with him in Iraq after being asked to leave France in 1997, is the organization's choice to become interim president of Iran if it were to take power.   CRS-25  Middle Eastern Terrorism List Countries Signs of success in the long-running U.S. campaign to reduce state sponsorship of international terrorism continue to mount. In the case of several of the five Middle Eastern countries on the terrorism list -- Iraq, Iran, Syria, Sudan, and Libya31 -- U.S. and international pressure, coupled with internal developments in some of these states, appears to have reduced their support for international terrorism. However, many experts believe that a decision whether or not to remove a country from the terrorism list is based on factors in addition to terrorism support alone, including congressional sentiment and public perception of the country in question. Of the Middle Eastern countries on the list, Sudan appears to be the closest to achieving removal; the State Department openly acknowledges working with Sudan to help it meet the remaining requirements for removing it from the list. Under Section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act, removal from the list requires 45 day advance notification to the House International Relations Committee, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the Senate and House Banking Committees, that the country has ceased support for international terrorism and pledges to continue doing so. Also under that provision, a major change of government in the listed country can serve as grounds for immediate removal from the list.  Iran32 Patterns 2000, as has been the case for the past six years, again characterizes Iran as ""the most active"" state sponsor of international terrorism. However, the report, as did Patterns 1999, attributes Iran's terrorism support to specific institutions  the Revolutionary Guard and the Ministry of Intelligence and Security  rather rather than the Iranian government as a whole. This characterization suggests that the State Department believes President Mohammad Khatemi and his allies genuinely wish to overcome Iran's reputation as a ""terrorist state"" in order to further ease Iran's isolation. Suggesting that Khatemi is attempting maintain a position within a leadership foreign policy consensus, that includes extremists, Patterns 2000 cites statements by him as well as by hardline leaders calling for the destruction of Israel. In another apparent signal to Iran, Patterns 2000, for the third year in a row, cites PMOI attacks on Iranian officials as justification for Iran's claim that it is a victim of terrorism. Although no major international terrorist attacks have been linked to Iran since Khatemi took office in August 1997, the United States has not publicly noted any diminution of Iranian material support for terrorist groups opposed to the ArabIsraeli peace process, such as those discussed earlier in this paper. Patterns 2000  31  Along with Cuba and North Korea, these countries have been designated by the Secretary of State, under Section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. 2405(j)) as having repeatedly provided state support for international terrorism. 32  For further information, see CRS Issue Brief IB93033, Iran: Current Developments and U.S. Policy. Updated regularly, by Kenneth Katzman.   CRS-26 notes that Iran has encouraged Hizballah and Palestinian terrorist groups to escalate attacks on Israel in the context of the Palestinian uprising. Iran also has been accused by regional governments of sponsoring assassinations of anti-Shiite Muslim clerics in Tajikistan and Pakistan, and of supporting Shiite Muslim Islamic opposition movements in the Persian Gulf states and Iraq. On the other hand, U.S. officials acknowledge that Iran has improved relations with its Gulf neighbors dramatically in recent years, and that its support for Gulf opposition movements has diminished sharply. Iran also has largely ceased attacks on dissidents abroad that were so prominent among Khatami's predecessors. In handing down indictments of 14 people in June 2001, the Department of Justice stated its belief that Iran was involved in the June 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, which killed 19 U.S. airmen. No Iranians were among those indicted, but the indictments detail the role of Iranian security personnel in inspiring and supervising the plot, which was carried out by members of Saudi Hizballah. Eleven of the 14 are in custody in Saudi Arabia, and Saudi Arabia says they will be tried there and not extradited to the United States.33 Many experts believe that the Saudi and U.S. governments have sought to avoid firmly pressing the Khobar case against Iran  legally or diplomatically  in order not to undermine Khatemi (who was elected after the bombing) or reduce the chance to improved relations with Iran.  Syria34 Patterns 2000 is more critical of Syria than was Patterns 1999, which came close to promising that Syria will be removed from the terrorism list if it signed a peace agreement with Israel. This could signal that U.S. hopes have receded that President Bashar al-Assad would be more flexible on foreign policy than his father, the late Hafez al- Assad, who Bashar succeeded in June 2000 upon his death. Far from praising Syria for restraining terrorist gro ups as was the case in some past Patterns report, Patterns 2000 says that Syria allowed Hamas to open a new office in Damascus in March 2000. The report adds that Syria did not act to stop Hizballah or Palestinian terrorist groups, operating in Syria or areas under Syrian control or influence, from launching ant-Israel attacks. Syria continued to allow Iran to resupply Hizballah through the Damascus airport, and has allowed visiting Iranian officials to meet with anti-peace process terrorist organizations based in Syria. It also publicly opposed suggestions that Hizballah be disarmed by U.N. peacekeepers after the militia seized positions in southern Lebanon vacated by Israel during its May 2000 withdrawal. Patterns 2000 does state that Syria is generally upholding its pledge to Turkey not to support the PKK. Some believe that Syria's position on the PKK is the result of Syria's fear of Turkey's potential threat to use armed force against Syria, and not a unilateral Syrian desire to sever relations with the PKK.

Updated regularly, by Alfred Prados. 34   CRS-27 is that Syria wants to sustain the recent improvement in its bilateral relationship with Turkey. Also, Patterns 2000 states that Syria appears to have maintained its longstanding ban on attacks launched from Syrian territory or against Western targets. Despite its position on the terrorism list, the United States maintains relatively normal relations with Syria. The two countries exchange ambassadors and most forms of U.S. trade with and U.S. investment in Syria are permitted. Exports of items that can have military applications are subject to strict licensing requirements.  Libya35 The Pan Am 103 bombing issue has been at the center of U.S. policy toward Libya for more than a decade, and will likely prevent any major rapprochement as long as Muammar Qadhafi remains in power. The Pan Am attack, on December 21, 1988, killed 259 people aboard plus 11 on the ground, and the families of the victims are vocal advocates of a hardline U.S. stance on Libya. Three U.N. Security Council resolutions -- 731 (January 21, 1992); 748 (March 31, 1992); and 883 (November 11, 1993) -- called on Libya to turn over the two Libyan intelligence agents (Abd alBasit Ali al-Megrahi and Al Amin Khalifah Fhimah) suspected in the bombing, and to help resolve the related case of the 1989 bombing of French airline UTA's Flight 772. The U.N. resolutions prohibited air travel to or from Libya and all arms transfers to that country (Resolution 748); and froze Libyan assets and prohibited the sale to Libya of petroleum-related equipment (Resolution 883). In accordance with U.N. Security Council Resolution 1192 (August 27, 1998), the sanctions were suspended, but not terminated, immediately upon the April 5, 1999 handover of the two to the Netherlands. There, their trial under Scottish law began on May 3, 2000 and ended on January 31, 2001 with the conviction of al-Megrahi and the acquittal of Fhimah. The handover of the Pan Am suspects, along with Libya's growing distance from radical Palestinian groups, reportedly prompted the Clinton Administration to review whether to remove Libya from the terrorism list. 36 In 1998, prior to the handover, Libya had expelled Abu Nidal, it was reducing its contacts with other radical Palestinian organizations, and it expressed support for Yasir Arafat. In an effort to reward Libya's positive steps, in 1999 a U.S. official met with a Libyan diplomat for the first time since 1981, and the U.S. trade ban was modified to permit exports of food and medicine. In March 2000, a group of U.S. security officials visited Libya briefly to assess whether or not to lift the U.S. restriction on the use of U.S. passports for travel to Libya. No decision was announced. The January 31, 2001 conviction of al-Megrahi brought some closure to the Pan Am case but also reinforced the perception among the Pan Am victims' families and others that Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi knew about, if not orchestrated, the bombing. Immediately upon the conviction, President Bush stated that the United States would maintains unilateral sanctions on Libya and opposes permanently lifting U.N. sanctions until Libya: (1) accepts responsibility for the act; (2) compensates the 35  For further information on Libya and its involvement in terrorism, see CRS Issue Brief IB93109, Libya, by Clyde Mark, (updated regularly).

Since the conviction, no U.S. official has suggested that Libya would receive consideration for removal from the terrorism list in the near future. Patterns 2000 was more critical of Libya than was Patterns 1999, stating that it is unclear whether or not Libya's distancing itself from its ""terrorist past"" signifies a true change in policy. Libya has tried to appear cooperative in resolving other past acts of terrorism. In March 1999, a French court convicted six Libyans, in absentia, for the 1989 bombing of a French airliner, UTA Flight 772, over Niger. One of them is Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi's brother-in-law, intelligence agent Muhammad Sanusi. Although it never acknowledged responsibility or turned over the indicted suspects, in July 1999 Libya compensated the families of the 171 victims of the bombing, who included seven U.S. citizens. In July 1999, Britain restored diplomatic relations with Libya after it agreed to cooperate with the investigation of the 1984 fatal shooting of a British policewoman, Yvonne Fletcher, outside Libya's embassy in London. It is alleged that a Libyan diplomat shot her while firing on Libyan dissidents demonstrating outside the embassy. In what some construe as part of the effort to improve its international image, Libya also has tried to mediate an end to conflicts between Eritrea and Ethiopia, and within Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, some believe Libya is trying to extend its influence in Africa rather than broker peace, and some in Congress and the Administration assert that Libya continues to arm rebel groups in Africa, such as the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone.37  Sudan38 Sudan appears closest of any of the Near Eastern countries on the terrorism list to being removed, despite congressional and outside criticism over its prosecution of the war against Christian and other rebels in its south. The State Department says it is engaged in discussions with Sudan with the objective of getting Sudan ""completely out of the terrorism business and off the terrorism list.""39 Since shortly after being placed on the terrorism list, Sudan has signaled a willingness to assuage international concerns about its support for terrorism. In August 1994, Sudan turned over the terrorist Carlos (Ilyich Ramirez Sanchez) to France. In December 1999, Sudan's President Umar Hassan al-Bashir, a military leader, politically sidelined Sudan's leading Islamist figure, Hassan al-Turabi. In February 2001, Turabi was arrested, and has remained under house arrest since May 2001. Turabi was the primary proponent of Sudan's ties to region-wide Islamic movements, including Al Qaida, the Abu Nidal Organization, Hamas, PIJ, Egypt's Islamic Group and Al Jihad, Hizballah, and  37  Libya Must Fulfill All Requirements to Have Sanctions Lifted.

The key outstanding terrorism issue is Sudan's compliance with three Security Council resolutions adopted in 1996: (1044 of January 31; 1054, of April 26; and 1070 of August 16). The resolutions demanded that Sudan extradite the three Islamic Group suspects in the June 1995 assassination attempt against President Mubarak in Ethiopia, restricted the number of Sudanese diplomats abro ad, and authorized a suspension of international flights by Sudanese aircraft, although the last measure was never put into effect. According to the Washington Post of August 21, 2001, the Bush Administration has concluded that Sudan has ended its support for the terrorists involved in the bomb plot. Some Administration officials want the United States to agree to a lifting of the U.N. sanctions if and when Sudan seeks such a move, possibly as early as late September 2001. Others believe that the U.N. sanctions should remain as a signal, in part, of U.S. displeasure with Sudan's overall poor human rights record and its war against southern Sudanese rebels. The United States has tried to promote further progress on terrorism by slowly increasing engagement with Sudan. The United States closed its embassy in Khartoum in February 1996, although diplomatic relations were not broken. U.S. diplomats posted to Sudan have since worked out of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya, but have made consular visits to the embassy in Khartoum. Several times since mid-2000, U.S. counterterrorism experts have visited Sudan to discuss U.S. terrorism concerns and monitor Sudan's behavior on the issue. There is lingering resentment among some Sudanese against the United States because of the August 20, 1998 cruise missile strike on the al-Shifa pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum, conducted in conjunction with the strike on bin Ladin's bases in Afghanistan. The United States destroyed the plant on the grounds that it was allegedly contributing to chemical weapons manufacture for bin Ladin. Although the Clinton Administration asserted that the al-Shifa strike was justified, several outside critics maintained that the plant was a genuine pharmaceutical factory with no connection to bin Ladin or to the production of chemical weapons. The plant owner's $24 million in U.S.-based assets were unfrozen by the Administration in 1999, a move widely interpreted as a tacit U.S. admission that the strike was in error.  Iraq40 U.S.-Iraq differences over Iraq's regional ambitions and its record of compliance with post-Gulf war ceasefire requirements will probably keep Iraq on the terrorism list as long as Saddam Husayn remains in power. Observers are virtually unanimous in assessing Iraq's record of compliance with its postwar obligations as poor, and its human rights record as abysmal. However, international pressure on Iraq on these broader issues appears to have constrained Iraq's ability to use terrorism. Patterns 2000, as have the past few Patterns reports, notes that Iraq continues to plan and sponsor international terrorism, although Iraq's activities are directed mostly against  For further information, see CRS Issue Brief IB92117, Iraqi Compliance With Ceasefire Agreements.

In October 1998, Iraqi agents allegedly planned to attack the Prague-based Radio Free Iraq service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, although no attack occurred. Iraq organized a failed assassination plot against former President Bush during his April 1993 visit to Kuwait, which triggered a U.S. retaliatory missile strike on Iraqi intelligence headquarters. Since 1991, it has sporadically attacked international relief workers in Kurdishcontrolled northern Iraq. Iraq, which historically has had close ties to Yasir Arafat, has given some support to anti-peace process Palestinian groups, and hosts the Abu Nidal Organization, Abu Abbas' Palestine Liberation Front, and other minor groups. As a lever in its relations with Iran, Iraq continues to host and provide some older surplus weaponry to the PMOI's army, the National Liberation Army (NLA), which has bases near the border with Iran. However, Iraq apparently has reduced support for the group as Iraq's relations with Tehran have improved over the past two years.  Table 2.

However, a central tenet of U.S. policy is not to capitulate to the demands of terrorists. Observers also tend to agree that the success of almost any strategy depends on bilateral, multilateral, or international cooperation with U.S. efforts. Not all options focus on pressuring states or groups; some believe that engagement with state sponsors and U.S. efforts to address terrorists' grievances are more effective over the long term. The United States has claimed some successes for its policy of pressuring state sponsors, but there are signs that the United States is now incorporating a greater degree of engagement into its policy framework. At the same time, the United States has not dropped the longstanding stated U.S. policy of refusing to make concessions to terrorists or of pursuing terrorism cases, politically or legally, as long as is needed to obtain a resolution. An exhaustive discussion of U.S. efforts to counter terrorism emanating from the region is beyond the scope of this paper, but the following sections highlight key themes in U.S. efforts to reduce this threat.42  Military Force The United States has used military force against terrorism in selected cases. U.S. allies in Europe have sometimes been the victims of Near Eastern terrorism, but they generally view military retaliation as a last resort, believing that it could inspire a cycle of attack and reaction that might be difficult to control. On some occasions, however, allies have provided logistic and diplomatic support for unilateral U.S. retaliatory attacks. U.S. military actions against terrorists have almost always received strong congressional support. Major U.S. attacks have been conducted in retaliation for terrorist acts sponsored by Libya and Iraq, as well as those allegedly sponsored by the bin Ladin network. On April 15, 1986, the United States sent about 100 U.S. aircraft to bomb military installations in Libya. The attack was in retaliation for the April 2, 1986 bombing of a Berlin nightclub in which 2 U.S. military personnel were killed, and in which Libya was implicated. On June 26, 1993, the United States fired cruise missiles at the headquarters in Baghdad of the Iraqi Intelligence Service, which allegedly sponsored a failed assassination plot against former President George Bush during his April 14-16, 1993 visit to Kuwait. (Other U.S. retaliation against Iraq since 1991 has been triggered by Iraqi violations of ceasefire terms not related to terrorism.) The August 20, 1998 cruise missile strikes against the bin Ladin network in Afghanistan represented a U.S. strike against a group, not a state sponsor. The related strike on a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan could have been intended as a signal to Sudan to sever any remaining ties to bin Ladin.  42  An extended discussion of these issues is provided by CRS Issue Brief IB95112. Terrorism, the Future, and U.S. Foreign Policy. Updated regularly, by Raphael Perl.   CRS-32 The effectiveness of U.S. military action against terrorist groups or state sponsors is difficult to judge. Libya did not immediately try to retaliate after the 1986 U.S. strike, but many believe that it did eventually strike back by orchestrating the Pan Am 103 bombing. Since the 1993 U.S. strike, Iraq has avoided terrorist attacks against high profile U.S. targets, but it has continued to challenge the United States on numerous issues related to its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The 1998 airstrikes against bin Ladin did not prompt the Taliban leadership to extradite or expel him from Afghanistan, nor did the strikes deter bin Ladin's network from engaging in further terrorist activities.  Unilateral Economic Sanctions The United States has been willing to apply economic sanctions unilaterally. Under a number of different laws,43 the placement of a country on the terrorism list triggers a wide range of U.S. economic sanctions, including: ! a ban on direct U.S. foreign aid, including Export-Import Bank guarantees. ! a ban on sales of items on the U.S. Munitions Control List. ! a requirement that the United States vote against lending to that country by international institutions. ! strict licensing requirements for sales to that country, which generally prohibit exports of items that can have military applications, such as advanced sensing, computation, or transportation equipment.  A U.S. trade ban has been imposed on every Middle Eastern terrorism list state, except Syria, under separate Executive orders. Placement on the terrorism list does not automatically trigger a total ban on U.S. trade with or investment by the United States. In addition, foreign aid appropriations bills since the late 1980s have barred direct and indirect assistance to terrorism list and other selected countries, and mandated cuts in U.S. contributions to international programs that work in those countries. As shown in Table 2 above, the United States also tries to maintain some leverage over terrorism list states and groups by blocking some of their assets in the United States. Some sanctions are aimed at countries that help or arm terrorism list countries. Sections 325 and 326 of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (P.L. 104-132) amended the Foreign Assistance Act by requiring the President to withhold U.S. foreign assistance to any government that provides assistance or lethal military aid to any terrorism list country. In April 1999, three Russian entities were sanctioned  The list of sanctions are under the following authorities: Section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act, as amended [P.L. 96-72; 50 U.S.C. app. 2405 (j)]; Section 40 of the Arms Export Control Act, as amended [P.L. 90-629; 22 U.S.C. 2780]; and Section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended [P.L. 87-195; 22 U.S.C. 2371]; and Section 1621 of the International Financial Institutions Act [22 U.S.C. 262c].  43   CRS-33 under this provision for providing anti-tank weaponry to Syria; sanctions on the Russian government were waived. The 1996 Anti-Terrorism act also gave the Administration another option besides placing a country on the terrorism list. Section 303 of that Act created a new list of states that are deemed ""not cooperating with U.S. anti-terrorism efforts,"" and provided that states on that list be barred from sales of U.S. Munitions List items. Under that provision, and every year since 1997, Afghanistan  along with the seven terrorism list countries  has been designated as not cooperating. No U.S. allies have been designated as ""not cooperating,"" although the provision was enacted following an April 1995 incident in which Saudi Arabia did not attempt to detain Hizballah terrorist Imad Mughniyah when a plane, on which he was believed to be a passenger, was scheduled to land in Saudi Arabia.44 Possibly in an attempt to avoid similar incidents, on June 21, 1995, President Clinton signed Presidential Decision Directive 39 (PDD-39), enabling U.S. law enforcement authorities to capture suspected terrorists by force from foreign countries that refuse to cooperate in their extradition.45 The Clinton Administration rejected several outside recommendations  most recently those issued in June 2000 by the congressionally-mandated National Commission on Terrorism  to place Afghanistan on the terrorism list. The Clinton Administration said that placing Afghanistan on the list would imply that the United States recognizes the Taliban movement as the legitimate government of Afghanistan. However, President Clinton, on July 4, 1999, issued Executive order 13129 imposing sanctions on the Taliban that are similar to those imposed on terrorism list countries and on foreign terrorist organizations. The order imposed a ban on U.S. trade with areas of Afghanistan under Taliban control, froze Taliban assets in the United States, and prohibited contributions to Taliban by U.S. persons. The President justified the move by citing the Taliban's continued harboring of bin Ladin. Also in its June 2000 report, the National Commission on Terrorism recommended naming Greece and Pakistan as not fully cooperating with U.S. antiterrorism efforts. The Clinton Administration rejected those recommendations as well. In Patterns 2000, the State Department implied that Pakistan and Lebanon were potential candidates for the terrorism list, or possibly the ""not cooperating"" list, for supporting or tolerating operations by terrorist groups.46 On the other hand, Patterns 2000 did credit both Pakistan and Lebanon with anti-terrorism cooperation in selected cases. Most experts believe the United States does not want to alienate those countries by placing them on the terrorism list, although designating them as ""not cooperating"" might have less of an effect on U.S. relations with them.47  44 45 46 47  Hizballah Denies Mughniyah on Board Plane.

Pakistan is widely credited with helping the United States capture Ramzi Ahmad Yusuf (February 1995), CIA shooter Mir Aimal Kansi (June 1997), and some suspects in the Kenya/Tanzania embassy bombings.   CRS-34 Analysts doubt that unilateral U.S. economic sanctions, by themselves, can force major changes in the behavior of state sponsors of terrorism. Major U.S. allies did not join the U.S. trade ban imposed on Iran in May 1995 and the move did not, in itself, measurably alter Iran's support for terrorist groups. On the other hand, virtually all Middle Eastern terrorism list states have publicly protested their inclusion on the list and other U.S. sanctions, suggesting that these sanctions are having an effect politically and/or economically. U.S. officials assert that U.S. sanctions, even if unilateral, have made some terrorism state sponsors ""think twice"" about promoting terrorism. To demonstrate that improvements in behavior can be rewarded, in April 1999 the Clinton Administration announced that it would permit, on a case-by-case basis, commercial sales of U.S. food and medical products to Libya, Sudan, and Iran. The move relaxed the bans on U.S. trade with the three countries. As noted previously, all three have recently shown some signs of wanting to improve their international images.  Multilateral Sanctions In concert with U.S. unilateral actions, the United States has sought to apply multilateral sanctions against Middle Eastern terrorism. As noted above, the United States led efforts to impose international sanctions on Libya and Sudan for their support of terrorism, and both those states have sought to improve their international standings since international sanctions were imposed. The United States and Russia jointly worked successfully to persuade the United Nations Security Council to adopt sanctions on the Taliban because of its refusal to extradite bin Ladin. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1267, adopted October 15, 1999, banned flights outside Afghanistan by its national airline, Ariana, and directed U.N. member states to freeze Taliban assets. The United States and Russia teamed up again to push another resolution (U.N. Security Council Resolution 1333, adopted December 19, 2000) that, among other measures, imposed an international arms embargo on the Taliban only, not on opposition factions.48 These measures are beginning to be implemented and have not, to date, caused the Taliban to waiver in its refusal to hand over bin Ladin. Pakistan has said it will comply with the resolutions, possibly resulting in Pakistan's reducing its patronage of the Taliban movement.  Counterterrorism Cooperation Successive administrations have identified counterterrorism cooperation with friendly countries as a key element of U.S. policy. In one important regional example, the United States has sought to contain Hizballah by providing military and law enforcement assistance to the government of Lebanon. In the past few years, the United States has sold Lebanon non-lethal defense articles such as armored personnel carriers. In 1994, on a one-time basis, the United States provided non-lethal aid, including excess trucks and equipment, to Palestinian Authority security forces in an effort to strengthen them against Hamas and PIJ, although some in Israel now fear Miller, Judith. Russians Join U.S. To Seek New Sanctions on Taliban. New York Times, August 4, 2000. 48   CRS-35 that the PA or PLO factions might use some of this equipment against Israel. Several Middle Eastern countries, including Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Turkey, receive anti-terrorism assistance through the Anti-Terrorism Assistance Program run by the State Department Bureau of Diplomatic Security, in which the United States provides training in airport security, explosives detection, and crisis management. In cooperating against the bin Ladin network, the United States has expanded and formalized a counterterrorism dialogue with Russia and begun bilateral dialogues on the issue with the Central Asian states. Every year since 1999, the State Department has hosted a multilateral conference of senior counterterrorism officials from the Middle East, Central Asia, and Asia, focusing on combating the terrorism threat from Afghanistan. These conferences and meetings have often resulted in agreements to exchange information, to conduct joint efforts to counter terrorist fundraising, and to develop improved export controls on explosives and conventions against nuclear terrorism.49 The United States has provided some detection equipment to the Central Asian states to help them prevent the smuggling of nuclear and other material to terrorist groups such as the bin Ladin network or terrorism list countries. The measure yielded some results in April 2000, when Uzbek border authorities used this equipment to detect and seize ten containers with radioactive material bound for Pakistan.50 During a trip to the region a few weeks after this incident, then Secretary of State Albright pledged $3 million each to Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan to help their border police combat drug smuggling and terrorism. In June 2001, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences began a program of cooperation with the Russian Academy of Sciences to combat the use of high technology for terrorism. The United States has worked with the European Union (EU) to exert influence on Iran to end its sponsorship of terrorism. In exchange for relaxing enforcement of U.S. sanctions under the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (P.L. 104-172) , which would have sanctioned EU firms that invest in Iran's energy industry, in mid 1998 the United States extracted a pledge from the EU to increase cooperation with the United States against Iranian terrorism. In May 1998, the EU countries agreed on a ""code of conduct"" to curb arms sales to states, such as Iran, that might use the arms to support terrorism. However, the code is not legally binding on the EU member governments.51 In January 2000, the United States signed a new International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Financing, which creates an international legal framework to investigate those involved in terrorist financing.  Selective Engagement As noted in the discussions of terrorism list countries, the Administration has shown increasing willingness to engage state sponsors, once these countries have demonstrated some willingness to curb support for terrorism.

On the other hand, critics believe that terrorism list countries are likely to view a U.S. policy of engagement as a sign that supporting terrorism will not adversely affect relations with the United States. Of the Middle Eastern terrorism list countries, the United States engages in bilateral dialogue with all except Iran and Iraq. The United States has called for a dialogue with Iran, but Iran has thus far refused on the grounds that the United States has not dismantled what Iran calls ""hostile"" policies toward that country  a formulation widely interpreted to refer to U.S. sanctions. Iraq has asked for direct talks with the United States, but the United States has rejected the suggestion on the grounds that Iraq is too far from compliance with Gulf war-related requirements to make official talks useful.  Legal Action Legal action against terrorist groups and state sponsors is becoming an increasingly large component of U.S. counterterrorism strategy. In the case of the bombing of Pan Am 103, the Bush Administration chose international legal action  a trial of the two Libyan suspects  over military retaliation. A similar choice has apparently been made in the Khobar Towers bombing case, although that legal effort consists of U.S. indictments of suspects and not a U.N.-centered legal effort. Congress has attempted to give victims of international terrorism a legal option against state sponsors. The Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (Section 221) created an exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunity for Certain Cases (28 U.S.C., Section 1605), allowing victims of terrorism to sue terrorism list countries for acts of terrorism by them or groups they support. Since this provision was enacted, a number of cases have been brought in U.S. courts, and several multimillion dollar awards have been made to former hostages and the families of victims of groups proven in court to have been sponsored by Iran. In 2000, the Clinton Administration accepted compromise legislation to use general revenues to pay compensatory damage awards to these successful claimants, with the stipulation that the President try to recoup expended funds from Iran as part of an overall reconciliation in relations and settlement of assets disputes. The provision, called the ""Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act,"" was incorporated into the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-386). The Clinton Administration had opposed directly tapping frozen Iranian assets in the United States  such as selling Iran's former embassy in Washington  on the grounds that doing so could violate diplomatic sovereignty or provoke attacks on U.S. property or citizens abroad.  The Domestic Front The February 1993 World Trade Center bombing exposed the vulnerability of the United States homeland to Middle Eastern-inspired terrorism as did no other previous event. The bombing sparked stepped up law enforcement investigation into the activities of Islamic networks in the United States and alleged fundraising in the   CRS-37 United States for Middle East terrorism. In January 1995, President Clinton targeted terrorism fundraising in his Executive order 12947 (see above). Congress included many of the measures in that Executive order in the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. The additional law enforcement powers and efforts in recent years might have accounted for the foiling of the alleged plot by bin Ladin supporters to detonate a bomb at Los Angeles airport on the eve of the millennium. Some observers allege that Middle Eastern groups have extensive fundraising and political networks in the United States, working from seemingly innocent religious and research institutions and investment companies.52 PIJ leader Shallah, before being tapped to lead PIJ, taught at the University of South Florida in the early 1990s and ran an affiliated Islamic studies institute called the World and Islam Studies Enterprise (WISE). In May 2000, the parents of an Israeli-American teenager killed in a 1996 Hamas attack in Israel filed suit against several Islamic charity groups in the United States alleging that they raised money for Hamas.53 Groups named in the suit included the Quranic Literary Institute, the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, the Islamic Association for Palestine, and the United Association for Studies and Research. Representatives of these groups have consistently denied any involvement with fundraising for terrorism or involvement in Hamas/PIJ activities.54 Others have challenged this view, saying that most American Muslims who support such groups oppose the use of violence, and donate money to organizations that they believe use the funds solely for humanitarian purposes. Some U.S. domestic counterterrorism efforts, particularly those dealing with immigration and investigative powers, have drawn substantial criticism from U.S. civil liberties groups, which have expressed concern about excessive intrusions by law enforcement authorities. These groups also have said that the prohibition on donations to groups allegedly involved in terrorism infringes free speech. Some Arab-American and American Muslim organizations have complained that U.S. residents and citizens of Arab descent are being unfairly branded as suspected terrorists, and point to erroneous initial accusations by some terrorism experts that Islamic extremists perpetrated the Oklahoma City bombing in April 1995.

GX014-85-0805208	"*EPF502   04/26/2002  Defense Department Report, April 26: Afghanistan, Central Asia  (Rumsfeld begins five-day trip to region) (400)  U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said he believes al-Qaida and Taliban militia will probably try an offensive in Afghanistan beginning in the spring.    Rumsfeld also said that al-Qaida and Taliban forces are trying to avoid concentrating in large groups until they are ready to attempt military operations.    ""My guess is that as the spring comes and the weather improves and as they find ways to communicate with each other, that they will probably again try to attack the interim authority and opposing factions in the country, as well as U.S. and coalition forces,"" Rumsfeld said April 26 en route from Washington to Kyrgyzstan on the first leg of his five-day trip to the Central Asian region.    His first stop was to visit U.S. forces at Ganci Air Base located at the Manas International Airport in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan.  The air base is unofficially named in honor of New York City Fire Chief Peter Ganci Jr., who was killed on September 11 trying to get his firefighters to safety before the World Trade Center collapsed.    Rumsfeld told a gathering of U.S. personnel at the base that forces would remain in the region ""as long as necessary.""  He said a major reason for the trip is to discuss security issues with the Afghan interim government of Hamid Karzai as well as Afghanistan's neighbors.    ""The relationship between Afghanistan and its neighbors is one of the determinants in its security and its circumstances, its economic health and its government's viability,"" Rumsfeld said.  ""The time I am going to be spending in Afghanistan is going to be focused essentially on the security situation.""    Rumsfeld also said U.S. and coalition forces will continue ""to conduct sweeps and find pockets of al-Qaida and Taliban.""    While Rumsfeld's trip will take him from Kyrgyzstan on to Afghanistan, the remainder of the trip remains unspecified until he concludes with a stop in Moscow to continue talks on nuclear arms reductions with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov.  The United States is preparing for a summit between Presidents Bush and Russian President Vladimir Putin later in May in Moscow.    ""We are in the process of making our way through a set of understandings that may or may not be discussed by the two presidents when they get together in one, two, or three occasions coming up,"" Rumsfeld said.

The Bush Administration has identified Iran's modernization of its conventional forces as a potential threat to U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf, but others argue that the buildup has been minor and that Iran still is relatively poorly equipped. Although the Bush Administration says it is still willing to hold a dialogue with Iran, the focus of current U.S. policy appears to be a return to the containment policy that prevailed during the early part of the Clinton Administration. During the first term of the Clinton Administration, as part of a policy of ""dual containment"" of Iran and Iraq, President Clinton imposed a ban on U.S. trade and investment in Iran in 1995, and a 1996 law imposed sanctions on foreign investment in Iran's energy sector (Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, ILSA). In keeping with a 1997 policy shift toward engagement, the Clinton Administration and Congress later eased sanctions to allow U.S. exports to Iran of food and medical supplies and importation from Iran of goods such as carpets and caviar. The United States has consistently worked with its allies to prevent arms and advanced technology sales to Iran and to limit Iran's influence over regional energy flows. U.S. purchases of Iranian crude oil and U.S. company investments in Iran remain barred. ILSA was renewed for another 5 years on August 3, 2001 (H.R. 1954, P.L. 107-24).  Even before Iran's tacit cooperation with post-September 11 U.S. efforts to defeat Afghanistan's Taliban regime, signs of moderation in Iran had stimulated the United States to try to engage Iran in official talks. Iran, still split between conservatives and reformers loyal to President Mohammad Khatemi, who was elected in May 1997 and overwhelmingly reelected on June 8, 2001, has not accepted to date. Recent reports of Iranian meddling in post-Taliban Afghanistan and Iran's intercepted January 2002 shipment of arms allegedly to the Palestinian Authority have reversed the warming trend. Iran was grouped with North Korea and Iraq as part of the ""axis of evil"" identified in President Bush's January 29, 2002 State of the Union message. President Bush has identified Iran's efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction and delivery means, coupled with its support of terrorist groups, as key U.S. concerns. Iran's ballistic missile program has made major strides over the past few years, with the help of several foreign suppliers, and its nuclear program is advancing with Russia's help. Iran has opposed the U.S.-led Middle East peace process since its inception in October 1991. It continues to provide material support to Hizballah in Lebanon and to Palestinian groups that oppose the Arab-Israeli peace process, such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. All Iranian factions have publicly supported Palestinian violence against Israel since September 2000.

In his January 29, 2002 State of the Union message, President Bush named Iran, along with Iraq and North Korea, as part of an ""axis of evil,"" constituting major potential threats to U.S. national security. The United States gave Iran $350,000 worth of humanitarian aid for victims of a June 22 earthquake.  BACKGROUND  AND  ANAL  YSIS  The power struggle in Iran between revolutionary purists and more moderate reformists colors Iran's domestic and foreign policies. President Mohammad Khatemi, who was reelected on June 8, 2001 by a landslide 77% of the vote against nine more conservative candidates, holds a popular mandate for greater domestic freedoms. His reelection victory was larger than his 69% first win in May 1997. His supporters hold about 70% of the seats in the 290-seat Majlis (parliament) following victories in the February 18, 2000 Majlis elections. However, Khatemi's reform program has been largely obstructed by hardliners, including Supreme Leader Ali Khamene'i (successor to Ayatollah Khomeini), who control key revolutionary institutions and other levers of power. The hardliners also have constrained Khatemi's efforts to moderate Iran's foreign policy. As part of a hardline backlash since April 2000, hardliners in the judiciary have closed more than 40 reformist newspapers and imprisoned or questioned several editors and even some members of the Majlis. In February 2002 testimony, DCI George Tenet said Iran's reform movement was ""losing momentum"" to the ""unelected"" hardliners, and Khatemi has publicly criticized hardline elements for slowing his reform attempts.  Iran's Strategic Buildup Iran is not considered a major conventional threat to the United States, but some of its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs, particularly medium range ballistic missiles, appear to be making significant progress and could put U.S. allies and installations at risk. For further information, see CRS Report RL30551, Iran: Arms and Technology Acquisitions.  Conventional Weapons Iran's armed forces total about 550,000 personnel, including both the regular military and the Revolutionary Guard, the latter of which is populated largely by hardliners. Low oil prices and high debts slowed Iran's defense acquisitions to about $300 million per year during 1996-1999, from over $1 billion per year in the early 1990s, although purchase levels appear to be rising again. According to U.S. military officials, equipment already purchased has given Iran the ability to block the Strait of Hormuz at least temporarily, but Iran is largely lacking in ability to project power far beyond its borders. In November 2000, Russia told the United States it would no longer abide by a 1995 pledge to refrain from new conventional arms deals with Iran. On October 2, 2001, Iran and Russia signed an agreement that CRS-1   IB93033  07-09-02  provides for $300 million per year in Iranian arms purchases over the next 5 years. Russia claims that the arms would be purely defensive, but the systems reportedly under consideration include new MiG-29 and Sukhoi combat aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as the S-300 air defense system (the Russian counterpart of the U.S. ""Patriot""). In May 2002, it was reported that Iran will buy new cruise-missile carrying patrol boats from China. See CRS Report RL31083, Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations, 1993-2000.  Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) It is partly because of Iran's attempts to acquire WMD that President Bush, in his January 29, 2002 State of the Union message, labeled Iran part of an ""axis of evil"" along with Iraq and North Korea. Iran's programs, particularly its missile program, continue to be assisted primarily by entities in Russia, China, and North Korea. In mid-May 2002, the Administration, under the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-178), sanctioned 9 companies and 3 persons in China, Armenia, and Moldova for alleged WMD technology (chemical weapons and missile-related) sales to Iran. (See also CRS Report RL30408, Weapons of Mass Destruction in the Middle East.) Chemical and Biological Weapons. U.S. proliferation reports state that Iran is seeking to acquire a self-sufficient chemical weapons infrastructure, that it may have some capability for biological weapons deployment, and that it has stockpiled chemical weapons, including blister, blood, and choking agents. On June 11, 2001, the Bush Administration imposed trade sanctions, in accordance with the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-178) on China's Jiangsu Yongli Chemicals and Technology Import and Export Corporation for allegedly selling Iran technology not permitted for export to Iran under the Chemical Weapons Convention. Two more Chinese entities (Liyang Chemical Equipment and China Machinery and Electric Equipment Import-Export Co.) and one individual (Q.C.Chen) were sanctioned under the Act in January 2002 for alleged export to Iran of chemical and biological technology. (These entities were again named in the May 2002 sanctioning discussed above.) This record raises questions about Iran's compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which Iran signed on January 13, 1993, and ratified on June 8, 1997. However, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), charged with monitoring the convention, has indicated general satisfaction with Iran's compliance thus far. OPCW toured Iran's declared chemical sites in February 1999, and Iran has made required declarations. Iran is a party to the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. Missiles. Largely with Russian help, Iran is making progress in its missile program. Two of its first three tests of the 800-mile range Shahab-3 (July 1998, July 2000, and September 2000) were either inconclusive or unsuccessful (the July 2000 test appears to have been a success), but Iran conducted an apparently successful test in late May 2002, and press reports say Iran might have deployed the Shahab-3 and produced 10 - 20 of them. Amid press reports that Iran might also be making progress on the 1,200 mile range Shahab-4, U.S. officials said in May 2002 that Iran's could be upgraded to reach countries in central Europe. An intelligence community official upgraded the missile threat from Iran, testifying on March 11, 2002, that the United States would ""most likely"" face an intercontinental ballistic missile threat from Iran by 2015. On June 11, 2001, the Bush Administration imposed trade sanctions on North Korean and Iranian entities under the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000 for alleged exports to Iran of missile technology. CIA statements in February 2002 cast CRS-2   IB93033  07-09-02  doubt that China is upholding a November 2000 pledge not to export missile technology to Iran or other countries. On February 22, 2002, the Washington Times reported that China had delivered HQ-7 surface-to-air missiles to Iran. Nuclear Weapons. DCI Tenet testified in February 2002 that Iran might be able to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon by late this decade, and sooner if it gets such material from outside. Russia, despite these U.S. concerns and protests, is proceeding with its January 1995 contract with Iran to complete a nuclear power plant at Bushehr, and the two countries have said it should be complete by the end of 2003 and operational by 2005. Russia says that the project envisages that all spent nuclear material produced by the plant would be returned to Russia and reprocessed there. Amid concerns among experts that the plant could help Iran produce fissile material for a nuclear weapon, Iran, perhaps fearing a U.S. air or missile strike to destroy the plant, has been surrounding it with anti-aircraft batteries (""Inside the Ring,"" Washington Times, May 10, 2002). In November 2001, Russia shipped to Iran the first reactor shell of the project. There have been inconclusive Iranian and Russian statements on whether Iran will commission Russia to build additional reactors. The February 2002 CIA report to Congress, covering January - June 2001, says that some Iran-China interactions raise questions about China's adherence to its pledge to refrain from new nuclear cooperation with Iran. Iran accepts International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards of its known nuclear facilities, and agency visits to Iran's declared facilities since 1992 have found no evidence at the sites visited to indicate Iran is developing nuclear weapons. Iran has refused to permit an enhanced IAEA inspections program (""93+2"") that would include surprise inspections to undeclared facilities, although some observers say Iran might accept the plan. Each year since FY1998, foreign aid laws have contained provisions cutting U.S. aid to the Russian government if it continues the Bushehr project or assists Iran's ballistic missile program. No waiver was provided for either in the FY1998 or the FY2000 legislation, although the cuts do not apply to nuclear dismantlement in Russia or aid to Russia's private sector. The foreign operations appropriations for both FY2001 (P.L. 106429) and FY2002 (conference report H.Rept. 107-345) contain a similar provision, but both increase the aid cut to 60%. The House version of the FY2002 foreign relations authorization bill, H.R. 1646, passed by the House on May 16, 2001, contains Title IX, the Iran Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 2001. Virtually identical to bills introduced in the 106th and 105th congresses, the provision would make the IAEA subject to cuts in U.S. voluntary contributions if it continued technical assistance to Iran's nuclear program.  Iranian Foreign Policy and Involvement in Terrorism Iran's continued support for terrorism contributed to President Bush's strong criticism of Iran in his State of the Union message. The State Department report on international terrorism for 2001, released May 21, 2002, again states, as it has for most of the past decade, that Iran ""remained the most active state sponsor of terrorism in 2001,"" although the report attributes the terrorist activity to two hardline institutions -- the Revolutionary Guard and the Intelligence Ministry. On the other hand, Iran strongly condemned the September 11 attacks and tacitly supported the U.S. war on the Taliban and Al Qaeda. (See also CRS Report RL31119, Terrorism: Near Eastern Groups and State Sponsors, 2002.)  CRS-3   IB93033  07-09-02  Persian Gulf Khatemi has largely succeeded in improving relations with Iran's neighbors, particularly the six states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC; Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates). Since he came into office, Iran apparently has reduced support for Shiite Muslim dissident movements in the Gulf states. See also CRS Report RL30728, Persian Gulf: Issues for U.S. Policy, 2000. Saudi Arabia/Khobar Towers/Gulf States. Iran and Saudi Arabia restored relations in December 1991 (after a 4 year break), and progressively higher level contacts have taken place since December 1997. In May 1999, Khatemi became the first senior Iranian leader to visit Saudi Arabia since the Islamic revolution. In April 2000, Saudi Arabia's number three leader, Prince Sultan, hosted a visit by Iran's Defense Minister. Supreme Leader Khamene'i has been invited to visit the Kingdom as well. In mid-April 2001, Saudi Arabia and Iran formally entered into an anti-crime security pact, suggesting that Saudi Arabia wishes to bury the issue of the June 25, 1996 Khobar Towers housing complex bombing, which killed 19 U.S. airmen. On June 21, 2001, a federal grand jury indicted 14 suspects, 13 Saudis and a Lebanese citizen, for the Khobar bombing. The indictment indicated that Iranian agents were likely involved, but no indictments of any Iranians were announced. In June 2002, it was reported that Saudi Arabia had sentenced some of the eleven suspects held there. In 2000, Iran entered into anti-crime security pacts with the other Gulf states of Kuwait and Oman. (See CRS Issue Brief IB93113, Saudi Arabia: Postwar Issues and U.S. Relations.) Gulf Islands Dispute With UAE. Relations between Iran and the UAE deteriorated sharply in April 1992, when Iran asserted complete control of the Persian Gulf island of Abu Musa, which it and the UAE shared under a 1971 bilateral agreement. (In 1971, Iran, then ruled by the U.S.-backed Shah, seized two other islands, Greater and Lesser Tunb, from the emirate of Ras al-Khaymah, which later became part of the UAE.) The UAE wants to refer the dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), but Iran insists on resolving the issue bilaterally. Several GCC states -- Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Oman -- have attempted to mediate and Iran-UAE talks did resume in July 2001, but there is no evidence of Iranian flexibility to date on the key issue of sovereignty. The United States, which is concerned about Iran's military improvements to the islands, generally supports UAE proposals but takes no position on sovereignty. Jane's Defence Weekly reported in March 2000 that Iran's military improvements were relatively minor. Iraq. A legacy of the 8-year long Iran-Iraq war (1980-1988) is deep lingering suspicion between Iran and Iraq, but the two have drawn closer in recent years. Since early 1998, the two have exchanged significant numbers of prisoners from the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. An October 2000 visit to Iraq by Iran's Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi resulted in apparent agreement to abide by the waterway-sharing and other provisions of their 1975 Algiers Accords, which Iraq had abrogated prior to its September 1980 invasion of Iran. In exchange for a share of the proceeds, Iran's maritime authorities sometimes cooperate with Iraq's illicit export of oil products through the Gulf. Iranian hardliners still give support to Shiite militants in southern Iraq (the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, SCIRI) trying to overthrow Iraq's regime, and Iran allowed the Iraqi National Congress (INC), Iraq's main opposition umbrella, to open an office in Tehran in 2001.  CRS-4   IB93033  07-09-02  Middle East Peace Process/North Africa Many of the allegations of Iran's support for terrorism center on its assistance to groups opposed to the Arab-Israeli peace process, primarily Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Hizballah, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. U.S. official terrorism reports state that, following the start of the September 2000 Palestinian uprising, Iran increased its support for terrorism by encouraging coordination among Palestinian terrorist groups. Iran also incites anti-Israel violence, including hosting conferences of anti-peace process organizations (April 24, 2001, and June 2-3, 2002). Khamene'i has continued to call Israel a ""cancerous tumor"" and he said in early November 2000 that the Palestinian-Israeli violence could end only if Israel were ""eradicated."" Khatemi has sometimes tried to moderate Iran's position somewhat, saying during his November 2001 visit to the United Nations that Iran would accept a final Israeli-Palestinian settlement acceptable to the Palestinians. At the same time, Khatemi has sought to avoid conflict with hardliners by pledging his support for anti-peace process groups. On the other hand, Iran has traditionally had few ties to the non-Islamist Palestinian organizations, including elements linked to the Palestinian Authority, that have conducted some of the day-to-day violence against Israel in the current uprising. It was therefore viewed as a new development when Israel and the United States asserted in early January 2002 that Iran was the source of a shipment, intercepted by Israel, of 50 tons of arms bought by the Palestinian Authority. About 150 Iranian Revolutionary Guards remain in Lebanon to coordinate Iranian arms deliveries to Hizballah, which are offloaded in Damascus and trucked into Lebanon. A New York Times report of January 12, 2002 said that, in the mid-1990s, Iran had transferred American-built Stinger anti-aircraft systems obtained in Afghanistan to Hizballah. Israel asserted in February 2002 that Iran had delivered 8,000 Katyusha rockets to Hizballah recently, but the Israeli claim could not be confirmed. The Washington Post reported on June 30, 2002 that Hizballah is cooperating with Al Qaeda on logistics and terrorist training, although some experts are skeptical that the two could bridge their differing goals. On the other hand, in mid-April 2002, Foreign Minister Kharrazi visited Lebanon and urged Hizballah to exercise restraint on the Israeli-Lebanese border at a time of heightened tensions between Israel and the Palestinians. Sudan. Sudan's close relations with Iran in the early 1990s contributed to Sudan's placement on the U.S. ""terrorism list"" on August 18, 1993. However, Sudan's alliance with Iran frayed in the mid 1990s as Sudan sought to burnish its international image.  Central and South Asia/Azerbaijan Iran's policy in Central Asia has thus far emphasized economic cooperation over Islamic ideology, although Iran has become increasingly assertive in its relations with Azerbaijan. In early 1992, Iran led the drive to bring the Central Asian states and Azerbaijan into the Economic Cooperation Organization (founded in 1985 by Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey, as a successor to an organization founded by those states in 1964). Iran is hoping to attract energy pipeline routes through it, rather than through other countries. However, Iran does host at least one anti-Azerbaijan guerrilla leader (Hasan Javadov), and it reportedly harbors leaders of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU). Some allegations surfaced in April CRS-5   IB93033  07-09-02  2002 that Iran is actively helping the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), an Al Qaeda ally, regroup after the war in Afghanistan. Tensions with Azerbaijan flared in late July 2001 over energy exploration rights in the Caspian; Iranian warships and combat aircraft intimidated an international oil firm (BP) on contract to Azerbaijan from continuing its work an area of the Caspian Iran considers its own. The United States called Iran's actions in the Caspian provocative, and it offered new border security aid and increased political support to Azerbaijan. Iran and Armenia, adversary of Azerbaijan, agreed on expanded defense cooperation in early March 2002. Tensions eased somewhat in conjunction with the mid-May 2002 visit of Azerbaijan's President Heydar Aliyev to Iran, although there was little evident progress on a bilateral division of their portions of the Caspian. Afghanistan/Pakistan. Iran long opposed the puritanical Sunni Muslim regime of the Taliban in Afghanistan on the grounds that it oppressed Shiite Muslim and other Persianspeaking minorities. Iran nearly launched a military attack against the Taliban in September 1998 after Taliban fighters captured and killed several Iranian diplomats based in northern Afghanistan. Subsequently, Iran provided military aid to the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance coalition, made up of mostly Persian-speaking minority groups. Iran -- along with the United States, Russia, and the countries bordering Afghanistan -- attended U.N.-sponsored meetings in New York (the Six Plus Two group) to try to end the internal conflict in Afghanistan. Iran and the United States also participated in a U.N.-sponsored group in Geneva, which also includes Italy and Germany. Tacitly aligned with the U.S. military campaign against the Taliban in Afghanistan, Iran pledged search and rescue assistance to the United States and pledged to allow U.S. humanitarian aid for the Afghan people to transit Iran en route to Afghanistan. U.S. officials initially called Iran's role in the anti-Taliban/Al Qaeda effort, including efforts to form a new government at the Bonn conference (ended in agreement December 5, 2001) ""constructive."" Some of Iran's activities in Afghanistan reflect official suspicion of the United States: Iran publicly opposed U.S. military retaliation for the September 11 attacks and refused to join a U.S.-led anti-terrorism coalition. Iran is said to fear the pro-U.S. tilt of the new government of Afghanistan and the waning of Iran's traditional sway in western, central, and northern Afghanistan where Persian-speaking Afghans predominate. There have been press reports and U.S. official statements since in January 2002 that Iran is harboring  or at least not aggressively moving to arrest  Al Qaeda fighters who have fled Afghanistan. Other reports say Iran is arming local Afghan strongmen including Herat governor Ismail Khan, Mazar-e-Sharif governor Abdul Rashid Dostam, and others, and President Bush has warned Iran not to seek to exert influence over the new government of Afghanistan. Apparently seeking to deflect the U.S. criticism, in March 2002 Iran reportedly expelled exiled Pashtun figure Gulbuddin Hikmatyar, an opponent of the new Afghan government. The expulsion followed a February 24, 2002 visit to Iran by Afghan interim leader Hamid Karzai in which the two countries agreed to cooperate broadly. (See CRS Report RL30588, Afghanistan: Current Issues and U.S. Policy Concerns.)  Former Yugoslavia On June 26, 1996, and again on May 5, 1997, President Clinton certified to Congress that Bosnia had expelled foreign forces and ended intelligence cooperation with Iran. The CRS-6   IB93033  07-09-02  certifications were required by P.L. 104-122, an FY1996 supplemental appropriation, and P.L. 104-208, the FY1997 foreign aid appropriation, in order to provide U.S. aid to Bosnia.  Human Rights Concerns U.S. and U.N. human rights reports cite Iran for widespread human rights abuses, (especially of the Baha'i faith), including assassinations and executions of regime opponents (Kurds, People's Mojahedin, and others) in Iran and abroad. These reports note that Khatemi's efforts to promote rule of law have met repeated challenges from hardliners. In April 2002, the U.N. Human Rights Commission narrowly voted not to investigate Iran's human rights record during 2002-3. Religious Persecution. On October 27, 2001, the State Department again named Iran as a ""Country of Particular Concern,"" under the International Religious Freedom Act. No sanctions were added, on the grounds that Iran is already subject to extensive U.S. sanctions. Religious persecution continues, especially against the Baha'i community, because Iran's Shiite Muslim clergy views the sect as heretical. Two Baha'is (Dhabihullah Mahrami and Musa Talibi) were sentenced to death in 1996 for apostasy. On July 21, 1998, Iran executed Ruhollah Ruhani, the first Bahai executed since 1992 (Bahman Samandari). The United States condemned the execution. In February 2000, Iran's Supreme Court set aside the death sentences against three Bahais, Sirus Zabihi-Moqaddam, Hedayat KashefiNajafabadi, and Manucher Khulusi. On April 21, 1999, the Clinton Administration expressed concern about the sentencing to prison of four Baha'is. Recent resolutions condemning Iran's treatment of the Baha'is, including S.Con.Res. 57, which passed the Senate July 19, 2000, and H.Con.Res. 257, which passed the House on September 19, 2000. Trial of 13 Jews. Although the 30,000 member Jewish community (the largest in the Middle East aside from Israel) enjoys more freedoms than Jewish communities in several other Muslim states, during 1993-1998 Iran executed five Jews allegedly spying for Israel. In June 1999, Iran confirmed that it had arrested 13 Jews -- teachers, shopkeepers, and butchers -- from the Shiraz area that it said were part of an ""espionage ring"" for Israel. After an April - June 2000 trial in which eight of the suspects ""confessed"" to the allegations, ten of the Jews and two Muslims accomplices were convicted (July 1, 2000) and received sentences ranging from 4 years to 13 years. Three Jews were acquitted. On September 21, 2000, a three-judge appeals panel reduced the sentences slightly, now ranging from 2 to 9 years. On February 8, 2001, Iran's Supreme Court rejected their appeals, allowing the revised sentences to stand. In March 2001, Iran released one of the Jews on the grounds that his sentence included time served; another was released on January 16, 2002. Several bills in the 106th Congress condemned the arrests and called for the release of the detainees and for linking U.S. relations with Iran to the trial's outcome; the Senate passed S.Con.Res. 39 (June 23, 1999) and S.Con.Res. 109 (May 4, 2000). In April 2001, a similar bill, H.Con.Res. 29, was introduced in the 107th Congress.  CRS-7   IB93033  07-09-02  U.S. Policy and Legislation The February 11, 1979 fall of the Shah of Iran, a key U.S. ally, opened a long rift in U.S.-Iranian relations. On November 4, 1979, radical ""students"" seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held its diplomats hostage until minutes after President Reagan's inauguration on January 20, 1981. The United States broke relations with Iran on April 7, 1980, and the two countries have had no official dialogue since. The exception was the abortive 1985-86 clandestine arms supply relationship with Iran in exchange for some American hostages held by Hizballah in Lebanon (the so-called ""Iran-Contra Affair""). Iran maintains an interests section in Washington (Embassy of Pakistan), staffed by Iranian permanent resident aliens or U.S. citizens of Iranian descent. The U.S. protecting power in Iran is Switzerland. Upon taking office in 1993, the Clinton Administration moved to further isolate Iran as part of a strategy of ""dual containment"" of Iran and Iraq. In 1995 and 1996, the Clinton Administration and Congress added sanctions on Iran in response to growing concerns about Iran's weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons acquisition programs, its support for terrorist groups, and its efforts to subvert the Arab-Israeli peace process. The election of Khatemi in May 1997 precipitated a shift in U.S. policy more toward engagement. The Administration offered Iran official dialogue, with no substantive preconditions. In January 1998, Khatemi publicly agreed only to increase ""people-to-people"" exchanges with the United States, ruling out official dialogue. In a June 17, 1998 speech, then Secretary of State Albright stepped up the U.S. outreach effort by calling for mutual confidence building measures that could lead to a ""road map"" for normalization of relations. Encouraged by the reformist victory in Iran's March 2000 parliamentary elections, Secretary Albright gave another speech on March 17, 2000, acknowledging past U.S. meddling in Iran, easing sanctions on some Iranian imports, and promising to work to resolve outstanding claims disputes. Iran welcomed the steps, but called them insufficient to warrant the beginning of a dialogue. In early September 2000 meetings at the United Nations in connection with the Millennium Summit, Secretary Albright and President Clinton sent a positive signal to Iran by attending Khatemi's speeches. Until early 2002, the Bush Administration appeared to be continuing the Clinton Administration efforts, in part by building on the cooperation between the two countries in Afghanistan. The Administration's November 13, 2001 continuation of the 1979 national emergency on Iran justified the emergency by saying that U.S. ""relations with Iran have not yet returned to normal,"" a far softer statement than previous justifications sighting a continued threat from Iran. Following a move by some Majlis deputies to call for reestablishing relations with the United States, Supreme Leader Khamene'i moved forcefully to squash talk of improved relations on October 30, 2001, when he threatened to fire Iranian officials who strive for that result. His statement came a few weeks after several Members of Congress had dinner in the Senate with Iran's U.N. representative. The gradual thaw in relations, which appeared to accelerate in the context of the Afghanistan crisis, appears to have stalled or reversed since January 2002. Allegations of Iran's sale of arms to the Palestinian Authority and reputed meddling in Afghanistan have caused the Administration and Congress to become more critical of Iran's intentions and actions. As noted above, President Bush named Iran as part of an ""axis of evil"" in his State of the Union message. The President and his aides stress that the United States would still CRS-8   IB93033  07-09-02  be willing to hold dialogue with Iran, although they imply that Iran's behavior would need to moderate as a condition for the dialogue. U.S. statements about possible ""preemptive action"" against rogue state WMD programs have apparently stoked Iranian fears of possible U.S. military action. Despite the tensions, in early 2002 Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Joseph Biden and the Chairman of the Middle East Subcommittee of the House International Relations Committee, Benjamin Gilman, called for U.S. efforts to promote civil society in Iran, in part to strengthen reformists' efforts. Apparently under pressure from Khamene'i, in late May 2002 Khatemi urged his reformist supporters in the Majles to abandon efforts to explore renewed relations with the United States. That had been the subject of recent closed-door meetings among reformist Majles members who want to end U.S.-Iran estrangement.  Economic Sanctions Since the November 4, 1979 seizure of the U.S. hostages in Tehran, economic sanctions have formed a major part of U.S. policy toward Iran. On November 14, 1979, President Carter declared a national emergency with respect to Iran, renewed every year since 1979. Terrorism/Foreign Aid. Following the October 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Lebanon, believed perpetrated by Iranian allies, Iran was added to the ""terrorism list"" in January 1984. The designation bans direct U.S. financial assistance and arms sales, restricts sales of U.S. dual use items, and requires the United States to oppose multilateral lending to the designated countries. Separate from its position on the terrorism list, successive foreign aid appropriations laws since the late 1980s ban direct assistance to Iran (loans, credits, insurance, Eximbank credits) and indirect assistance (U.S. contributions to international organizations that work in Iran). Section 307 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (added in 1985) names Iran as unable to benefit from U.S. contributions to international organizations, requiring proportionate cuts if these institutions work in Iran. Iran is also barred from sales of U.S. munitions list items because it has been designated every year since 1997 as not cooperating with U.S. anti-terrorism efforts, under the AntiTerrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (P.L. 104-132). That Act also penalizes countries that assist or sell arms to terrorism list countries, and another law (P.L. 99-500, the Defense Department Authorization Act of 1987) limits Defense Department contracts with companies controlled by terrorism list states ($100,000 contract limit). U.S. regulations do not bar disaster relief and the United States donated $125,000, through relief agencies, to help victims of two earthquakes in Iran (February and May 1997), and another $350,000 worth of aid to the victims of a June 22, 2002 earthquake. Proliferation Sanctions. Some of these sanctions are discussed above, and two laws are unique to Iran. The Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act (P.L. 102-484) requires denial of license applications for exports to Iran of dual use items, and imposes sanctions on foreign countries that transfer to Iran ""destabilizing numbers and types of conventional weapons,"" as well as WMD technology. The Iran Nonproliferation Act (P.L. 106-178) authorizes sanctions on foreign entities that assist Iran's WMD programs. It bans U.S. extraordinary payments to the Russian Aviation and Space Agency in connection with the international space station unless the President can certify that the agency or entities under the Agency's control had not transferred any WMD or missile-related technology to Iran within the year prior. The provision contains certain exceptions to ensure the safety of astronauts who will use the space station and for certain space station hardware. CRS-9   IB93033  07-09-02  Counternarcotics. In February 1987, Iran was first designated as a state that failed to cooperate with U.S. anti-drug efforts or take adequate steps to control narcotics production or trafficking. U.S. and U.N. Drug Control Program (UNDCP) assessments of drug production in Iran prompted the Clinton Administration, on December 7, 1998, to remove Iran from the U.S. list of major drug producing countries. The decision exempts Iran from the annual certification process that kept drug-related U.S. sanctions in place on Iran. Britain reportedly has sold Iran small arms for its anti-drug efforts on the Afghan border. Trade Ban. On May 6, 1995, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12959 banning U.S. trade and investment in Iran, including the trading of Iranian oil overseas by U.S. companies. This followed an earlier March 1995 executive order barring U.S. investment in Iran's energy sector, and, although modified, has been extended each year since. On March 13, 2001, President Bush renewed the declaration of a state of emergency that triggered the March 1995 investment ban. An August 1997 amendment to the trade ban (Executive Order 13059) prevented U.S. companies from knowingly exporting goods to a third country for incorporation into products destined for Iran. The trade ban was partly intended to blunt criticism that U.S. trade with Iran made U.S. appeals for multilateral containment of Iran less credible. Some goods related to the safe operation of civilian aircraft can be licensed for export to Iran, and in December 1999, the Clinton Administration allowed the repair of engine mountings on seven Iran Air 747's (Boeing). Implementing regulations do not permit U.S. firms to negotiate investment deals with Iran. Following a 1998 application by a U.S. firm to sell Iran agricultural products, and in the context of Clinton Administration and congressional reviews of U.S. unilateral sanctions policies, the Clinton Administration announced in April 1999 that it would license, on a case-by-case basis, commercial sales of food and medical products to certain countries on which unilateral U.S. trade bans are in place (Iran, Libya, and Sudan). Under regulations issued in July 1999, private letters of credit can be used to finance approved sales, but no U.S. government credit guarantees were made available and U.S. exporters were not permitted to deal directly with Iranian banks. Iran says the lack of credit makes U.S. sales, particularly of wheat, uncompetitive. The FY2001 agriculture appropriations (P.L. 106-387), contains a provision banning the use of official credit guarantees for food and medical sales to Iran and other countries on the U.S. terrorism list, except Cuba, although allowing for a presidential waiver to permit such credit guarantees. (In the 107th Congress, S.171, introduced January 24, 2001, would repeal this provision.) The Clinton Administration did not provide credit guarantees, and the Bush Administration has not done so either. In her March 17, 2000 speech, then Secretary Albright announced an easing of the trade ban to allow U.S. importation of Iranian nuts, dried fruits, carpets, and caviar; regulations governing the imports were issued in April 2000. The United States was the largest market for Iranian carpets before the 1979 revolution, although U.S. anti-dumping tariffs imposed on Iranian pistachio nut imports in 1986 (about 300%) and still in effect are dampening imports of that product. Iranian caviar and carpets are now sold in the United States; the Iranian carpet market could eventually reach an estimated $100 million per year. The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA). The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA, H.R. 3107, P.L. 104-172, signed August 5, 1996), a law that sanctions foreign investment in Iran or Libya's energy sector, was to expire on August 5, 2001. H.R. 1954, which renewed ILSA for five years but requires an Administration report on its effectiveness within 24-30 months, CRS-10   IB93033  07-09-02  was passed by large majorities in both chambers in July 2001. It was signed on August 3, 2001 (P.L. 107-24). In testimony before the House International Relations Committee on June 20, 2002, a senior State Department official said that the Bush Administration probably would waive sanctions on European companies that invest in Iran, in exchange for European assistance in curbing Iran's WMD programs and terrorism. The statement was a response to calls in Congress (H.Res.434) to sanction Canadian oil company Sheer Energy, which, in May 2002, announced an $80 million contract to develop an Iranian oil field. See CRS Report RS20871, The Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA). Caspian/Central Asian Energy Routes Through Iran. The U.S. trade ban permits U.S. companies to apply for licenses to conduct ""swaps"" of Caspian Sea oil with Iran, but, as part of a U.S. policy to route Central Asian energy around Iran (and Russia), a Mobil Corporation application to do so was denied in April 1999. The Administration continues to oppose, and to threaten imposing ILSA sanctions on, pipeline projects that route Caspian/Central Asian energy through Iran. U.S. policy has been to strongly favor construction of a pipeline that would cross the Caspian Sea and let out in Ceyhan, Turkey (Baku-Ceyhan pipeline), avoiding Iran or Russia. Four Caspian nations (Turkey, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan) signed an agreement embracing Baku-Ceyhan on November 18, 1999, and regional and corporate support for the project has gained momentum to the point where pipeline construction might soon begin. Kazakhstan nonetheless is pushing for construction of an oil pipeline across Iran. Despite U.S. pressure not to import Iranian gas, Turkey has begun to do so through a new cross-border pipeline, under an August 1996 agreement. (See CRS Report 98-86, Iran: Relations With Key Central Asian States.) European and Japanese Relations With/Lending to Iran. U.S.-allied differences on Iran narrowed since 1998 in concert with the Clinton Administration's attempt to engage Iran, a policy consistently favored by the European countries as a way to moderate Iran's behavior. During 1992-1997, the European Union (EU) countries maintained a policy of ""critical dialogue"" with Iran. The United States did not oppose those talks but maintained that the EU's dialogue would not change Iranian behavior. The dialogue was suspended immediately following the April 1997 German terrorism trial that found high-level Iranian involvement in assassinating Iranian dissidents in Germany. Alongside the post-1997 U.S. shift toward engagement, the EU-Iran dialogue formally resumed in May 1998. Since then, Khatemi has undertaken state visits to several Western countries, including Italy (March 1999), France (October 1999), Germany (July 2000), and Japan (November 2000). The United States publicly welcomed these visits. The resolution of the ""Rushdie affair"" to Britain's satisfaction sparked improvement in its relations with Iran. Iran maintains that Ayatollah Khomeini's 1989 death sentence against author Salman Rushdie cannot be revoked (his ""Satanic Verses"" novel was labeled blasphemous) because Khomeini is no longer alive to revoke it. However, on September 24, 1998, Iran's Foreign Minister pledged to Britain that Iran will not seek to implement the sentence and opposes any bounties offered for his death. Britain then upgraded relations with Iran to the ambassadorial level, and Foreign Ministers of the two countries have exchanged several visits. In October 2000, Britain began extending longer term credit (two years or greater) for exports to Iran. Some Iranian clerics (outside the formal government structure) have said the death sentence stands, and the Iranian government has not required the Fifteen Khordad foundation to withdraw its $2.8 million reward for Rushdie's death. Khatemi said on June 4, 2001 that he considers the issue closed. CRS-11   IB93033  07-09-02  In August 1999, Japan continued a gradual improvement in relations with Iran by announcing a resumption of Japan's official development lending program for Iran to construct a hydroelectric dam over the Karun River. However, the $70 million increment announced was less that Iran had wanted, and Japan said that this tranche would close out Japan's involvement in the project. (In 1993, Japan provided the first $400 million tranche of the overall $1.4 billion official development loan program, but the lending was subsequently placed on hold as the United States sought to persuade its allies to pressure Iran.) In late January 2000, Japan agreed to resume medium- and long-term export credit insurance for exports to Iran, suspended since 1994. Economic relations improved further during Khatemi's November 2000 visit to Tokyo, which resulted in Iran's granting Japanese firms the first right to negotiate to develop the large Azadegan field, and Iran and a Japaneseled consortium are moving forward with preliminary studies of the field. Some press reports suggest that Royal Dutch/Shell might join the Azadegan project, apparently because it can provide needed technology. In exchange, Japan agreed to prepay Iran $1 billion per year for the next 3 years for Iranian oil. Partly at U.S. urging, Japan refused to extend to Iran additional official loans. During 1994-1995, and over U.S. objections at the time, Iran's European and Japanese creditors rescheduled about $16 billion in Iranian debt. These countries (governments and private creditors) rescheduled the debt bilaterally, in spite of Paris Club rules that call for multilateral rescheduling and International Monetary Fund (IMF) involvement. Iran has worked its external debt down from $32 billion in 1997 to about $20 billion as of March 2002, according to Iran's Central Bank. The improved debt picture has led most European export credit agencies, including Germany's Hermes, France's COFACE, and that of Spain, to restore insurance cover for exports to Iran. In early September 2001, Iran and the EU met to discuss a possible trade pact that would lower the tariffs or increase quotas for Iranian exports to the EU countries, and the EU decided in mid-June 2002 to move toward formal negotiations on that pact. In August 2001, Iran announced it would tap international capital markets for the first time since the Islamic revolution by issuing a $280 million Eurobond. In July 2002, Iran offered $492 million in bonds, which attracted interest from European banks. However, at the urging of the U.S. government, Moody's stopped its credit ratings service for Iran's government bonds in May 2002 on the grounds that performing the credit ratings service might violate the U.S. trade ban. Multilateral Lending to Iran. Section 1621 of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-132) amended the Foreign Assistance Act to require the United States to vote against international loans to countries on the U.S. terrorism list. Acting under provisions of successive foreign aid laws, in 1993 the United States voted its 16.5% share of the World Bank against loans to Iran of $460 million for electricity, health, and irrigation projects. To signal opposition to international lending to Iran, the FY1994 foreign aid appropriations act (P.L. 103-87) cut the Administration's request for the U.S. contribution to the World Bank by the amount of those loans. That law, the FY1995 foreign aid appropriation (P.L. 103-326), and the FY1996 foreign aid appropriations (P.L. 104-107), would have significantly reduced U.S. payments to the Bank if it had provided new loans to Iran. The legislation contributed to the Bank's refusal to approve any new lending to since then. By 1999, Iran's moderating image had led the World Bank to consider new loans.  CRS-12   IB93033  07-09-02  In May 2000, the United States was unsuccessful in obtaining further delay on a vote on new lending for Iran, and its allies outvoted the United States to approve $232 million in loans for health and sewage projects. Twenty one of the Bank's twenty four governors voted in favor, and France and Canada abstained. Earlier, Iran also had asked the International Monetary Fund for about $400 million in loans (its quota is about $2 billion) to help it deal with its trade financing shortfalls. However, Iran balked at accepting IMF conditionality, and there was no agreement. Despite the required U.S. opposition, on May 10, 2001, the World Bank's executive directors voted to approve a two-year economic reform plan for Iran that envisions $775 million in new Bank loans. Voting on the loans is expected later in 2002. WTO. The Bush Administration has opposed Iran's membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO), although it says that position is ""under review."" In May, July, and October 2001, the WTO, at U.S. urging, postponed a discussion on whether to launch entry talks with Iran. Travel Sanctions. Use of U.S. passports for travel to Iran is permitted, but a State Department travel warning, softened somewhat in April 1998, asks that Americans ""defer"" travel to Iran. Iranians entering the United States are required to be fingerprinted, although the Clinton Administration had promised to eliminate the practice for Iranian visitors. Assets Disputes/Victims of Terrorism. Iran claims that the United States has frozen vast amounts of Iranian assets, presenting an obstacle to improved relations. A U.S.Iran Claims Tribunal, at the Hague, is arbitrating cases resulting from the break in relations following the Iranian revolution. The major cases yet to be decided center on hundreds of Foreign Military Sales cases between the United States and the Shah's regime, which Iran claims it paid for but were unfulfilled. About $400 million in proceeds from the resale of that equipment is in a DOD account. In April 2000, then Secretary Albright named a representative to negotiate a resolution of the claims issue at the Hague. The assets issue moved to the forefront following several U.S. court judgements against Iran for past acts of terrorism against Americans, filed under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. Since March 1998, U.S. courts have awarded the following: $247 million to the family of Alisa Flatow, killed in Israel in April 1995 in a bombing by Palestinian Islamic Jihad (awarded in March 1998); $65 million to three Americans held hostage in Lebanon - David Jacobsen, Joseph Cicippio, and Frank Reed (August 1998); $324 for Lebanon hostage Terry Anderson (March 2000); $327 million to the families of two Americans killed in a February 1996 Hamas bombing (July 2000); and $355 million to the family of Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, killed by Hizballah in 1989 (September 2000). Former Lebanon hostage Thomas Sutherland won a $353 million judgement against Iran on June 26, 2001. In August 2001, the family of former Lebanon hostage father Lawrence Jenco won a $314.6 million judgment against Iran for his captivity. In June 2001, former hostages Benjamin Weir and Frank Regier sued Iran for over $100 million for their captivity in Lebanon. Also in early June 2001, the family of former hostage Peter Kilburn, who was killed in the course of his captivity in Lebanon, filed a suit against both Libya and Iran for more than $200 million. In October 2001, victims of the October 1982 Hizballah bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut filed a $5 billion suit against Iran. On January 23, 2002, a federal judge ordered Iran to pay $42 million to the family of Charles Hegna, who was beaten CRS-13   IB93033  07-09-02  in the course of a 1984 Hizballah hijacking of Kuwait Air 221. On February 6, 2002, a federal judge awarded $56 million to the family of Ira Weinstein, killed in a 1996 Hamas bus bombing in Israel. On the basis of the sanctity of diplomatic property, the Clinton Administration blocked efforts by the claimants to satisfy their judgments from frozen Iranian assets  diplomatic property in Washington (worth about $22 million) or the DOD account mentioned above. In December 1999, the Clinton Administration also blocked a Flatow effort to seize a $6 million U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal judgement awarded to Iran. A provision of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (H.R. 3244, P.L. 106-386) provides for the use of general revenues to pay 110% of compensatory damage awards to the above and future successful claimants in a total not to exceed the rental proceeds from Iran's diplomatic property and the DOD account. (The tenant of the Iranian Embassy building was evicted for non-payment of rent in March 2002, with rent of about $750,000 overdue.) The provision requires the President to try to recoup the expended funds from Iran as part of an overall reconciliation in relations and assets settlement, although there is no requirement that funds ultimately be withheld from Iran. A provision of the FY2002 Commerce, Justice, State appropriation (P.L. 107-77) requires an Administration legislative proposal on how to compensate successful U.S. claimants in future terrorism-related judgments against Iran. In April 2002, a federal judge ruled that Iran, under the Algiers Accords, had immunity from a lawsuit by the 52 Americans held hostage by Iran for 444 days. With regard to the 52 American hostages, the conference report on the FY2002 defense appropriation (P.L. 107117, H.Rept.107-350) states that the hostages should be able to collect damages from Iranian assets, notwithstanding U.S.-Iran agreements on the disposition of Iran's assets. Regarding the mistaken U.S. shootdown on July 3,1988 of an Iranian Airbus passenger jet, on February 22, 1996, the United States, responding to an Iranian case before the International Court of Justice (ICJ), agreed to pay Iran up to $61.8 million in compensation ($300,000 per wage earning victim, $150,000 per non wage earner) for the 248 Iranians killed in the shootdown. The funds for this settlement came from a general appropriation for judgments against the United States. The United States previously paid $3 million in death benefits for 47 non-Iranians killed in the attack, but has not compensated Iran for the airplane itself. A different case, pending before the ICJ, involves an Iranian claim for damages to Iranian oil platforms during U.S. naval clashes with Iran in October 1987 and April 1988.  Military Containment U.S. policy has focused on containing the military threat posed by Iran to the United States, U.S. allies in the Persian Gulf, and international shipping. Although containing Iraq has been the primary goal of U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf region since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, U.S. military officials note that U.S. forces could potentially be used against Iran, if the President so decides. U.S. military officers note that their encounters with Iranian naval vessels in the Gulf have been more professional since Khatemi took office.  Iran's Opposition Movements On February 8, 1995, then House Speaker Newt Gingrich said that a U.S. policy supporting the overthrow of Iran's regime was the only policy that made sense. The Administration accepted a House-Senate conference agreement to include $18-$20 million CRS-14   IB93033  07-09-02  in funding authority for covert operations against Iran in the FY1996 intelligence authorization act (H.R. 1655, P.L. 104-93) -- about $14 million more than requested -- according to a Washington Post report of December 22, 1995. The Clinton Administration reportedly succeeded in focusing the covert aid on changing the regime's behavior, rather than its overthrow. The conference report on H.R. 2267 (H.Rept. 105-405), the FY1998 Commerce/State/ Justice appropriation, provided $4 million for a ""Radio Free Iran,"" to be run by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). The radio, which the Administration is calling the Farsi service of RFE/RL, began operations in Prague on October 31, 1998. Another $4 million for the radio for FY1999 was provided by the omnibus appropriation (H.R. 4328, P.L. 105-277). (See CRS Report 98-539, Radio Free Iraq and Radio Free Iran: Background, Legislation, and Policy Issues for Congress.) Since the late 1980s, the State Department has refused contact with the anti-regime People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI) and its umbrella organization, the National Council of Resistance (NCR). It was designated as a foreign terrorist organization in October 1997 under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. For further information on this group, see CRS Report RL31119, Terrorism: Near Eastern Groups and State Sponsors, 2002. Some Iranian exiles follow the son of the late former Shah, who lives in the United States. On January 24, 2001, the Shah's son, Reza Pahlavi, 40 years old, ended a long period of inactivity by giving a speech in Washington calling for unity in opposition to the current regime and for the institution of a constitutional monarchy and genuine democracy in Iran. He has since broadcast messages into Iran from a station in California, and press reports say a growing number of Iranians are listening to his broadcasts.  CRS-15"

Burke Chair in Strategy Center for Strategic and International Studies October 28, 2003   Cordesman: Iranian Security Threats  28-10-2003  Page 2  Iran presents one of the most complex security problems the US faces in dealing with the threat posed by proliferation, in securing world energy supplies and the global economy, and in bringing stability to the Middle East and the Gulf region. Iran is located in an area with more than 60% of the world's proven conventional oil reserves and some 35% of its gas. It has borders on two nations where the US is still at war: Iraq and Afghanistan. Iran is a major proliferator. It plays an indirect role in the Israel-Palestinian conflict. It has carried out direct terrorist activities in the past, and it tolerates and supports terrorist movements today. At the same time, Iran offers opportunities as well as a threat. Political change is taking place, some forms of informal dialogue have been possible, Iran has moderated some of its actions, and the US has been more able to work out at least a partial modus vivendi in dealing with some aspects of the problems posed by Afghanistan and Iraq. Moreover, the US cannot divorce its treatment of Iran from its overall strategic posture in the region and the world. The US war in Iraq is still underway, and it is not a popular conflict. The US lacks the military resources for a major intervention in Iran, and limited strikes might do as much to encourage Iranian proliferation and support of terrorism as discourage it. While the EU has been more supportive recently in pressuring Iran over proliferation, the US lacks allies in its present approach to Iran at a time when it has more overall tensions with its traditional allies than at any time since the war in Vietnam. The Range of Possible Iranian Threats The US faces a wide range of policy challenges in dealing with the security threats posed by Iran. Nuclear proliferation is only one of these challenges, and the US cannot afford to look at only one problem and ignore the others. In brief, the challenges the US must deal with may be summarized as follows:  The US faces a wide range of potential threats in terms of proliferation. Iran has admitted it has chemical weapons and is testing ballistic missiles. It may well be developing biological weapons and cruise missiles. The unclassified reporting by the US intelligence community on Iranian developments is necessarily limited, and does not address many of the most recent issues affecting Iran's nuclear   Cordesman: Iranian Security Threats  28-10-2003  Page 3  program, but a recent CIA report describes the range of Iranian activities as follows: Nuclear. Despite Iran's status in the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the United States remains convinced Tehran is pursuing a nuclear weapons program. To bolster its efforts to establish domestic nuclear fuel-cycle capabilities, Iran has technology that also can support fissile material production for Tehran's overall nuclear weapons program. Iran has continued to attempt using its civilian nuclear energy program to justify its efforts to establish domestically or otherwise acquire assorted nuclear fuel-cycle capabilities. Such capabilities, however, are well suited to support fissile material production for a weapons program, and we believe it is this objective that drives Iran's efforts to acquire relevant facilities. We suspect that Tehran is interested in acquiring foreign fissile material and technology for weapons development as part of its overall nuclear weapons program. Despite Bushehr being put under IAEA safeguards, Russia's provision of expertise and manufacturing assistance has helped Iran to develop its own nuclear technology infrastructure. In addition, facing economic pressures, some Russian entities have shown a willingness to provide assistance to other nuclear projects within Iran. For example, an institute subordinate to the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy (MINATOM) had agreed to deliver in late 2000 equipment that was clearly intended for atomic vapor laser isotope separation, a technology capable of producing weapons-grade uranium. As a result of US protests, the Russian Government has halted the delivery of some of this equipment to Iran. Chinese entities are continuing work on a zirconium production facility at Esfahan that will enable Iran to produce cladding for reactor fuel. As an adherent to the NPT, Iran is required to accept IAEA safeguards on its nuclear material. The IAEA's Additional Protocol requires states to declare production of zirconium fuel cladding and gives the IAEA the right of access to resolve questions or inconsistencies related to the declarations, but Iran has made no moves to bring the Additional Protocol into force. Moreover, Iran remains the only NPT adherent with a full-scope safeguards agreement that has not adopted a subsidiary agreement obligating early declaration of nuclear facilities. Zirconium production, other than production of fuel cladding, is not subject to declaration or inspection. Missiles. Ballistic missile-related cooperation from entities in the former Soviet Union, North Korea, and China over the years has helped Iran move toward its goal of becoming self-sufficient in the production of ballistic missiles. Such assistance during the reporting period continued to include equipment, technology, and expertise. Iran, already producing Scud short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs), is in the late stages of developing the Shahab-3 medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM). In addition, Iran publicly has acknowledged the development of follow-on versions of the Shahab-3. It originally said that another version, the Shahab-4, is a more capable ballistic missile than its predecessor but later characterized it as solely a space launch vehicle with no military applications. Iran's Defense Minister has also publicly mentioned a ""Shahab-5."" Such statements strongly suggest that Tehran intends to develop a longer-range ballistic missile capability. Chemical. Iran is a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). Nevertheless, during the reporting period it continued to seek chemicals, production technology, training, and expertise from Chinese entities that could further Tehran's efforts at achieving an indigenous capability to produce nerve agents. Iran already has stockpiled blister, blood, and choking agents--and the bombs and artillery shells to deliver them-- which it previously has manufactured. It probably also has made some nerve agents.   Cordesman: Iranian Security Threats  28-10-2003  Page 4  Biological. Even though Iran is part of the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), Tehran probably maintains an offensive BW program. Foreign dual-use biotechnical materials, equipment, and expertise--primarily, but not exclusively, from Eastern Europe--continued to feature prominently in Iran's procurement efforts. While such materials do have legitimate uses, Iran's biological warfare (BW) program also could benefit from them. It is likely that Iran has capabilities to produce small quantities of BW agents, but has a limited ability to weaponize them. Advanced Conventional Weapons. Iran continued to seek and acquire conventional weapons and production technologies, primarily from Russia, China, and North Korea. Since Russia announced in November 2000 that it was abrogating the GoreChernomyrdin Agreement, the Russian and Iranian Governments and firms have engaged in high-level discussions on a wide variety of military services and equipment -- including air defense, naval, air and ground weapons, and technologies. In October 2001, Tehran and Moscow signed a new military-technical cooperation agreement, which laid the groundwork for negotiations and created a commission for future arms sales, but did not itself include sales contracts. Contract negotiations, which may take years to complete, continued in the following months and at least one sale--apparently for helicopters--was concluded. Various Russian officials and academicians have suggested that sales under this new agreement could, in the next few years, make Iran Russia's third-largest arms customer, after China and India. Until that agreement is concluded, Russia will continue to deliver on existing contracts. Estimates of conventional arms sales to Iran of $300 million per year would put Iran's share of Russian sales worldwide at roughly 10 percent, compared to more than 50 percent going to China and India. To facilitate new arms agreements, Russian oil enterprises entered an agreement with the Russian state arms trading firm Rosoboronexport to promote arms exports. Russian and Iranian arms dealers are to include such firms as Lukoil to coordinate ""commercial conditions"" and participate in projects proposed by the customer. Outside the Russian market, Iran's search for conventional weapons is global. In particular, Iran capitalized on the specialized weapons services and lower prices that China and North Korea offered. Elsewhere, Iran sought out products, particularly weapons components and dual-use items, that are superior in quality to those available from Russia or that have proven difficult to acquire through normal government channels.    The US cannot afford to focus on one form of proliferation. Iran can pursue a wide range of proliferation strategies, and this includes different approaches to nuclear weapons development. Iran could, for example, give up any efforts to produce fissile material using reactors and known centrifuge facilities, while concentrating on covert research and development of weapons, compact or ""folded"" high capacity centrifuges, laser isotope separation, and warheads. It could build more reactors as part of a ""peaceful power generating"" programs, appearing to conform to IAEA standards but preparing for the day it was no longer dependent on imports and could use its own fuel cycle. The recent IAEA reporting on Iran leaves major questions unanswered regarding Iran's fuel cycle   Cordesman: Iranian Security Threats  28-10-2003  Page 5  efforts, but also regarding its research and development programs in both laser isotope separation and centrifuge technology.  Iran can wage a number of forms of asymmetric warfare against the US and its allies without ever being at war in any overt sense. It can support hard-line and extremist elements in Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Gaza, and the West Bank using proxies to attack US interests without ever directly conducting acts of terrorism. Here, Iran can also use organizations as proxies that have a civil role or which cannot be identified solely as terrorist groups. These include the Hezbollah, Shi'ite movements in Afghanistan and Iraq, and Islamic charities or political causes that fund or act as covers for extremist groups. It can create ambiguous sanctuaries and operating/training areas in Iran for organizations like Al Qaida or simply turn a blind eye to low-level activities that are difficult to detect or prove. Iran can use more direct forms of terrorism, as it may well have done in supporting the attack on the USAF barracks at Al Khobar. The most recent State Department report on terrorism describes Iran's role as follows, and this report was issued before the full scale of Iran's relations to Al Qaida and support of Hamas and the PIJ became a major issue: Iran remained the most active state sponsor of terrorism in 2002. Its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Ministry of Intelligence and Security were involved in the planning of and support for terrorist acts and continued to exhort a variety of groups that use terrorism to pursue their goals. Iran's record against al-Qaida has been mixed. While it has detained and turned over to foreign governments a number of al-Qaida members, other al-Qaida members have found virtual safehaven there and may even be receiving protection from elements of the Iranian Government. Iran's long, rugged borders are difficult to monitor, and the large number of Afghan refugees in Iran complicates efforts to locate and apprehend extremists. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that al-Qaida elements could escape the attention of Iran's formidable security services. During 2002, Iran maintained a high-profile role in encouraging anti-Israeli activity, both rhetorically and operationally. Supreme Leader Khamenei referred to Israel as a ""cancerous tumor,"" a sentiment echoed by other Iranian leaders in speeches and sermons. Matching this rhetoric with action, Iran provided Lebanese Hizballah and Palestinian rejectionist groups--notably HAMAS, the Palestine Islamic Jihad, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command--with funding, safehaven, training, and weapons. Tehran also encouraged Hizballah and the Palestinian rejectionist groups to coordinate their planning and to escalate their terrorist activities against Israel. Iran also provided support to extremist groups in Central Asia, Afghanistan, and Iraq with ties to al-Qaida, though less than that provided to the groups opposed to Israel.   Cordesman: Iranian Security Threats  28-10-2003  Page 6  Iran can use the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a proxy war to gain support from Arab nations, and put pressure upon the US and Israel.  Iran lacks modern conventional forces, and is modernizing at a slow rate compared to most Gulf and Middle Eastern countries, but its conventional warfighting capabilities cannot be dismissed. It did sign some $1.7 billion worth of new arms agreements during 1995-1998, and $1,000 billion worth during 1999-2002  primarily with Russia, China, and Europe, and signed $200 million worth of new agreements in 2002. It took delivery on $2.1 billion worth of arms during 1995-1998, and $700 million worth during 1999-2002. Iran has some 513,000 men in its armed forces, some 325,000 in its army, 125,000 in its Revolutionary Guards Corps, 18,000 in its navy, and 45,000 in its air force plus some 40,000 paramilitary forces and 300,000 in its Basij or Popular Mobilization Army. These forces include some 1,600 tanks, 1,500 other armored vehicles, 3,400 artillery weapons, and 283 combat aircraft  roughly 180-200 of which are operational. It has no modern tanks, combat aircraft, or surface-to-air missiles, but it can certainly pose a far better organized and more popular resistance to any US or other outside military attack than Iraq, and its conventional forces will improve with time.  Iran lacks any modern surface ships but geography gives Iran a strategic position that commands the tanker routes through the lower Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait is the world's most important oil chokepoint. Some 13.6 million bbl/d or so of oil transit the Strait of Hormuz each day and go east to Asia (especially Japan, China, and India) and west via the Suez Canal, the Sumed pipeline, or around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa to Western Europe and the United States. Moreover, the EIA reference case indicates that exports through the Strait must nearly double by 2020, reaching around 42 MMBD. This implies that up to three times more tankers will transit the Strait in 2020 than at present. Alternative routes cannot move anything close to current export levels, much less the much higher production levels forecast by DOE.   Cordesman: Iranian Security Threats  28-10-2003  Page 7  At its narrowest, the Strait consists of 2-mile wide channels for inbound and outbound tanker within the Omani side of the Strait, and a 2-mile wide buffer zone. The exits on both sides of the Strait are close to Iranian waters and air space. Iran and the UAE have also long quarreled over sovereignty over three islands on the Western side of the Strait that are near the main tanker channels. These islands include Abu Musa, Greater Tunb Island, and Lesser Tunb Island, Reports that Iran had fortified the islands seem to be untrue, but Iran has steadily increased its numbers of smart mines. It has bought three relatively modern Kilo-class conventional submarines with long-range torpedoes and minelaying capability from Russia. It has bought anti-ship missile equipped patrol boats from China, has land based anti-ship missiles, and can deliver such missiles from aircraft, including maritime patrol aircraft and long range fighters. Over time, it can steadily improve its capability to threaten Gulf oil traffic, and while the US can certainly defeat Iran in any open attack on such traffic, Iran's ability to intimidate its neighbors, disrupt such traffic, or conduct low level raids give it the ability to conduct asymmetric wars of intimidation as well as actual military operations.  Iran has large asymmetric forces in its Revolutionary Guards Corps, including some 20,000 men in the IRGC naval branch. These can do more than attack Gulf shipping. South Gulf states have vulnerable offshore oil and gas facilities, highly vulnerable oil and gas loading facilities on their Gulf coasts, and have become totally dependent on large-scale coastal desalination plants for water. Once again, threats and ""wars of intimidation"" can substitute for overt military action.  Finally, Iran can put pressure on the Southern Gulf and other states by funding, training, and arming Shi'ite groups in nations like Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, by disrupting the pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, and by funding local liberation and religious groups that are not Shi'ite but are hostile to such states. These are not theoretical options. It has carried out all of these activities at some point since the Iranian revolution in 1979, and while it has chosen improved diplomatic relations since the death of Khomeini, it can resume such actions at short notice.   Cordesman: Iranian Security Threats  28-10-2003  Page 8  An Unstable and Conflicted Iran The US cannot afford to ignore these potential threats. At the same time, it also cannot afford to ignore the fact that Iran is a deeply conflicted nation and one where no one can now predict whether it will evolve towards moderation, move towards overt civil conflict, or come under the control of its extremists and hardliners. Iran is a partial democracy, but one where its religious leaders and hardliners control the choice of all candidates, can veto any action by the President or Majlis, and have control over much of the media, the justice system, the military and security forces, and intelligence. The balance of power between reformer and hardliner is so close that many Iranian officials that would like both to focus on national development, and create a more moderate state that has improved relations with the US, fear that clashes with the hardliners could lead to open conflict. Many have already been arrested and imprisoned for such views, as have many Iranian religious leaders, citizens, and students. It is clear that the Iranian people want a more moderate government, and many  probably most  are potentially friendly to the US. At the same time, it is a proud and highly nationalistic nation and one that has memories of a US role in the coup that destroyed a previous secular Iranian democracy and brought back the Shah. If the US has memories of a long hostage crises and Iranian terrorism, Iran has memories of long periods of imperialism and US interference in Iranian affairs. This situation is complicated by the fact that the outside opposition does have elements that support true democracy, but also consists of a largely ludicrous effort to restore the monarchy and one of the most vicious terrorists movements in the world: Mujahedin-e Khalq Organization (MEK or MKO). This organization is designated as a terrorist organization and is known under other several other names, some of which lobby the US Congress: The National Liberation Army of Iran (NLA, the militant wing of the MEK), the People's Mujahedin of Iran (PMOI), National Council of Resistance (NCR), the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), Muslim Iranian Student's Society (front organization used to garner financial support) The MEK claims to be democratic in the West, but its actual structure mixes the cult of personality with political beliefs that y mixes Marxism and Islam. It was formed in the   Cordesman: Iranian Security Threats  28-10-2003  Page 9  1960s, opposed the Shah, and murdered a number of Americans, including men like Colonel Louis Hawkins. The organization was expelled from Iran, after which support came from the Iraqi regime, and it was based primarily in Iraq, where the remnants of its military forces remain. The State Department describes the organization as follows: The MEK's history is studded with anti-Western attacks as well as terrorist attacks on the interests of the clerical regime in Iran and abroad. ...The worldwide campaign against the Iranian Government stresses propaganda and occasionally uses terrorist violence. During the 1970s, the MEK killed US military personnel and US civilians working on defense projects in Tehran and supported the takeover in 1979 of the US Embassy in Tehran. In 1981, the MEK detonated bombs in the head office of the Islamic Republic Party and the Premier's office, killing some 70 highranking Iranian officials, including chief Justice Ayatollah Mohammad Beheshti, President Mohammad-Ali Rajaei, and Premier Mohammad-Javad Bahonar. Near the end of the 1980-88 war with Iran, Baghdad armed the MEK with military equipment and sent it into action against Iranian forces. In 1991, it assisted the Government of Iraq in suppressing the Shia and Kurdish uprisings in southern Iraq and the Kurdish uprisings in the north. Since then, the MEK has continued to perform internal security services for the Government of Iraq. In April 1992, the MEK conducted near-simultaneous attacks on Iranian Embassies and installations in 13 countries, demonstrating the group's ability to mount large-scale operations overseas. In recent years, the MEK has targeted key military officers and assassinated the deputy chief of the Armed Forces General Staff in April 1999. In April 2000, the MEK attempted to assassinate the commander of the Nasr Headquarters--the interagency board responsible for coordinating policies on Iraq. The normal pace of anti-Iranian operations increased during the ""Operation Great Bahman"" in February 2000, when the group launched a dozen attacks against Iran. In 2000 and 2001, the MEK was involved regularly in mortar attacks and hit-and-run raids on Iranian military and law-enforcement units and government buildings near the Iran-Iraq border, although MEK terrorism in Iran declined throughout the remainder of 2001. Since the end of the Iran-Iraq war, the attacks along the border have garnered almost no military gains and have become commonplace. MEK insurgent activities in Tehran constitute the biggest security concern for the Iranian leadership. In February 2000, for example, the MEK launched a mortar attack against the leadership complex in Tehran that houses the offices of the Supreme Leader and the President, and assassinated the Iranian Chief of Staff.  The Other Side of the Hill The US cannot afford to ignore the fact that while Iran may be a potential threat, it also feels threatened. Iraq  the main threat to Iran is no longer under the control of Saddam Hussein  but Iran fought one of the most bloody wars in recent history against Iraq and one that involved the massive Iraqi use of poison gas. The US was seen to be Iraq's ally in that war, and the US fought Iran in a low-level tanker war between 1987 and 1998. The US now has forces on two of Iran's borders, and if the US sees Iran as unwilling to engage in a meaningful official dialog, Iran sees the US as unwilling to engage in a meaningful unofficial dialog.   Cordesman: Iranian Security Threats  28-10-2003  Page 10  The US sees the Israel-Palestinian conflict largely as an Israeli war on terrorism, but Iran's regime and people see it as an asymmetric war between Palestinian and occupier. If Israel sees Iran as a major potential threat because of its search for long-range missiles and nuclear weapons, Iran sees Israel and the US as current threats with both nuclear weapons and massive conventional capabilities. Iran has little confidence  if any -- in the future stability of Iraq and points to proliferation in Pakistan and India. It also sees a Gulf in which the Southern Gulf states have cumulatively imported $83.3 billion worth of arms since 1995 versus $2.9 billion for Iran  a ratio of roughly 30:1 The Constraints on US Policy The United States thus faces an extremely difficult situation. It must contain any Iranian adventures, help to protect its allies, do as much as possible to prevent Iranian proliferation and the support of terrorism, and help ensure the security of Gulf energy exports. At the same time, it must seek to find ways to support peaceful internal change and the move towards a moderate democracy that the Iranian people clearly want. It must seek to limit the actions of Iran's extremists and hardliners, but it must avoid being seen as intervening in Iranian affairs in ways that could provoke a nationalist reaction or civil conflict, tie the US to terrorist groups like the MEK, and unify Iran around a more aggressive and hostile posture towards the US. The US must also act in ways that recognize that its approach to Iran is virtually unique, and does not have the support of any European ally of the US or any friendly Gulf state. Rightly or wrongly, all have chosen dialogue and trade over the US effort to isolate and sanction Iran. This is particularly important at a time when the US face growing hostility to its operations in Iraq and has problems with many of its traditional allies over both Iraq and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. More materially, the US cannot ignore the fact that the Department of Energy and International Energy Agency project a steady increase in global economic dependence on Iranian energy exports as part of a projected increase in Gulf exports. It estimates that Iran's production capacity must increase from 3.8 MMBD today to 4.9 MMBD by 2025, as part of an increase in total production capacity that will allow the Gulf to increase its   Cordesman: Iranian Security Threats  28-10-2003  Page 11  total exports from 14.8 MMBD in 2001 to 35.8 MMBD in 2025  a more than 140% increase. Dealing with the Iranian Threat Given this background, there are several ways the US should approach Iran, both in terms of threat and opportunity:  It should make it clear that the US will react to any Iranian military threats and deter and contain them. It is as dangerous to romanticize Iran, as it is to demonize it. Iran may evolve towards a stable form of moderation. It has not done so as yet. It must be made clear to Iran that any course of action it pursues will be met with a reaction that does not leave it any viable military options and that any major military action would lead to the destruction of its present regime. The US should also be prepared to react decisively to any overt Iranian deployment of nuclear weapons, biological weapons, and long-range missiles. Deterrence and containment should not be static. The US should be prepared to provide missile defenses, and improved defenses against other forms of attack. The US should also be prepared to extend a conventional deterrent umbrella over its regional allies. It should never threaten Iran with nuclear retaliation  which would only provoke more problems in the region  but it should never renounce such an option as long as there is any risk of Iranian proliferation, leaving the issue in doubt, It should be stressed that this does not mean adventures in areas like preemption unless massive improvements can be made in US intelligence and targeting capabilities, and unless it is either clear that Iranian strikes are both imminent and far more threatening than seems likely for some years to come. Retaliation is the ultimate option, and the US cannot afford to carry out strikes that miss their targets or which only succeed in making an enemy out of the Iranian people while force Iran's government to create more covert means of proliferation.  Demonstrate US will and capability responsibly: Deterrence and containment are best done quietly and by deploying a ""big stick."" Harsh and over-simplistic   Cordesman: Iranian Security Threats  28-10-2003  Page 12  rhetoric plays into the hands of Iran's hard-liners and America's opponents. In contrast, US military deployments and exercises, and military cooperation with friendly Gulf states, provide a quiet and tangible message. Similarly, US reporting and statements that provide clear and validated public descriptions of threatening Iranian actions persuade both regional and other allies, where sweeping and vague charges simply undermine US credibility.  Pursue arms control without relying on it: It is highly unlikely that Iran will abandon a major research and development effort in every aspect of proliferation until major changes occur in its regime and perception of the threat. The US must assume this is the case until it has far better intelligence collection and analysis regarding proliferation than it now has on any country, and it must not forget that nine years of UNSCOM and UNMOVIC inspection of Iran, and months of postwar US efforts, have still failed to provide an understanding of such efforts in Iraq. Even if Iran does fully comply with its agreements with the British Foreign Minister and gives the IAEA all of the access called for under the NNPT protocol, major uncertainties will remain. Iranian compliance in arms control may well, however, prevent any overt acquisition and deployment of nuclear weapons, and the creation of major fissile material production facilities. Other arms control efforts may limit the scale of Iran's chemical weapons programs. The will still leave Iran with no meaningful constraints on its missile and biological programs, but even imperfect arms control can be far better than none provided that the US is proactive in ensuring that every possible violation is dealt with honestly and with suitable inspection, and the US firmly seeks to enforce those treaty provisions that could cut off the flow of nuclear, chemical, and possibly biological technology.  Continue to put constant pressure on Iran's suppliers: The US cannot cut off Iran from dual-use and direct technology for proliferation, or block all purchases of advanced weapons, but it should continue to make every effort to try. One possible step would be to move beyond quiet dialogue with allied governments over transactions and suppliers that appear to aid Iran in proliferating and   Cordesman: Iranian Security Threats  28-10-2003  Page 13  acquiring advanced arms and to aggressively name and sanction such suppliers in the way that has been done for some Russian and Chinese firms.  Pursue counterterrorism systematically and in a focused way: the US should make it unambiguously clear to Iran that it will do everything possible to check any Iranian support or tolerance of terrorism against the US or any of its allies. Far too much of the public US effort, however, again involves sweeping and careless rhetoric, rather than carefully focused efforts with detailed charges and credible demands for Iranian action.  Make every effort to maintain an informal dialog with Iran, and create formal official relations, without concession or preconditions: Dealing with the Iranian threat requires more than sticks. The US must demonstrate that it will do everything possible to improve relations with Iran, that it is not hostile to Iran's moderates or its people, and that the burden of the failure to create formal relations lies solidly with Iran's hard-liners and extremists. This does not mean concessions, but neither does it mean demanding Iran change its behavior as the price of the formal relations that are the key to allowing meaningful security negotiations to begin. The US dialog with Iran over Afghanistan is a model of how the US should approach this issue; the sudden decision to break off a dialog with Iraq over Iraq before the US and British invasion of Iraq is a model of how not to deal with the problem. The US negotiated and traded with far more threatening opponents throughout the Cold War, and gained much of its eventual victory by doing so.  Use the European and Gulf efforts at dialog and improved cooperation constructively without compromising the US position. The US has no chance of either persuading or compelling its allies and other nations to join it in isolating Iran unless a clear case can be made for doing so in ways that actually change Iranian behavior. The reality is also that the European dialog with Iran, and the efforts of the Gulf states to normalize relations, have accomplish a great deal and offer the only practical means at this point to change Iran's behavior and directly influence its internal behavior. This does not mean the US should not pressure   Cordesman: Iranian Security Threats  28-10-2003  Page 14  Europe, the Gulf states, and other nations to react to Iranian actions that threaten the region or support terrorism. Europe, for example, has sometimes only remembered the ""dialog"" part of ""critical dialog.""  Do everything possible to support internal change in Iran, but avoid adventures and efforts at regime change. The US should use every diplomatic tool available to encourage political moderation in Iran. The should include every effort to help those Iranian's who call for real democracy, to improve human rights, and encourage cultural exchanges and every other way of both showing the Iranian people the US is on their side and will act on their behalf. The problems and weaknesses in the Iranian opposition outside Iran are so grave, however, that they make the Iraqi opposition seem a tower of strength by comparison. The MEK is beyond change and too contemptible to deal with,  Consider major revisions to a largely failed sanctions policy. It is one of the ironies of the post Cold War era that the primary threat to the US no longer truly consists of foreign power, but is rather the mistakes made by its Executive and Legislative branches. The only nation that can defeat the US is itself. The present US sanctions policy is a good example of such self-defeating actions. It does not stop Iran from proliferating. If anything, it makes proliferation and asymmetric warfare Iran's only military options, and reinforces Iran's hardliners in arguing that the US is hostile and a threat. The US should consider lifting those Executive Orders that cut US business off from their Iranian counterparts, which block Iranian energy development without halting or limiting Iranian proliferation, and which impede an unofficial cultural and political dialog for no apparent reason. This does not mean tolerating any transfer of critical technologies or offering some kind of carte blanche in trade and investment that would given the Iranian government large amounts of hard currency it could use for weapons programs. This, however, is very different from the present hollow sanctions policy that serves no purpose other than posturing for domestic political constituencies.  Pursue an Arab-Israeli Peace and the ""Road Map"" in the face of all obstacles: the US cannot enforce a peace on Israel and the Palestinians, and should not. Iran   Cordesman: Iranian Security Threats  28-10-2003  Page 15  is, however, only one example of the need to convince the people of the region that the US is both serious in seeking an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict, and that it will put pressure on Israel to limit its settlements and restrict its military actions to those action truly needed to protect its people and halt attacks and terrorism. This in no way means relaxing US pressure for Palestinian action and reform, for a halt to Iranian support of extremist and terrorist organizations, and for Arab and Iranian support of the peace process. A strong, visible, and continuing US-led Arab-Israeli peace effort is vital, however, to any effort to deal with Iran -- as well as to every other aspect of US security interests in the Middle East. Finally, the US needs something it has badly lacked in recent years: patience. There are no instant solutions or good options for dramatic action. Poorly chosen rhetoric and political posturing aids those forces in Iran that threaten the US and its allies, it does not compel Iran or threaten it in productive ways. Most important, the US needs to finish the job in Iraq and in dealing with Afghanistan and Al Qaida before it even contemplates new confrontations that are not force upon it be events, and the US needs to rebuild its relations with its allies and adopt policies that can win international support. Deterrence and containment have their risks and limits, and they only succeed with time. Wandering off in search enemies, however, has never made strategic sense and is only likely to further alienate Iran, other regional allies, and the world."

Stephan Minikes to OSCE Permanent Council) (1150)  The rules and procedures governing U.S. military commissions for suspected international terrorists would afford impartial, full, and fair trials with appropriate due process safeguards, U.S. Ambassador to the OSCE Stephan Minikes told the Permanent Council in Vienna April 11.  The procedures, announced by the U.S. Department of Defense March 21, ""are consistent with fundamental international standards governing criminal trials, specifically consistent with the procedural safeguards found in the Geneva Conventions,"" said Minikes, and they are also consistent with the procedural safeguards found in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  He added: ""Consistent with the OSCE Vienna, Copenhagen, and Moscow human dimension commitments, the procedures include the presumption of innocence, the right to choose one's council, and the right to be informed of the charges in one's native language.""  As an additional safeguard, Minikes said, an impartial three-member panel that might include civilians would review guilty verdicts, and the commissions themselves would be open to the public ""except when necessary to protect national security and for other reasons relating to the safety and security of those involved.""  Minikes raised the subject of military commissions in the context of his response to a report to the Permanent Council by Ambassador Gerard Stoudmann, director of the OSCE's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR).  Minikes also commented on elections in Ukraine and Hungary, Latvian election legislation, riots in the Kyrgyz Republic, and the ODIHR budget.  Following is a transcript of his remarks:  (begin transcript)  United States Mission to the OSCE  Vienna  April 11, 2002  STATEMENT ON THE REPORT BY THE DIRECTOR OF ODIHR   Delivered by Ambassador Stephan M. Minikes to the Permanent Council  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would like to welcome Ambassador Stoudmann back to the Permanent Council.  At your last appearance, we promised to keep the Permanent Council apprised of developments regarding the United States' commitment to human rights in our fight against international terrorism.  On March 21, the Department of Defense made public the rules and procedures that will govern the U.S. Military Commissions that have been established to try suspected international terrorists and their supporters for violations of the law of war.  The procedures take into account the many comments that we have received from our allies, as well as human rights groups and other non-governmental organizations.  It is our firm belief that the Military Commissions will be impartial. They will provide full and fair trials and afford appropriate due process safeguards.  The procedures are consistent with fundamental international standards governing criminal trials, specifically consistent with the procedural safeguards found in the Geneva Conventions. They are also consistent with the procedural safeguards found in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  Consistent with the OSCE Vienna, Copenhagen, and Moscow human dimension commitments, the procedures include the presumption of innocence, the right to choose one's council, and the right to be informed of the charges in one's native language.  An impartial three-member panel, possibly including civilians who are temporarily commissioned, will also review guilty verdicts, and the Commissions will be open to the public except when necessary to protect national security and for other reasons relating to the safety and security of those involved.  No individuals have yet been designated for trial by Military Commissions and no Military Commissions have in fact yet been established. We will continue to keep the Permanent Council apprised of developments as they unfold.  I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Ambassador Stoudmann for keeping us abreast of other developing issues in the OSCE region.  We share his assessment of the elections in the Ukraine and in Hungary. We applaud Hungary for holding elections in line with international standards and commitments and for the record high voter turnout. We encourage Hungarian authorities to continue working with the OSCE to address issues regarding media coverage and minority issues.  In Ukraine, we recognize the contribution that a new Election Law, multi-party election commissions, and engagement of civil society in the election process made an improved electoral environment. However, we share the concerns expressed by the International Election Observation Mission regarding media bias and uneven access to the media, the abuse of administrative resources, and uneven implementation of the legal framework for the elections. We urge Ukraine to build on progress demonstrated in the preparation and conduct of the March elections by addressing these matters, and reserve the right to revisit the matter pending issuance of the final observation report.  Regarding election legislation, we too call on the Latvian Government to continue to make progress in implementing the President's promise to remove the language requirements in the election law, working with ODIHR and the High Commissioner's Office in this regard.  Election observation throughout the OSCE region will continue to be a top priority for ODIHR. In this regard, ODIHR has the full support of the United States Government to conduct a reinforced election observation mission in Macedonia for the parliamentary elections anticipated for September. We stand ready to provide our appropriate share of the funding, either by voluntary contribution or as a supplemental budget.  Likewise, ODIHR's role in monitoring the human rights situations in the OSCE region is also important. At our last Permanent Council, I expressed my concern about the riots in the Jalal-Abad Oblast of southern Kyrgyzstan.  The United States Government is concerned about reports that Kyrgyz police fired into an unarmed crowd, triggering further violence and protests. We call on the Government of Kyrgyzstan to form a comprehensive independent commission comprised of NGO, opposition, and government representatives to investigate the incident, with much attention paid to its root causes.  Given the serious situation, we believe it would be constructive if Ambassador Stoudmann were to visit Kyrgyzstan, and we welcome his remarks in that connection this morning, because we feel that this could play an important role in stabilizing the situation and it seems propitious for him to make that trip and we hope that that will be as early as possible.  Mr. Chairman, in closing, I want to thank Ambassador Stoudmann and the entire ODIHR staff for their dedication to their work. I realize that the budget impasse has been a strain on their ability to carry out projects and has hindered planning for election observation. The United States Government recognizes the importance of your work and we will continue to support you in that regard.  And on a personal note, I want to say how sorry we are to hear that you will be leaving your position. You have provided strong leadership and built an effective organization as Director for ODIHR over the past years and your place will be hard to fill. The best, most important mark you will leave will be the standards of excellence and courage that you have set.  Thank you.  (end transcript)                   Return to US Embassy Home Page"

She said it is her ""firm belief that free speech, that democratic discussion, that democratic debate, in fact reduces the possibility that citizens will be attracted to join terrorist organizations.""  Most of the reporters' questions for Jones, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, dealt with human rights.  Jones took issue with the notion that U.S. concerns about human rights are being subordinated to the prosecution of the war against terrorism, arguing that the more contact the United States has with the Kyrgyz government on military issues, ""the more capacity we have to talk in greater detail about human rights cases, about the development of democracy, about economic reform, about combating poverty.""  The United States will ""continue to work to support the independent media, free speech, civil society, economic reform"" in the Kyrgyz Republic, she said.  Asked about Chechnya, Jones said the United States continues to state its concerns regarding Russian prosecution of the war there, and that U.S. policy has not changed.  ""The only way that the situation on Chechnya can be resolved, we believe, is through addressing the social issues and the economic issues there. And we have encouraged the Government of the Russian Federation as well as representatives of the Chechen people to meet, to talk, to begin to resolve these issues,"" she said.  Following is a transcript of the press conference:  (begin transcript)  Bishkek, The Kyrgyz Republic January 25, 2002  PRESS CONFERENCE WITH U.S. AMBASSADOR ELIZABETH JONES ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE, BUREAU OF EUROPEAN AND EURASIAN AFFAIRS  AMBASSADOR JONES: Thank you very much for joining me here today. I'm very happy to be in Kyrgyzstan, I've been here not quite 24 hours so far. I've had some very interesting, some very good meetings. But primarily I'm very impressed and grateful for the very strong support that Kyrgyzstan is giving to the coalition against terrorism. In particular, we are grateful for the support of the Parliament and the President in presenting and passing the Status of Forces Agreement that allows some of our forces to work out of Manas airport. A week from today we will celebrate the 10th anniversary of the opening of the American Embassy in Bishkek. I expect that we will have a very strong Embassy here and a strong presence here for many, many years to come. Right now, as I said, we are very grateful for the ability of our Air Force to use Manas airbase. But that's only a small part of all of the cooperation and the work that we do with the Government of Kyrgyzstan and with the Kyrgyz people. We have been working very hard and we will continue to work to support the independent media, free speech, civil society, economic reform, which are all common goals of the people of the United States and the people of Kyrgyzstan. Thank you very much. I'd be happy to answer your questions.  QUESTION FROM AKI-PRESS: In December you made a presentation at the Subcommittee for Central Asia and the Caucasus, when you said that the U.S. will provide support to the independent media. My question is whether and when the support will really be provided, and in what form? Thank you.  AMBASSADOR JONES: We have had programs in the Kyrgyz Republic for most of the past 10 years and we will continue to have programs that support independent media in quite a number of ways. Some of that support is in the form of training, and some of it is in the form of exchanges. Another way we support independent media is through our political support, through discussions with senior government officials to help them understand the importance to them of permitting free media.  QUESTION FROM RES PUBLICA: Isn't the deployment of American military forces in Kyrgyzstan, and the fact that the Kyrgyz Government supports the anti-terrorism coalition, resulting in the lessening of attention given by the United States to the human rights violations that are taking place practically every second? We are in a situation of repression and terror.  AMBASSADOR JONES: We actually think that the opposite is the case. The more we cooperate, the more we have contact with the Government on some of the military issues that you mention, the more capacity we have to talk in greater detail about human rights cases, about the development of democracy, about economic reform, about combating poverty. For instance, your colleague mentioned the hearing that I appeared before in Congress, with the Subcommittee on Central Asia. That subcommittee had never existed before. It was the first time that it had been formed and I was the first person that they asked to come to speak to it. And the interest came because of the problems in Afghanistan of terrorism. It gave us, gave me the opportunity to talk about civil society and gave me the opportunity to talk about the importance of human rights and development of democracy in Central Asia.  QUESTION FROM RES PUBLICA: Could you tell us briefly what questions on human rights violations were raised during the meeting with [President] Akayev?  AMBASSADOR JONES: I talked about the importance of the development of civil society to the war on terrorism. Because it is my firm belief that free speech, that democratic discussion, that democratic debate, in fact reduces the possibility that citizens will be attracted to join terrorist organizations.  QUESTION FROM ITAR-TASS: Please tell us if the U.S. attitude toward events in Chechnya changed after September 11th?  AMBASSADOR JONES: No, our policy didn't change in terms of Chechnya. We have been very outspoken on our concerns about how the Russian Federation is prosecuting the war in Chechnya. We firmly believe, and we say this regularly, that there is not a military solution to the problems in Chechnya. The only way that the situation on Chechnya can be resolved, we believe, is through addressing the social issues and the economic issues there. And we have encouraged the Government of the Russian Federation as well as representatives of the Chechen people to meet, to talk, to begin to resolve these issues.  QUESTION FROM RES PUBLICA: How do you comment on the fact that after the terrorist attacks in the U.S. on September 11, articles appeared in local pro-governmental media blaming the Kyrgyz opposition for participating in these attacks?  AMBASSADOR JONES: I wasn't aware that these articles existed. But suffice it to say that I don't believe that to be true. And I think it's important for any reader of newspapers, especially when there is a free press, to understand that part of being a reader of the free press is to be discriminating in how one evaluates what one reads.  QUESTION FROM AGYM: There are 300 people conducting a hunger strike in the country. Was this issue raised during meeting with Askar Akayev?  AMBASSADOR JONES: The issue of the reason for the hunger strike did come up in my meeting with the President. We believe, the U.S. believes very strongly that Mr. Beknazarov should be freed from prison until his legal process is undertaken, and we are hoping very much for a good result.

EDT -- Monday, September 23, 2002  (On The Record Unless Otherwise Noted)    Mr. Boucher:  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. It's a pleasure to be here. I don't have any statements or announcements, so I'd be glad to take your questions.    Mr. Gedda.    Question:  Well, the White House says you're going to let it all hang out on Germany. Ari said that about two hours ago, so you haven't got much choice.    Mr. Boucher:  Well, I don't know that there's a lot to hang. On the basic reaction to the election, obviously we welcome a democratic election. The voters of Germany have spoken clearly through a democratic process, and we look forward to working with the German Government on issues of common interest.    Question:  Well, do you have any observations about the state of US-German relations in the wake of the campaign?    Mr. Boucher:  I don't have any particular observations beyond what the White House has said. There have been some issues during the course of the campaign. The White House and we have expressed views about that. We have a continuing dialogue with German Government officials on a variety of issues. I would note that German Foreign Minister Fischer called the Secretary this morning and they spoke about some of those issues. But beyond that, no particular further comment.  Question:  I think that the Justice Minister whose remarks caused so much offense is apparently planning to stand down. Do you have any observation on that?    Mr. Boucher:   No.    Question:  Can I ask you about the other election, the Slovak election?    Question:   Can we stay on Germany?    Question:  This is directly related to it. I'm trying to get a juxtaposition.    Mr. Boucher:   Okay.  You want to get a juxtaposition?    Question:   Yeah, from your one-sentence observation on Germany.    Mr. Boucher:   Okay, I'll jux give you the position on that.    We commend the voters in Slovakia for exercising their democratic right and responsibility to vote in a free and fair election. We welcome the high voter turnout as a sign of the vibrancy of the democratic system in the Slovak Republic. Now that the voters have spoken, we encourage the political leaders to form a government that will ensure the Slovak Republic's place within the Euro Atlantic democratic family of nations. We look forward to working with the new government and encourage it to vigorously pursue the reform agenda to best serve the people of Slovakia.    Question:  So I can go back and count, but how many sentences was that compared to what you had to say about Germany?    Mr. Boucher:   I don't think I'm going to go back and count.    Question:   We can do that, though?  Would you encourage us to do so?    Mr. Boucher:  I'm not going to encourage you one way or the other. I don't think particular counts of words or sentences apply in these cases.    Okay.  Elise.    Question:  Chancellor Schroeder seemed to run on an anti-American campaign, almost, because he found a lot of anti-American sentiment among the German people because of some policies recently. Can you speak to this and whether you think that maybe a public diplomacy campaign should be branched out to some European countries where the anti-American sentiment is particularly high?    Mr. Boucher:  I don't think I want to start commenting on particular political platforms and campaigns. We know the positions that the various German candidates took through the election. We obviously followed the whole situation closely. When there were particularly disturbing issues, like some of the comments by the Justice Minister, we raised those, we commented on them. But the general tenor of the campaign or the platforms, I really don't think we're going to get into.    Question:  Well, what about the anti-American sentiment in Germany right now? I mean, he capitalized on what he saw in the papers as a huge anti-American sentiment among the German public.    Mr. Boucher:  I think we'll leave that for others to analyze for the moment. Obviously the United States is out there as often as we can and in as many ways as we can expressing our views, clarifying our position, making clear what we stand for and what we work for in the world, and we look for others in the world who can work for us in the same direction of peace and democracy and security, in some cases. In many cases, we find a lot of areas to work with with our allies, including Germany. In some cases, we might have differences.    Question:   Today in the morning, Colin Powell, State Depart --    Mr. Boucher:   Secretary of State.    Question:  Secretary of State -- sorry -- met Kyrgyz President. What issues were raised there? Human Rights Watch said that human rights situation in Kyrgyzstan is quickly getting worse. Was that issue addressed?    Mr. Boucher:  It was addressed quite extensively, I would say. Human rights was a major topic both for the Secretary and for President Akayev during the course of the meetings. Secretary Powell welcomed the meeting with President Askar Akayev this morning. In their meeting, first of all, the Secretary underscored our long-term commitment to a relationship with Kyrgyzstan and to the region of Central Asia. He thanked President Akayev for the country's strong support for Operation Enduring Freedom and for the global war on terrorism. They discussed regional security issues and a number of bilateral economic and political issues.    The Secretary also stressed to President Akayev the importance of implementing political and economic reforms, especially democratic reforms and the protection of human rights, as a basis for development, for stability, and also for cooperation with the United States. A healthy economy, an open democratic society, the Secretary made clear, help to ensure the country's long-term stability and prosperity. The same messages are being discussed with President Akayev in other meetings that he's having throughout -- well, in the building and around Washington today.    I would note President Akayev gave us quite a lengthy brief on the state of human rights in Kyrgyzstan, pointing to some of the things that he had done and that they were doing in terms of drafting a new constitution and a very strong commitment to try to move forward an understanding that democracy was one of the foundations of development and prosperity. And we heard quite a number of commitments in that regard and an update on some of the things that they were doing, and the Secretary said we look forward to seeing those things done and implemented.    Question:  Back to the German-American relations again. The White House described the atmosphere between both countries as poisoned last week. Would the State Department share that opinion this week after the reelection of Schroeder?    Mr. Boucher:  We obviously share those remarks about -- in the context in which they were made.    Question:  I have two questions. Mr. Boucher, firstly, there was a device exploded in a car near the US Embassy properties in Jakarta, Indonesia this morning. According to the Embassy press release, still there is no indication that the US Embassy properties are the target, however I need your comment or you have already further explanation about this accident.    And then the second question. The Embassy has also released some kind of warning for Westerners that they are maybe targeted for violence in the immediate future in Yogyakarta area in Jakarta. I just want to know, is there any plan from the US Government will release such notification for American citizen not to visit special or certain region in Indonesia in the immediate future?    Thank you.    Mr. Boucher:  Let me say a couple things about that. One is we have general advice for American travelers or people who live in Indonesia that applies and, as far as I know, remains the way it is. The specific advice that the Embassy gave to people about Yogyakarta came out on Friday as well, but frankly we don't see any particular relationship between that and this device that exploded.    Let me tell you a little bit about the device that did explode. It was a grenade that exploded in a vehicle, which then careened into a residence, not a US Government residence. I think there have been various reports out there. The explosion was not at an Embassy warehouse and it was not a truck bomb.    It took place on a street that houses Indonesian Government officials as well as other well-known Indonesian individuals and two US Government residences. No Americans were hurt in the explosion. At the present time, there are no indications that Americans or American interests were intended as the target. We understand, according to the Indonesian police, that one man has been arrested, and we'll keep in close touch with Indonesian law enforcement officials.    So what's what we know about the incident.    Question:  On my second question, is there any plan that US Government will release such a warning?    Mr. Boucher:  We have standing advice to American citizens about travel to Indonesia. That includes, in fact, some details on areas of the country where you have to be more or less careful, or more careful than others. We revise that periodically based on changes of conditions, but I think the advice is basically sound and stands for the moment.    Matt.    Question:  Moving on, are you aware of any travel by representatives of the Quartet coming up to the Middle East? Apparently the Danish, according to the Greek Foreign Minister, the Danish Foreign Minister told him that representatives of the Quartet would be going to the Middle East very soon, like today or tomorrow, to talk with all of the principals, including Arafat. Is there any US -- first of all, do you know about that and if there are --    Mr. Boucher:  I think ""representatives of the Quartet"" is kind of a phrase we don't normally use.    Question:  Yeah, I know. I'm not talking about the Secretary. I think it's a --    Mr. Boucher:  The Quartet involves the Russians, the Europeans, the United Nations and the United States. I only speak for the United States, not for the Quartet. I have heard that there may be some European travel, but you'd have to check with them on whether there are Europeans traveling. As far as the United States goes, I'm not aware of any particular dispatch of envoys, but obviously we're well represented in the region and we keep in close touch with people in the region from Washington by phone and other ways.    Question:  Well, should a delegation from the Quartet members go, and go to see Chairman Arafat in Ramallah, would the United States participate in such a --    Mr. Boucher:  I have not heard of any delegation from the Quartet. I've only heard of European, possible European travel, but you'd have to check with them.    Question:  Can you tell us about what contacts there have been, in fact, over the last 24 hours or so between the State Department and the parties in the Middle East on the Ramallah --    Mr. Boucher:   On the situation in Ramallah?    Question:   Yeah.    Mr. Boucher:  First of all, our envoys in the region, ambassadors, consul general, representatives out there are very active with the governments involved. The Secretary himself has been on the phone over the weekend. He's talked to Secretary General Annan three times over the weekend. He talked to Prime Minister Sharon on Sunday night to convey the President's deep concerns about the situation. That was something like a 35-40 minute phone call.    He's also talked to Foreign Minister Maher of Egypt, Foreign Minister Saud al-Faysal of Saudi Arabia and Foreign Minister Ivanov of Russia, all those on Saturday. This morning, as I said, he received a phone call from Foreign Minister Fischer of Germany. He's also talked to the Danish Foreign Minister, Per Stig Moeller, who is currently the head of the EU. So we've been working, I would say, fairly intensely on the situation in Ramallah.    I think we've made clear in our conversations that recent Israeli actions in Ramallah and around the Muqatta, including the destruction of Palestinian civilian and security infrastructure, have aggravated the situation and they do not contribute to progress on Palestinian civil and security reform.    We've urged Israel to consider carefully the consequences of its recent actions and their effect on the goals of Palestinian security cooperation and reform of Palestinian institutions in preparation for Palestinian statehood. I find it difficult to understand how these actions can further the goals the President outlined in his June 24th speech. The United States has underscored these points at the highest levels of the Israeli Government, including with Prime Minister Sharon.    I would note, at the same time, we've condemned the two suicide bombings last week in the strongest possible terms and made very clear that acts of terrorism must end now if we're ever to be able to move ahead on implementation of the vision of two states contained in the June 24th speech, and it's imperative that Palestinians take immediate, sustained and comprehensive steps to prevent terrible attacks such as these and eradicate the structure that supports terrorism and violence.    So that's where we are. We remain closely, intensely engaged with the international community to try to calm the situation, try to build upon recent progress that was being made towards Palestinian civil and security reform.    Question:  Do you have any reason to believe that the people wanted by Israel in the Ramallah compound have any connection with the suicide bombings of last week?    Mr. Boucher:  I don't think that's a question that we would be in a position to answer at this point. I think those questions are probably more properly directed at the Israelis.    Question:   Can I just follow up on that, then?    Question:  So when you say it's difficult to understand how this contributes, have you come to any conclusions about what possibly might be behind all this?    Mr. Boucher:  We don't do ""what possibly might be's"" here. That's know as a hypothetical or a speculative answer. I'm just giving you the facts. We think these actions over the last few days around the Muqatta have aggravated the situation and don't contribute to the goals that the President outlined, including reform in the Palestinian community so that we can have a more stable situation between the two parties.    Question:   In other words, keep the peace.    Mr. Boucher:   Joel.    Question:  Did you ask for any assurances from Israel that they will not harm or exile Chairman Arafat, as you have done in the past?    Mr. Boucher:  We have discussed the situation of Chairman Arafat and our understanding remains that these, shall I say our previous understandings on this subject, remain unchanged.    Question:  Could you elaborate on that (inaudible)? I mean, since you've said it before, can you say it again?    Mr. Boucher:  We've previously talked with both sides in these kind of situations our view that Chairman Arafat should not be harmed, and the Israelis have made clear that they were not intending to harm him.    Question:  Richard, has the US asked the Israelis to withdraw from the Muqatta or from Ramallah?    Mr. Boucher:  At this point, let me just say that we're working fairly intensely with both sides and other international parties to try to calm the situation and try to help resolve it. I will stop at that point.    Dave.    Question:  If I may follow up. You said that these actions have aggravated the reform process. Would you say that it has hurt it or, I mean, I think you said aggravated --    Mr. Boucher:  I said aggravated the situation and did not contribute to the reform process.    Question:  Did not contribute. Has it hurt the reform process? Has it been a setback as well as a --    Mr. Boucher:  We'll make those kind of assessments later. I will give you instant analysis the way I just did.    Question:  Richard, when the Secretary spoke to Prime Minister Sharon last night, did the Secretary tell him --    Mr. Boucher:   Saturday night.    Question:   Saturday night.  You said last night, but --    Mr. Boucher:   I regret having said --    Question:   Whenever it was he talked to him.    Mr. Boucher:  It was Saturday night. I was definitely Saturday night.    Question:  This was when -- as the Israelis were warning, telling people to get out of the area and there was going to be a big explosion? Was this in that timeframe, around 5 o'clock our time?    Mr. Boucher:   Yeah.  More or less.    Question:  And was his phone call as a result of the ratcheting up of the tension at that point, or was he going to make this call, had he been planning to make this call anyway?    Mr. Boucher:  I don't think it was linked particularly to those statements or that moment. It was linked to the fact that he wanted to call and talk to the Israelis about the situation, and second of all to convey the President's deep concerns about the situation.    Question:  In his phone call, did he tell the Prime Minister that the President and he, and the Secretary, that they believed that Israel's actions were, you know, working counter to the President's goal and what is, in fact, apparently supposed to be Sharon's goal as well? MR. BOUCHER: I'm not in a position to get into exact words that might or might not have been used on the phone call. I'd say our view that I've expressed today is the one that we've expressed to the Israelis as well.    Question:  Bewilderment? That you don't know why they're -- how can --    Mr. Boucher:  Our views, as I expressed them today, are the ones that we expressed to the Israelis.    Elise.    Question:  Do you see a receptivity on the part of Israel to back down a bit, or were they along the lines of when you tried to get them to withdraw in April that this is just an action that needs to be taken?    Mr. Boucher:  Well, we'll have to see how the situation resolves itself.    Joel.    Question:  Turkish Prime Minister Ecevit has invited both the PA as well as the Israelis and the United States and other countries to host an Israeli-Palestinian type of conference. Would you welcome that? And he has also said that he thinks that Arafat has been brought to a powerless position and also it's not helpful to peacemaking, the actions over the week, as well as the suicide bombings. Any comment to that?    Mr. Boucher:  I don't think I can give you commentary on that. I don't know the details of this meeting that they may be trying to set up, so I'll have to stay away from it for the moment.    Question:   Can I switch subjects to Iraq?    Mr. Boucher:   Okay.    Question:  Can you bring us up to date on the diplomacy that has taken place over the last couple days, whether or not you believe Secretary Powell or others have made some headway with the Russians and the French in particular in convincing them to sign onto this tough UN resolution?    Mr. Boucher:  We continue to pursue the diplomacy on Iraq and getting a resolution that makes clear Iraq's violations, what they have to do to correct them, and that there will be consequences if they don't. We continue our consultations in the Security Council with our partners there on a draft resolution that would make these things absolutely clear. We think a resolution like this is necessary in order to make clear -- give the inspectors unfettered access as a critical ingredient for an effective inspections regime.    We've noted the comments by Iraq over the weekend, but I'd say it's not up to Iraq to decide whether the Security Council adopts a new resolution, nor is it for Iraq to decide what sort of inspection regime the Security Council should use. Recent Iraqi statements are just further proof that Iraq is already backtracking on its commitments to have inspections without conditions.    We do believe it's necessary for the Security Council to make clear the terms of inspections and to make clear the consequences that would follow should Iraq not permit those inspections, and that's what we continue to pursue. We're working with other governments up in New York as well as in some of these telephone conversations that the Secretary's had. We have, as you know, worked with the British on text. We've talked to many others about the concepts and the elements involved, and that process is continuing now. It's not time to assess who's on board and who's not.    Question:  Do you have an idea of when you're going to introduce the resolution?    Mr. Boucher:  I can't give you an exact timeframe, but the Secretary has made clear this is a process that we felt should take weeks, not months, and so we're coming to that point sometime.    Elise.    Question:  Richard, usually when there's a UN resolution, the Council seeks to have a unanimous vote so that Council unity shows that the whole Security Council is really behind any resolution, in this case behind a certain inspections regime that you're calling for. But Secretary Powell said last week that the US is hoping for nine out of 15 votes and isn't -- which would seem it doesn't really matter about Council unity calling for a tough inspections regime. Are you just looking for the resolution on the books or do you want an inspections regime that the whole Council is behind?    Mr. Boucher:  I think on any UN resolution, we want as many as possible. Iraq, in particular, has been defiant throughout the years, particularly when there was not unanimity or strength in the Security Council. So we think it's important to get as much as possible. We think it's important for the Security Council to take up this challenge, to take up this responsibility that both the President and the Secretary General referred to in their speeches last week. And we think it's important for the Security Council to make the rules, not for Iraq. So we'll continue to pursue those goals. Obviously, the more people that sign on, the better.    Question:  The Dutch Foreign Minister, after his meeting with the Secretary, said that -- quoted the Secretary as saying he was reasonably confident that he would get a Security Council resolution to his liking, including consequences. Is that -- would you concur with that's the way the Secretary sees it?    Mr. Boucher:  I'm not quite sure we really think this is the moment to start assessing things. We're reasonably confident that a number of countries understand the need for a resolution and therefore I'd say we're -- I wouldn't dispute that, but I don't want to start predicting an outcome quite yet. Obviously, until a resolution is worked out, till we have a text for others to support or not to support, it's hard to make predictions.    Question:  Just a couple questions on a fairly old story, and that's the court case against the former Consul General of Vladivostok in Vladivostok. I understand that State's not involved in this lawsuit because it's argued that he was not on official business when he was in this accident. But then, how then could he have invoked his diplomatic immunity there in Russia if he were not on official business?    Mr. Boucher:  We do see this as a private matter and that the lawsuit is a private dispute that we're not involved in, so we've stayed away from that. We've not really commented very much, and I don't think I can start now.    Question:  Can I ask one other question about his -- whether or not -- I understand he didn't have insurance and that it is State policy to have all of your representatives overseas to have car insurance.    Mr. Boucher:  I think those are matters that are under discussion and dispute in the lawsuit, and I have to stay out of it. It's a private lawsuit and I'm not going to get involved.    Question:  Can we go back to Iraq for a second? The Secretary -- has he met with the Omani Foreign Minister?    Mr. Boucher:   Not yet.    Question:   Oh, never mind, then.  I'll ask later.    Mr. Boucher:   Okay.  All right, 2:00 p.m.    Question:  In Turkey Islamic-oriented Justice and Development Party leader Erdogan has been barred from running in the November elections by Turkey's high election board. Do you have anything on that?    Mr. Boucher:  No, I don't. I'm not sure it's a matter we would comment on, but I will check and see.    Question:  I have a question on the Colin-Akayev meeting. On the 12th of September in a statement, Human Rights Watch asked for the -- asked President Bush for the release of opposition leader Felix Kulov before the arrival of Akayev to the United States. Obviously, there was no such pressure or it was not effective because Kulov remains in prison. Was that issue raised with the Colin-Akayev meeting and will it be raised in the meeting of Bush with Akayev this evening, afternoon?    Mr. Boucher:  I think you'll have to check with the White House about what may or may not come up in their meetings. In terms of the discussion of human rights, the Secretary and President Akayev discussed many specific issues. I'm not in a position to go into each one. As for that particular one, I will check and see how it was raised with the delegation. I just don't have an answer right now.    Dave.    Question:  Could you give us a little more readout, perhaps, on the Secretary's phone conversation with Mr. Fischer this morning? You mentioned they talked about the Mideast. Specifically, did the --    Mr. Boucher:  No, I don't think I mentioned any particular issue. I just said that they discussed a number of issues.    Question:  You mentioned it in the context of the Mideast discussion.    Mr. Boucher:   Yeah, I guess I did.    Question:  Did the Secretary congratulate Mr. Fischer on his surprising showing which helped, in a sense, support regime change in Berlin?    Mr. Boucher:  I'm not going to go -- again, it's a -- (laughter) -- it's a -- you know, it's a particular matter. The Foreign Minister called him. They talk very frequently. They talked today.    Question:   Did the Foreign Minister say (inaudible)?    Mr. Boucher:   Yes.    Sir.    Question:  Ivory Coast. Do you have any -- have you come to any conclusions about what last week's ruckus was all about and can you -- also, there's a bunch -- close to 200 American schoolchildren stuck in one of the towns that's still kind of iffy. Are you speaking with the French, who have an evacuation team on standby for the people who are at the school? Is there coordination going on between you and the French on this?    Mr. Boucher:  Okay. Let's do the whole thing. First, I think we put out a statement on the 20th, right, that went through our basic view of the situation. We do believe that the rebels need to lay down their arms and negotiate a peaceful solution to the conflict. We've urged the government to do all it can to avoid further bloodshed and continue to respect the human rights of all citizens and residents of Cote d'Ivoire and we urge them to continue a process of national reconciliation.    The situation in Abidjan on Monday remains calm. Some shops have reopened, but there's a dusk-to-dawn curfew that remains in effect throughout the country until next Sunday. Some of the poorer neighborhoods of Abidjan, many inhabited by foreigners, by foreign residents in Cote d'Ivoire, have been burned during the soldiers' -- during the government's searches for pockets of rebellious soldiers. So there remain difficulties there, particularly for some of the foreigners who reside in those quarters.    As far as the school, the International Christian Academy is a school primarily serving the children of missionaries posted throughout West Africa. This school has approximately 160 US citizens on the campus. It's located in Bouake. Despite reports of gunfire close to the school, the school has adequate supplies and students are reported safe. Our Embassy remains in very close contact with the school.   The rebels are still in control of Bouake and Korhogo. The Minister of Sports remains held hostage by the rebels in Bouake. Rebels have appealed to the Government of Cote d'Ivoire for negotiations and the Government has demanded that the rebels lay down their arms prior to any negotiations.   French troops arrived in Abidjan on Saturday, September 21st, to help ensure the safety of French and third-country nationals in rebel-held Korhogo and Bouake, and the US is coordinating closely with French authorities.   Question:  You guys haven't made a determination on whether this was a coup attempt or a --   Mr. Boucher:  Well, the government is calling it a failed coup attempt. We think the situation is fluid and it's hard at this point to assess the motives or organizers of the events conclusively at this point.   Okay.  Last one, maybe?   Question:  Today, right here aside the State Department, there is a demonstration to free southern Sudan from what they say is genocide. There are a lot of people that have been exiled. And this same group had been over at the White House about two months ago. Is Senator Danforth's meetings with the Sudanese progressing to, perhaps, settle this? Will there be a separate enclave or break the country in half? What are they planning?   Mr. Boucher:  Senator Danforth, as you know, presented his report to the White House a few months ago. Since then, we've been working very intensely on the peace process that was underway, and that absorbed a lot of time from representatives of the Africa Bureau who were traveling out to Kenya to help support those peace talks and to try to do everything we could to urge the -- urge progress in this situation.   This is one of the subjects that the Secretary took up during his recent trip to southern Africa because of the interest of people in the region, as well as the number of other people he saw out there. Regrettably, at that time, there had been some fighting that broke out again. But we continue to try to see what we can to move this process forward and we do think it's important to bring peace for the people of southern Sudan -- all of Sudan, for that matter.   Thank you.

GEOGRAPHY Iceland is a volcanic island in the North Atlantic Ocean east of Greenland and immediately south of the Arctic Circle. It lies about 4,200 kilometers (2,600 mi.) from New York and 830 kilometers (520 mi.) from Scotland.   About 79% of Iceland's land area, which is of recent volcanic origin, consists of glaciers, lakes, a mountainous lava desert (highest elevation 2,000 meters--6,590 ft.--above sea level), and other wasteland. About 28% of the land is used for grazing, and 1% is cultivated. The inhabited areas are on the coast, particularly in the southwest where about 60% of the population lives.   Because of the Gulf Stream's moderating influence, the climate is characterized by damp, cool summers and relatively mild but windy winters. In Reykjavik, the average temperature is 11C (52F) in July and -1C (30F) in January.   PEOPLE Most Icelanders are descendants of Norwegian settlers and Celts from the British Isles, and the population is remarkably homogeneous. According to Icelandic Government statistics, 93% of the nation's inhabitants live in urban areas (localities with populations greater then 200) and about 60% live in Reykjavik metropolitan area. Of the Nordic languages, the Icelandic language is closest to the Old Norse language and has remained relatively unchanged since the 12th century.   About 91% of the population belongs to the state church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church, or other Lutheran Churches. However, Iceland has complete religious liberty, and about 20 other religious congregations are present.   Most Icelandic surnames are based on patronymy, or the adoption of the father's first given name. For example, Magnus and Anna, children of a man named Petur, would hold the surname Petursson and Petursdottir, respectively. Magnus' children, in turn, would inherit the surname Magnusson, while Anna's children would claim their father's first given name as their surname. Women normally maintain their original surnames after marriage. This system of surnames is required by law, except for the descendants of those who had acquired family names before 1913. Most Icelanders, while reserved by nature, rarely call each other by their surnames, and even phone directories are based on first names. Because of its small size and relative homogeneity, Iceland holds all the characteristics of a very close-knit society.   Cultural Achievements The Sagas, almost all written between 1180-1300 A.D., remain Iceland's best-known literary accomplishment, and they have no surviving counterpart anywhere in the Nordic world. Based on Norwegian and Icelandic histories and genealogies, the Sagas present views of Nordic life and times up to 1100 A.D. The Saga writers sought to record their heroes' great achievements and to glorify the virtues of courage, pride, and honor, focusing in the later Sagas on early Icelandic settlers. The best-known Icelandic writer of the 20th century is the Nobel Prize winner Halldor Kiljan Laxness. The literacy rate is 99.9%, and literature and poetry are a legendary passion with the population. Per capita publication of books and magazines is the highest in the world.   Unlike its literature, Iceland's fine arts did not flourish until the 19th century because the population was small and scattered. Iceland's most famous painters are Asgrimur Jonsson, Jon Stefansson, and Johannes Kjarval, all of whom worked during the first half of the 20th century. The best-known modern sculptor, Asmundur Sveinsson (1893-1982), drew his inspiration from Icelandic folklore and the Sagas for many of his works.   Kristjan Johannsson is most likely Iceland's most famous opera singer, while pop singer Bjork is probably its best-known artist internationally together with the progressive rock band Sigur Ros.   HISTORY Iceland was settled in the late 9th and early 10th centuries, principally by people of Norse origin. In 930 A.D., the ruling chiefs established a republican constitution and an assembly called the Althingi--the oldest parliament in the world. Iceland remained independent until 1262, when it entered into a treaty establishing a union with the Norwegian monarchy. Iceland passed to Denmark in the late 14th century when Norway and Denmark were united under the Danish crown.   In the early 19th century, national consciousness revived in Iceland. The Althingi had been abolished in 1800 but was reestablished in 1843 as a consultative assembly. In 1874, Denmark granted Iceland home rule, which again was extended in 1904. The constitution, written in 1874, was revised in 1903, and a minister for Icelandic affairs, residing in Reykjavik, was made responsible to the Althingi. The Act of Union, a 1918 agreement with Denmark, recognized Iceland as a fully sovereign state united with Denmark under a common king. Iceland established its own flag, but Denmark continued to represent Icelandic foreign affairs and defense interests. German occupation of Denmark in 1940 severed communications between Iceland and Denmark. Consequently, Iceland moved immediately to assume control over its own territorial waters and foreign affairs. In May 1940, British military forces occupied Iceland. In July 1941, responsibility for Iceland's defense passed to the United States. Following a plebiscite, Iceland formally became an independent republic on June 17, 1944.   In October 1946, the Icelandic and U.S. Governments agreed to terminate U.S. responsibility for the defense of Iceland, but the United States retained certain rights at Keflavik. Iceland became a charter member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949. After the outbreak of hostilities in Korea in 1950, and pursuant to the request of NATO military authorities, the United States and Iceland agreed that the United States should again be responsible for Iceland's defense. A bilateral defense agreement signed on May 5, 1951, is the authority for U.S. military presence in Iceland. Iceland is the only NATO country with no standing military of its own.   GOVERNMENT The president, elected to a 4-year term, has limited powers. The prime minister and cabinet exercise most executive functions. The parliament is composed of 63 members, elected every 4 years unless it is dissolved sooner. Suffrage for presidential and parliamentary elections is universal for those 18 and older, and members of the parliament are elected on the basis of parties' proportional representation in six constituencies. The judiciary consists of the Supreme Court, district courts, and various special courts. The constitution protects the judiciary from infringement by the other two branches.

(202) 265-6653], and a consulate general at 800 Third Ave, 36th floor, New York, NY 10022 [tel. (212) 593-2700]. Iceland also has 25 honorary consulates in major U.S. cities.   POLITICAL CONDITIONS The current government is a coalition of the conservative Independence Party (led by Prime Minister David Oddsson) and the rural-based Progressive Party (led by Foreign Minister Halldor Asgrimsson). The two parties, which have been in coalition since the 1995 election, hold a comfortable majority in parliament, even though the IP lost some ground in the May 2003 elections. Oddsson has been prime minister since 1991, making him the longest-serving prime minister in Europe (from 1991 to 1995, the IP was in coalition with the Social Democratic Party).   Three left-wing parties--the Social Democratic Party, the People's Alliance and the Women's List--formed an electoral coalition prior to the 1999 parliamentary election in the hope of mounting a credible challenge to the long-dominant Independence Party. But the dream of creating a united left coalition failed when disaffected leftists formed a new far-left splinter party called the Left Green Party, led by former deputy People's Alliance leader Steingrimur Sigfusson. With these defections, the left coalition won a disappointing 27% of the vote (17 seats) in the 1999 election, four percentage points below what the three parties had won running separately in 1995. Their 31% (20 seats) showing in 2003 recaptured this ground but did not suffice to topple the government. The Left Greens, on the other hand, surprised everyone by winning a respectable 9% of the vote (6 seats), and clinging to that support in 2003. Another new splinter party, the Liberal Party, won 3% of the vote (2 seats) in 1999 based on its strong opposition to the current fishing management system, and managed to double that support to just over 7% (4 seats) in 2003.   Despite the poor electoral showing in 1999, the three left-wing parties decided to formally merge in 2000, creating a new party, the Social Democratic Alliance, led by Ossur Skarphedinsson. The party has found it difficult to reconcile the widely varying foreign policy views of its members, which range from strong support for NATO membership and the U.S. military presence to pacifism and a return to traditional neutrality.   When Iceland became a republic in 1944, the post of president was created to fill the void left by the Danish king. Although the president is popularly elected and has limited veto powers (he can force a public referendum on a proposed law by refusing to sign it), the expectation is that the president play the same limited role as a monarch in a traditional parliamentary system.   The current president is Olafur Ragnar Grimsson, a former political science professor who led the People's Alliance in 1987-95 and served as finance minister in 1988-91. Although Grimsson won office with only a 41% plurality in 1996, he was not challenged for re-election in 2000. This follows a well-established tradition of giving deference to sitting presidents. Once in office, a president can generally count on serving as many terms as he or she likes, assuming good behavior. Since the establishment of the republic in 1944, a sitting president has been challenged for re-election only one time and that effort fell far short (in 1988, against then-President Vigdis Finnbogadottir). Reflecting the belief that the president is ""above politics,"" presidential candidates run for election as individuals--since 1952, political parties have played no role in nominating or endorsing candidates. During his term, Grimsson has occasionally drawn criticism for breaching the bounds of presidential etiquette by being too outspoken on sensitive political issues.   ECONOMY Marine products account for the majority of Iceland's exports of goods. Other important exports include aluminum, ferro-silicon alloys, equipment and electronic machinery for fishing and fish processing, pharmaceuticals, and woolen goods. Information technology and related services is an important growth area. Foreign trade plays an important role in the Icelandic economy. Exports account for about one-fourth of GDP and imports for one-third. Most of Iceland's exports go to the EU and EFTA countries, the United States, and Japan. The United States is Iceland's largest bilateral investment partner and largest partner in services trade.   Iceland's relatively liberal trading policy was strengthened by accession to the European Economic Area in 1994 and by the Uruguay Round agreement, which also brought significantly improved market access for Iceland's exports, particularly seafood products. However, the agricultural sector remains heavily subsidized and protected.   Iceland's economy is prone to inflation but remains rather broad-based and highly export-driven. The 1970s oil shocks hit Iceland hard. Inflation rose to 43% in 1974 and 59% in 1980, falling to 15% in 1987 but rising to 30% in 1988. Since 1990, due to economic reforms and deregulation, inflation has dramatically fallen, averaging only 4.85% from 1990-2000. Due to several years of strong economic growth, Iceland experienced the best economic period in its history in the 1990s. However, the economy fell into recession in late 2001 and inflation began to escalate. In March 2001, the Central Bank adopted an inflation target exchange rate policy instead of an index rate policy with the aim of managing the value of the Icelandic Krona to keep inflation below a certain level. In addition, the government urged municipalities, labor unions, and private parties to unite in keeping inflation down. Unemployment more than doubled to 2.6%, and inflation that spiked above 9% threatened to give labor unions leverage to abrogate national wage agreements. The government took monetary and fiscal measures that brought inflation down close to the current target rate of 3%. Inflation remained moderate in 2002, but with slightly negative GDP growth. The government expects a return to positive growth in 2003.   Iceland has few proven mineral resources, although deposits of diatomite (skeletal algae) are mined. Abundant hydroelectric and geothermal power sources allow about 90% of the population to enjoy heating from these natural resources. The Burfell hydroelectric project is the largest-single station with capacity of 240 mw. The other major hydroelectric stations are at Hrauneyjarfoss (210 mw) and Sigalda (150 mw). Iceland is exploring the feasibility of exporting hydroelectric energy via submarine cable to mainland Europe and also actively seeks to expand its power-intensive industries, including aluminum and ferro-silicon smelting plants. Nordural Aluminum is a wholly owned investment by Columbia Ventures of Washington State. The plant employs more than 150 people and recently expanded to 90,000 tons per year capacity, which is planned to double before the end of the decade. Power projects in the connection with Alcoa's 322,000 tons per year capacity aluminum smelter have already taken off. The smelter will be opened for production in 2007 at which point over $2 billion will have been invested in this largest project in Icelandic history.   Iceland has no railroads. Organized road building began about 1900 and has greatly expanded in the past decade. The current national road system connecting most of the population centers is largely in the coastal areas and consists of about 13,000 kilometers (8,125 mi.) of roads with about 3,955 kilometers (2,547 mi.) were paved. Regular air and sea service connects Reykjavik with the other main urban centers. The national airline, Icelandair, flies from Iceland to Europe and North America, and is one of the country's largest employers. Iceland became a full European Free Trade Association member in 1970 and entered into a free trade agreement with the European Community in 1973. Under the agreement on a European Economic Area, effective January 1, 1994, there is basically free cross-border movement of capital, labor, goods, and services between Iceland, Norway, and the EU countries.   DEFENSE When Iceland became a founding member of NATO in 1949, it did so on the explicit understanding that Iceland, which has never had a military, would not be expected to establish an indigenous force. Iceland's main contribution to the common defense effort has been the rent-free provision of the ""agreed areas""--sites for military facilities. By far the largest and most important of these is the NATO Naval Air Station at Keflavik. Although this base is manned primarily by U.S. forces, it also has a permanently stationed Dutch P-3 aircraft and crew, as well as officers from Canada, Denmark, Norway, and the United Kingdom. Units from these and other NATO countries also are deployed temporarily to Keflavik, and they stage training exercises. Iceland and the United States regard the ongoing U.S. military presence since World War II as a cornerstone to bilateral foreign/security policy. In May 2001, the 50th anniversary of the bilateral agreement was celebrated. Bilateral negotiations regarding implementation of a new ""Agreed Minute"" governing force structure and operations at the Keflavik base commenced in 2003.   In addition to providing the ""agreed areas,"" the Government of Iceland contributes financially to NATO's international overhead costs and recently has taken a more active role in NATO deliberations and planning. Iceland hosted the NATO Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Reykjavik June 1987 and again in May 2002.   In June 2002, Iceland hosted the Partnership for Peace (PfP) humanitarian exercise ""Cooperative Safeguard."" This was the third time that Iceland has held this exercise since 1997. The exercise has the distinction of attracting a large number of partner countries, including Russia.   FOREIGN RELATIONS Iceland maintains diplomatic and commercial relations with practically all nations, but its ties with other Nordic states, with the U.S., and with the other NATO member states are particularly close. Icelanders remain especially proud of the role Iceland played in hosting the historic 1986 Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Reykjavik, which set the stage for the end of the Cold War.   Iceland has greatly increased its international profile since the early 1990s with the end of the Cold War. In 2001 alone, the government opened new embassies in Canada, Japan, and Mozambique, bringing the total number of its overseas missions to over 20. Buying and outfitting the embassy in Tokyo cost more than $7 million, an extraordinary investment for this small country, whose total foreign affairs budget in 2000 amounted to a little more than $40 million. Since the mid-1990s, Iceland has opened eight missions overseas, including an embassy in Beijing, giving Iceland a diplomatic presence in all five permanent member countries of the UN Security Council. Not coincidentally, one of Iceland's key foreign policy goals is to win a seat on the UN Security Council for the 2009-10 term. In the past few years, Iceland also has established missions to the Council of Europe in Strasbourg and to the OSCE in Vienna. In 1998, it bolstered its delegation to NATO, assigning a permanent representative to the military committee for the first time ever.   Notwithstanding its status as an unarmed nation, Iceland has been eager to do its part to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security. One of the niches it is trying to fill is in civilian peacekeeping and crisis management. It took a significant step forward in this area in 2001 by launching its Icelandic Crisis Response Unit (ICRU). In setting up the ICRU, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs established a roster of 100 experts in various occupations (police officers, nurses, doctors, lawyers, engineers, journalists, etc.) who will be specially trained and prepared to deploy to troubled spots abroad on short notice.   Peacekeeping has been a permanent item in the Icelandic state budget since 1994, and Iceland has been an active member of the UN Peacekeeping Committee since 1997. Iceland had an average of five peacekeepers-- primarily doctors, nurses, and police officers--in Bosnia at any given time from 1994 to 1999, and it doubled that number to 10 in 2000. During 2001, Iceland had an average of 15 peacekeepers in the Balkan region at any given time. Most of the peacekeepers continued to be policemen, doctors, and nurses, but a few engineers, media experts, and social scientists also were deployed. With the formal establishment ICRU, the government decided to increase the number of peacekeepers to 20 in 2002 and to 25 in 2003. By 2006 Iceland wants the capability to deploy up to 50 peacekeepers overseas at any given time.   Icelanders have a strong emotional bond toward the Baltic states, and Iceland prides itself on being the first country to recognize their claim for independence in 1991.   Membership in International Organizations Iceland is a member of the following organizations: Arctic Council, Barents Euro-Arctic Council; Council of Baltic Sea States; Council of Europe; European Economic Area; European Free Trade Organization; EFTA Court; EFTA Surveillance Authority; North Atlantic Treaty Organization; Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe; Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development; International Criminal Police Organization; International Council for the Exploration of the Sea; International Hydrographic Organization; International Maritime Satellite Organization; International Telecommunications Satellite Organization; International Union for the Publication of Custom Tariffs; Nordic Council; North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission; North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization; the International Whaling Commission; and the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission.   It also is a member of the United Nations and most of its related organizations, specialized agencies and commissions, including the International Monetary Fund, World Trade Organization, World Tourism Organization, Food and Agricultural Organization, International Atomic Energy Agency, International Civil Aviation Organization, International Fund for Agricultural Development; Industrial Development Organization; International Labor Organization, International Maritime Organization, International Telecommunications Union, UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, Universal Postal Union, World Health Organization, and World Meteorological Organization; World Intellectual Property Organization; International Bank for Reconstruction and Development; International Development Association; International Finance Corporation Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency and International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes; UN Conference on Disarmament; Economic Commission for Europe; UN High Commissioner for Refugees; Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights; Commission of Human Rights; UN Conference on Trade and Development.   U.S.-ICELANDIC RELATIONS U.S. policy aims to maintain close, cooperative relations with Iceland, both as a NATO ally and as a friend interested in the shared objectives of enhancing world peace; respect for human rights; economic development; arms control; and law enforcement cooperation, including the fight against terrorism, narcotics, and human trafficking. Moreover, the United States endeavors to strengthen bilateral economic and trade relations.   In celebration of the 1,000th anniversary in the Year 2000 of Leif Eriksson's voyage to North America, the United States established a volunteer binational working group to coordinate a number of millennium activities with the Government of Iceland and interested parties. These activities highlighted, among other areas, shared culture, scholarship and research, scientific discovery and exploration, pioneer legacy, and the strong defense relationship between the countries.

GX016-73-11617420	"05/02/2002   EDITORIAL NUMBER=0-09858    RUMSFELD IN CENTRAL ASIA    U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld recently traveled to Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan to thank the people of those countries for their support in the war on terrorism.     In Kyrgyzstan, Mr. Rumsfeld met with President Askar Akayev and expressed United States appreciation for providing a major base for nearly two-thousand troops supporting operations against Taleban and al-Qaida terrorists in Afghanistan. Mr. Rumsfeld said, ""The base at Manas [airport] has been exceedingly helpful and valuable to the coalition effort."" The airbase has allowed coalition aircraft to fly over Afghanistan, refuel, and conduct security operations to prevent al-Qaida and Taleban from gathering and threatening the Afghan government. The base has also made possible the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan.     Kazakhstan has announced that it is prepared to make additional contributions to the war on terrorism. President Nursultan Nazarbayev said he is prepared to allow U.S. and coalition aircraft to use Kazakhstan air space and railways to transport humanitarian cargo. Kazakhstan plans to send military officers to U.S. Central Command headquarters in Florida to serve as liaison for planning and coordination of anti-terrorism operations. In addition, Kazakhstan announced it would provide food, oil products, and other humanitarian supplies to Afghanistan.     Kazakhstan has already granted overflight rights for aircraft participating in Operation Enduring Freedom. More than three-hundred fifty aircraft have flown over Kazakhstan since the U.S.-led coalition began operations in October. As President Nazarbayev told Mr. Rumsfeld, ""Everyone knows you can’t stand alone in that struggle [against terrorism]. You must fight jointly.""    Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld also visited Turkmenistan, where he thanked President Saparmurat Niyazov for his ""very fine cooperation with respect to humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan."" Turkmenistan’s support will undoubtedly save many lives.     The United States is grateful for the help it is receiving from its coalition partners in the war against terrorism. Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan continue to provide invaluable assistance in the war to rid the region of the al-Qaida terrorist network. The U.S. will do all it can to prevent Afghanistan from ever again becoming a sanctuary for terrorists."

GEOGRAPHY Iceland is a volcanic island in the North Atlantic Ocean east of Greenland and immediately south of the Arctic Circle. It lies about 4,200 kilometers (2,600 mi.) from New York and 830 kilometers (520 mi.) from Scotland.   About 79% of Iceland's land area, which is of recent volcanic origin, consists of glaciers, lakes, a mountainous lava desert (highest elevation 2,000 meters--6,590 ft.--above sea level), and other wasteland. About 28% of the land is used for grazing, and 1% is cultivated. The inhabited areas are on the coast, particularly in the southwest where about 60% of the population lives.   Because of the Gulf Stream's moderating influence, the climate is characterized by damp, cool summers and relatively mild but windy winters. In Reykjavik, the average temperature is 11C (52F) in July and -1C (30F) in January.   PEOPLE Most Icelanders are descendants of Norwegian settlers and Celts from the British Isles, and the population is remarkably homogeneous. According to Icelandic Government statistics, 93% of the nation's inhabitants live in urban areas (localities with populations greater then 200) and about 60% live in Reykjavik metropolitan area. Of the Nordic languages, the Icelandic language is closest to the Old Norse language and has remained relatively unchanged since the 12th century.   About 91% of the population belongs to the state church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church, or other Lutheran Churches. However, Iceland has complete religious liberty, and about 20 other religious congregations are present.   Most Icelandic surnames are based on patronymy, or the adoption of the father's first given name. For example, Magnus and Anna, children of a man named Petur, would hold the surname Petursson and Petursdottir, respectively. Magnus' children, in turn, would inherit the surname Magnusson, while Anna's children would claim their father's first given name as their surname. Women normally maintain their original surnames after marriage. This system of surnames is required by law, except for the descendants of those who had acquired family names before 1913. Most Icelanders, while reserved by nature, rarely call each other by their surnames, and even phone directories are based on first names. Because of its small size and relative homogeneity, Iceland holds all the characteristics of a very close-knit society.   Cultural Achievements The Sagas, almost all written between 1180-1300 A.D., remain Iceland's best-known literary accomplishment, and they have no surviving counterpart anywhere in the Nordic world. Based on Norwegian and Icelandic histories and genealogies, the Sagas present views of Nordic life and times up to 1100 A.D. The Saga writers sought to record their heroes' great achievements and to glorify the virtues of courage, pride, and honor, focusing in the later Sagas on early Icelandic settlers. The best-known Icelandic writer of the 20th century is the Nobel Prize winner Halldor Kiljan Laxness. The literacy rate is 99.9%, and literature and poetry are a legendary passion with the population. Per capita publication of books and magazines is the highest in the world.   Unlike its literature, Iceland's fine arts did not flourish until the 19th century because the population was small and scattered. Iceland's most famous painters are Asgrimur Jonsson, Jon Stefansson, and Johannes Kjarval, all of whom worked during the first half of the 20th century. The best-known modern sculptor, Asmundur Sveinsson (1893-1982), drew his inspiration from Icelandic folklore and the Sagas for many of his works.   Kristjan Johannsson is most likely Iceland's most famous opera singer, while pop singer Bjork is probably its best-known artist internationally together with the progressive rock band Sigur Ros.   HISTORY Iceland was settled in the late 9th and early 10th centuries, principally by people of Norse origin. In 930 A.D., the ruling chiefs established a republican constitution and an assembly called the Althingi--the oldest parliament in the world. Iceland remained independent until 1262, when it entered into a treaty establishing a union with the Norwegian monarchy. Iceland passed to Denmark in the late 14th century when Norway and Denmark were united under the Danish crown.   In the early 19th century, national consciousness revived in Iceland. The Althingi had been abolished in 1800 but was reestablished in 1843 as a consultative assembly. In 1874, Denmark granted Iceland home rule, which again was extended in 1904. The constitution, written in 1874, was revised in 1903, and a minister for Icelandic affairs, residing in Reykjavik, was made responsible to the Althingi. The Act of Union, a 1918 agreement with Denmark, recognized Iceland as a fully sovereign state united with Denmark under a common king. Iceland established its own flag, but Denmark continued to represent Icelandic foreign affairs and defense interests. German occupation of Denmark in 1940 severed communications between Iceland and Denmark. Consequently, Iceland moved immediately to assume control over its own territorial waters and foreign affairs. In May 1940, British military forces occupied Iceland. In July 1941, responsibility for Iceland's defense passed to the United States. Following a plebiscite, Iceland formally became an independent republic on June 17, 1944.   In October 1946, the Icelandic and U.S. Governments agreed to terminate U.S. responsibility for the defense of Iceland, but the United States retained certain rights at Keflavik. Iceland became a charter member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949. After the outbreak of hostilities in Korea in 1950, and pursuant to the request of NATO military authorities, the United States and Iceland agreed that the United States should again be responsible for Iceland's defense. A bilateral defense agreement signed on May 5, 1951, is the authority for U.S. military presence in Iceland. Iceland is the only NATO country with no standing military of its own.   GOVERNMENT The president, elected to a 4-year term, has limited powers. The prime minister and cabinet exercise most executive functions. The parliament is composed of 63 members, elected every 4 years unless it is dissolved sooner. Suffrage for presidential and parliamentary elections is universal for those 18 and older, and members of the parliament are elected on the basis of parties' proportional representation in six constituencies. The judiciary consists of the Supreme Court, district courts, and various special courts. The constitution protects the judiciary from infringement by the other two branches.

(202) 265-6653], and a consulate general at 800 Third Ave, 36th floor, New York, NY 10022 [tel. (212) 593-2700]. Iceland also has 25 honorary consulates in major U.S. cities.   POLITICAL CONDITIONS The current government is a coalition of the conservative Independence Party (led by Prime Minister David Oddsson) and the rural-based Progressive Party (led by Foreign Minister Halldor Asgrimsson). The two parties, which have been in coalition since the 1995 election, hold a comfortable majority in parliament, even though the IP lost some ground in the May 2003 elections. Oddsson has been prime minister since 1991, making him the longest-serving prime minister in Europe (from 1991 to 1995, the IP was in coalition with the Social Democratic Party).   Three left-wing parties--the Social Democratic Party, the People's Alliance and the Women's List--formed an electoral coalition prior to the 1999 parliamentary election in the hope of mounting a credible challenge to the long-dominant Independence Party. But the dream of creating a united left coalition failed when disaffected leftists formed a new far-left splinter party called the Left Green Party, led by former deputy People's Alliance leader Steingrimur Sigfusson. With these defections, the left coalition won a disappointing 27% of the vote (17 seats) in the 1999 election, four percentage points below what the three parties had won running separately in 1995. Their 31% (20 seats) showing in 2003 recaptured this ground but did not suffice to topple the government. The Left Greens, on the other hand, surprised everyone by winning a respectable 9% of the vote (6 seats), and clinging to that support in 2003. Another new splinter party, the Liberal Party, won 3% of the vote (2 seats) in 1999 based on its strong opposition to the current fishing management system, and managed to double that support to just over 7% (4 seats) in 2003.   Despite the poor electoral showing in 1999, the three left-wing parties decided to formally merge in 2000, creating a new party, the Social Democratic Alliance, led by Ossur Skarphedinsson. The party has found it difficult to reconcile the widely varying foreign policy views of its members, which range from strong support for NATO membership and the U.S. military presence to pacifism and a return to traditional neutrality.   When Iceland became a republic in 1944, the post of president was created to fill the void left by the Danish king. Although the president is popularly elected and has limited veto powers (he can force a public referendum on a proposed law by refusing to sign it), the expectation is that the president play the same limited role as a monarch in a traditional parliamentary system.   The current president is Olafur Ragnar Grimsson, a former political science professor who led the People's Alliance in 1987-95 and served as finance minister in 1988-91. Although Grimsson won office with only a 41% plurality in 1996, he was not challenged for re-election in 2000. This follows a well-established tradition of giving deference to sitting presidents. Once in office, a president can generally count on serving as many terms as he or she likes, assuming good behavior. Since the establishment of the republic in 1944, a sitting president has been challenged for re-election only one time and that effort fell far short (in 1988, against then-President Vigdis Finnbogadottir). Reflecting the belief that the president is ""above politics,"" presidential candidates run for election as individuals--since 1952, political parties have played no role in nominating or endorsing candidates. During his term, Grimsson has occasionally drawn criticism for breaching the bounds of presidential etiquette by being too outspoken on sensitive political issues.   ECONOMY Marine products account for the majority of Iceland's exports of goods. Other important exports include aluminum, ferro-silicon alloys, equipment and electronic machinery for fishing and fish processing, pharmaceuticals, and woolen goods. Information technology and related services is an important growth area. Foreign trade plays an important role in the Icelandic economy. Exports account for about one-fourth of GDP and imports for one-third. Most of Iceland's exports go to the EU and EFTA countries, the United States, and Japan. The United States is Iceland's largest bilateral investment partner and largest partner in services trade.   Iceland's relatively liberal trading policy was strengthened by accession to the European Economic Area in 1994 and by the Uruguay Round agreement, which also brought significantly improved market access for Iceland's exports, particularly seafood products. However, the agricultural sector remains heavily subsidized and protected.   Iceland's economy is prone to inflation but remains rather broad-based and highly export-driven. The 1970s oil shocks hit Iceland hard. Inflation rose to 43% in 1974 and 59% in 1980, falling to 15% in 1987 but rising to 30% in 1988. Since 1990, due to economic reforms and deregulation, inflation has dramatically fallen, averaging only 4.85% from 1990-2000. Due to several years of strong economic growth, Iceland experienced the best economic period in its history in the 1990s. However, the economy fell into recession in late 2001 and inflation began to escalate. In March 2001, the Central Bank adopted an inflation target exchange rate policy instead of an index rate policy with the aim of managing the value of the Icelandic Krona to keep inflation below a certain level. In addition, the government urged municipalities, labor unions, and private parties to unite in keeping inflation down. Unemployment more than doubled to 2.6%, and inflation that spiked above 9% threatened to give labor unions leverage to abrogate national wage agreements. The government took monetary and fiscal measures that brought inflation down close to the current target rate of 3%. Inflation remained moderate in 2002, but with slightly negative GDP growth. The government expects a return to positive growth in 2003.   Iceland has few proven mineral resources, although deposits of diatomite (skeletal algae) are mined. Abundant hydroelectric and geothermal power sources allow about 90% of the population to enjoy heating from these natural resources. The Burfell hydroelectric project is the largest-single station with capacity of 240 mw. The other major hydroelectric stations are at Hrauneyjarfoss (210 mw) and Sigalda (150 mw). Iceland is exploring the feasibility of exporting hydroelectric energy via submarine cable to mainland Europe and also actively seeks to expand its power-intensive industries, including aluminum and ferro-silicon smelting plants. Nordural Aluminum is a wholly owned investment by Columbia Ventures of Washington State. The plant employs more than 150 people and recently expanded to 90,000 tons per year capacity, which is planned to double before the end of the decade. Power projects in the connection with Alcoa's 322,000 tons per year capacity aluminum smelter have already taken off. The smelter will be opened for production in 2007 at which point over $2 billion will have been invested in this largest project in Icelandic history.   Iceland has no railroads. Organized road building began about 1900 and has greatly expanded in the past decade. The current national road system connecting most of the population centers is largely in the coastal areas and consists of about 13,000 kilometers (8,125 mi.) of roads with about 3,955 kilometers (2,547 mi.) were paved. Regular air and sea service connects Reykjavik with the other main urban centers. The national airline, Icelandair, flies from Iceland to Europe and North America, and is one of the country's largest employers. Iceland became a full European Free Trade Association member in 1970 and entered into a free trade agreement with the European Community in 1973. Under the agreement on a European Economic Area, effective January 1, 1994, there is basically free cross-border movement of capital, labor, goods, and services between Iceland, Norway, and the EU countries.   DEFENSE When Iceland became a founding member of NATO in 1949, it did so on the explicit understanding that Iceland, which has never had a military, would not be expected to establish an indigenous force. Iceland's main contribution to the common defense effort has been the rent-free provision of the ""agreed areas""--sites for military facilities. By far the largest and most important of these is the NATO Naval Air Station at Keflavik. Although this base is manned primarily by U.S. forces, it also has a permanently stationed Dutch P-3 aircraft and crew, as well as officers from Canada, Denmark, Norway, and the United Kingdom. Units from these and other NATO countries also are deployed temporarily to Keflavik, and they stage training exercises. Iceland and the United States regard the ongoing U.S. military presence since World War II as a cornerstone to bilateral foreign/security policy. In May 2001, the 50th anniversary of the bilateral agreement was celebrated. Bilateral negotiations regarding implementation of a new ""Agreed Minute"" governing force structure and operations at the Keflavik base commenced in 2003.   In addition to providing the ""agreed areas,"" the Government of Iceland contributes financially to NATO's international overhead costs and recently has taken a more active role in NATO deliberations and planning. Iceland hosted the NATO Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Reykjavik June 1987 and again in May 2002.   In June 2002, Iceland hosted the Partnership for Peace (PfP) humanitarian exercise ""Cooperative Safeguard."" This was the third time that Iceland has held this exercise since 1997. The exercise has the distinction of attracting a large number of partner countries, including Russia.   FOREIGN RELATIONS Iceland maintains diplomatic and commercial relations with practically all nations, but its ties with other Nordic states, with the U.S., and with the other NATO member states are particularly close. Icelanders remain especially proud of the role Iceland played in hosting the historic 1986 Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Reykjavik, which set the stage for the end of the Cold War.   Iceland has greatly increased its international profile since the early 1990s with the end of the Cold War. In 2001 alone, the government opened new embassies in Canada, Japan, and Mozambique, bringing the total number of its overseas missions to over 20. Buying and outfitting the embassy in Tokyo cost more than $7 million, an extraordinary investment for this small country, whose total foreign affairs budget in 2000 amounted to a little more than $40 million. Since the mid-1990s, Iceland has opened eight missions overseas, including an embassy in Beijing, giving Iceland a diplomatic presence in all five permanent member countries of the UN Security Council. Not coincidentally, one of Iceland's key foreign policy goals is to win a seat on the UN Security Council for the 2009-10 term. In the past few years, Iceland also has established missions to the Council of Europe in Strasbourg and to the OSCE in Vienna. In 1998, it bolstered its delegation to NATO, assigning a permanent representative to the military committee for the first time ever.   Notwithstanding its status as an unarmed nation, Iceland has been eager to do its part to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security. One of the niches it is trying to fill is in civilian peacekeeping and crisis management. It took a significant step forward in this area in 2001 by launching its Icelandic Crisis Response Unit (ICRU). In setting up the ICRU, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs established a roster of 100 experts in various occupations (police officers, nurses, doctors, lawyers, engineers, journalists, etc.) who will be specially trained and prepared to deploy to troubled spots abroad on short notice.   Peacekeeping has been a permanent item in the Icelandic state budget since 1994, and Iceland has been an active member of the UN Peacekeeping Committee since 1997. Iceland had an average of five peacekeepers-- primarily doctors, nurses, and police officers--in Bosnia at any given time from 1994 to 1999, and it doubled that number to 10 in 2000. During 2001, Iceland had an average of 15 peacekeepers in the Balkan region at any given time. Most of the peacekeepers continued to be policemen, doctors, and nurses, but a few engineers, media experts, and social scientists also were deployed. With the formal establishment ICRU, the government decided to increase the number of peacekeepers to 20 in 2002 and to 25 in 2003. By 2006 Iceland wants the capability to deploy up to 50 peacekeepers overseas at any given time.   Icelanders have a strong emotional bond toward the Baltic states, and Iceland prides itself on being the first country to recognize their claim for independence in 1991.   Membership in International Organizations Iceland is a member of the following organizations: Arctic Council, Barents Euro-Arctic Council; Council of Baltic Sea States; Council of Europe; European Economic Area; European Free Trade Organization; EFTA Court; EFTA Surveillance Authority; North Atlantic Treaty Organization; Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe; Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development; International Criminal Police Organization; International Council for the Exploration of the Sea; International Hydrographic Organization; International Maritime Satellite Organization; International Telecommunications Satellite Organization; International Union for the Publication of Custom Tariffs; Nordic Council; North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission; North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization; the International Whaling Commission; and the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission.   It also is a member of the United Nations and most of its related organizations, specialized agencies and commissions, including the International Monetary Fund, World Trade Organization, World Tourism Organization, Food and Agricultural Organization, International Atomic Energy Agency, International Civil Aviation Organization, International Fund for Agricultural Development; Industrial Development Organization; International Labor Organization, International Maritime Organization, International Telecommunications Union, UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, Universal Postal Union, World Health Organization, and World Meteorological Organization; World Intellectual Property Organization; International Bank for Reconstruction and Development; International Development Association; International Finance Corporation Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency and International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes; UN Conference on Disarmament; Economic Commission for Europe; UN High Commissioner for Refugees; Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights; Commission of Human Rights; UN Conference on Trade and Development.   U.S.-ICELANDIC RELATIONS U.S. policy aims to maintain close, cooperative relations with Iceland, both as a NATO ally and as a friend interested in the shared objectives of enhancing world peace; respect for human rights; economic development; arms control; and law enforcement cooperation, including the fight against terrorism, narcotics, and human trafficking. Moreover, the United States endeavors to strengthen bilateral economic and trade relations.   In celebration of the 1,000th anniversary in the Year 2000 of Leif Eriksson's voyage to North America, the United States established a volunteer binational working group to coordinate a number of millennium activities with the Government of Iceland and interested parties. These activities highlighted, among other areas, shared culture, scholarship and research, scientific discovery and exploration, pioneer legacy, and the strong defense relationship between the countries.

GX016-98-9444899	"Washington File                           11 March 2003       Text: Lugar Urges Repeal of Jackson-Vanik Amendment for Russia    (Introduces bill providing permanent normal trade relations) (530)  Senator Richard G. Lugar (Republican of Indiana), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, introduced a bill March 10 to exempt Russia from the provisions of the Jackson-Vanik amendment to the 1974 U.S. Trade Act and to authorize the President to grant permanent normal trade relations to Russia.  The amendment denies permanent normal trade relations to communist countries that restrict emigration rights.  ""Since 1994, successive Administrations have found Russia in full compliance with the requirements of freedom of emigration,"" Lugar said.  ""While Russia currently receives normal trade relations treatment with respect to its exports to the U.S., "" he said, ""repealing Jackson-Vanik will remove the requirement of semi-annual reports that have been an irritant in U.S.-Russia relations.""  Following is a press release from his office:  (begin text)  United States Senate Richard G. Lugar United States Senator for Indiana (Republican) March 10, 2002  LUGAR INTRODUCES BILL TO IMPROVE TRADE WITH RUSSIA   U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Dick Lugar today introduced legislation to repeal the Jackson-Vanik amendment to Title IV of the 1974 Trade Act as it relates to Russia and to authorize the President to grant permanent normal trade relations to Russia.  ""Congress passed the 1974 Jackson-Vanik amendment to deny permanent normal trade relations to communist countries that restricted emigration rights. Over the years, it has been an effective tool to promote free emigration, but its continuing applicability to Russia no longer makes sense in the context of the many changes that have occurred since the fall of the Soviet Union,"" Lugar said in a statement introducing the bill.  ""Since 1994, successive Administrations have found Russia in full compliance with the requirements of freedom of emigration. Because Russia continues to be subject to Jackson-Vanik, the Administration must submit a semi-annual report to the Congress on Russia's continued compliance with freedom of emigration requirements. Since 1991, Congress has authorized the removal of Jackson-Vanik restrictions from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Kyrgyzstan, Albania, and Georgia. The conditions that have warranted these countries' removal from Title IV reporting apply equally to Russia.  ""For more than 8 years, Russia has satisfied the requirements of the Jackson-Vanik legislation. It has supported free emigration and it has signed a bilateral trade agreement with the United States allowing the application of normal trade relations status. Last year, the United States declared that Russia would no longer be considered a nonmarket economy for the purposes of trade remedies laws. Russia has made tremendous strides in the last decade. While Russia currently receives normal trade relations treatment with respect to its exports to the U.S., repealing Jackson-Vanik will remove the requirement of semi-annual reports that have been an irritant in U.S.-Russia relations. Granting permanent normal trade relations also will provide certainty that will improve the investment climate and promote enhanced economic relations between the U.S. and Russia,"" Lugar said.  Lugar introduced the same Jackson-Vanik repeal legislation last year. The Bush Administration supports the bill.

GX010-88-0441895	[Print Friendly Version]      Iceland Country Reports on Human Rights Practices   -   2002 Released by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor March 31, 2003 Iceland is a constitutional republic and a parliamentary democracy in which citizens periodically choose their representatives in free and fair multiparty elections. The judiciary is independent.    Elected officials maintained effective control of the police forces, which were responsible for internal security. There were no military forces. There were no reports that security forces committed human rights abuses.    The mixed, open economy provided residents with a high standard of living. The country had a population of approximately 286,000. The gross domestic product (GDP) during the year was approximately $8 billion; GDP growth was approximately 2 percent. Fish and other marine products accounted for about 40 percent of the country's exports. Aluminum was the second leading export.    The Government generally respected the human rights of its citizens, and the law and judiciary provided effective means of dealing with individual instances of abuse. Human rights monitors expressed concern about the Government's policy on dissent by foreign visitors and on protections of citizens' privacy. Violence against women remained a problem that the Government took steps to address. Some societal discrimination against women persisted, especially in the area of equal pay. There were reports of trafficking in women for prostitution. Iceland was invited as a participant to the second Ministerial Meeting of the Community of Democracies in Seoul, Republic of Korea, in November.    RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS Section 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including Freedom From:     a. Arbitrary or Unlawful Deprivation of Life    There were no reports of the arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of life committed by the Government or its agents.    b. Disappearance    There were no reports of politically motivated disappearances. c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment    The law prohibits such practices, and there were no reports that government officials employed them.    Prison conditions generally met international standards. Most of the country's prison population of fewer than 110 inmates were held at Litla Hraun Prison, which included a state-of-the-art detention facility. However, the prison system used a substandard jail (Hegningarhusid, built in 1874), where the 16 individual cells lacked toilets and sinks. In most cases, prisoners were kept in Hegningarhusid Prison only a short time for evaluation and processing before being transferred to another facility. Some prisoners with short sentences (less than 30 days) elected to serve their time there to be closer to friends and family.    Human rights observers expressed concern about the use of illegal drugs by some inmates at Litla Hraun Prison and about the lack of social services to help inmates overcome drug addiction and prepare them for eventual release. For humanitarian reasons, authorities have not instituted stringent controls on visitation that could stop narcotics from being smuggled into the prison.    In 2001 in response to the Council of Europe's 1999 finding that authorities used solitary confinement excessively, the Ombudsman of the Parliament investigated its use as a punishment for violations of prison regulations. He concluded that the Ministry of Justice needed to adopt clearer guidelines to prevent the arbitrary use of solitary confinement by prison authorities. By year's end, the Ministry had not done so. During the year, 94 of 108 persons placed in custody spent some time in isolation. The average time spent in isolation was approximately 14 days.    There was a separate minimum-security prison for women inmates. However, because so few women were incarcerated, some men who have been convicted of nonviolent crimes were held there as well. Juvenile offenders 15 years of age or older could be sentenced to prison terms, but the vast majority were given probation, suspended sentences, or attended a treatment program instead of going to jail. In the rare instances when juvenile offenders were incarcerated, they were held with adults since there was no separate facility for juveniles. The Government argued that such separation was not practical since the need to incarcerate a juvenile occurred infrequently.    The law allows pretrial detainees to be held with the general prison population; some human rights observers criticized this law. In 2001 the Government budgeted planning funds for a new remand prison just outside of Reykjavik; however, construction had not begun by year's end.    The Government permitted prison visits by independent human rights observers. The Icelandic Red Cross carried out regular prison visits to counsel prisoners and address their individual concerns. The independent Ombudsman of Parliament monitored prison conditions during the year.    d. Arbitrary Arrest, Detention, or Exile    The Constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention, and the Government generally observed these prohibitions; however, followers of the Falun Gong religious movement complained in June that the Government detained them for several hours before admitting them to the country (see Section 2.b.). Officials said that the names of Falun Gong practitioners were gathered by police with the help of police in countries where these persons had been involved in civil disturbances. Police may only make arrests where there is a strong suspicion of a crime having been committed or where a person refused to obey police orders to move. There were no reports of arbitrary arrests. All persons placed under arrest were presented with a form for their signature that outlines their rights and options. Within 24 hours of the arrest they appear before a judge who rules on whether they need to remain in custody during the investigation. They were entitled to legal counsel.    The law prohibits forced exile, and the Government did not employ it.    e. Denial of Fair Public Trial    The Constitution and the law provide for an independent judiciary, and the Government generally respected this provision in practice.  There were two levels of courts. A five-member Judicial Council appointed by the Minister of Justice administered the eight district courts, and the Supreme Court administers itself. All judges, at all levels, served for life.    The law provides for the right to a fair trial, and an independent judiciary generally enforced this right. Juries were not used, but multijudge panels were common, particularly in the Supreme Court, which heard all appeals. Depending upon the seriousness of the case, a Supreme Court panel could have from three to seven judges. Defendants were presumed innocent and generally were tried without delay. They were provided access to legal counsel of their own choosing with sufficient time in general to prepare their defense. For defendants unable to pay attorneys' fees, the State covered the cost, as set by the court; however, defendants were required to reimburse the State. Defendants had the right to be present at their trial, to confront witnesses, and to participate in the proceedings. No groups were barred from testifying, and all testimony was treated alike. The courts had the discretion to allow the introduction of evidence obtained illegally by the police. With limited exceptions, trials were public and conducted fairly, with no official intimidation. Defendants had the right to appeal, and appeals were handled expeditiously.    There were no reports of political prisoners.    f. Arbitrary Interference with Privacy, Family, Home, or Correspondence    The Constitution prohibits such actions, and the Government generally respected these prohibitions in practice.    Scientists and privacy advocates criticized the Ministry of Health and Social Security's national medical data program as a threat to citizens' privacy. The Government maintained access to health records under the 1998 Act on the Health Sector Database without prior affirmative consent by citizens. Its purpose was national health planning and policy. The program is expected to be completed in 2003. During the year, approximately seven percent of citizens exercised their option not to participate in the program.    Section 2.   Respect for Civil Liberties, Including:    a. Freedom of Speech and Press    The Constitution provides for freedom of speech and of the press, and the Government generally respected these rights in practice. An independent press, an effective judiciary, and a functioning democratic political system combined to ensure freedom of speech and of the press. The law bans the production, exhibition, distribution, or sale of violent motion pictures, which strive to show mistreatment or the brutal killing of men or animals. A six-member Motion Picture Review Committee, appointed by the Minister of Education and Culture, reviewed all motion pictures before they were shown and rated their suitability for children.    The country had three national daily newspapers, numerous radio stations, and two television stations that broadcast news, one of which was state owned but journalistically independent. There were also numerous Internet magazines devoted to news and political debate.    Internet access was available and unrestricted.    The Government did not restrict academic freedom.    b. Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association    The Constitution provides for freedom of assembly and association, and the Government generally respected these rights in practice; however, during the June visit of Chinese President Jiang Zemin, the Government attempted to prohibit approximately 100-120 Falun Gong practitioners from entering the country. Authorities asserted that they lacked the capacity, including facilities and officers, to maintain order and handle the assembly of hundreds of foreign followers of the spiritual movement, which is illegal in China. On June 11, police detained approximately 70 Falun Gong followers on their arrival at Keflavik International Airport; they were released late that night. The detainees did not allege mistreatment. Falun Gong representatives demanded an apology from the Government, which met them after significant pressure. On June 14, approximately 500 persons assembled peacefully in front of the parliament building (see Section 2.c.) to protest Chinese policies and Government actions against Falun Gong demonstrators. The Government's treatment of Falun Gong members provoked heavy criticism within the country from politicians, the media, and the public.    c. Freedom of Religion    The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respected this right in practice. The State financially supported and promoted the official religion, Lutheranism. The State directly paid the salaries of the 146 ministers in the State Lutheran Church, and these ministers were considered to be public servants under the Ministry of Justice and Ecclesiastical Affairs (MOJ); however, the Church was autonomous in its internal affairs. The Government did not pay Lutheran ministers in the nonstate churches, also known as Free Churches.    All citizens 16 years of age and older had to pay a church tax of approximately $73 (isk 6,800) per year. For persons who were not registered as belonging to a religious organization, or who belonged to one that was not registered and recognized officially by the Government, the tax payment went to the University of Iceland, a secular institution.    The law sets specific conditions and procedures that religious organizations must follow to be registered by the Government. Such recognition was necessary for religious organizations other than the state church to receive a per capita share of church tax funds from the Government. The law applies only to religious organizations that are seeking to be, or are already, officially recognized and registered. No restrictions or requirements were placed on unregistered religious organizations, which had the same rights as other groups in society.    By law religious instruction in Christianity is required in the public schools; however, students may be exempted.    In June Falun Gong followers from China experienced entry difficulty and detention in connection with the visit of Chinese President Jiang Zemin (see Section 2.b.).    For a more detailed discussion see the  2002 International Religious Freedom Report .    d. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign Travel, Emigration, and Repatriation    The Constitution provides for these rights, and the Government generally respected them in practice.    Although neither the Constitution nor the law includes provisions for the granting of refugee or asylum status in accordance with the 1951 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, in practice the Government adjudicated cases in accordance with their provisions. The Government cooperated with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other humanitarian organizations in assisting refugees. In May the Government adopted the Act on Foreigners, which is scheduled to enter into force in January 2003. There was concern that the 1965 Supervision of Foreigners Law gives police and customs officers at ports of entry too much discretion to deny admission to asylum seekers whose claims they deem not credible. The new law will provide guidelines on the granting of asylum and refugee status, particularly that only the Directorate of Immigration will have the discretion to deny admission to asylum seekers.    In 2001 the country became part of the Schengen free travel area, resulting in the elimination of formal border controls on the movement of persons into the country from other Schengen countries.    The Government has not formulated a policy of first asylum. Because of the country's geographic isolation, the question of first asylum rarely has arisen; however, the Directorate of Immigration and the Icelandic Red Cross (which housed and assisted asylum seekers under a Government contract) reported that 94 persons had applied for asylum by October, compared with 52 in 2001. Of these 33 were sent to other countries and 60 withdrew their applications or disappeared. At year's end, the applications of 18 persons still were being processed. Most asylum seekers applied for asylum after entering the country, rather than in the international sector (airside) of the airport. Official asylum procedures require that asylum seekers who are admitted into the country be turned over immediately to the Icelandic Red Cross and the Directorate of Immigration for processing and care. Processing of asylum cases could take 1 year or more, during which time asylum seekers were eligible for state-subsidized health care but could not work or enroll their children in public schools.    In June Falun Gong supporters visiting from China were detained for a brief period (see Section 2.b.).    The Government planned to receive 10 to 15 UNHCR-designated quota refugees during the year, substantially fewer than in previous years. However, no refugees were accepted during the year due to a reduction in funding.    There were no reports of the forced return of persons to a country where they feared persecution.    Section 3.   Respect for Political Rights: The Right of Citizens to Change Their Government    The Constitution provides citizens with the right to change their government peacefully, and citizens exercise this right in practice through periodic, free, and fair elections held on the basis of universal suffrage. The last elections to the Althingi, the unicameral legislature, were held in 1999.    A center-right coalition has governed since 1991. The next national elections are scheduled for May 2003. There were 23 women in the 63-member Parliament, 3 women in the 12-member Cabinet, and 2 on the 9-member Supreme Court. In April the Government gave foreigners who have resided in the country legally for 5 years or more the right to vote in municipal elections.    Section 4.   Governmental Attitude Regarding International and Nongovernmental Investigation of Alleged Violations of Human Rights    A number of domestic and international human rights groups generally operated without government restriction, investigating and publishing their findings on human rights cases. Government officials were cooperative and responsive to their views. An independent Ombudsman, elected by the Parliament, monitors national and local authorities to ensure equal protection of persons residing in the country, whether citizens or aliens. Complaints may be lodged with the Ombudsman regarding decisions, procedures, and conduct of public officials and government agencies. The Ombudsman may demand official reports, documents, and records and may summon officials to give testimony. The Ombudsman has access to official premises. While the Ombudsman's conclusions are not binding on the authorities, his recommendations normally have been followed, and he made annual reports of his work to the Parliament. There was also a Children's Ombudsman (see Section 5).    Section 5.   Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Disability, Language, or Social Status    The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on these factors. The population was strongly egalitarian and opposed discrimination based on any of these factors.  Women    The law prohibits domestic violence and rape, including spousal rape. Violence against women continued to be a problem, with gang rapes reportedly becoming more frequent during the year. Police statistics indicated that the incidence of violence against women--including rape and sexual assault--was low; however, the number of women seeking assistance at the public women's shelter, the counseling center, and the emergency ward of the National Hospital indicated that many incidents go unreported. Each year about 100 women ask for temporary lodging at the women's shelter, while 300 to 400 women and children seek assistance at the counseling center. During the year, they had 410 visitors, 225 of whom came to the center for the first time.   The Government helped finance various facilities and organizations that provided assistance to victims of violence. The City of Reykjavik, in addition to partially funding such services, provided help to immigrant women in abusive relationships, offering emergency accommodation, counseling, and information on legal rights. Courts could issue restraining orders. Victims of sexual crimes were entitled, under the Criminal Code, to lawyers to advise them of their legal rights and help them pursue cases against the alleged assailants. However, a large majority of victims declined to press charges or chose to forgo trial, in part to avoid unwanted publicity in a small, tightly knit society. Some local human rights monitors also attributed underreporting to the fact that convictions traditionally yield light sentences: The maximum penalty for rape is 16 years' imprisonment, but the actual sentences imposed typically are much closer to the minimum sentence of 1 year.   Prostitution is not illegal, but it is illegal to engage in prostitution as a main source of income. It is also illegal to act as an intermediary in the sale or procurement of sex. There were reports that some foreign women were trafficked to work as striptease dancers (see Section 6.f.).    The rate of participation by women in the labor market was high at over 80 percent. In part this reflected the country's comprehensive system of subsidized day care, which made work outside the home more affordable and convenient for parents. The law requires that preference be given to hiring and promoting women in areas where they are underrepresented, as long as they are equal in all other respects to male job seekers. Despite laws that require equal pay for equal work, a pay gap existed between men and women. According to one of the largest labor unions, women on average earned 16 percent less than men in 2001. A 12 percent difference in pay may be attributable to the fact that men work on average 4.2 hours more a week than women.    Fathers had the same right as mothers to paid leave upon the birth of a child. Under the law, which is expected to be fully implemented in 2003, both mothers and fathers would be allowed to take 3 months of paid leave (at 80 percent of the normal salary), with an additional 3 months that can be taken by either parent or shared between them. Previously a mother was given 6 months of paid maternity leave and the father just 2 weeks. The new leave requirements apply equally to the public and private sectors.    Children    The Government was strongly committed to children's rights and welfare; it amply funded a system of public education and health care. School attendance was compulsory through the age of 15 and free through public university level. Approximately 85 percent of students continued to upper secondary education, which was financed completely by the Government. The Government provided free prenatal and infant medical care, as well as heavily subsidized childcare. The Children's Ombudsman, appointed by the Prime Minister but independent from the Government, fulfilled its mandate to protect children's rights, interests, and welfare by, among other things, exerting influence on legislation, government decisions, and public attitudes. When investigating complaints, the Ombudsman had access to all of the country's public and private institutions and associations that house children or otherwise care for them. However, the Ombudsman's conclusions were not legally binding on parties to disputes. The government-funded Agency for Child Protection coordinated the work of approximately 40 committees around the country that were responsible for managing child protection issues (for example, adoption and foster care) in their local areas. In June, Law number 80/2002 article 7 went into effect, raising the minimum size of child protection areas from 200 to 1,500 inhabitants. The change was made to address concerns about conflicts of interest and improper influence. The law also took away the committees' power to terminate parental rights and provided that longer-term care decisions must be adjudicated in court. The Agency also operated eight treatment centers and a diagnostic facility for abused and troubled minors.    There was no societal pattern of abuse directed against children. In an effort to improve the rate of prosecution of child sexual abuse and lessen the trauma to the child, the Government established the Children's Assessment Center (Barnahus). The center, which handled 100 to 125 cases annually, was intended to create a safe and secure environment where child victims feel more comfortable talking about what happened to them. The center brought together police, prosecutors, judges, doctors, and officials from child protection services. Under a 2000 Supreme Court ruling, a district court judge could hold an investigatory interview in the courthouse rather than at the center. Human rights observers criticized this ruling as a step backward in the protection of children's rights.    Human rights observers also criticized the establishment of a national health database that included children. Medical records of children under the age of 18 automatically were entered into the database unless their legal guardians requested otherwise. On reaching the age of 18, a person could elect to discontinue their inclusion in the database, but information already stored could not be withdrawn (see Section 1.f.).    Persons with Disabilities    There was no reported discrimination against persons with disabilities in employment, education, or the provision of other state services. The law provides that such persons have the right to all common national and municipal services and provides that they be given assistance to make it possible for them to live and work normally in society. The law also provides that persons with disabilities receive preference for a government job when they are qualified equally, or more qualified, than regular applicants.    Building regulations require that public accommodations and government buildings, including elevators, be accessible to persons in wheelchairs. The regulations also specify that one percent of parking spaces (a minimum of one space) be reserved for persons with disabilities. The regulations also specify that, to the extent possible, the sidewalk outside the main entrance of such a building be heated so that it remains clear of ice and snow. Violations of these regulations are punishable by a fine or a jail sentence of up to 2 years; however, the main association for persons with disabilities has complained that enforcement is lax and that penalties rarely are assessed for noncompliance.    In 2000 the Supreme Court ruled that the reduction of social security payments to persons with disabilities based on the income of their spouses violated constitutional protections regarding equality and support for persons with disabilities. In response, Parliament in 2001 increased the minimum payment to persons with disabilities who have able-bodied spouses, but continued to subject benefits to a modified means test. The Association of Disabled Persons protested that the legislation did not comply with the Supreme Court ruling and challenged the law in court. The case was on appeal at year's end.   While significant progress has been made in addressing the concerns and needs of persons with physical disabilities, some mental health advocates criticized the Government for not devoting sufficient attention and resources to the care of persons with mental disabilities.    National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities    There is no law that prohibits organizations that promote and incite racial discrimination. The Prime Minister and others expressed concern that the rapidly increasing number of foreigners entering the country to meet labor shortages could lead to future problems, especially in the event of an economic downturn. According to the National Statistical Office, at the end of 2001, 9,850 foreigners were living in the country, approximately 3 percent of the population. Many temporary workers come from Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and the Directorate of Immigration expected most to seek to remain permanently rather than return to their countries of origin. The term nbar--newcomer--has taken on a negative connotation according to human rights observers and is increasingly applied to immigrants of color. Asian women in public at night reportedly were taunted on the assumption that they were prostitutes, and minority children were teased for allegedly having been purchased on the Internet. In September a Gallup Poll revealed that only 27 percent of citizens aged 45 to 54 had positive feelings toward foreigners; however, nearly half the 16- to 24-year-olds had positive feelings.    The City of Reykjavik, together with three other municipalities and the Icelandic Red Cross, operated an Intercultural Center that helps foreigners adjust to living in the country. The center offered free translation, education, research, and advice services. The Ministry of Social Affairs operated a Multicultural Center in Isafjordur that facilitated the interaction of citizens with foreign nationals and provided support services for foreign nationals in rural municipalities.    Human rights observers continued to express concern about a tiny ultranationalist organization, Iceland for Icelanders, which was founded in 1997 with the goal of limiting the further settlement of foreigners in the country to persons of European origin. In 2001 the Supreme Court fined the deputy leader of the organization for making disparaging remarks about foreigners in a newspaper interview.    Section 6.  Worker Rights    a. The Right of Association    The Constitution provides for the right of workers to establish unions, draw up their own constitutions and rules, choose their own leaders and policies, and publicize their views, and workers exercised these rights. Labor unions were independent of the Government and political parties. Approximately 85 percent of all eligible workers belonged to unions.    Labor courts effectively adjudicated disputes over contracts and over the rights provided by the law, which prohibits antiunion discrimination. By law employers found guilty of antiunion discrimination are required to reinstate workers fired for union activities; however, in practice the charges often were difficult to prove.    Unions were permitted to affiliate internationally, and they took active part in Nordic, European, and other international trade union bodies.    b. The Right to Organize and Bargain Collectively    Union membership is not impeded by law or practice. Employers were required to withhold union dues (one percent of gross pay) from the pay of all employees, whether or not they were union members, to help support disability, strike and pension funds and other benefits to which all workers are entitled. Trade unions and management organizations periodically negotiate collective bargaining agreements that set specific terms for workers' pay, hours, and other conditions. Collective bargaining agreements were negotiated in 2000, and most are scheduled to expire in 2003 and 2004. The Government played a minor role in the bargaining process, providing mediation assistance in a few cases (through the State Mediator's Office).    The Icelandic Federation of Labor (IFL) lost two lawsuits in 2001 in which it charged that Parliament's intervention in the fish industry strike violated the seamen's constitutional rights to associate freely and to bargain collectively (see Section 6.a.). In December 2001, the IFL made the same complaints to the International Labor Organization (ILO). The Government answered ILO questions in August, and the case remained open at the end of the year.    With the exception of limited categories of workers in the public sector whose services are essential to public health or safety, unions have the right to strike. There were no strikes during the year. There were no export processing zones.    c. Prohibition of Forced or Bonded Labor    The law prohibits forced or bonded labor, including by children, and there were no reports that such practices occurred. Work permit practices left newly arrived foreign workers vulnerable to abuse by employers (see Section 6.e.).    d. Status of Child Labor Practices and Minimum Age for Employment    The law prohibits the employment of children younger than age 16 in factories, on ships, or in other places that are hazardous or require hard labor; this prohibition is observed in practice. Children 14 or 15 years old may be employed part time or during school vacations in light, nonhazardous work. Their work hours must not exceed the ordinary work hours of adults in the same occupation. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration enforced child labor regulations effectively.    e. Acceptable Conditions of Work    No minimum wage is mandated by law, but the minimum wages negotiated in various collective bargaining agreements applied automatically to all employees in those occupations, whether they were union members or not. Labor contracts provided a decent standard of living for a worker and family.    The standard legal workweek was 40 hours, which included nearly 3 hours of paid breaks a week. Work exceeding 8 hours in a workday must be compensated as overtime. Workers were entitled to 11 hours of rest within each 24-hour period and to a day off every week. Under defined special circumstances, the 11-hour rest period could be reduced to 8 hours, but workers would then have to be compensated with 1.5 hours of rest for every hour received less than 11 hours. The day off could be postponed by 1 week, in which case the worker had a right to 2 additional hours off the following week.    Health and safety standards were set by Parliament and administered and enforced by the Ministry of Social Affairs through its Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which could close down workplaces until safety and health standards were met. Workers had a collective, not an individual, right to refuse to work in a place that did not meet occupational safety and health criteria. Firing workers who report unsafe or unhealthy conditions was illegal.    The Government's practice of issuing work permits for newly arrived foreign workers or refugees to the employer rather than to the employee made workers vulnerable to abuse by the employer in some instances (see Section 5).    f. Trafficking in Persons    The law does not prohibit specifically trafficking in persons, although a number of legal provisions may be used to prosecute such cases. There were reports that women were trafficked to and within the country.    Article 206 of the Constitution specifies imprisonment for a conviction of facilitating a minor's entry or departure from the country if the purpose was commercial sex or if the victim was unaware of the genuine purpose, as through fraud. Criminal procedures also provide that victims may testify at government expense against traffickers. However, no person has ever been arrested or charged with trafficking in persons.    The 1984 Extradition Law provides that a person may be extradited as long as the offense involved would be punishable by more than 1 year's imprisonment. Article 206 of the general penal code provides for a sentence of up to 4 years imprisonment for an offense tantamount to trafficking in persons; therefore the law would allow the extradition of persons who were charged with trafficking in other countries.    Evidence of trafficking has been reported by police, NGOs, researchers and foreign diplomats, mainly in connection with foreign women who entered the country to work in striptease clubs. There was an assumption that some women travelling to Iceland to work in the country's striptease clubs were victims of trafficking. Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia and the former Soviet Union were the main countries of origin for these dancers, but there were no statistics on the number or origin of women actually trafficked. While most attention has been focused on the country as a possible destination point for trafficked women, there have been some cases during the year that indicated that the country was also being used as a transit point for the movement of trafficked women between Europe and North America. There were no reliable estimates on how many women this may have involved.    Parliament in 2000 closed a loophole that allowed striptease dancers to enter the country as artists and perform without a work permit for up to 4 weeks. Subsequently, in order to work as a striptease dancer, any foreigner from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) was required first to obtain a work permit, which was typically valid for 3 months. Due to the action of government authorities in denying work and residence permits, the influx of nightclub dancers from outside the EEA slowed considerably in the second half of 2001. During the year the number of foreign dancers plummeted following a ban by Reykjavik authorities on private dances that served as a front for prostitution. At the end of the year, club owners were contesting the ban in the courts.    There were two cases since 2001 of foreign striptease dancers complaining to police that a club owner had pressured them into prostitution. The police investigation, which involved a total of six women from Estonia and Denmark, concluded without any charges being brought against the club owner. Foreign embassies reported that they had helped to repatriate women who realized upon arrival that they had been deceived concerning the work that they were expected to perform. Many employers required their dancers to live in small, crowded group houses provided by the clubs. Some clubs allegedly restricted their dancers' movement, enforced a curfew, and kept dancers under constant surveillance, confiscating their passports and airline tickets and warning them not to fraternize with persons outside work. The club owners reportedly limited the dancers' stay in the country to minimize the number of contacts that the women could make, moving them quickly to the next country and job.    Victims of trafficking could seek help at the women's shelter, counseling center, and hospital, all of which were government funded. There were no domestic NGOs dedicated solely to assisting victims of trafficking, nor was there an established government assistance program. Some NGOs provided government-supported counseling and shelter to women and children who were victims of violence or sexual abuse. The Icelandic Human Rights Center, which is also government funded, assisted with trafficking cases and made referrals (see Section 5).    There were no ongoing information, public awareness, or other antitrafficking programs during the year.                        This site is managed by the Bureau of Public Affairs, U.S.                 Department of State.
