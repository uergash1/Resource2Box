GX060-11-15629940	[Federal Register: June 30, 1995 (Volume 60, Number 126)] [Notices]                [Page 34303-34304] From the Federal Register Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov] [DOCID:fr30jn95-110]   ======================================================================= -----------------------------------------------------------------------  LIBRARY OF CONGRESS  Copyright Office [Docket No. RM 94-4A]    Cable Compulsory License: Specialty Station List  AGENCY: Copyright Office, Library of Congress.  ACTION: Notice of final specialty station list.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  SUMMARY: The Copyright Office is publishing a new and final list of  specialty stations that sent us affidavits claiming they meet specialty  station requirements. A specialty station is a commercial broadcast  television station that meets requirements set by the Federal  Communications Commission under its former distant signal carriage  rules at 47 CFR 76.5(kk)(1981). The Office will refer to the list to  check broadcast station status when cable systems file semi-annual  statements of account under 17 U.S.C. 111.  EFFECTIVE DATE: July 1, 1995.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Marilyn J. Kretsinger, Acting General Counsel, Copyright GC/I&R, P.O.  Box 70400, Southwest Station, Washington, DC 20024. Telephone: (202)  707-8380. Fax: (202) 707-8366.  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the cable compulsory license, section  111 of title 17, United States Code, carriage of a specialty station  \1\ by a cable operator allows the operator to pay copyright fees at a  lower rate than the 3.75% rate that is usually incurred by an operator  when it carries non-permitted signals. Specialty station status is  determined by reference to former regulations of the Federal  Communications Commission at 47 CFR 76.5(kk)(1981). The FCC no longer  determines whether or not a station qualifies as a specialty station,  however, the Copyright Office updates the specialty station list  periodically, because the list remains relevant in connection with the  filing of statements of account by cable operators.      \1\ The FCC defined a specialty station as ``a commercial  television broadcast station that generally carries foreign- language, religious, and/or automated programming in one-third of  the hours of an average broadcast week and one-third of weekly  prime-time hours.'' 47 CFR 76.5(kk)(1976). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      The Office created its first specialty station list in 1990, and  stated that it would compile new lists at approximately three year  intervals. Early this year we published a request for affidavits from  stations claiming current specialty station status. 60 FR 4639 (January  24, 1995). We extended the filing deadline from March 27, 1995, to  April 24, 1995, in order to accommodate specialty station owners who  had been unaware that we were updating the list. 60 FR 1826 (April  1995). On May 9, 1995, we published a list of stations whose affidavits  we had received, and requested that any party objecting to any claim to  specialty station status submit comments to the Office stating its  objections. 60 FR 24659 (May 9, 1995). We received no comments or  objections.The Office now publishes a final list of specialty stations,  effective July 1, 1995, for the accounting period 1995/2 and  thereafter. Copyright Office examiners will refer to this final  specialty station list in examining cable systems' claims on their  statements of account that particular broadcast stations they carry are  specialty stations. Although the Office does not officially place  stations filing affidavits after the closing date on the specialty  station list, we will accept these affidavits without objection. These  late claims will be placed in the public file in the Licensing Division  for reference purposes. If a cable system claims specialty station  status for a station not on this list, the examiner will determine  whether the station has filed an affidavit since the closing date for  submitting claims (April 24, 1995).

In the last few years, the impact of such occurrences on the environment and    concern about their future frequency have brought the maritime industry under    increased scrutiny.    To reduce the potential for oil spills, members of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) agreed in April 2001 to a 2015 deadline on the worldwide phaseout of most single-hulled oil tankers in favor of the added protection provided by double-hulled vessels. 1  Other international actions underway include a ban on the use of ship hull paints that contain toxic tributyltin (TBT) 2  and establishment of guidelines for dismantling obsolete ships. 3  In addition, the IMO is working within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to reduce ship greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which contribute to global warming.     In the United States, pressure on shipping is coming from several directions. Ports are being assessed by state and regional officials, who are having difficulty meeting their commitments under the Clean Air Act. The Port of Los Angeles has, for instance, developed a program for the reduction of diesel particulate and smog-forming emissions, and the Port of Houston has conducted a comprehensive study of vessel air emissions. In July 2000, an environmental group published a report,  A Stacked Deck: Air Pollution from Large Ships,  reporting data on emissions of nitrogen oxide, sulfur, and GHGs from Category 3 ships. 4  The report contained data estimated by the Sea Emissions Assessment project at Carnegie Melon University. This ongoing project has produced a globally mapped inventory of emissions from commercial ship engines operating internationally and estimates these emissions at more than 14 percent of all nitrogen emissions from global fuel combustion and more than 16 percent of sulfur emissions from world petroleum use. The project has estimated that 747 thousand metric tons of nitrogen oxides (NOx) are annually emitted from foreign and domestic ships in U.S. waters. 5  The EPA National Emissions Trends database, which takes a different approach in estimating emissions, attributed 1,008 thousand short tons (916 thousand metric tons) of NOx to commercial marine vessels in 1998. Bluewater Network sued EPA for not regulating ship emissions, and in January 2001 the agency agreed in a settlement to establish air emission standards for Category 3 ships.     Cruise Ships    Public attention on the environmental impacts of shipping has been especially    focused on the cruise industry. The Bluewater Network initiated a Cruise Ship    Campaign in early 2000 with a petition to the EPA detailing various water discharges    (see  table 1 ). The petition    suggested that not only was enforcement of existing laws weak but that these    laws did not adequately address the problems. In response to the 2000 petition,    EPA established a multiyear Cruise Ship Discharges Assessment study.     Previously, the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) had conducted a limited study on cruise ship marine pollution. 6  The report found that between 1993 and 1998, foreign-flag cruise ships were involved in 87 confirmed illegal discharge cases in U.S. waters. A few of the cases included multiple illegal discharge incidents occurring over the 6-year period. Eighty-three percent of the cases involved discharges of oil or oil-based products, the volume of which ranged from a few drops to hundreds of gallons. The balance of the cases were discharges of plastic or garbage. GAO judged that 72 percent of the illegal discharges were accidental. The 87 cruise ship cases represented 4 percent of the 2,400 foreign-flag commercial ship illegal discharge cases confirmed during the 6 years studied.     Concerned about the growth of cruise ship activity in their coastal waters, but recognizing the lack of comprehensive data on ship discharges, California and Alaska set up task forces to collect data on ship effluents and air emissions. California’s Cruise Ship Environmental Task Force began its work in 2001 and is required to report to the state legislature in June 2003. Alaska collected data during the 2000 summer cruise season and released a draft final report in May 2001. The data collected showed that no ship tested was in full compliance with all standards. For instance, treated blackwater (sewage) exceeded federal standards for fecal coliform in 75 percent of the samples and exceeded standards for total dissolved solids in 86 percent of the samples. In addition, gray water (which is not regulated by federal standards) showed high concentrations of fecal coliform 7  which should not be present at all. The air emissions data was less definitive because only ambient monitoring was conducted. In June 2001, the Alaska state legislature passed new legislation regulating cruise ship discharges and emissions. It requires a program of sampling, testing, and reporting of wastewater and air discharges and enforceable standards for anything cruise ships may discharge in Alaska waters.    In the midst of state activity on cruise ships, the U.S. Congress passed a law (Public Law 106-554), in December 2000, that placed new requirements on ships in waters off Alaska. The U.S. Coast Guard took its first penalty action under this new law against the cruise ship Norwegian Sky on May 4, 2001. Lab results of samples of treated effluent discharges showed fecal coliform counts of 700,000 per 100 milliliters and total suspended solids (TSS) of 27,000 milligrams per liter. Federal standards are 200 fecal coliform per 100 milliliters and 150 milligrams per liter of TSS. A third citation was issued in June 2001. These and other data collected in Alaska suggest that the current marine sanitary devices (MSDs) that ships use to treat blackwater may not always be effective, especially as MSDs age. 8  The discharge standards were adopted in 1976, based on the technology in use at the time.    On the industry side, a year after the Florida-Caribbean Cruise Association signed a Memorandum of Understanding regarding environmental practices and policies with Florida, the International Council of Cruise Lines (ICCL) announced in June 2001 that its members had adopted mandatory environmental standards for all association cruise ships. The standards, which specify acceptable waste management methods, cover graywater and blackwater discharges; hazardous chemical waste such as photo processing fluid and dry-cleaning chemicals; unused and outdated pharmaceuticals; and used batteries and fluorescent and mercury vapor lightbulbs.      1  The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 set a phase out schedule (by ship size, age) of oil shipments in U.S. waters in single-hulled ships from 1995 to 2015. From January 2015 onward, single-hulled oil shipments are banned in U.S. waters.     2  TBT is an antifouling agent, a biocide, that prevents the growth of algae, barnacles, and other marine organisms on ship hulls. It leaches from the paint, thereby entering the marine environment and accumulates in sediments, especially in harbors and ports.     3  This action was taken under the Basel Convention on the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal.     4  Category 3 is an EPA classification for large, ocean-going vessels.     5  Ship Emissions Assessment at  http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/~jcorbett/SEA.html     6  U.S. General Accounting Office,  Marine Pollution: Progress Made to Reduce Marine Pollution by Cruise Ships, but Important Issues Remain,  GAO/RCED-00-48, February 2000.     7  Fecal coliform indicates the possible presence of human or warm-blooded animal waste.     8  U.S. EPA, Cruise Ship White Paper, Aug. 22, 2000.                                                                                                     Accessibility  |      Disclaimer  |      Freedom of Information Act  |      Privacy           FedStats  |      FirstGov  |      White House              U.S. Department of Transportation     Bureau of Transportation Statistics      400 7th Street, SW • Room 3103 • Washington, DC 20590     L'Enfant Plaza Metrorail Station (7th and D Streets)         800-853-1351 •          answers@bts.gov          Directions

The petition    suggested that not only was enforcement of existing laws weak but that these    laws did not adequately address the problems. In response to the 2000 petition,    EPA established a multiyear Cruise Ship Discharges Assessment study.     Previously, the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) had conducted a limited study on cruise ship marine pollution. 6  The report found that between 1993 and 1998, foreign-flag cruise ships were involved in 87 confirmed illegal discharge cases in U.S. waters. A few of the cases included multiple illegal discharge incidents occurring over the 6-year period. Eighty-three percent of the cases involved discharges of oil or oil-based products, the volume of which ranged from a few drops to hundreds of gallons. The balance of the cases were discharges of plastic or garbage. GAO judged that 72 percent of the illegal discharges were accidental. The 87 cruise ship cases represented 4 percent of the 2,400 foreign-flag commercial ship illegal discharge cases confirmed during the 6 years studied.     Concerned about the growth of cruise ship activity in their coastal waters, but recognizing the lack of comprehensive data on ship discharges, California and Alaska set up task forces to collect data on ship effluents and air emissions. California’s Cruise Ship Environmental Task Force began its work in 2001 and is required to report to the state legislature in June 2003. Alaska collected data during the 2000 summer cruise season and released a draft final report in May 2001. The data collected showed that no ship tested was in full compliance with all standards. For instance, treated blackwater (sewage) exceeded federal standards for fecal coliform in 75 percent of the samples and exceeded standards for total dissolved solids in 86 percent of the samples. In addition, gray water (which is not regulated by federal standards) showed high concentrations of fecal coliform 7  which should not be present at all. The air emissions data was less definitive because only ambient monitoring was conducted. In June 2001, the Alaska state legislature passed new legislation regulating cruise ship discharges and emissions. It requires a program of sampling, testing, and reporting of wastewater and air discharges and enforceable standards for anything cruise ships may discharge in Alaska waters.    In the midst of state activity on cruise ships, the U.S. Congress passed a law (Public Law 106-554), in December 2000, that placed new requirements on ships in waters off Alaska. The U.S. Coast Guard took its first penalty action under this new law against the cruise ship Norwegian Sky on May 4, 2001. Lab results of samples of treated effluent discharges showed fecal coliform counts of 700,000 per 100 milliliters and total suspended solids (TSS) of 27,000 milligrams per liter. Federal standards are 200 fecal coliform per 100 milliliters and 150 milligrams per liter of TSS. A third citation was issued in June 2001. These and other data collected in Alaska suggest that the current marine sanitary devices (MSDs) that ships use to treat blackwater may not always be effective, especially as MSDs age. 8  The discharge standards were adopted in 1976, based on the technology in use at the time.    On the industry side, a year after the Florida-Caribbean Cruise Association signed a Memorandum of Understanding regarding environmental practices and policies with Florida, the International Council of Cruise Lines (ICCL) announced in June 2001 that its members had adopted mandatory environmental standards for all association cruise ships. The standards, which specify acceptable waste management methods, cover graywater and blackwater discharges; hazardous chemical waste such as photo processing fluid and dry-cleaning chemicals; unused and outdated pharmaceuticals; and used batteries and fluorescent and mercury vapor lightbulbs.      1  The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 set a phase out schedule (by ship size, age) of oil shipments in U.S. waters in single-hulled ships from 1995 to 2015. From January 2015 onward, single-hulled oil shipments are banned in U.S. waters.     2  TBT is an antifouling agent, a biocide, that prevents the growth of algae, barnacles, and other marine organisms on ship hulls. It leaches from the paint, thereby entering the marine environment and accumulates in sediments, especially in harbors and ports.     3  This action was taken under the Basel Convention on the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal.     4  Category 3 is an EPA classification for large, ocean-going vessels.     5  Ship Emissions Assessment at  http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/~jcorbett/SEA.html     6  U.S. General Accounting Office,  Marine Pollution: Progress Made to Reduce Marine Pollution by Cruise Ships, but Important Issues Remain,  GAO/RCED-00-48, February 2000.     7  Fecal coliform indicates the possible presence of human or warm-blooded animal waste.     8  U.S. EPA, Cruise Ship White Paper, Aug. 22, 2000.                                                                                                     Accessibility  |      Disclaimer  |      Freedom of Information Act  |      Privacy           FedStats  |      FirstGov  |      White House              U.S. Department of Transportation     Bureau of Transportation Statistics      400 7th Street, SW • Room 3103 • Washington, DC 20590     L'Enfant Plaza Metrorail Station (7th and D Streets)         800-853-1351 •          answers@bts.gov          Directions

In the last few years, the impact of such occurrences on the environment and    concern about their future frequency have brought the maritime industry under    increased scrutiny.    To reduce the potential for oil spills, members of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) agreed in April 2001 to a 2015 deadline on the worldwide phaseout of most single-hulled oil tankers in favor of the added protection provided by double-hulled vessels. 1  Other international actions underway include a ban on the use of ship hull paints that contain toxic tributyltin (TBT) 2  and establishment of guidelines for dismantling obsolete ships. 3  In addition, the IMO is working within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to reduce ship greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which contribute to global warming.     In the United States, pressure on shipping is coming from several directions. Ports are being assessed by state and regional officials, who are having difficulty meeting their commitments under the Clean Air Act. The Port of Los Angeles has, for instance, developed a program for the reduction of diesel particulate and smog-forming emissions, and the Port of Houston has conducted a comprehensive study of vessel air emissions. In July 2000, an environmental group published a report,  A Stacked Deck: Air Pollution from Large Ships,  reporting data on emissions of nitrogen oxide, sulfur, and GHGs from Category 3 ships. 4  The report contained data estimated by the Sea Emissions Assessment project at Carnegie Melon University. This ongoing project has produced a globally mapped inventory of emissions from commercial ship engines operating internationally and estimates these emissions at more than 14 percent of all nitrogen emissions from global fuel combustion and more than 16 percent of sulfur emissions from world petroleum use. The project has estimated that 747 thousand metric tons of nitrogen oxides (NOx) are annually emitted from foreign and domestic ships in U.S. waters. 5  The EPA National Emissions Trends database, which takes a different approach in estimating emissions, attributed 1,008 thousand short tons (916 thousand metric tons) of NOx to commercial marine vessels in 1998. Bluewater Network sued EPA for not regulating ship emissions, and in January 2001 the agency agreed in a settlement to establish air emission standards for Category 3 ships.     Cruise Ships    Public attention on the environmental impacts of shipping has been especially    focused on the cruise industry.

ACTION: Notice of filings, request for comments.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  SUMMARY: The Copyright Office is publishing a list of stations that  sent us affidavits claiming that they legally qualify for specialty  station status. Specialty station status means a commercial broadcast  television station qualifies as a specialty station under former  distant signal carriage rules of the Federal Communications Commission  (FCC) for purposes of administering section 111 of title 17, United  States Code. Any party objecting to a listed station's claim should  send the objection and the reasons for it to the Copyright Office.  DATES: Comments must be received by June 8, 1995. The effective date of  the annotated list will coincide with the beginning of the accounting  period that starts after the final list is published in the Federal  Register.  ADDRESSES: By Mail: Copyright GC/I&R, P.O. Box 70400, Southwest  Station, Washington, DC 20024. By Hand: Office of the General Counsel,  U.S. Copyright Office, James Madison Memorial Building, Room LM 407.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Marilyn J. Kretsinger, Acting General  Counsel, Copyright GC/I&R, P.O. Box 70400, Southwest Station,  Washington, D.C. 20024. Telephone: (202) 707-8380. Telefax: (202) 707- 8366.  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Copyright Office is compiling a new  specialty station list of television broadcast stations that qualify as  specialty stations under the former distant signal carriage rules of  the Federal Communications Commission (47 CFR 76.5(kk)(1981)). We  published a Notice of Inquiry asking qualifying stations to submit  sworn affidavits to the Office stating that the programming of their  stations satisfies the FCC's former requirements for specialty station  status\1\ by March 27, 1995. 60 FR 4639 (January 24, 1995). The number  of filings received indicated that many stations had not seen the  Federal Register notice. To assure the new list is complete, we  extended the deadline to April 24, 1995. 60 FR 18426 (April 11, 1995).      \1\The FCC defined a specialty station as ``a commercial  television broadcast station that generally carries foreign- language, religious, and/or automated programming in one-third of  the hours of an average broadcast week and one-third of weekly  prime-time hours.'' 47 CFR 76.5(kk)(1976). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  Background      The FCC did not consider the specialty station status of distant  signals carried by cable systems after it deleted its distant signal  carriage rules.\2\ However, specialty station status is still relevant  for administration of section 111 of the Copyright Act of 1976, because  specialty stations may be carried as distant signals by cable  television systems at a significantly lower rate than the 3.75% rate  that is usually incurred by a system when it carries non-permitted  signals.      \2\See Malrite T.V. of New York v. FCC, 652 F2d 1140 (2d cir.  1981), cert. den., 454 U.S. 1143 (1982). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------      The Office created its first specialty station list in 1990, and  stated that it would compile a new list at approximately three year  intervals. Ninety stations filed affidavits this year claiming  specialty station status. These stations are listed below. We ask that  any party who objects to another party's claim to specialty station  status submit specific and factual comments as to which station(s) they  object to, and why. The Office will publish a final annotated list of  specialty stations that includes references to objections to stations'  claims. Cable systems considering carriage of stations as specialty  stations may then verify the station's status and program carriage  before making a final decision.     Copyright Office licensing examiners will refer to the final  annotated specialty station list in examining cable systems' claims on  their Statements of Account that particular stations are specialty  stations. If a cable system claims specialty station status for a  station not on the final annotated list, the examiner will check to see  if the station has filed an affidavit since publication of the list.  Although the Office does not officially place stations filing  affidavits after publication of the final list on this list, it will  accept these affidavits for the record.

GX272-26-5733956	Section 23  Transportation  This section presents data on civil air transportation, both passenger and cargo, and on water transportation, including inland waterways, oceanborne commerce, the merchant marine, cargo, and vessel tonnages. This section also presents statistics on revenues, passenger and freight traffic volume, and employment in various revenue-producing modes of the transportation industry, including motor vehicles, trains, and pipelines. Data are also presented on highway mileage and finances, motor vehicle travel, accidents, and registrations; and characteristics of public transit, railroads, and pipelines. Principal sources of air and water transportation data are the annual National Transportation Statistics, issued by the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics; the Annual Report issued by the Air Transport Association of America, Washington, DC; and the annual Waterborne Commerce of the United States issued by the Corps of Engineers of the Department of the Army. In addition, the U.S. Census Bureau in its commodity transportation survey (part of the census of transportation, taken every 5 years through 1997, for years ending in ``2'' and ``7'') provides data on the type, weight, and value of commodities shipped by manufacturing establishments in the United States, by means of transportation, origin, and destination. The latest complete reports for 1997 are part of the 1997 Economic Census. See text, Section 15, Business Enterprise, for a discussion of the 1997 Economic Census. Additional sources of data on water transportation include Merchant Fleets of the World, issued periodically by the U.S. Maritime Administration; The Bulletin, issued monthly by the American Bureau of Shipping, New York, NY; and the annual World Fleet Statistics.  The principal compiler of data on public roads and on operation of motor vehicles is the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). These data appear in FHWA's annual Highway Statistics and other publications. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issues data on traffic accident deaths and death rates in two annual reports: the Fact Book and the Fatal Accident Reporting System Annual Report. DOTs Federal Railroad Administration presents data on accidents involving railroads in its annual Accident/Incident Bulletin, and the Rail-Highway Crossing Accident/Incident and Inventory Bulletin. The data for the truck transportation component of the 1997 Economic Census are presented in the Truck Inventory and Use Survey. Data are also presented in many nongovernment publications. Among them are the weekly and annual Cars of Revenue Freight Loaded and the annual Yearbook of Railroad Facts, both published by the Association of American Railroads, Washington, DC; Transit Fact Book, containing electric railway and motorbus statistics, published annually by the American Public Transit Association, Washington, DC.; Accident Facts, issued by the National Safety Council, Chicago, IL; and Transportation in America, issued by the Eno Foundation for Transportation, Westport, Connecticut. Civil aviation--Federal promotion and regulation of civil aviation have been carried out by the FAA and the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). The CAB promoted and regulated the civil air transportation industry within the United States and between the United States and foreign countries. The Board granted licenses to provide air transportation service, approved or disapproved proposed rates and fares, and approved or disapproved Transportation 653  U.S. Census Bureau, Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2002   proposed agreements and corporate relationships involving air carriers. In December 1984, the CAB ceased to exist as an agency. Some of its functions were transferred to the Department of Transportation (DOT), as outlined below. The responsibility for investigation of aviation accidents resides with the National Transportation Safety Board. The Office of the Secretary, DOT aviation activities include: negotiation of international air transportation rights, selection of U.S. air carriers to serve capacity controlled international markets, oversight of international rates and fares, maintenance of essential air service to small communities, and consumer affairs. DOT's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) handles aviation information functions formerly assigned to CAB. Prior to BTS, the Research and Special Programs Administration handled these functions. The principal activities of the FAA include: the promotion of air safety; controlling the use of navigable airspace; prescribing regulations dealing with the competency of airmen, airworthiness of aircraft and air traffic control; operation of air route traffic control centers, airport traffic control towers, and flight service stations; the design, construction, maintenance, and inspection of navigation, traffic control, and communications equipment; and the development of general aviation. The CAB published monthly and quarterly financial and traffic statistical data for the certificated route air carriers. BTS continues these publications, including both certificated and noncertificated (commuter) air carriers. The FAA publishes annually data on the use of airway facilities; data related to the location of airmen, aircraft, and airports; the volume of activity in the field of nonair carrier (general aviation) flying; and aircraft production and registration. General aviation comprises all civil flying (including such commercial operations as small demand air taxis, agriculture application, powerline patrol, etc.) but excludes certificated route air carriers, supplemental operators, large-aircraft commercial operators, and commuter airlines. 654 Transportation  Air carriers and service--The CAB previously issued ``certificates of public convenience and necessity'' under Section 401 of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 for scheduled and nonscheduled (charter) passenger services and cargo services. It also issued certificates under Section 418 of the Act to cargo air carriers for domestic all-cargo service only. The DOT Office of the Secretary now issues the certificates under a ``fit, willing, and able'' test of air carrier operations. Carriers operating only a 60-seat-or-less aircraft are given exemption authority to carry passengers, cargo, and mail in scheduled and nonscheduled service under Part 298 of the DOT (formerly CAB) regulations. Exemption authority carriers who offer scheduled passenger service to an essential air service point must meet the ``fit, willing, and able'' test. Vessel shipments, entrances, and clearances--Shipments by dry cargo vessels comprise shipments on all types of watercraft, except tanker vessels; shipments by tanker vessels comprise all types of cargo, liquid and dry, carried by tanker vessels. A vessel is reported as entered only at the first port which it enters in the United States, whether or not cargo is unloaded at that port. A vessel is reported as cleared only at the last port at which clearance is made to a foreign port, whether or not it takes on cargo. Army and Navy vessels entering or clearing without commercial cargo are not included in the figures. Units of measurement--Cargo (or freight) tonnage and shipping weight both represent the gross weight of the cargo including the weight of containers, wrappings, crates, etc. However, shipping weight excludes lift and cargo vans and similar substantial outer containers. Other tonnage figures generally refer to stowing capacity of vessels, 100 cubic feet being called 1 ton. Gross tonnage comprises the space within the frames and the ceiling of the hull, together with those closed-in spaces above deck available for cargo, stores, passengers, or crew, with certain minor exceptions. Net or registered tonnage is the gross tonnage less the spaces occupied by the propelling machinery,  U.S. Census Bureau, Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2002   fuel, crew quarters, master's cabin, and navigation spaces. Substantially, it represents space available for cargo and passengers. The net tonnage capacity of a ship may bear little relation to weight of cargo. Deadweight tonnage is the weight in long tons required to depress a vessel from light water line (that is, with only the machinery and equipment on board) to load line. It is, therefore, the weight of the cargo, fuel, etc., which a vessel is designed to carry with safety. Federal-aid highway systems--The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) of 1991 eliminated the historical Federal-Aid Highway Systems and created the National Highway System (NHS) and other federal-aid highway categories. The final NHS was approved by Congress in December of 1995 under the National Highway System Designation Act. Functional systems--Roads and streets are assigned to groups according to the character of service intended. The functional systems are (1) arterial highways that generally handle the long trips, (2) collector facilities that collect and disperse traffic between the arterials and the lower systems, and (3) local roads and streets that primarily serve direct access to residential areas, farms, and other local areas. Regulatory bodies--The ICC, created by the U.S. Congress to regulate transportation in interstate commerce, has jurisdiction over railroads, trucking companies, bus lines, freight forwarders, water carriers, coal slurry pipelines, and transportation brokers. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is responsible for setting rates and charges for transportation and sale of natural gas and for establishing rates or charges for transportation. Motor carriers--For 1960-73, Class I forhire motor carriers of freight were classified by the ICC as those with $1 million or more of gross annual operating revenue; 1974-79, the class minimum was $3 million. Effective January 1, 1980, Class I carriers are those with $5 million or more in revenue. For 1960-68, Class I motor carriers of passengers were classified by the  ICC as those with $200,000 or more of gross annual operating revenue; for 196976, as those with revenues of $1 million or more; and since 1977, as those with $3 million or more. Effective January 1, 1988, Class I motor carriers of passengers are those with $5 million or more in operating revenues; Class II less than $5 million in operating revenues. Railroads--Railroad companies reporting to the ICC are divided into specific groups as follows: (1) Regular line-haul (interstate) railroads (and their nonoperating subsidiaries), (2) switching and terminal railroads, (3) private railroads prior to 1964 (identified by ICC as ``circular'' because they reported on brief circulars), and (4) unofficial railroads, so designated when their reports are received too late for tabulation. For the most part, the last three groups are not included in the statistics shown here. For years prior to 1978, Class I railroads were those with annual revenues of $1 million or more for 1950-55; $3 million or more for 1956-64; $5 million or more for 1965-75; and $10 million or more for 1976-77. In 1978, the classification became Class I, those having more than $50 million gross annual operating revenue; Class II, from $10 million to $50 million+; and Class III, less than $10 million. Effective January 1, 1982, the ICC adopted a procedure to adjust the threshold for inflation by restating current revenues in constant 1978 dollars. In 1988, the criteria for Class I and Class II railroads were $92.0 million and $18.4 million, respectively. Also effective January 1, 1982, the ICC adopted a Carrier Classification Index Survey Form for carriers not filing annual report Form R-1 with the commission. Class II and Class III railroads are currently exempted from filing any financial report with the Commission. The form is used for reclassifying carriers. The Surface Transportation Board (STB) was established pursuant to the ICC Termination Act of 1995, Pub. L. No. 104-88, 109 Stat. 803 (1995) (ICCTA), to assume certain of the regulatory functions that had been administered by the Interstate Commerce Commission. The Board has broad economic regulatory oversight of railroads, addressing such matters as rate Transportation 655  U.S. Census Bureau, Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2002   reasonableness, car service and interchange, mergers and line acquisitions, line construction, and line abandonments. 49 U.S.C. 10101-11908. Other ICC regulatory functions were either eliminated or transferred to the Federal Highway Administration or the Bureau of Transportation Statistics within DOT. Class I Railroads are regulated by the STB and subject to the Uniform System of Accounts and required to file annual and periodic reports. Railroads are classified based on their annual operating revenues. The class to which a carrier belongs is determined by comparing its adjusted operating revenues for 3 consecutive years to the following scale: Class I, $250 million or more, Class II $20 million to $250 million, and Class III $0 to 20 million. Postal Service--The Postal Service provides mail processing and delivery services within the United States. The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 created the Postal Service, effective July 1971, as an independent establishment of the Federal Executive Branch.  Revenue and cost analysis describes the Postal Service's system of attributing revenues and costs to classes of mail and service. This system draws primarily upon probability sampling techniques to develop estimates of revenues, volumes, and weights, as well as costs by class of mail and special service. The costs attributed to classes of mail and special services are primarily incremental costs which vary in response to changes in volume; they account for roughly 60 percent of the total costs of the Postal Service. The balance represents ``institutional costs.'' Statistics on revenues, volume of mail, and distribution of expenditures are presented in the Postal Service's annual report, Cost and Revenue Analysis, and its Annual Report of the Postmaster General and its annual Comprehensive Statement on Postal Operations. Statistical reliability--For a discussion of statistical collection and estimation, sampling procedures, and measures of statistical reliability applicable to Census Bureau data, see Appendix III.  656 Transportation U.S. Census Bureau, Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2002   No. 1028.Transportation-Related Components of U.S. Gross Domestic Product: 1980 to 2000 [In billions dollars (349.4 represents $349,400,000,000), except percent] Item CURRENT DOLLARS Total transportation-related final demand Total gross domestic product (GDP) . .

GX014-58-11418461	Previous            Next   Home                                            Key Freight Transportation Challenges             National      Security                       For the most part, the freight          transportation system has been designed with productivity in mind. Up          until recently, concerns about security generally focused on controlling          theft and reducing contraband. Less attention was given to the vulnerability          of the freight network to terrorism. The events of September 11, 2001          changed that. The focus is now on preventing attacks and reducing system          vulnerability while keeping commerce moving.          Security involves protecting          transportation assets—facilities, vehicles, and supporting infrastructure          (communications structures and power stations)—from a host of potential          threats. Security also involves protecting transportation assets from          being used as instruments in carrying out terrorist attacks on civilian,          industrial, or military targets. The use of commercial aircraft in the          attacks of September 11th and the use of a rental truck to bomb the federal          building in Oklahoma City are two painful examples.                                                     The          Port of Oakland is one of the top 10           container ports in the United States.            Source: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers                                   Because of its accessibility,          extent, and diversity, the U.S. transportation system presents many opportunities          for terrorists both from within and outside the United States. In particular,          the freight sector’s increasing dependence on the use of containers,          intermodal transport, and global supply chains poses multiple security          risks. In 2001, an estimated 19 million containers entered the United          States through water ports and land ports. Few containers are tracked          as they are transported to their final destinations, and the routes used          are often in close proximity to some of America’s most populated          cities.          Given these risks, several          freight security priorities have emerged. The top priority is general          cargo in international commerce. Because of the potential for a “bomb          in a box,” the priority given to container and containership security          is understandable. Domestically, the major focus is on hazardous materials          transport, which relates primarily to highway and railroad operations.          Other top priorities include air cargo services, domestic general commodity          movements, and exports. Prior to September 11, these movements received          only sporadic attention.                                              To          ensure cargo security, tracking technologies           like this one are being field tested by the           International Mobility and Trade Corridor partnership in the Pacific Northwest.           Source: Transcor                                   Information about ownership          and location of containers as they move from origin to destination is          crucial in reducing the vulnerability of the freight transportation network          and related infrastructure. A system of tracking containers and identifying          custodians of the cargo is now being developed. Smart cards that contain          biometric identifiers and cargo information connected to an electronic          manifest can be used to establish a chain of custody. Other technologies          that offer the potential to enhance security and supply chain efficiency          include supply chain software that can accommodate security applications,          electronic cargo seals, and wide-area communications combined with global          positioning systems or other global location technologies. These technologies          also can be useful in tracking hazardous materials shipments and freight          being moved across our international borders.         The freight transportation          network also may be affected by responses to terrorism and other incidents,          such as hazardous materials transport incidents. Shutting down the U.S.          aviation system for a few days after September 11 is an example of a response          to terrorism. Another example is the closing of the Howard Street tunnel          in Baltimore for several days after a train carrying hazardous materials          derailed. Other responses, or countermeasures, may have longer-term repercussions.          Continuing security delays in processing air cargo is just one example.                   Intertwined with the increased          focus on freight security is the need to keep commerce moving and further          boost productivity and reliability. In recent years, freight transportation          and logistics systems have become tightly coupled, resulting in efficient          global supply chains. In this environment, predictability and reliability          are critical to shippers and carriers. Enhanced freight security has the          potential to affect reliability and timeliness of deliveries by disrupting          well-tuned supply chain operations. Enhanced freight security measures          may also provide opportunities for increasing efficiency and productivity.                   Clearly, the extensive and          readily accessible U.S. freight transportation network is vulnerable to          terrorism. Many efforts are needed to enhance the security of the system.          Some security needs are urgent while others are longer-term goals. Thus,          the challenge for transportation decisionmakers is to balance security          needs with freight productivity. Neither goal is mutually exclusive. If          designed and implemented well, security measures have the potential to          improve efficiency and customer service and reduce losses from theft.                           Previous      Next   Home                                          Freight Management Home  |  Feedback      United States Department of Transportation    - Federal Highway Administration - Freight

These carriers hold Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPN) issued  by the USDOT authorizing the performance of air transportation. Large certificated  air carriers operate aircraft with seating capacity of more than 60 seats or a  maximum payload capacity of more than 18,000 pounds or conduct international operations.  Data for commuters, intrastate, nonscheduled air taxi operators, and foreign flag  air carriers are not included in this BTS data.

Airport Activity Statistics . Washington, DC: Annual issues.   Internet:  www.bts.gov   Commodity Flow Survey   The Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) provides data on the movement of freight by  type of commodity shipped and by mode of transport. In 1997, 100,000 domestic  establishments were randomly selected from a universe of approximately 800,000  engaged in mining, manufacturing, wholesale, warehouses of multi-establishment  companies, and some selected activities in retail and service. The survey excluded  establishments classified as farms, forestry, fisheries, governments, construction,  transportation, foreign establishments, services, and most establishments in retail.  For the 1997 CFS, each selected establishment reported a sample of about 25 outbound  shipments for a one-week period in each of four calendar quarters in 1997. This  produced a total sample of over 5 million shipments. Due to industry-wide reporting  problems, shipments by oil and gas extraction establishments were excluded from  data tabulations.   For each sampled 1997 CFS shipment, zip code of origin and destination, 5-digit  Standard Classification of Transported Goods (SCTG) code, weight, value, and modes  of transport were provided. Information on whether the shipment was containerized,  a hazardous material, or an export was also obtained. Route-distance for each  mode, for each shipment, is imputed from a Mode-Distance Table developed by Oak  Ridge National Laboratory. Distance was used to compute ton-mileage by mode of  transport. The CFS provides nationwide geographic coverage in 89 National Transportation  Analysis Regions, stratified by state and, for the 1997 CFS, metropolitan area.

EC97TCF-CA, Washington, DC: 1999.   Internet:  www.bts.gov/ntda/cfs/   Commuting data   Commuting data are derived from the Census 2000 Supplementary Survey (C2SS).  The C2SS used the questionnaire and methods developed for the American Community  Survey to collect demographic, social, economic, and housing data from a national  sample of 700,000 households. Group quarters were not included in the sample.  The C2SS was conducted in 1,203 counties with monthly samples of about 58,000  housing units. Economic, demographic, and housing characteristics from the Census  2000 Supplementary Survey are reported for the United States as a whole, the 50  states, and the District of Columbia.    The Census 2000 Supplementary Survey is not directly comparable with the 1990  Census for several reasons, one being that the former did not include group quarters.  This may understate some categories such as walking.

Accidents must be reported as  soon as possible, but no later than 30 days after discovery. Undetected releases  are a possible source of error; even if subsequently detected and reported, it  may not be possible to accurately reconstruct the accident. Property damage figures  are estimates.   Gas pipeline incidents involve: 1) releases of gas from a pipeline or liquefied  natural gas (LNG) or gas from an LNG facility that results in a) death or personal  injury necessitating in-patient hospitalization, or b) estimated property damage,  including cost of gas lost, of the operator or others, or both, of $50,000 or  more; 2) an event that results in an emergency shutdown of an LNG facility; or  3) an event that is significant, in the judgment of the operator, even though  it did not meet the criteria of 1) or 2).   For hazardous liquids pipelines, an accident report is required for each failure  in a pipeline system in which there is a release of the hazardous liquid or carbon  dioxide transported resulting in any of the following: 1) explosion or fire not  intentionally set by the operator; 2) loss of 50 or more barrels (8 or more cubic  meters) of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide; 3) escape to the atmosphere of  more than 5 barrels (0.8 cubic meters) a day of highly volatile liquids; 4) death  of any person; 5) bodily harm to any person resulting in one or more of the following:  a) loss of consciousness, b) an individual being carried from the scene, c) medical  treatment, or d) disability which prevents the discharge of normal duties or the  pursuit of normal activities beyond the day of the accident; or 6) estimated property  damage, including cost of clean-up and recovery, value of lost product, and damage  to the property of the operator or others, or both, exceeding $50,000.

Alternatively, every five years, in years ending  in a ‘2’ or ‘7’, a Census of Governments, including a finance portion, is conducted.  The survey coverage includes all state and local governments in the United States.  For both the Census and annual survey, the finance detail data is equivalent,  encompassing the entire range of government finance activities—revenue, expenditure,  debt, and assets.   The data collection for the annual survey uses two methods: mail canvas and  central collection from state sources. Data for local governments includes county,  municipal, township, special district, and school district data. Data for state  governments are compiled from state government audits, budgets, and other financial  reports into the classification categories used for reporting by the Census Bureau.   Reporting of government finances by the Census Bureau involves presentation  of data in terms of uniform categories. While often similar to, or identical to,  the classification used by the state or local government, there could be instances  in which a significant difference exists between the name of a state or local  financial item and the final category to which it is assigned by the Census Bureau.     Like financial transactions are combined. The financial categories for revenue  involve grouping of items by source. Revenue items of the same kind are merged.  Financial transactions for expenditures are classified both by function and by  object category. Debt items are classified by term (short- and long-term), as  well as by type of debt and, to a limited extent, by purpose. Assets also are  put into uniform categories, grouped by type of holding, with holdings for insurance  trust systems grouped separately from general government.    The share of government sector financial totals contributed by a state government  or by local governments differs materially from one state to another. Users can  review the  Government Finance and Employment Classification Manual  for  additional information regarding the financial categories. The financial amounts  in the tables and files are statistical in nature and do not represent accounting  statements or conditions.    The local government statistics are developed from a sample survey. Therefore,  the local totals, as well as state and local aggregates, are considered estimated  amounts subject to sampling error. State government finance data are not subject  to sampling. Consequently, state-local aggregates for individual states are more  reliable (on a relative standard error basis) than the local government estimates  they include.

Each carrier must submit a report to the  USDOT, Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) within 30 days of the  incident, including information on the mode of transportation involved, results  of the incident, and a narrative description of the accident. These reports are  generally made available on RSPA’s incident database within 90 days of receipt.   Fatalities and injuries are counted only if directly caused by a hazardous  material. For example, a truck operator killed by impact forces during a motor  vehicle crash would not be counted as a hazardous-material fatality. RSPA contacts  the submitting carrier by telephone to verify all reported fatalities.   Although RSPA acknowledges that there is some level of underreporting, it believes  that the underreporting is mostly limited to small, nonserious incidents. The  reporting requirements were extended to intrastate highway carriers on October  1, 1998, and the response rate from this new group is expected to increase over  time. Property damage figures are estimates determined by the carrier prior to  the 30-day reporting deadline, and are generally not subsequently updated. Property  damage figures, therefore, may underestimate actual damages.

Washington, DC: 2001   Internet:  http://hazmat.dot.gov   Highway mileage, condition, and use, driver licenses, and highway vehicle  registrations data    Data on roadway mileage, condition, and use are extracted from the Highway  Performance Monitoring System (HPMS), which uses a stratified simple random sample  of highway links (small sections of roadway) selected from state inventory files.  The HPMS sample was designed as a fixed sample to minimize data collection costs,  but adjustments to maintain representativeness are carried out periodically. The  HPMS also consists of universe reporting (a complete census) for the Interstate  and the National Highway System, and tabular summary reporting of limited information.     Data are collected independently by the 50 states, Metropolitan Planning Organizations  (MPOs), and lower jurisdictions. Many of the geometric data items rarely change,  such as number of lanes; others change frequently, such as traffic. The U.S. Department  of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) provides guidelines for  data collection in the HPMS  Field Manual , which the states follow to varying  extents depending on matters such as staff, resources, state perspective, uses  of the data, and state/MPO/local needs for the data. State Departments of Transportation  (DOTs) report HPMS data annually to the FHWA.   HPMS data are subject to sampling and nonsampling error. Nonsampling error  is the major concern with these data. For some of the most variable and important  data items, such as traffic, guidelines for measurement and data collection have  been produced. States have the option of using the guidelines or using their own  procedures. Many data items are difficult and costly to collect and are reported  as estimates not based on direct measurement. The data are collected and reported  by many entities and individuals within the responsible organizations. Most do  a reasonably good job, but staff turnover, cost, equipment issues, etc., can create  difficulties.   States provide vehicle registration data to the FHWA. Vehicle registration  data are shown on a calendar-year basis. Efforts are made to exclude transfers,  re-registrations, and any other factors that could result in duplication in the  vehicle counts. Registration practices for commercial vehicles differ greatly  among the states. Some states register a tractor-semitrailer combination as a  single unit; others register the tractor and the semitrailer separately. Some  states register buses with trucks or automobiles, while many states do not report  house and light utility trailers separately from commercial trailers or semitrailers.  Some states do not require registration of car or light utility trailers. In some  instances, FHWA has supplemented the data supplied by the states with information  obtained from other sources.    States also provide driver licensing data to the FHWA. Although efforts are  made to minimize license duplication, drivers who move from one state to another  are sometimes counted in both states until the license from the previous state  of residence expires. Problems with the data also arise from the fact that: 1)  some individuals obtain their drivers licenses in states other than those of legal  residence; 2) some individuals fraudulently obtain multiple licenses; 3) not all  individuals who drive are licensed; and 4) the purging of expired licenses or  licenses from deceased individuals is not performed on a continual basis.

Data are gathered  from a census of police accident reports (PARs), state vehicle registration files,  state drivers licensing files, state highway department data, vital statistics,  death certificates, coroner/medical examiner reports, hospital medical reports,  and emergency medical service reports. A separate form is completed for each fatal  crash. Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is estimated when not known. Statistical  procedures used for unknown data in FARS can be found in the NHTSA report,  A  Method for Estimating Posterior BAC Distributions for Persons Involved in Fatal  Traffic Accidents , DOT HS 807 094 (Washington, DC: July 1986).    Data are collected from relevant state agencies and electronically submitted  for inclusion in the FARs database on a continuous basis. Cross-verification of  PARs with death certificates helps prevent undercounting. Moreover, when data  are entered, they are checked automatically for acceptable range values and consistency,  enabling quick corrections when necessary. Several programs continually monitor  the data for completeness and accuracy. Periodically, sample cases are analyzed  for accuracy and consistency.   FARS data do not include motor vehicle fatalities on nonpublic roads. These  are thought to account for about 2 percent or fewer of the total motor vehicle  fatalities per year.    Injuries and crashes : NHTSA’s General Estimates System (GES) data are  a nationally representative sample of police-reported crashes that contributed  to an injury or fatality or resulted in property damage and involved at least  one motor vehicle traveling on a trafficway. GES data collectors randomly sample  PARs and forward copies to a central contractor for coding into a standard GES  system format. Documents such as police diagrams or supporting text provided by  the officers might be further reviewed to complete a data entry. A NHTSA study  of injuries from motor vehicle crashes estimated the total count of nonfatal injuries  at over 5 million compared with the GES’s estimate of 3.2 million in 1998.

Internet:  www.nhtsa.dot.gov   International visitors data   Data on international visitors to the United States are based on international  arrivals by air to the United States (excluding those from Canada and Mexico).  Information is derived from the Immigration and Naturalization Service’s (INS)  Visitor Arrivals Program (I-94) and the U.S. Department of Commerce, Tourism Industries  Office’s Survey of International Air Travelers. The survey obtains data on overseas  travel patterns, characteristics, and spending patterns of international travelers  to and from the United States. Between 69,000 and 95,000 travelers are surveyed  each year. The survey results are weighted so they represent the international  travel populations of U.S. residents and non-residents based upon Immigration  and Naturalization Service data.

These numbers reflect all entries,  and it is not possible to divide these data into separate entries for same-day  and overnight travel or by country of residence for the traveler. Additionally,  for border-crossing figures, the total number of people is not the number of unique  individuals, but rather indicates the number of border crossings. Multiple crossings  by the same individual count as multiple border crossings.

The state-specific data include commerce, employment,  and financial contributions.   The primary source of data for Class I railroads is Schedule 700 of the R-1  Annual Report to the Surface Transportation Board (STB) by individual carriers  (100 percent reporting) and the 2000 Carload Waybill Sample. The primary source  of data for non-Class I railroads is AAR’s Profiles of U.S. Railroads from statistics  supplied annually by nearly all operating U.S. freight railroads. Some of the  data are estimated based on more aggregated, national figures.   The STB defines Class I railroads as having operating revenues at or above  a threshold indexed to a base of $250 million (1991) and adjusted annually in  concert with changes in the Railroad Freight Rate Index published by the Bureau  of Labor Statistics. Declassification from Class I status occurs when a railroad  falls below the applicable threshold for three consecutive years. Although few  in number, Class I railroads account for over 90 percent of the industry’s revenue.   The AAR determines the number of non-Class I railroads through an annual survey  sent to each U.S. freight railroad.   Historical reliability may vary due to changes in the railroad industry, including  bankruptcies, mergers, and declassification by the STB. Small data errors may  also have occurred because of independent rounding in this series by the AAR.   Additional information:   Contact: Association of American Railroads, Policy and Economics Department   Internet:  www.aar.org   Railroad safety data   Railroads are required to file a report for each accident or incident to the  Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). These include: 1) train accidents, reported  on Form F 6180.54, comprised of collisions, derailments, and other events involving  the operation of on-track equipment and causing reportable damage above an established  threshold ($6,600 in 1998); 2) highway-rail grade crossing incidents, reported  on Form F 6180.57, involving impact between railroad on-track equipment and highway  users at crossings; and 3) other incidents, reported on Form F 6180.55a, involving  all other reportable incidents or exposures that cause a fatality or injury to  any person or an occupational illness to a railroad employee.   Railroads are required by FRA regulations to use the current  FRA Guide for  Preparing Accident/Incident Reports  when preparing reports.    The Systems Support Division of FRA maintains the Railroad Accident/Incident  Reporting System (RAIRS), consisting of four databases: rail equipment, injury/illness,  grade-crossing accidents, and railroad summary (freight and passenger). These  databases include information on all railroad accidents, grade-crossing accidents,  railroad employee casualties, and any other injuries on railroad property, and  provide the basis for accident analyses and assessment as well as annual reports.  The databases are updated monthly from information submitted by the railroads.

Internet:  www.fra.dot.gov   Recreational boating safety and vehicles data   The U.S. Coast Guard, of the U.S. Department of Transportation, collects data  on recreational boating accidents from two sources: 1) Boating Accident Report  (BAR) data forwarded to the Coast Guard by jurisdictions with an approved boat  numbering and casualty reporting system, and 2) reports of Coast Guard investigations  of fatal boating accidents that occurred on waters under federal jurisdiction.  Recreational Boating Accident Investigation data are used if submitted to the  Coast Guard and are relied on as much as possible to provide accident statistics.  In the absence of investigations, information is collected from reports filed  by boat operators.   Boat operators are required to file a BAR if an accident results in 1) loss  of life, 2) personal injury that requires medical treatment beyond first aid,  3) damage to the vessel and other property exceeding $500, or 4) complete loss  of the vessel.    Boat operators are required to report their accidents to authorities in the  state where the accident occurred. States with approved boat numbering systems  furnish the Coast Guard with BAR data. The minimum reporting requirements are  set by federal regulation, but states are allowed to have stricter requirements.  The Coast Guard reports recreational boating safety data in the report  Boating  Statistics,  which only covers accidents meeting the federal minimum reporting  requirements.   The statistics in  Boating Statistics  cover boating accidents reported  on waters of joint federal and state jurisdiction, and exclusive state jurisdiction.     The Coast Guard believes over 90 percent of fatal accidents are included in   Boating Statistics . A smaller percentage of nonfatal accidents are reported  because of reporting thresholds, ignorance of the law, and difficulties enforcing  the law. Federal law does not require the reporting of accidents on private waters  where states have no jurisdiction. Reports of accidents on such waters are included  when received by the Coast Guard if they satisfy the other requirements of inclusion.  Accidents excluded are those in which the boat was used as a platform for other  activities (e.g., swimming), and those in which a person dies of natural causes  aboard a boat. However, the data do include accidents involving people in the  water who are struck by their boat or another boat.

Internet:  www.uscgboating.org   Transborder surface freight data   The Transborder Surface Freight Dataset is extracted from the Census Foreign  Trade Statistics Program and made available by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.  Import and export data are extracted from administrative records required by the  Departments of Commerce and Treasury. This dataset incorporates all shipments  entering or exiting the United States by surface modes of transport (that is,  other than air or maritime vessel) to and from Canada or Mexico. Prior to January  1997, this dataset also included transhipments in its detailed tables, that is,  shipments entering or exiting the United States by way of U.S. Customs ports on  the northern or southern borders, even when the actual origin or final destination  of the goods was other than Canada or Mexico. Shipments that neither originate  nor terminate in the United States (i.e., intransit shipments) are beyond the  scope of this dataset because they are not considered U.S. international trade  shipments.    Users should be aware that the datasets trade data fields (such as value and  commodity classification) are typically more rigorously reviewed than transportation  data fields (i.e., mode of transportation and port of entry/exit). Users should  also be aware that the use of foreign trade data to describe physical transportation  flows might not be direct. For example, this dataset provides surface transportation  information for individual Customs districts and ports on the northern and southern  borders. However, because of filing procedures for trade documents, these ports  may or may not reflect where goods physically crossed the border. This is because  the filer of information may choose to file trade documents at one port, while  shipments actually enter or exit at another port.    Import data are generally more accurate than export data. This is primarily  due to the fact that Customs uses import documents for enforcement purposes, while  it performs no similar function for exports.     Additional information:   Contact: USDOT, Bureau of Transportation Statistics, Office of Transportation  Analysis   Internet:  www.bts.gov   Transit operating, financial, and safety data   Transit data are from the National Transit Database (NTD) produced by the USDOT,  Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Data are collected from transit agencies  that receive Urbanized Area Formula Program funds. Transit operators that do not  report to FTA are those that do not receive federal funding, typically private,  small, and rural operators. FTA reviews and validates information submitted by  individual transit agencies. Reliability may vary because some transit agencies  cannot obtain accurate information or may interpret certain data definitions differently  than intended.   In 2000, 592 agencies reported to the NTD. Of that total, 67 transit agencies  received exemptions from detailed reporting because they operated 9 or fewer vehicles,  and 7 were excluded because their data were incomplete. Thus, 518 individual reporters  were included in the NTD accounting for 90 to 95 percent of transit passenger-miles.   Data are collected on a range of variables including capital and operating  funding, transit service supplied and consumed, and transit safety and security.  Transit operators must report fatalities, injuries, accidents, incidents, and  property damage in excess of $1,000.

Data are collected annually. Data are  extracted from the Business Register, the Census Bureau’s file of all known single  and multi-establishment companies. The Annual Company Organization Survey and  quinquennial Economic Censuses provide individual establishment data for multi-location  firms. Data for single-location firms are obtained from various programs conducted  by the Census Bureau, such as the Economic Censuses, the Annual Survey of Manufactures,  and Current Business Surveys. They are also obtained from administrative records  of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Social Security Administration (SSA),  and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

The 1997 VIUS sampled about 131,000 trucks from an estimated universe of over  75 million trucks. The sample excludes vehicles owned by federal, state, and local  government including ambulances, buses, motor homes, farm tractors, unpowered  trailer units, and trucks reported to have been sold, junked, or wrecked prior  to July 1, 1996. Light trucks registered as cars, as is the practice in many states,  were included. Unregistered trucks used off-road are not included. Census delivered  a mail-out/mail-back survey to the owner identified in the vehicle registration  records. Data collection is staggered as state records become available. Owners  report data only for the vehicles selected. The response rate for the 1997 VIUS  was about 85 percent.

MARAD compiles these figures  from a data service provided by Lloyd’s Maritime Information Service. The parent  company, Lloyd’s Register (LR), collects data from several sources, including  its offices around the world, data transfers and agreements with other classification  societies, questionnaires to ship owners and shipbuilders, feedback from government  agencies, and input from port agents.    MARAD’s Office of Statistical and Economic Analysis maintains the waterborne  databank used to compile the annual import and export statistics from monthly  and quarterly data provided by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. MARAD publishes  the data in reports of vessel movements, trade and cargo by type of service, U.S.  and foreign port, country of origin/destination, commodity, value, weight, and  containerized cargo.    MARAD distributes the reports and performs special tabulations and customized  maritime data reports created for other government agencies and the private sector  on a reimbursable basis. MARAD also provides these services for historic data  and maintains the Schedule K Classification of Foreign Ports by Geographic Trade  Area and Country.

The NDC’s databases contain information on physical characteristics, infrastructure,  and commodities for principal facilities on the U.S. coast, Great Lakes, and inland  ports. The data consists of listings of port area’s waterfront facilities, including  information on berthing, cranes, transit sheds, grain elevators, marine repair  plants, fleeting areas, and docking and storage facilities.    All vessel operators of record report their domestic waterborne traffic movements  to the Corps via ENG Forms 3925 and 3925b. Cargo movements are reported according  to points of loading and unloading. Excluded cargo movements are: 1) cargo carried  on general ferries, 2) coal and petroleum products loaded from shore facilities  directly into vessels for fuel use, 3) military cargo moved in U.S. Department  of Defense vessels, and 4) cargo weighing less than 100 tons moved on government  equipment. The Corps calculates ton-miles by multiplying the cargo’s tonnage by  the distance between points of loading and unloading.   An annual survey of companies that operate inland waterway vessels is the principal  source of data for inland non self-propelled vessels, self-propelled vessels,  and flag passenger and cargo vessels. More than 3,000 surveys are sent to these  companies, and response rates are typically above 90 percent.

These carriers hold Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPN) issued  by the USDOT authorizing the performance of air transportation. Large certificated  air carriers operate aircraft with seating capacity of more than 60 seats or a  maximum payload capacity of more than 18,000 pounds or conduct international operations.  Data for commuters, intrastate, nonscheduled air taxi operators, and foreign flag  air carriers are not included in this BTS data.

In 1997, 100,000 domestic  establishments were randomly selected from a universe of approximately 800,000  engaged in mining, manufacturing, wholesale, warehouses of multi-establishment  companies, and some selected activities in retail and service. The survey excluded  establishments classified as farms, forestry, fisheries, governments, construction,  transportation, foreign establishments, services, and most establishments in retail.  For the 1997 CFS, each selected establishment reported a sample of about 25 outbound  shipments for a one-week period in each of four calendar quarters in 1997. This  produced a total sample of over 5 million shipments. Due to industry-wide reporting  problems, shipments by oil and gas extraction establishments were excluded from  data tabulations.   For each sampled 1997 CFS shipment, zip code of origin and destination, 5-digit  Standard Classification of Transported Goods (SCTG) code, weight, value, and modes  of transport were provided. Information on whether the shipment was containerized,  a hazardous material, or an export was also obtained. Route-distance for each  mode, for each shipment, is imputed from a Mode-Distance Table developed by Oak  Ridge National Laboratory. Distance was used to compute ton-mileage by mode of  transport. The CFS provides nationwide geographic coverage in 89 National Transportation  Analysis Regions, stratified by state and, for the 1997 CFS, metropolitan area.

The C2SS used the questionnaire and methods developed for the American Community  Survey to collect demographic, social, economic, and housing data from a national  sample of 700,000 households. Group quarters were not included in the sample.  The C2SS was conducted in 1,203 counties with monthly samples of about 58,000  housing units. Economic, demographic, and housing characteristics from the Census  2000 Supplementary Survey are reported for the United States as a whole, the 50  states, and the District of Columbia.    The Census 2000 Supplementary Survey is not directly comparable with the 1990  Census for several reasons, one being that the former did not include group quarters.  This may understate some categories such as walking.

Accidents must be reported as  soon as possible, but no later than 30 days after discovery. Undetected releases  are a possible source of error; even if subsequently detected and reported, it  may not be possible to accurately reconstruct the accident. Property damage figures  are estimates.   Gas pipeline incidents involve: 1) releases of gas from a pipeline or liquefied  natural gas (LNG) or gas from an LNG facility that results in a) death or personal  injury necessitating in-patient hospitalization, or b) estimated property damage,  including cost of gas lost, of the operator or others, or both, of $50,000 or  more; 2) an event that results in an emergency shutdown of an LNG facility; or  3) an event that is significant, in the judgment of the operator, even though  it did not meet the criteria of 1) or 2).   For hazardous liquids pipelines, an accident report is required for each failure  in a pipeline system in which there is a release of the hazardous liquid or carbon  dioxide transported resulting in any of the following: 1) explosion or fire not  intentionally set by the operator; 2) loss of 50 or more barrels (8 or more cubic  meters) of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide; 3) escape to the atmosphere of  more than 5 barrels (0.8 cubic meters) a day of highly volatile liquids; 4) death  of any person; 5) bodily harm to any person resulting in one or more of the following:  a) loss of consciousness, b) an individual being carried from the scene, c) medical  treatment, or d) disability which prevents the discharge of normal duties or the  pursuit of normal activities beyond the day of the accident; or 6) estimated property  damage, including cost of clean-up and recovery, value of lost product, and damage  to the property of the operator or others, or both, exceeding $50,000.

Alternatively, every five years, in years ending  in a ‘2’ or ‘7’, a Census of Governments, including a finance portion, is conducted.  The survey coverage includes all state and local governments in the United States.  For both the Census and annual survey, the finance detail data is equivalent,  encompassing the entire range of government finance activities—revenue, expenditure,  debt, and assets.   The data collection for the annual survey uses two methods: mail canvas and  central collection from state sources. Data for local governments includes county,  municipal, township, special district, and school district data. Data for state  governments are compiled from state government audits, budgets, and other financial  reports into the classification categories used for reporting by the Census Bureau.   Reporting of government finances by the Census Bureau involves presentation  of data in terms of uniform categories. While often similar to, or identical to,  the classification used by the state or local government, there could be instances  in which a significant difference exists between the name of a state or local  financial item and the final category to which it is assigned by the Census Bureau.     Like financial transactions are combined. The financial categories for revenue  involve grouping of items by source. Revenue items of the same kind are merged.  Financial transactions for expenditures are classified both by function and by  object category. Debt items are classified by term (short- and long-term), as  well as by type of debt and, to a limited extent, by purpose. Assets also are  put into uniform categories, grouped by type of holding, with holdings for insurance  trust systems grouped separately from general government.    The share of government sector financial totals contributed by a state government  or by local governments differs materially from one state to another. Users can  review the  Government Finance and Employment Classification Manual  for  additional information regarding the financial categories. The financial amounts  in the tables and files are statistical in nature and do not represent accounting  statements or conditions.    The local government statistics are developed from a sample survey. Therefore,  the local totals, as well as state and local aggregates, are considered estimated  amounts subject to sampling error. State government finance data are not subject  to sampling. Consequently, state-local aggregates for individual states are more  reliable (on a relative standard error basis) than the local government estimates  they include.

Each carrier must submit a report to the  USDOT, Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) within 30 days of the  incident, including information on the mode of transportation involved, results  of the incident, and a narrative description of the accident. These reports are  generally made available on RSPA’s incident database within 90 days of receipt.   Fatalities and injuries are counted only if directly caused by a hazardous  material. For example, a truck operator killed by impact forces during a motor  vehicle crash would not be counted as a hazardous-material fatality. RSPA contacts  the submitting carrier by telephone to verify all reported fatalities.   Although RSPA acknowledges that there is some level of underreporting, it believes  that the underreporting is mostly limited to small, nonserious incidents. The  reporting requirements were extended to intrastate highway carriers on October  1, 1998, and the response rate from this new group is expected to increase over  time. Property damage figures are estimates determined by the carrier prior to  the 30-day reporting deadline, and are generally not subsequently updated. Property  damage figures, therefore, may underestimate actual damages.

Washington, DC: 2001   Internet:  http://hazmat.dot.gov   Highway mileage, condition, and use, driver licenses, and highway vehicle  registrations data    Data on roadway mileage, condition, and use are extracted from the Highway  Performance Monitoring System (HPMS), which uses a stratified simple random sample  of highway links (small sections of roadway) selected from state inventory files.  The HPMS sample was designed as a fixed sample to minimize data collection costs,  but adjustments to maintain representativeness are carried out periodically. The  HPMS also consists of universe reporting (a complete census) for the Interstate  and the National Highway System, and tabular summary reporting of limited information.     Data are collected independently by the 50 states, Metropolitan Planning Organizations  (MPOs), and lower jurisdictions. Many of the geometric data items rarely change,  such as number of lanes; others change frequently, such as traffic. The U.S. Department  of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) provides guidelines for  data collection in the HPMS  Field Manual , which the states follow to varying  extents depending on matters such as staff, resources, state perspective, uses  of the data, and state/MPO/local needs for the data. State Departments of Transportation  (DOTs) report HPMS data annually to the FHWA.   HPMS data are subject to sampling and nonsampling error. Nonsampling error  is the major concern with these data. For some of the most variable and important  data items, such as traffic, guidelines for measurement and data collection have  been produced. States have the option of using the guidelines or using their own  procedures. Many data items are difficult and costly to collect and are reported  as estimates not based on direct measurement. The data are collected and reported  by many entities and individuals within the responsible organizations. Most do  a reasonably good job, but staff turnover, cost, equipment issues, etc., can create  difficulties.   States provide vehicle registration data to the FHWA. Vehicle registration  data are shown on a calendar-year basis. Efforts are made to exclude transfers,  re-registrations, and any other factors that could result in duplication in the  vehicle counts. Registration practices for commercial vehicles differ greatly  among the states. Some states register a tractor-semitrailer combination as a  single unit; others register the tractor and the semitrailer separately. Some  states register buses with trucks or automobiles, while many states do not report  house and light utility trailers separately from commercial trailers or semitrailers.  Some states do not require registration of car or light utility trailers. In some  instances, FHWA has supplemented the data supplied by the states with information  obtained from other sources.    States also provide driver licensing data to the FHWA. Although efforts are  made to minimize license duplication, drivers who move from one state to another  are sometimes counted in both states until the license from the previous state  of residence expires. Problems with the data also arise from the fact that: 1)  some individuals obtain their drivers licenses in states other than those of legal  residence; 2) some individuals fraudulently obtain multiple licenses; 3) not all  individuals who drive are licensed; and 4) the purging of expired licenses or  licenses from deceased individuals is not performed on a continual basis.

Data are gathered  from a census of police accident reports (PARs), state vehicle registration files,  state drivers licensing files, state highway department data, vital statistics,  death certificates, coroner/medical examiner reports, hospital medical reports,  and emergency medical service reports. A separate form is completed for each fatal  crash. Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is estimated when not known. Statistical  procedures used for unknown data in FARS can be found in the NHTSA report,  A  Method for Estimating Posterior BAC Distributions for Persons Involved in Fatal  Traffic Accidents , DOT HS 807 094 (Washington, DC: July 1986).    Data are collected from relevant state agencies and electronically submitted  for inclusion in the FARs database on a continuous basis. Cross-verification of  PARs with death certificates helps prevent undercounting. Moreover, when data  are entered, they are checked automatically for acceptable range values and consistency,  enabling quick corrections when necessary. Several programs continually monitor  the data for completeness and accuracy. Periodically, sample cases are analyzed  for accuracy and consistency.   FARS data do not include motor vehicle fatalities on nonpublic roads. These  are thought to account for about 2 percent or fewer of the total motor vehicle  fatalities per year.    Injuries and crashes : NHTSA’s General Estimates System (GES) data are  a nationally representative sample of police-reported crashes that contributed  to an injury or fatality or resulted in property damage and involved at least  one motor vehicle traveling on a trafficway. GES data collectors randomly sample  PARs and forward copies to a central contractor for coding into a standard GES  system format. Documents such as police diagrams or supporting text provided by  the officers might be further reviewed to complete a data entry. A NHTSA study  of injuries from motor vehicle crashes estimated the total count of nonfatal injuries  at over 5 million compared with the GES’s estimate of 3.2 million in 1998.

Internet:  www.nhtsa.dot.gov   International visitors data   Data on international visitors to the United States are based on international  arrivals by air to the United States (excluding those from Canada and Mexico).  Information is derived from the Immigration and Naturalization Service’s (INS)  Visitor Arrivals Program (I-94) and the U.S. Department of Commerce, Tourism Industries  Office’s Survey of International Air Travelers. The survey obtains data on overseas  travel patterns, characteristics, and spending patterns of international travelers  to and from the United States. Between 69,000 and 95,000 travelers are surveyed  each year. The survey results are weighted so they represent the international  travel populations of U.S. residents and non-residents based upon Immigration  and Naturalization Service data.

These numbers reflect all entries,  and it is not possible to divide these data into separate entries for same-day  and overnight travel or by country of residence for the traveler. Additionally,  for border-crossing figures, the total number of people is not the number of unique  individuals, but rather indicates the number of border crossings. Multiple crossings  by the same individual count as multiple border crossings.

The state-specific data include commerce, employment,  and financial contributions.   The primary source of data for Class I railroads is Schedule 700 of the R-1  Annual Report to the Surface Transportation Board (STB) by individual carriers  (100 percent reporting) and the 2000 Carload Waybill Sample. The primary source  of data for non-Class I railroads is AAR’s Profiles of U.S. Railroads from statistics  supplied annually by nearly all operating U.S. freight railroads. Some of the  data are estimated based on more aggregated, national figures.   The STB defines Class I railroads as having operating revenues at or above  a threshold indexed to a base of $250 million (1991) and adjusted annually in  concert with changes in the Railroad Freight Rate Index published by the Bureau  of Labor Statistics. Declassification from Class I status occurs when a railroad  falls below the applicable threshold for three consecutive years. Although few  in number, Class I railroads account for over 90 percent of the industry’s revenue.   The AAR determines the number of non-Class I railroads through an annual survey  sent to each U.S. freight railroad.   Historical reliability may vary due to changes in the railroad industry, including  bankruptcies, mergers, and declassification by the STB. Small data errors may  also have occurred because of independent rounding in this series by the AAR.   Additional information:   Contact: Association of American Railroads, Policy and Economics Department   Internet:  www.aar.org    Railroad safety data   Railroads are required to file a report for each accident or incident to the  Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). These include: 1) train accidents, reported  on Form F 6180.54, comprised of collisions, derailments, and other events involving  the operation of on-track equipment and causing reportable damage above an established  threshold ($6,600 in 1998); 2) highway-rail grade crossing incidents, reported  on Form F 6180.57, involving impact between railroad on-track equipment and highway  users at crossings; and 3) other incidents, reported on Form F 6180.55a, involving  all other reportable incidents or exposures that cause a fatality or injury to  any person or an occupational illness to a railroad employee.   Railroads are required by FRA regulations to use the current  FRA Guide for  Preparing Accident/Incident Reports  when preparing reports.    The Systems Support Division of FRA maintains the Railroad Accident/Incident  Reporting System (RAIRS), consisting of four databases: rail equipment, injury/illness,  grade-crossing accidents, and railroad summary (freight and passenger). These  databases include information on all railroad accidents, grade-crossing accidents,  railroad employee casualties, and any other injuries on railroad property, and  provide the basis for accident analyses and assessment as well as annual reports.  The databases are updated monthly from information submitted by the railroads.

Washington, DC: Annual issues.   Internet:  www.fra.dot.gov   Recreational boating safety and vehicles data   The U.S. Coast Guard, of the U.S. Department of Transportation, collects data  on recreational boating accidents from two sources: 1) Boating Accident Report  (BAR) data forwarded to the Coast Guard by jurisdictions with an approved boat  numbering and casualty reporting system, and 2) reports of Coast Guard investigations  of fatal boating accidents that occurred on waters under federal jurisdiction.  Recreational Boating Accident Investigation data are used if submitted to the  Coast Guard and are relied on as much as possible to provide accident statistics.  In the absence of investigations, information is collected from reports filed  by boat operators.   Boat operators are required to file a BAR if an accident results in 1) loss  of life, 2) personal injury that requires medical treatment beyond first aid,  3) damage to the vessel and other property exceeding $500, or 4) complete loss  of the vessel.    Boat operators are required to report their accidents to authorities in the  state where the accident occurred. States with approved boat numbering systems  furnish the Coast Guard with BAR data. The minimum reporting requirements are  set by federal regulation, but states are allowed to have stricter requirements.  The Coast Guard reports recreational boating safety data in the report  Boating  Statistics,  which only covers accidents meeting the federal minimum reporting  requirements.   The statistics in  Boating Statistics  cover boating accidents reported  on waters of joint federal and state jurisdiction, and exclusive state jurisdiction.     The Coast Guard believes over 90 percent of fatal accidents are included in   Boating Statistics . A smaller percentage of nonfatal accidents are reported  because of reporting thresholds, ignorance of the law, and difficulties enforcing  the law. Federal law does not require the reporting of accidents on private waters  where states have no jurisdiction. Reports of accidents on such waters are included  when received by the Coast Guard if they satisfy the other requirements of inclusion.  Accidents excluded are those in which the boat was used as a platform for other  activities (e.g., swimming), and those in which a person dies of natural causes  aboard a boat. However, the data do include accidents involving people in the  water who are struck by their boat or another boat.

Internet:  www.uscgboating.org   Transborder surface freight data   The Transborder Surface Freight Dataset is extracted from the Census Foreign  Trade Statistics Program and made available by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.  Import and export data are extracted from administrative records required by the  Departments of Commerce and Treasury. This dataset incorporates all shipments  entering or exiting the United States by surface modes of transport (that is,  other than air or maritime vessel) to and from Canada or Mexico. Prior to January  1997, this dataset also included transhipments in its detailed tables, that is,  shipments entering or exiting the United States by way of U.S. Customs ports on  the northern or southern borders, even when the actual origin or final destination  of the goods was other than Canada or Mexico. Shipments that neither originate  nor terminate in the United States (i.e., intransit shipments) are beyond the  scope of this dataset because they are not considered U.S. international trade  shipments.    Users should be aware that the trade data fields (such as value and commodity  classification) are typically more rigorously reviewed than transportation data  fields (i.e., mode of transportation and port of entry/exit). Users should also  be aware that the use of foreign trade data to describe physical transportation  flows might not be direct. For example, this dataset provides surface transportation  information for individual Customs districts and ports on the northern and southern  borders. However, because of filing procedures for trade documents, these ports  may or may not reflect where goods physically crossed the border. This is because  the filer of information may choose to file trade documents at one port, while  shipments actually enter or exit at another port.    Import data are generally more accurate than export data. This is primarily  due to the fact that Customs uses import documents for enforcement purposes, while  it performs no similar function for exports.    Additional information:   Contact: USDOT, Bureau of Transportation Statistics, Office of Transportation  Analysis   Internet:  www.bts.gov   Transit operating, financial, and safety data   Transit data are from the National Transit Database (NTD) produced by the USDOT,  Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Data are collected from transit agencies  that receive Urbanized Area Formula Program funds. Transit operators that do not  report to FTA are those that do not receive federal funding, typically private,  small, and rural operators. FTA reviews and validates information submitted by  individual transit agencies. Reliability may vary because some transit agencies  cannot obtain accurate information or may interpret certain data definitions differently  than intended.   In 2000, 592 agencies reported to the NTD. Of that total, 67 transit agencies  received exemptions from detailed reporting because they operated 9 or fewer vehicles,  and 7 were excluded because their data were incomplete. Thus, 518 individual reporters  were included in the NTD accounting for 90 to 95 percent of transit passenger-miles.   Data are collected on a range of variables including capital and operating  funding, transit service supplied and consumed, and transit safety and security.  Transit operators must report fatalities, injuries, accidents, incidents, and  property damage in excess of $1,000.

Data are collected annually. Data are  extracted from the Business Register, the Census Bureau’s file of all known single  and multi-establishment companies. The Annual Company Organization Survey and  quinquennial Economic Censuses provide individual establishment data for multi-location  firms. Data for single-location firms are obtained from various programs conducted  by the Census Bureau, such as the Economic Censuses, the Annual Survey of Manufactures,  and Current Business Surveys. They are also obtained from administrative records  of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Social Security Administration (SSA),  and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

The 1997 VIUS sampled about 131,000 trucks from an estimated universe of over  75 million trucks. The sample excludes vehicles owned by federal, state, and local  government including ambulances, buses, motor homes, farm tractors, unpowered  trailer units, and trucks reported to have been sold, junked, or wrecked prior  to July 1, 1996. Light trucks registered as cars, as is the practice in many states,  were included. Unregistered trucks used off-road are not included. Census delivered  a mail-out/mail-back survey to the owner identified in the vehicle registration  records. Data collection is staggered as state records become available. Owners  report data only for the vehicles selected. The response rate for the 1997 VIUS  was about 85 percent.

MARAD compiles these figures  from a data service provided by Lloyd’s Maritime Information Service. The parent  company, Lloyd’s Register (LR), collects data from several sources, including  its offices around the world, data transfers and agreements with other classification  societies, questionnaires to ship owners and shipbuilders, feedback from government  agencies, and input from port agents.    MARAD’s Office of Statistical and Economic Analysis maintains the waterborne  databank used to compile the annual import and export statistics from monthly  and quarterly data provided by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. MARAD publishes  the data in reports of vessel movements, trade and cargo by type of service, U.S.  and foreign port, country of origin/destination, commodity, value, weight, and  containerized cargo.    MARAD distributes the reports and performs special tabulations and customized  maritime data reports created for other government agencies and the private sector  on a reimbursable basis. MARAD also provides these services for historic data  and maintains the Schedule K Classification of Foreign Ports by Geographic Trade  Area and Country.

The NDC’s databases contain information on physical characteristics, infrastructure,  and commodities for principal facilities on the U.S. coast, Great Lakes, and inland  ports. The data consists of listings of port area’s waterfront facilities, including  information on berthing, cranes, transit sheds, grain elevators, marine repair  plants, fleeting areas, and docking and storage facilities.    All vessel operators of record report their domestic waterborne traffic movements  to the Corps via ENG Forms 3925 and 3925b. Cargo movements are reported according  to points of loading and unloading. Excluded cargo movements are: 1) cargo carried  on general ferries, 2) coal and petroleum products loaded from shore facilities  directly into vessels for fuel use, 3) military cargo moved in U.S. Department  of Defense vessels, and 4) cargo weighing less than 100 tons moved on government  equipment. The Corps calculates ton-miles by multiplying the cargo’s tonnage by  the distance between points of loading and unloading.   An annual survey of companies that operate inland waterway vessels is the principal  source of data for inland non self-propelled vessels, self-propelled vessels,  and flag passenger and cargo vessels. More than 3,000 surveys are sent to these  companies, and response rates are typically above 90 percent.

Conducted for the first time in 1993 and again in 1997, the CFS is the nation’s primary and most comprehensive data source on domestic freight movement. It surveys a sample of shipments by domestic establishments engaged in manufacturing, mining, wholesale trade, and some selected retail trade services. The CFS collects information about what modes these establishments used to ship their products and materials, the types of commodities they shipped, and the value, weight, distance, origin, and destination of the shipments. The survey collects information on freight moved by each mode of transportation and on freight moved by intermodal combinations (e.g., truck and train).                                                                                                    Accessibility  |      Disclaimer  |      Freedom of Information Act  |      Privacy           FedStats  |      FirstGov  |      White House              U.S. Department of Transportation     Bureau of Transportation Statistics      400 7th Street, SW • Room 3103 • Washington, DC 20590     L'Enfant Plaza Metrorail Station (7th and D Streets)         800-853-1351 •          answers@bts.gov          Directions

Footnotes:  Note that data between 1993-1996 include transshipment                  activity (i.e., shipments which entered or exited the United States                  by way of a US Customs port on the northern or southern borders                  but whose origin or final destination was other than Canada or                  Mexico). Data beginning with January 1997 do not include transshipment                  activity. Users should note these differences before comparing                  figures for 1993-1996 with 1997 and subsequent year data. .                                  a The Canadian province of origin typically refers                  to the province where the goods were grown, manufactured                  or otherwise produced. In some instances, however, it may not                  always reflect the actual province of physical origin.                   b The US state of destination reflects the state                  of the importer of record. This state may not always represent                  the ultimate physical destination of shipments.

GX264-88-2230444	Summary of Final Report, BC208 December 2002  URBAN HIGHWAY FREIGHT MODELING INCLUDING INTERMODEAL CONNECTORS FOR FLORIDA PROBLEM STATEMENT Over the past few decades, there has been a growing interest in planning for the safe, efficient, and smooth movement of goods and freight across all modes of transportation. This is because of the growing realization that freight transportation and economic development are inextricably linked to one another. Planning for the safe and efficient movement of freight is directly tied to the economic development of an area, because businesses often locate in areas where just-in-time logistics practices can be implemented effectively and reliably. Despite the growing importance of freight transportation planning, the state of freight transportation modeling has lagged behind that of passenger transportation modeling, primarily due to the lack of data and the lack of an understanding of the modeling issues pertinent to freight transportation. In addition, freight transportation is invariably influenced by the economic, trade, and logistics activity at intermodal transportation facilities such as seaports, airports, rail terminals, truck terminals, and warehouses. However, past work in the modeling of freight transportation demand has not been able to integrate intermodal connectivity to reflect the importance of highway connectors that transport freight to and from intermodal terminals. This research project was undertaken in response to the need to obtain detailed data about freight movements in the State of Florida and to understand the issues and model design elements associated with urban freight transportation modeling.  OBJECTIVES The objectives of the research project were to do the following:     Review freight transportation modeling methods currently in use and under development around the country with special emphasis on urban freight transportation modeling practice in Florida Assemble freight transportation data for the State of Florida that urban areas can use for freight transportation planning purposes Identify freight transportation model development issues with emphasis on the freight trip generation, trip distribution, modal choice, and assignment steps of the modeling process Design a freight transportation modeling system that recognizes intermodal connectivity, multimodal choices, and commodity and truck types     Provide guidance on the statistical and econometric issues associated with development, specification, and estimation of urban freight transportation models from aggregate freight transportation data sets.  FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS This research project has provided several key deliverables that would be of immense use to local agencies as they plan for the safe and efficient movement of goods, freight, and services in their areas. Some of the major highlights of the research findings are as follows:  The state-of-the-art in freight transportation modeling has made great strides in the past decade. Many local and state agencies have engaged in freight transportation data collection and freight transportation model development efforts with a view to enhancing their ability to plan for the needs of freight transportation. The methods are diverse and include econometric, network/logistics-based, disaggregate, aggregate, and four-step modeling procedures. Many areas in Florida have kept up with the advances in freight transportation modeling with more than a half-dozen areas collecting detailed freight trip data and developing freight trip generation, trip distribution, and truck assignment models. These models are readily applied within the Florida Standard Model context. This research project has resulted in the development of a CD containing the latest Reebie Transearch Freight Movement Data for the State of Florida. The Reebie data contains details about the mode, shipment type, commodity type, and origin and destination of shipments at the zip code and county levels of aggregation. The data set is very rich in detail and can be used to obtain basic measures of freight movements by mode and commodity type within the state. This data set has been used to analyze commodity trip productions, commodity trip attractions, modal split, and trip length distributions for a variety of commodity types. There are many issues associated with the development of freight trip generation, trip distribution, mode choice, and assignment models. The report provides a detailed listing of all of the issues and data needs associated with each step of the freight transportation modeling process including intermodal connectivity issues. Statistical and econometric issues associated with the estimation and application of freight transportation models such as model misspecification, heterogeneity, forecasting input variables, and aggregation error are important considerations in freight transportation model development. The report provides a detailed description of these issues and methods to overcome them. The research project presents a conceptual freight transportation modeling system. interactions and data flows among them. are identified in a generic fashion so that state. design that provides a The design identifies The inputs and outputs the model design can detailed depiction of an urban all of the elements and the associated with each element be adapted to any area in the         BENEFITS The research project has resulted in the development of a detailed freight transportation data set for the State of Florida together with a detailed freight transportation model design that can be adapted in any area of the State of Florida. Local and state agencies that have the responsibility to make multibillion dollar transportation investment decisions will greatly benefit from the results of this research project. They will be able to analyze freight transportation movements in their areas and develop robust, accurate, and reliable models of freight transportation demand while explicitly accounting for intermodal facilities. The model design presented in this research will help the state save time and become more efficient as it will directly improve the ability to plan for freight transportation in the state and test alternative freight transportation policies.

GX250-45-15880630	"How the Bureau of Labor Statistics Measures Price Change for Air Freight in the U.S. Import/Export Price Indexes The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Import/Export and Inbound/Outbound Air Freight Indexes measure changes in air freight rates for air delivery to and from the U.S. The air freight indexes were first published in the early 1990s on a quarterly basis. Other international transportation services price indexes published by the BLS include those for air passenger fares, crude oil tanker freight, and ocean liner freight. The U.S. Import/Export Price Indexes include two types of air freight indexes  Balance of Payments Indexes and International Services Indexes. The Balance of Payments Indexes include imports and exports, taking into account the residency of the shipper and the nationality of the air carrier. The International Services Indexes measure all inbound and outbound transactions, and do not account for the nationality of the carriers. The Import Air Freight Index measures changes in rates paid for the transportation of freight from foreign countries to the U.S. on foreign air carriers. The Export Air Freight Index measures changes in rates paid for the transportation of freight from the U.S. to foreign countries on U.S. air carriers. It also includes freight transportation between two foreign countries provided by U.S. air carriers. For example, the rate from New York to Paris on Delta would be included in the Export Air Freight Index while the rate from Paris to New York on Delta would not. The U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is a primary user of the Import/Export Air Freight Indexes. The BEA uses these indexes to adjust the Balance of Payments Accounts and deflate the Gross Domestic Product. The BLS publishes the Inbound/Outbound Air Freight Indexes as an alternative to the Import/Export Air Freight Indexes. The Inbound Air Freight Index measures changes in rates paid for the transportation of freight from foreign countries into the U.S. on any air carrier. The Outbound Air Freight Index measures changes in rates paid for the transportation of freight from the U.S. into foreign countries on any air carrier. For example, the rate from New York to Paris on Delta would be included in the Outbound Air Freight Index while the rate from Paris to New York on Delta would be included in the Inbound Air Freight Index. The Inbound and Outbound Air Freight Indexes are most useful for international trade, market, and economic analyses of the cost of transporting freight to and from the U.S. Sample Design and Selection The BLS uses the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) T-100 International Market file as the sampling source for both the Import/Export and the Inbound/Outbound Air Freight Indexes. The data contained in this file include: origin and destination airports, air carrier name and nationality, and service class to identify passenger/cargo service or all cargo service.   The samples for the import and export air freight indexes are subsets of the samples selected for the U.S. inbound and outbound indexes, respectively. A sample of company-routes representative of international air freight transportation is selected by probability methods from the T100 sample source. A company-route is composed of an air carrier transporting freight between the city of origin and its destination. Each air freight item in these indexes is defined by the following characteristics: air carrier nationality, origin and destination airports, shipment weight, dimensions and packaging of shipment, type of commodity shipped, and type of buyer of the service. Pricing Pricing data for the air freight indexes are obtained directly from air carriers and reflect transaction prices for the first week of March, June, September, and December; price data are not collected during intermediate months. To determine the net freight rate, the contract or tariff freight rate is reported along with information about commissions, discounts, and surcharges. Air freight consists of commodities, including small packages tendered to an airline for transportation. Freight does not include mail, express, or passenger baggage. The scope of the service measured is air transportation only. Therefore, the service  being priced is from airport to airport only and does not include any ground transportation or port service. Trade Value The revenue weights used for index calculation are derived from a regression analysis based on data from the Fraud Intelligence file of the U.S. Customs Service and the DOT's T-100 International Market file. Air freight trade value weights are updated every five years. These indexes currently are based on year 2000 trade values.

GX243-64-11329379	"November 21, 2002  Office of Freight Strategy and Policy  Freight Implementation Plan November 2002 Introduction The importance of freight mobility to Washington State cannot be overstated. It is freight mobility that brings materials or components to the worksite to produce value added goods or services. Without efficient freight movement, our agricultural bounty would be unable to arrive at markets and access to foreign markets for all of our products would not happen. A few facts relative to the importance of freight movement to our economic well being include:      One in four jobs in the state are dependent on foreign trade1. Forty-three percent of the nation's wheat travels on Washington rivers2. Since NAFTA (1993), truck traffic at the Canadian border has increased almost one hundred percent.3 Freight and goods tonnage moved by road in the state has increased 116 percent since 1980.4 Puget Sound deep-water ports have the second highest level of container traffic in the United States.1  These impressive statistics are due in part to our geographic location, natural deepwater harbors and a developed river system that provides transport, irrigation to croplands, and hydroelectric power. These advantages should not be taken for granted and can be negated by our failure to invest in freight systems and infrastructure. As part of a 2001 Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) reorganization, the Office of Freight Strategy and Policy was created. The purpose of this office is to focus, coordinate and provide leadership for freight issues. The Transportation Commission's FY02 Work Program requires the Office of Freight Strategy and Policy to ""develop an implementation plan for focusing and coordinating WSDOT freight initiatives within the 2003-2013 Washington Transportation Plan (WTP) and 03-05 budget proposals"". In compliance with this directive, the Freight Implementation Plan was created. 1 2 3 4  Washington Association of Public Ports WSDOT Rail Office IMTC 2001 Resource Manual WSDOT CIPP 2001  1   November 21, 2002  Purpose The Freight Implementation Plan is intended to show a comprehensive overview of WSDOT internal freight strategies and elements. Its purpose is to lay the groundwork and create an environment that produces projects that move freight. The Freight Implementation Plan identifies who is working on WSDOT freightrelated issues, what they are doing and when they are going to do it, and how it fits together with existing plans and budgets. The Freight Implementation Plan is a dynamic document that will change frequently as new information becomes available, programs move forward, and budgets change. Background In 1998, the state legislature directed WSDOT to focus on five primary goals, one of which is freight mobility. The goal is to ensure that freight movement is reliable and transportation investments support Washington's strategic trade advantage. The objectives are to reduce barriers that cause delays and maintain freight movement in the event of alterations to the Columbia/Snake River system. A number of freight mobility and related issues are identified in the 2003-2022 WTP and the 2001 Freight and Goods Transportation System Update, including  Removal of Barriers to freight movement, such as conflicts between rail and highway traffic; highway capacity, congestion, and condition; access to intermodal transfer facilities; and other barriers that cause delays. Collection and Analysis of Essential Data to guide designation and implementation of a freight and goods transportation system. Immediate data needs include but are not limited to truck origin, destination, and commodity type. Maintain Washington's Strategic Trade Advantage by enabling competitive freight movement through transportation investments. Delays lead to increased delivery costs and inefficient delivery of goods and services, which will lead to the loss of Washington's competitive edge. Planning for future increases in port imports and exports and gross tonnage for freight moved is essential. Obtain Financial Support for investments in freight transportation services and infrastructure. Include freight strategy concerns in the development of highway system plans. Streamline Laws and Regulations impacting freight transportation.          2   November 21, 2002    Find Alternatives to the Snake/Columbia River barge freight transport system in the event that Snake River dam breaching proposals become reality.  In order to address these issues with success, coordination between WSDOT freight elements is essential. Of critical importance are junctions where freight is transferred from one mode to another and pathways that connect one freight system to another. The Freight Implementation Plan provides a basis from which improved coordination can move forward.  3"

International data is withheld for three years. The detailed T-3 data is also available in electronic formats from independent data services such as Data Base Products (Dallas, TX) and BACK Associates (Stamford, CT). There are simificant gaps in this data base, due to suppression of international data, th~ &striction to large certificated ""c;rriers, the lack of standard fiigs for earner partnerships, and the lack of deplaned and in-transit statistics. Carriers which do not file the T-3 may account for a signMcant portion of individual airports' traffic.

The data are collected for the ICC under contract by AAR Traffic and revenue values can be expanded to annual values based on the sampling ratios. Proprietary data identifying specific railroads, rail equipment and station locations are eliminated from the 151-field master file (MF) to produce an annual public use file (PUP) of 62 fields. Individual records represent single rail shipments Actual waybills filed in hard copy or in machine-readable-input (MRI) format by the terminating railroad.  ,,. .  structure Data Source  Scope:  A sample of all railroad freight waybills for movements terminating on U.S. raikoads that meet minimum filing requirement (4~ carloads per year within last 3 years or 5 percent or more of any state's traffic). Canadian originating traffic is included, if reported by a U.S. railroad. The sampling rate varies based on the number of carloads on the waybill and the method of filing, with higher sampling for larger shipments and for MRI railroads. The Master File is proprietary and not available to the public. The annual Public Use File is available on tape from the AAR about the end of July. The PUF for 1988-1992 is also available on CD-ROM from BTS.The Federal Railroad Administration produces an annual summary of traffic by STCC between five freight-rate territories. ALK Associates produces an armual summary with traffic density maps by commodity and car type, commodity carload volumes, and state-level inbound and outbound volumes by commodity. Specific problems include - the billing of multi-car shipments as single car movements - over-reporting of revenues for contract movements - the use of billed (minimum tariff) vs. actual weight - the rebilling of through movements as local. Also, terminating traffic for some non-reporting Class II and XII railroads is not covered due to reporting thresholds and fee-based arrangements with major railroads. -Z  Availability  ;,.: ,: .,.  comments  :-,:.: ,...

Footnotes:  Note that data between 1993-1996 include transshipment                  activity (i.e., shipments which entered or exited the United States                  by way of a US Customs port on the northern or southern borders                  but whose origin or final destination was other than Canada or                  Mexico). Data beginning with January 1997 do not include transshipment                  activity. Users should note these differences before comparing                  figures for 1993-1996 with 1997 and subsequent year data. .                                  a The Canadian province of origin typically refers                  to the province where the goods were grown, manufactured                  or otherwise produced. In some instances, however, it may not                  always reflect the actual province of physical origin.                   b The US state of destination reflects the state                  of the importer of record. This state may not always represent                  the ultimate physical destination of shipments.

GX010-35-3488251	“Talking Freight” Seminar Series    Come hear the latest on freight transportation trends and challenges in the 21st Century.   The Federal Highway Administration’s (FHWA’s) Office of Freight Management and Operations, in partnership with the FHWA’s Office of Planning and other public and private organizations, is hosting the new “Talking Freight” Seminar series via the telephone and Internet. The seminars are part of a broader Freight Professional Development Program initiative aimed at providing additional technical training, tools, and information to help the freight and planning workforce meet the transportation challenges of tomorrow. Seminars will be held on a monthly basis throughout the year and are open to all interested parties in both the public and private sectors. The schedule of planned seminars appears below.  To register for “Talking Freight” seminars, please go to  http://talkingfreight.webex.com .  If you have questions, please call or email Jennifer Seplow, SAIC, at 703-676-0851,  Jennifer.E.Seplow@saic.com .   Why dial in?   With limited travel budgets and busy work schedules, it has become increasingly more difficult for freight and freight planning practitioners to get needed information, training, and education to keep up-to-date with the latest trends, tools, and noteworthy practices in freight transportation.  The seminar series provides a convenient and no-cost way for transportation practitioners to broaden their knowledge base and develop new skills to help them do their jobs better.  These topics were chosen based on suggestions made at various freight outreach events, as well as through conversations with freight stakeholders. The seminars will include sessions on freight decision-making tools, the challenges of urban goods movement, and innovative approaches to planning intermodal projects.   As an added benefit, participants will be given the opportunity to register for a Freight Peer Exchange. The Peer Exchange will take place through the Freight Planning LISTSERV ( www.fhwa.dot.gov/freightplanning ), which is managed by FHWA’s Office of Planning in coordination with FHWA’s Office of Freight Management and Operations. The Peer Exchange will serve as another resource to expand participants’ freight transportation knowledge.   How it works         The seminars are interactive and will be held via teleconference        and the Internet. All that is needed is a telephone and a 56K Internet connection.        This format allows for extensive participation of freight stakeholders from        across the country. Each seminar will last 90 minutes, with 60 minutes allocated        for the presentation, and 30 minutes for audience Q&As. Through the        use of web conferencing, participants will be able to view the speaker’s        PowerPoint presentation on their personal computer and hear the audio portion        of the presentation by dialing into the assigned teleconference number.       The “Talking Freight” website provides details about each of the seminars and information about registration. It will also be used for logging on to the web conference and providing feedback after each seminar. Seminars will be recorded and archived on the “Talking Freight” website as well. Once participants register for a particular seminar, they will receive an email with directions for logging on to the web conference and the teleconference.   We look forward to your participation and hope that you will find the “Talking Freight” Seminar series beneficial to your professional needs.
