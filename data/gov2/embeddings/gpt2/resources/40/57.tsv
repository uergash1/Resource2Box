Do you know what is lurking out there on your credit report?       Your credit report contains tons of personal information that can be used in a variety of ways by many businesses, people and institutions. Because your credit report will impact many parts of your life, it is important that you know what a credit report contains, how it is used, and the best way for you to obtain and monitor your credit report.       Each of the three national credit bureaus is required by Federal Law to provide you with a free copy of your credit report once every 12 months.  Your credit report includes information on who you owe, how much you owe, where you live, and how timely you make payments to your creditors. A credit report, however, contains a lot more than just financial information; it shows whether you've been arrested, where you have lived, if anyone has a legal judgment against you, or if you have filed for bankruptcy in the past 10 years.        With the rise in identity theft, knowing how to monitor your credit report is more important than ever. Please use the information at Bills.com to learn how best to get your credit report, understand the information on it, and how to correct any inaccuracies on your credit report.

There are three major credit bureaus that offer credit reports:         Equifax        1-800-685-1111         www.equifax.com         Experian        1-888-397-3742         www.experian.com         Trans Union        1-800-916-8800         www.transunion.com        To get a hold of your credit report, contact one of these three bureaus. Each bureau interprets your credit information differently, so you might want to get a report from all three.                Can I get a Copy of My Credit Report at Any Time?              By law, you're entitled to one free credit report annually from the credit bureaus.  This can be accessed at:   www.annualcreditreport.com   - You can also request a free copy of your credit report if you were denied credit; however, you can only request a copy from the specific credit bureau that supplied the credit report to the creditor who denied you.         What Information do Credit Bureaus Collect about Me?              Credit bureaus collect your identification information, employment history, credit inquiries, and any additional public records and data.        Will Requesting a Credit Report Affect My Credit?              No. Requesting a credit report will NOT affect your credit. You have the right to look at your credit report without it affecting your credit or score. When you request your credit report it's called a ""consumer pull"" and has no affect on your credit. The only time when requesting a credit report can affect your credit is when you ask a possible creditor to inquire about your credit. This is because it implies that you're possibly opening a new line of credit.                                                                                                                                                                    Glossary of Credit Report Terms                         Accounts in Good Standing:  positive items on your credit report that should reflect favorably on your overall creditworthiness.        Credit History:  a personal record of past credit accounts paid. Credit history is commonly used to predict a person's likelihood of making payments on time.        Credit Score:  this score is determined by the credit reporting agencies (a.k.a. credit bureaus) by taking a number of factors into consideration including but not limited to payment history, amount owed, and length of time an account has been open. Exact scales for traditional credit scoring vary from bureau to bureau, but are around 350 - 900. Your traditional credit score may be based on factors from as far back as seven or eight years.        Verification:  the process of checking whether or not data in a credit report is accurate. Verification is initiated by consumers when they question information in their credit report. Credit reporting agencies will accept valid documentation from the consumer that will help with verification.

A credit rating is simply someone's assessment of how well you would be able to pay back money lent to you. Usually, that ""someone"" is a credit reporting agency; however, creditors themselves will also make their own assessment, which is usually based on the score you receive from the credit reporting agencies and is determined by requirements that vary a great deal from one creditor to the next.

clueweb09-en0005-98-00113	               What the 403(b) Is      The 403(b) is a tax deferred retirement plan available for certain employees of public schools, employees of certain tax-exempt organizations, and  certain ministers.  If uncertain of your eligibility, consult your employer.     The 403(b) has often been referred to as a Tax Deferred Annuity (TDA) or a Tax Sheltered Annuity (TSA). This is a misnomer and gives the false impression that a participant must invest in annuity products. This is not true. Way back in 1974 Congress granted participants the ability to contribute directly in mutual funds when they added paragraph 7 to the code creating the 403(b)(7) custodial account. Throughout this site the term 403(b) is intended to mean all of the following: 403(b), 403(b)(7), TDA, and TSA. Ultimately, the 403(b) plan is a defined contribution plan (often called a DC plan), where the participant makes contributions and investment decisions, as opposed to a pension or defined benefit plan (often called a DB plan), where the employer makes all, or a majority of contributions and all of the investment decisions.    Why the 403(b) is Important    The 403(b) can be an excellent way to save money for retirement whether as a supplement to a traditional pension plan or other retirement plan(s), or as a stand-alone plan.    How the 403(b) Works    Employees set aside money for retirement on a pre-tax basis through a salary reduction agreement with their employer. Contributions and earnings on investments grow tax deferred until the time of retirement, when withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income.    What Tax Deferred Means    An employee in the 15 percent federal tax bracket would reduce their taxable obligation by 15 cents for each dollar contributed to a 403(b). In effect, a $1 contribution would only cost the participant 85 cents. Employees in higher tax brackets would reduce tax obligation by even more.    How Much Can Be Contributed    For 2009, employees can contribute $16,500 in regular contributions. The IRS refers to regular contributions as elective deferrals. A Participant age 50 or older at any time during the year can contribute an additional $5,500 for 2009. For those with employer matches or other employer contributions, limit is $49,000 for 2009, or 100% of compensation (whichever is less). The participant is still limited to the employee elective deferral limit ($16,500 for 2009). An employer can add up to another $32,500 for 2009.    15 Years of Service Provision    Employees with 15 years or more of service with an employer and an annual average contribution of less than $5,000 per year, are eligible to contribute an additional $3,000 per year up to a lifetime maximum catch-up of $15,000.    Note:  For participants eligible for both the Age 50 Catch-up and the 15 Years of Service provision, the IRS will apply contributions above the 2009 limit of $16,500 first to the 15 Years of Service provision. For example, if an employee eligible for both catch-ups contributed $20,000 during the year 2009, $16,500 would count toward the regular contribution limit for 2009; $3,000 would count toward the 15 Years of Service provision; and $500 would count toward the Age 50 Catch-up. If this was the first contribution this participant had made toward the 15 Years of Service provision, the amount they would be able to contribute to this catch-up in the future would be reduced from $15,000 (the lifetime maximum) to $12,000 ($15,000 less the $3,000 contributed in 2009).    Where the 403(b) Can Be Invested    403(b) money can be invested in a fixed annuity; and/or variable annuity; and/or a mutual fund.    Fixed Annuities    Fixed annuities operate much like certificates of deposit but are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company (FDIC). Generally, investors are given two interest rates: the current rate and the guaranteed rate. The current rate is the return that the insurance company promises to pay for a set period of time, typically between one and five years. The guaranteed rate, usually lower, is the minimum rate that investors will receive after the current rate expires, regardless of market conditions.    Variable Annuities    A variable annuity offers a range of investment options — typically mutual funds that invest in stocks, bonds, short-term money-market instruments, or some combination of the three. These investments options are referred to as the subaccount. The value of the investment will vary depending on the performance of the investments in the subaccount. There is usually a death benefit that will pay a beneficiary the greater of the account value or a guaranteed minimum amount, such as total purchase payments. Variable annuities are securities regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).    Mutual Funds(    A mutual fund is an investment that pools money from many participants and invests in stocks, bonds, short-term money-market instruments, or some combination of the three. The combined holdings of stocks, bonds, or other assets that the fund owns are known as its portfolio. Each investor in the fund owns shares, which represent a part of these holdings. There are two kinds of mutual funds: loaded mutual funds and no-load mutual funds. A load is a commission the investor must pay in order to purchase/sell that fund. All mutual funds have operating costs. Mutual funds are securities regulated by the SEC but are not guaranteed or insured by the FDIC or any other government agency.

What factors impact my credit score? Doing the following typically has a positive impact on your credit score:      Paying your bills on time. Delinquent payments and collections can have a significantly negative impact on your score.    If you have missed payments in the past, getting current and staying current on your payments.    Paying off debt rather than move it around.    Re-establishing your credit worthiness if you have had problems. Opening new accounts responsibly and paying them off on time may help in the long run.    Applying for and opening new credit accounts only as needed.    Keeping credit cards and managing them responsibly. In general, having credit cards and installment loans (and making timely payments) may help in the long run. Someone with no credit cards, for example, may be seen as a higher risk than someone who has demonstrated a history of managing credit cards responsibly.    If you are having trouble making ends meet, contacting your creditors or seeing a legitimate, reputable credit counselor.    Keeping balances low on credit cards and other lines of revolving credit.    Doing your rate shopping for a loan or credit line within a short period of time. FICO® scores distinguish between a search for a single loan and a search for many new credit lines in part by the length of time over which inquiries occur.      The following factors typically do not have a positive impact (or may even have a negative impact) on your credit score:     Opening a number of new credit cards that you do not need, just to increase your available credit. This approach could backfire and actually have a negative impact on your score.   Opening a lot of new accounts in a short period of time, especially if you have been managing credit for a short time. New accounts will lower your average account age. If you do not have a lot of other information in your credit file, this could have a larger effect on your score. Also, rapid account build-up can look risky if you are a new credit user.   What is a ""good"" credit score? FICO® scores can range from 300 to 850, but the majority of scores usually fall within the 600s and 700s:     20% are above 780    20% are in the range of 745 - 780    20% are in the range of 690 - 745    20% are in the range of 620 - 690    20% are below 619    Since there is no universal score cutoff used by all lenders, it is hard to say what a good score is outside the context of a particular lending decision. For example, one lender may determine that a score of 750 may qualify you for a platinum credit card, whereas a score of 675 may indicate that you are a better match for a standard card. Why is my Equifax score different from my Experian and TransUnion credit scores? There are several reasons for variations in your credit score among the different credit reporting agencies and even among different credit grantors:     First, your credit score from each credit reporting agency is based on the information in your credit file at the credit reporting agency, and the credit history information each credit reporting agency has about you can differ. This can result in your score at the other credit reporting agencies being different from your Equifax score.    Second, there is a slightly different FICO credit scoring model at each of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies due to the differences in credit history information they each have about you. Remember: your FICO score at a given credit reporting agency is only based on the credit data that credit reporting agency has about you.    Third, although the FICO® credit scoring model is the score used most often by lenders, each of the credit reporting agencies, including Equifax, has their own scoring models. These other models may evaluate your credit file differently from the FICO® model and, in some cases a higher score may mean more risk, not less risk as with FICO® scores.

In most cases, the payments you receive or that are made available to you under your 403(b) account are taxable in full as                         ordinary income. In                         general, the same tax rules apply to distributions from 403(b) plans that apply to distributions from other retirement plans.                         These rules are                         explained in Publication 575. Publication 575 also discusses the additional tax on early distributions from retirement plans.                         For more information                         concerning public safety employees, see Publication 575.                                                                       Distribution for active reservist.                                  The 10% penalty for early withdrawal will not apply to a qualified reservist distribution attributable to elective                         deferrals from a 403(b) plan.  A                          qualified reservist distribution  is a distribution that is made:                                                                                                                                                   To an individual who is a reservist or national guardsman and who was ordered or called to active duty for a period in excess                                     of 179 days or                                     for an indefinite period; and                                                                                                                                       During the period beginning on the date of the order or call to duty and ending at the close of the active duty period.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Minimum Required Distributions                                                                                                                     You must receive all, or at least a certain minimum, of your interest accruing after 1986 in the 403(b) plan by April 1 of                            the calendar year                            following the later of the calendar year in which you become age 70½ or the calendar year in which you retire.                                                                                Check with your employer, plan administrator, or provider to find out whether this rule also applies to pre-1987 accruals.                            If not, a minimum amount                            of these accruals must begin to be distributed by the later of the end of the calendar year in which you reach age 75 or April                            1 of the calendar year                            following retirement, whichever is later. For each year thereafter, the minimum distribution must be made by the last day                            of the year. If you do not                            receive the required minimum distribution, you are subject to a nondeductible 50% excise tax on the difference between the                            required minimum                            distribution and the amount actually distributed.                                                                                For more information on minimum distribution requirements and the additional tax that applies if too little is distributed                            each year, see                            Publication 575.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              No Special 10-Year Tax Option                                                                                                                     A distribution from a 403(b) plan does not qualify as a lump-sum distribution. This means you cannot use the special 10-year                            tax option to                            calculate the taxable portion of a 403(b) distribution. For more information, see Publication 575.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Transfer of Interest in 403(b) Contract                                                                                                                                        90-24 transfer.                                  If you transfer all or part of your interest from a 403(b) account to another 403(b) account, the transfer is tax                         free. This is known as a 90-24                         transfer. However, this treatment applies only if the transferred interest is subject to the same or stricter distribution                         restrictions. This rule                         applies regardless of whether you are a current employee, a former employee, or a beneficiary of a former employee. After                         September 24, 2007, you may                         no longer make a 90-24 transfer without your employer's involvement.                                                                                    Transfers that do not satisfy this rule are plan distributions and are generally taxable as ordinary income.                                                                                                 Tax-free transfers for certain cash distributions.                                  A tax-free transfer may also apply to a cash distribution of your 403(b) account from an insurance company that is                         subject to a rehabilitation,                         conservatorship, insolvency, or similar state proceeding. To receive tax-free treatment, you must do all of the following.                                                                                                                                                   Withdraw all the cash to which you are entitled in full settlement of your contract rights or, if less, the maximum permitted                                     by the                                     state.                                                                                                                                      Reinvest the cash distribution in a single policy or contract issued by another insurance company or in a single custodial                                     account subject                                     to the same or stricter distribution restrictions as the original contract not later than 60 days after you receive the cash                                     distribution.                                                                                                                                      Assign all future distribution rights to the new contract or account for investment in that contract or account if you received                                     an amount                                     that is less than what you are entitled to because of state restrictions.                                                                                                                                                                                                              In addition to the preceding requirements, you must provide the new insurer with a written statement containing all                         of the following information:                                                                                                                                                   The gross amount of cash distributed under the old contract.                                                                                                    The amount of cash reinvested in the new contract.                                                                                                    Your investment in the old contract on the date you receive your first cash distribution.                                                                                                                                                                            Also, you must attach the following items to your timely filed income tax return in the year you receive the first                         distribution of cash.                                                                                                                                                   A copy of the statement you gave the new insurer.

Direct trustee-to-trustee transfer.                                  If you make a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer, from your governmental 403(b) account to a defined benefit governmental                         plan, it may not be                         includible in gross income.                                                                                    The transfer amount is not includible in gross income if it is made to:                                                                                                                                                   Purchase permissive service credits, or                                                                                                    Repay contributions and earnings that were previously refunded under a forfeiture of service credit under the plan, or under                                     another plan                                     maintained by a state or local government employer within the same state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           After-tax contributions.                                  For distributions beginning after December 31, 2006, after-tax contributions can be rolled over between a 403(b) plan                         and a defined benefit plan,                         IRA, or a defined contribution plan. If the rollover is to or from a 403(b) plan, it must occur through a direct trustee-to-trustee                         transfer.                                                                                                 Permissive service credit.                                  A  permissive service credit  is credit for a period of service recognized by a defined benefit governmental plan, only if you voluntarily                         contribute to the plan an amount that does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to the period                         of service and the amount                         contributed is in addition to the regular employee contribution, if any, under the plan.                                                                                    Permissive service credit may also include service credit for up to 5 years where there is no performance of service,                         or service credited to                         provide an increased benefit for service credit which a participant is receiving under the plan.                                                                                    Check with your plan administrator as to the type and extent of service that may be purchased by this transfer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Tax-Free Rollovers                                                                                                                                        You can generally roll over tax free all or any part of a distribution from a 403(b) plan to a traditional IRA or a non-Roth                         eligible retirement                         plan, except for any nonqualifying distributions, described below. You may also rollover any part of a distribution from a                         403(b) plan by converting                         it through a direct rollover, described below, to a Roth IRA. Conversion amounts are generally includible in your taxable                         income in the year of the                         distribution from your 403(b) account. See Publication 590 for more information about conversion into a Roth IRA.                                                                       Hardship exception to rollover rules.                                  The IRS may waive the 60-day rollover period if the failure to waive such requirement would be against equity or good                         conscience, including cases                         of casualty, disaster, or other events beyond the reasonable control of the individual.                                                                                    To obtain a hardship exception, you must apply to the IRS for a waiver of the 60-day rollover requirement. You apply                         for the waiver by following                         the general instructions used in requesting a letter ruling. These instructions are stated in Revenue Procedure 2007-4 found                         in Internal Revenue                         Bulletin 2007-1. You must also pay a user fee with the application. The user fee for a rollover that is less than $50,000                         is $500. For rollovers that                         are $50,000 or more, see                           Revenue Procedure 2007-8, 2007-1 I.R.B. 230.                                                                                    In determining whether to grant a waiver, the IRS will consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including:                                                                                                                                                   Whether errors were made by the financial institution;                                                                                                    Whether you were unable to complete the rollover due to death, disability, hospitalization, incarceration, restrictions imposed                                     by a foreign                                     country, or postal error;                                                                                                                                      Whether you used the amount distributed (for example, in the case of payment by check, whether you cashed the check); and                                                                                                    How much time has passed since the date of distribution.                                                                                                                                                                            For additional information on rollovers, see Publication 590.                                                                                                                                                       Contributions from a designated Roth account can only be rolled over to another Roth account or a Roth IRA.                                                                       Rollovers to and from 403(b) plans.                                  You can generally roll over tax free all or any part of a distribution from an eligible retirement plan to a 403(b)                         plan. Beginning January 1,                         2008, distributions from tax-qualified retirement plans and tax-sheltered annuities can be converted by making a direct rollover                         into a Roth IRA                         subject to the restrictions that currently apply to rollovers from a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA. Converted amounts are                         generally includible in                         your taxable income in the year of the distribution from your 403(b) account. See Publication 590 for more information on                         conversion into a Roth IRA.                         Additionally, you can generally roll over, tax free, all or any part of a distribution from a 403(b) plan to a non-Roth eligible                         retirement plan,                         except for any nonqualifying distributions, described below.                                                                                    If a distribution includes both pre-tax contributions and after-tax contributions, the portion of the distribution                         that is rolled over is treated                         as consisting first of pre-tax amounts (contributions and earnings that would be includible in income if no rollover occurred).                         This means that if you                         roll over an amount that is at least as much as the pre-tax portion of the distribution, you do not have to include any of                         the distribution in income.                                                                                    For more information on rollovers and eligible retirement plans, see Publication 575.                                                                                                                                                       If you roll over money or other property from a 403(b) plan to an eligible retirement plan, see Publication 575 for information                         about possible                         effects on later distributions from the eligible retirement plan.                                                                       Eligible retirement plans.                                  The following are considered eligible retirement plans.

(To determine if your plan is a qualified plan, ask your plan administrator.)                                                                                                    403(b) plans.

If the distribution is from a designated Roth account, then the only eligible retirement plan is another designated Roth account                         or a Roth IRA.                                                                                                 Nonqualifying distributions.                                  You cannot roll over tax free:                                                                                                                                                   Minimum distributions (generally required to begin at age 70½),                                                                                                    Substantially equal payments over your life or life expectancy,                                                                                                    Substantially equal payments over the joint lives or life expectancies of your beneficiary and you,                                                                                                    Substantially equal payments for a period of 10 years or more,                                                                                                     Hardship distributions, or                                                                                                    Corrective distributions of excess contributions or excess deferrals, and any income allocable to the excess, or excess annual                                     additions and                                     any allocable gains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Rollover of nontaxable amounts.                                   You may be able to roll over the nontaxable part of a distribution (such as your after-tax contributions) made to                         another eligible retirement                         plan, traditional IRA, or Roth IRA. The transfer must be made either through a direct rollover to an eligible plan that separately                         accounts for the                         taxable and nontaxable parts of the rollover or through a rollover to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA.                                                                                    If you roll over only part of a distribution that includes both taxable and nontaxable amounts, the amount you roll                         over is treated as coming first                         from the taxable part of the distribution.                                                                                                 Direct rollovers of 403(b) plan distributions.                                  You have the option of having your 403(b) plan make the rollover directly to a traditional IRA, Roth IRA or new plan.                         Before you receive a                         distribution, your plan will give you information on this. It is generally to your advantage to choose this option because                         your plan will not withhold                         tax on the distribution if you choose it.                                                                                                 Distribution received by you.                                  If you receive a distribution that qualifies to be rolled over, you can roll over all or any part of the distribution.                         Generally, you will receive                         only 80% of the distribution because 20% must be withheld. If you roll over only the 80% you receive, you must pay tax on                         the 20% you did not roll                         over. You can replace the 20% that was withheld with other money within the 60-day period to make a 100% rollover.                                                                                                 Voluntary deductible contributions.                                  For tax years 1982 through 1986, employees could make deductible contributions to a 403(b) plan under the individual                         retirement arrangement (IRA)                         rules instead of deducting contributions to a traditional IRA.                                                                                    If you made voluntary deductible contributions to a 403(b) plan under these traditional IRA rules, the distribution                         of all or part of the                         accumulated deductible contributions may be rolled over assuming it otherwise qualifies as a distribution you can roll over.                         Accumulated deductible                         contributions are the deductible contributions plus income and gain allocable to the contributions, minus expenses and losses                         allocable to the                         contributions, and minus distributions from the contributions, income, or gain.                                                                                                 Excess employer contributions.                                  The portion of a distribution from a 403(b) plan transferred to a traditional IRA that was previously included in                         income as excess employer                         contributions (discussed earlier) is not an eligible rollover distribution.                                                                                    Its transfer does not affect the rollover treatment of the eligible portion of the transferred amounts. However, the                         ineligible portion is subject                         to the traditional IRA contribution limits and may create an excess IRA contribution subject to a 6% excise tax (see chapter                         1 of Publication 590).                                                                                                 Qualified domestic relations order.                                  You may be able to roll over tax free all or any part of an eligible rollover distribution from a 403(b) plan that                         you receive under a qualified                         domestic relations order (QDRO). If you receive the interest in the 403(b) plan as an employee's spouse or former spouse under                         a QDRO, all of the                         rollover rules apply to you as if you were the employee. You can roll over your interest in the plan to a traditional IRA                         or another 403(b) plan. For                         more information on the treatment of an interest received under a QDRO, see Publication 575.                                                                                                 Spouses of deceased employees.                                  If you are the spouse of a deceased employee, you can roll over the qualifying distribution attributable to the employee.                         You can make the rollover                         to any eligible retirement plan.                                                                                    If after you roll over money and other property from a 403(b) plan to an eligible retirement plan, you take a distribution                         from that plan, you will                         not be eligible to receive the capital gain treatment or the special averaging treatment for the distribution.                                                                                                 Second rollover.                                  If you roll over a qualifying distribution to a traditional IRA, you can, if certain conditions are satisfied, later                         roll the distribution into                         another 403(b) plan. For more information, see  IRA as a holding account (conduit IRA) for rollovers to other eligible plans  in Publication                         590.                                                                                                 Nonspouse beneficiary.                                  A nonspouse beneficiary may make a direct rollover of a distribution from a 403(b) plan of a deceased participant                         if the rollover is a direct                         transfer to an inherited IRA established to receive the distribution. If the rollover is a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer                         to an IRA established to                         receive the distribution:                                                                                                                                                   The transfer will be treated as an eligible rollover distribution.                                                                                                    The IRA will be considered an inherited account.                                                                                                    The required minimum distribution rules that apply in instances where the participant dies before the entire interest is distributed                                     will                                     apply to the transferred IRA.                                                                                                                                                                                                               For more information on IRAs, see Publication 590.

Are you curious about your annual credit report? Under the law, you are entitled to receive a  free credit report  from the three major credit bureaus in the United States. These reports tell give you an idea of your chances of getting a loan.    The free annual credit report will enable you to examine whether there is any wrong information provided there. Take note that many credit reports contain inaccurate data that can seriously damage your financial standing since lenders study your credit report when determining your capability to pay back the debt.    Even though there are great opportunities for people with bad credit, it is still a lot better for you to have a good credit rating. You can make your life a little bit easier by reviewing your  free annual credit report  and correcting any wrong information that damages your credit rating.    It is not impossible to achieve this.  Here are three things you need to remember:    1.  Negative marks on your credit report are not going to last forever. Be on your best financial behavior, and you will soon see that your credit rating is getting better. A year or two of prompt payments on your credit card and mortgage can do wonders.     2.  Some  bad credit lenders  use professional underwriters to assess your capability to make payments rather than your history. Some even go through the effort of digging into your previous debt to find out if you fell behind on payments because of divorce or other circumstances.    3.   Loans  do not last forever. The drawback of a  bad credit loan  is that you pay more than someone with good rating does. Once you make payments for several years, you are able to establish a new credit history and return to the mainstream market.    One of your most important financial tools is your credit report. Make sure to take advantage of the opportunity to read your report. This is one of the first steps to gaining control of your finances.                                                                Your Free Credit Report May Reveal Surprises                                      You might be thinking that your credit is  impeccable, you have never been denied a loan before and you have never been late on your bills.

Your free credit report is recognized as your license to  apply for a loan . What is typically referred to as a credit report is more accurately termed a consumer report by the federal government. This is because credit is only one aspect of the report. A typical consumer report contains personal data, employment history, detailed account information including a monthly transaction history, information reported by landlords, utility and insurance companies, doctors, hospitals, lawyers, and other agencies.

They can charge anywhere from a few hundred dollars to thousands.  You do not need to pay a credit repair company a lot of money to repair your credit.  Anything they can do for you, you can do for yourself for free or little cost.                                          You do not need a Software Program to repair your credit.  However, there is an awful lot of letter writing and record keeping involved, and an inexpensive program to help automate the process and point you in the right directions can literally save you hundreds of hours and aggravation and can keep you organized, so you never again find yourself in a credit nightmare.                                                                              YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                    A credit report is the equivalent of a consumer's financial report card. It details your credit history as it has been reported to the credit reporting agency by the lenders who've given you credit. Your credit report lists the types of credit you use, the amount of time your accounts have been open, and if you pay your bills on time.                    Your credit report is used by many different companies to make decisions about you. Credit card companies, Banks, mortgage companies, auto loan and insurance companies, also landlords and employers check credit reports to check on your credit history. Why? They know that if you were responsible in the past, you are likely be responsible in the future (and vice versa).                                                              CREDIT SCORING                    ""Credit scoring"" of is a system creditors use to help determine whether to give you credit, and how much to charge you for it.  When you apply for credit, the creditor or lender will often request your report (or credit score) from one of the big three bureaus (Equifax, Experian and Trans-Union).  In some instances, however (such as when applying for a Mortgage), the broker or lender will pull reports from all three. These Bureaus grade your ""credit worthiness"" by calculating your credit history against a system called the Fair Isaac Model.  Fair Isaac uses a variety of factors to determine your score, such as; your bill-paying history, the number and type of accounts you have, late payments, collection actions, outstanding debt, and the age of your accounts.                    The final outcome of those calculations is referred to as your FICOscore.  FICOscores range from 300 to 850, but the majority of scores fall between the 600s and 700s. Higher scores indicate a lower credit risk.  A FICOscore above 700 will get you a very good mortgage rate.  A score above 720 will get you an excellent rate.  A score below 700 will make it very difficult for you, and definitely should be worked on.                    Correcting mistakes on a credit report in order to repair an undesirable credit score takes time. It's your responsibility to correct mistakes that may appear in your credit report. To do this, you must regularly obtain copies of your credit reports, and contact each of the big three credit reporting bureaus to correct any misinformation.                                                              HOW TO GET COPIES OF YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                    The three nationwide consumer reporting companies Equifax, Experian and Trans-union are the three major bureaus that maintain credit reports on you.  To order your reports, you simply write or call them at the numbers below.                     You are also eligible for Free Credit Reports once a year.                                     Requests for free Annual Reports are not made to the bureaus themselves, they are made to their Combined Service.  You can order your free reports online instantly thru  Credit Doctor Software , or complete an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mail it to: Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281.  With the new laws, you are now entitled to one free copy from each of the nationwide consumer reporting companies every 12 months.                    You need to provide your name, address, Social Security number, and date of birth. If you have moved in the last two years, you may have to provide your previous address. To maintain the security of your file, each nationwide consumer reporting company may ask you for some information that only you would know, like the amount of your monthly mortgage payment. Each company may ask you for different information because the information each has in your file may come from different sources.                    There are also other circumstances which will allow you to receive free credit history reports.  Under federal law, you're entitled to a free report if a company takes adverse action against you, such as denying your application for credit, insurance, or employment, and you ask for your report within 60 days of receiving notice of the action. The notice will give you the name, address, and phone number of the consumer reporting company. You're also entitled to one free report per year if you're unemployed and plan to look for a job within 60 days; if you're on welfare; or if your report is inaccurate because of fraud or identity theft. Otherwise, any of the three consumer reporting companies may charge you up to $10.00 for another copy of your report within a 12-month period.                    To buy copies of your credit history report, contact:                    Equifax                  800-685-1111                                    Experian                  888-EXPERIAN (397-3742)                                    Trans Union                  800-916-8800                    Under state law, consumers in Colorado, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Vermont already have free access to their credit reports                                         REVIEWING YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                      Recent studies by a Public Interest Research Group found that over 70% of credit reports contain errors. Incorrect information in your credit file lowers your credit score. As the result you get a higher interest rate when you: take a loan, open a new credit card account, lease a car, etc.  29% of the credit reports in this study contained even more serious errors that could result in the denial of credit. These errors included false delinquencies, public records, judgments and credit accounts that did not belong to the consumer.  Sometimes these errors are the work of sloppy data entry, but it is also often due to the ever growing epidemic of identity theft.                     Since your Credit Reports are used to determine IF you are to be given credit (and what rates you will be charged), it is in your best interest to examine your reports carefully, correct inaccurate information and make every effort to remove ALL Unfavorable information.  If you see problems on your report, such as an unpaid bill that you simply forgot about, act right away to resolve the debt. Then ask that creditor to send a letter to the credit reporting agencies stating that the matter has been resolved.                     Check for accounts you didn't open, charges you haven't made, and delinquencies you didn't cause. If you suspect fraud on one of your reports, contact that credit bureau IMMEDIATELY. Explain the situation and ask them to place a fraud alert on your file. Also report the fraud to the police.                    Your credit reports follow you throughout your life and can help you greatly -- or hurt you. Review them carefully!                                                              HOW TO READ YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                    The bulk of the report will be filled with credit information showing the following:                    1).

Inquiries that display                    All authorized and legitimate requests to see your credit history.                     6). Inquiries that DO NOT display                    These inquiries are displayed only to you and are not considered when tabulating  your credit score. Examples of this inquiry type include a pre-approved offer of credit, insurance or periodic account reviews by an existing creditor.                    7). Consumer Statements                    If for some reason you cannot prove that a negative item is an error or if you are having a disagreement with a certain creditor, you have the right to tell your side of the story in 100 words or less. This statement will be ADDED to your report.                                                              SUMMARY OF WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN YOUR CREDIT HISTORY REPORT                    Credit Reports seem rather cryptic at first, but once you see how they are laid out they will start to make sense. These are the important things to examine:                                        Make sure your personal Information is correct                      Make sure your accounts are listed correctly                      Make sure your credit lines are listed correctly                      Make sure your balances are listed correctly                      If YOU closed an account, it should say ""Account closed BY CONSUMER.""                                                                                 STATING YOUR DISPUTE                    Make certain that all information is current and accurate, including the Personal Identification information (address, social security, etc…). If you find an error (for example, a loan that you have PAID OFF is still listed as outstanding), tell the Credit Bureau (in writing) EXACTLY what the mistake is, and explain the way that the information SHOULD be listed. For example, ""My Loan to Bank of Fred is NOT outstanding. It was paid in full on 02/14//05.""  Send photocopies along with all the necessary information to backup your claim.                            After you have done this send it to the credit bureau by ""CERTIFIED MAIL."" When the credit bureau receives your report and the information in question, they are required to investigate and ADVISE YOU of the results of their investigation. They must do this Free of charge.                    Anytime that you are denied credit you have the right to know why.  If you are turned down for a credit account at a store, you will receive a statement from the store stating that you were denied credit and their reason why. If the store based their decision on your credit history, they must provide you with the name and address of the agency that reported it.                    If for some reason you cannot prove that a negative item is an error or if you are having a disagreement with a certain creditor, you have the right to tell your side of the story in 100 words or less. This statement will be ADDED to your report.                    When correcting items on your credit report, you have the right to demand that the credit bureau send corrected copies of your report to all creditors who have received the incorrect reports for the past six months. Note: Credit bureaus will not do this automatically! They will only do it if you ask.  So make sure you ask.  It's your right!                                                              SAMPLE DISPUTE LETTER                    Here is a sample letter with sample dispute items.  Use the ones you need and delete the rest.

It is my understanding that you will recheck these items with the creditor who has posted them.  Please remove any information that the creditor cannot verify.                    I understand that under 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1681i(a), you must complete this reinvestigation within 30 days of receipt of this letter.

Thank you time and help in this matter.                                    Sincerely,                    _____________________________________                  [Signature]                                     Make sure you send this letter by certified mail.  Enclose a copy of the credit report containing the items you are disputing.  It may also help to circle the items.  Also include copies (not originals) of any paperwork you may have that validates your claims.                                                              DEALING WITH NEGATIVE (BUT CORRECT) INFORMATION ON YOUR REPORT  (AND COLLECTION AGENCIES)                    Despite popular belief, it is often possible to negotiate removal of negative items on your credit reports posted by creditors.  In some cases, you might not even have to pay them the full amount owed*. The important thing is to be positive, be patient and get in contact with them to try to work out a deal.                    If you've ignored (or never received) a creditor's bills or phone calls, or if you failed to keep up with payments, your bill may be turned over to a collection agency.  Keep in mind that collection agencies are hired by the creditor and their only goal is to collect the money owed (or as much of it as they can) as quickly as possible.  For their efforts, they are paid a percentage of what they collect.                     If you feel that the amount in question is being billed in error, you have the right to ask for proof and verification of the charges.  If the charges are indeed yours it may be in your best interest to negotiate with the collection agency.  You may be able to negotiate payment of the total sum (or even a partial amount) in return for their removing their negative marks on your Credit History Report.  You might be able to settle on paying a portion of your debt, or you might be able to work out a payment installment plan with them.  Many of the Creditor letters in the STOREROOM  can be used with collection agencies for these situations.  Whatever deal you make with them, be sure that you have it all in writing prior to paying them.                    Collection agencies can be very aggressive when it comes to collecting money.  Remember that you have rights.  You have the right to ask a collection agency stop contacting you, especially if you feel harassed. Use these letters below to give yourself breathing room while working through your plan to reorganize your finances.                    *See the letters in the Storeroom section.                                                              SEVEN STEPS TO BOOST YOUR FICO SCORE                                                             Correct all inaccuracies on your Credit Report.                                         Go through your credit reports very carefully.  Especially look for; Late payments, charge-offs, collections or other negative items that aren't yours, Accounts listed as ""settled,"" ""paid derogatory,"" ""paid charge-off"" or anything other than ""current"" or ""paid as agreed"" if you paid on time and in full, Accounts that are still listed as unpaid that were included in a bankruptcy, Negative items older than seven years (10 in the case of bankruptcy) that should have automatically fallen off your report (you must be careful with this last one, because sometimes scores actually go down when bad items fall off your report. It's a quirk in the FICO credit-scoring software, and the potential effect of eliminating old negative items is difficult to predict in advance).  Also make sure you don't have duplicate collection notices listed.  For example; if you have an account that has gone to collections, the original creditor may list the debt, as well as the collection agency.  Any duplicates must be removed!                                          Make sure that your proper credit lines are posted on your Credit Reports.                                         Often, in an effort to make you less desirable to their competitors, some creditors will not post your proper credit line.  Showing less available credit can negatively impact your credit score.  If you see this happening on your credit report, you have a right to complain and bring this to their attention.  If you have bankruptcies that should be showing a zero balance…make sure they show a zero balance! Very often the creditor will not report a ""bankruptcy charge-off"" as a zero balance until it's been disputed.                      If you have any negative marks on your credit report, negotiate with the creditor/lender to remove it.                      If you are a long time customer and it's something simple like a one-time late payment, a creditor will often wipe it away to keep you as a loyal customer.  If you have a serious negative mark (such as a long overdue bill that has gone to collections), always negotiate a payment in exchange for removal of the negative item.  Always make sure you have this agreement with them in writing.  Do not pay off a bill that has gone to collections unless the creditor agrees in writing that they will remove the derogatory item from your credit report.  This is important; when speaking with the creditor or collection agency about a debt that has gone to collections, do not admit that the debt is yours.  Admission of debt can restart the statute of limitations, and may enable the creditor to sue you.  You are also less likely to be able to negotiate a letter of deletion if you admit that this debt is yours.   Simply say ""I'm calling about account number ________"" instead of ""I'm calling about my past due debt.""                                              Pay all credit cards and any revolving credit down to below 30% of the available credit line.                                           The scoring system wants to make sure you aren't overextended, but at the same time, they want to see that you do indeed use your credit. 30% of the available credit line seems to be the magic ""balance vs. credit line"" ratio to have.  For example; if you have a Credit Card with a $10,000 credit line, make sure that never more than $3000 (even if you pay your account off in full each month).  If your balances are higher than 30% of the available credit line, pay them down.   Here is another thing you can try; ask your long time creditors if they will raise your Credit Line without checking your FICO score or your Credit Report.  Tell them that you're shopping for a house and you can't afford to have any hits on your credit report.  Many will not but some will.                                          Do not close your old credit card accounts.                                          Old established accounts show your history, and tell about your stability and paying habits.  If you have old credit card accounts that you want to stop using, just cut up the cards or keep them in a drawer, but keep the accounts open.                                           Avoid applying for new credit.                     Each time you apply for new credit, your credit report gets checked. New credit cards will not help your credit score and a credit account less than one year old may hurt your credit score.  Use your cards and credit as little as possible until the next credit scoring.                                           Have at least three revolving credit lines and one active (or paid) installment loan listed on your Credit Report.                      The scoring system wants to see that you maintain a variety of credit accounts.  It also wants to see that you have 3 revolving credit lines.  If you do not have three active credit cards, you might want to open some (but keep in mind that if you do, you will need to wait some time before rescoring).  If you have poor credit and are not approved for a typical credit card, you might want to set up a ""secured credit card"" account.  This means that you will have to make a deposit that is equal or more than your limit, which guarantees the bank that you will repay the loan.  It's an excellent way to establish credit.  Examples of an installment loan would be a car loan, or it could be for furniture or a major appliance.  In addition to the above, having a mortgage listed will bring your score even higher.                                      Throughout this process, always remember:                    I t takes up to 30 Days for any of these things to get reported and often longer to reflect on your Credit History Reports.  It feels like a slow process, but hang in there, because it DOES work.  This tedious process can be made much simpler with the automated help of Credit Doctor™ Software  www.creditdoctorsoftware.com .   Credit Doctor™ stores your user information to merge into its database of letters, saving you many long hours of letter writing.                                                                            A SUMMARY OF YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT                    The Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) promotes the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. There are many types of consumer reporting agencies, including credit bureaus and specialty agencies (such as agencies that sell information about check writing histories, medical records, and rental history records). Here is a summary of your major rights under the FCRA. For more information, including information about additional rights, go to www.ftc.gov or write to: Consumer Response Center, Room 130-A, Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Ave. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20580.                                     • You must be told if information in your file has been used against you. Anyone who uses a credit report or another type of consumer report to deny your application for credit, insurance, or employment - or to take another adverse action against you - must tell you, and must give you the name, address, and phone number of the agency that provided the information.                    • You have the right to know what is in your file. You may request and obtain all the information about you in the files of a consumer reporting agency (your ""file disclosure""). You will be required to provide proper identification, which may include your Social Security number. In many cases, the disclosure will be free.                    You are entitled to a free file disclosure if:                                        a person has taken adverse action against you because of information in your credit report                      you are the victim of identify theft and place a fraud alert in your file                      your file contains inaccurate information as a result of fraud                      you are on public assistance                      you are unemployed but expect to apply for employment within 60 days. In addition, by September 2005 all consumers will be entitled to one free disclosure every 12 months upon request from each nationwide credit bureau and from nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies. See www.ftc.gov for additional information.                                      You have the right to ask for a credit score. Credit scores are numerical summaries of your credit-worthiness based on information from credit bureaus. You may request a credit score from consumer reporting agencies that create scores or distribute scores used in residential real property loans, but you will have to pay for it. In some mortgage transactions, you will receive credit score information for free from the mortgage lender.                    You have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information. If you identify information in your file that is incomplete or inaccurate, and report it to the consumer reporting agency, the agency must investigate unless your dispute is frivolous. See www.ftc.gov for an explanation of dispute procedures.                    Consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information. Inaccurate, incomplete or unverifiable information must be removed or corrected, usually within 30 days. However, a consumer reporting agency may continue to report information it has verified as accurate.                    Consumer reporting agencies may not report outdated negative information. In most cases, a consumer reporting agency may not report negative information that is more than seven years old, or bankruptcies that are more than 10 years old.                    Access to your file is limited. A consumer reporting agency may provide information about you only to people with a valid need -- usually to consider an application with a creditor, insurer, employer, landlord, or other business. The FCRA specifies those with a valid need for access.                  You must give your consent for reports to be provided to employers. A consumer reporting agency may not give out information about you to your employer, or a potential employer, without your written consent given to the employer. Written consent generally is not required in the trucking industry. For more information, go to www.ftc.gov.                    You may limit ""prescreened"" offers of credit and insurance you get based on information in your credit report. Unsolicited ""prescreened"" offers for credit and insurance must include a toll-free phone number you can call if you choose to remove your name and address from the lists these offers are based on. You may opt-out with the nationwide credit bureaus at 1-888-5-OPTOUT (1-888-567-8688).                    You may seek damages from violators. If a consumer reporting agency, or, in some cases, a user of consumer reports or a furnisher of information to a consumer reporting agency violates the FCRA, you may be able to sue in state or federal court.                    Identity theft victims and active duty military personnel have additional rights. For more information, visit www.ftc.gov.

They can charge anywhere from a few hundred dollars to thousands.  You do not need to pay a credit repair company a lot of money to repair your credit.  Anything they can do for you, you can do for yourself for free or little cost.                                          You do not need a Software Program to repair your credit.  However, there is an awful lot of letter writing and record keeping involved, and an inexpensive program to help automate the process and point you in the right directions can literally save you hundreds of hours and aggravation and can keep you organized, so you never again find yourself in a credit nightmare.                                                                              YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                    A credit report is the equivalent of a consumer's financial report card. It details your credit history as it has been reported to the credit reporting agency by the lenders who've given you credit. Your credit report lists the types of credit you use, the amount of time your accounts have been open, and if you pay your bills on time.                    Your credit report is used by many different companies to make decisions about you. Credit card companies, Banks, mortgage companies, auto loan and insurance companies, also landlords and employers check credit reports to check on your credit history. Why? They know that if you were responsible in the past, you are likely be responsible in the future (and vice versa).                                                              CREDIT SCORING                    ""Credit scoring"" of is a system creditors use to help determine whether to give you credit, and how much to charge you for it.  When you apply for credit, the creditor or lender will often request your report (or credit score) from one of the big three bureaus (Equifax, Experian and Trans-Union).  In some instances, however (such as when applying for a Mortgage), the broker or lender will pull reports from all three. These Bureaus grade your ""credit worthiness"" by calculating your credit history against a system called the Fair Isaac Model.  Fair Isaac uses a variety of factors to determine your score, such as; your bill-paying history, the number and type of accounts you have, late payments, collection actions, outstanding debt, and the age of your accounts.                    The final outcome of those calculations is referred to as your FICOscore.  FICOscores range from 300 to 850, but the majority of scores fall between the 600s and 700s. Higher scores indicate a lower credit risk.  A FICOscore above 700 will get you a very good mortgage rate.  A score above 720 will get you an excellent rate.  A score below 700 will make it very difficult for you, and definitely should be worked on.                    Correcting mistakes on a credit report in order to repair an undesirable credit score takes time. It's your responsibility to correct mistakes that may appear in your credit report. To do this, you must regularly obtain copies of your credit reports, and contact each of the big three credit reporting bureaus to correct any misinformation.                                                              HOW TO GET COPIES OF YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                    The three nationwide consumer reporting companies Equifax, Experian and Trans-union are the three major bureaus that maintain credit reports on you.  To order your reports, you simply write or call them at the numbers below.                     You are also eligible for Free Credit Reports once a year.                                     Requests for free Annual Reports are not made to the bureaus themselves, they are made to their Combined Service.  You can order your free reports online instantly thru  Credit Doctor Software , or complete an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mail it to: Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281.  With the new laws, you are now entitled to one free copy from each of the nationwide consumer reporting companies every 12 months.                    You need to provide your name, address, Social Security number, and date of birth. If you have moved in the last two years, you may have to provide your previous address. To maintain the security of your file, each nationwide consumer reporting company may ask you for some information that only you would know, like the amount of your monthly mortgage payment. Each company may ask you for different information because the information each has in your file may come from different sources.                    There are also other circumstances which will allow you to receive free credit history reports.  Under federal law, you're entitled to a free report if a company takes adverse action against you, such as denying your application for credit, insurance, or employment, and you ask for your report within 60 days of receiving notice of the action. The notice will give you the name, address, and phone number of the consumer reporting company. You're also entitled to one free report per year if you're unemployed and plan to look for a job within 60 days; if you're on welfare; or if your report is inaccurate because of fraud or identity theft. Otherwise, any of the three consumer reporting companies may charge you up to $10.00 for another copy of your report within a 12-month period.                    To buy copies of your credit history report, contact:                    Equifax                  800-685-1111                                    Experian                  888-EXPERIAN (397-3742)                                    Trans Union                  800-916-8800                    Under state law, consumers in Colorado, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Vermont already have free access to their credit reports                                         REVIEWING YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                      Recent studies by a Public Interest Research Group found that over 70% of credit reports contain errors. Incorrect information in your credit file lowers your credit score. As the result you get a higher interest rate when you: take a loan, open a new credit card account, lease a car, etc.  29% of the credit reports in this study contained even more serious errors that could result in the denial of credit. These errors included false delinquencies, public records, judgments and credit accounts that did not belong to the consumer.  Sometimes these errors are the work of sloppy data entry, but it is also often due to the ever growing epidemic of identity theft.                     Since your Credit Reports are used to determine IF you are to be given credit (and what rates you will be charged), it is in your best interest to examine your reports carefully, correct inaccurate information and make every effort to remove ALL Unfavorable information.  If you see problems on your report, such as an unpaid bill that you simply forgot about, act right away to resolve the debt. Then ask that creditor to send a letter to the credit reporting agencies stating that the matter has been resolved.                     Check for accounts you didn't open, charges you haven't made, and delinquencies you didn't cause. If you suspect fraud on one of your reports, contact that credit bureau IMMEDIATELY. Explain the situation and ask them to place a fraud alert on your file. Also report the fraud to the police.                    Your credit reports follow you throughout your life and can help you greatly -- or hurt you. Review them carefully!                                                              HOW TO READ YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                    The bulk of the report will be filled with credit information showing the following:                    1). Identification Information  The first thing listed will be your name, date of birth and Social Security number. These are used for identification. Employment information may also be listed.  As well as current and past addresses, spouse's name (if you're married) and date of birth are also listed for further identification.                      2). Public Record Information -- Data from federal, state or county court records. Bankruptcies, liens or judgments and other types of claims.  Info listed will be; Date filed, court case number, amount, status and date settled.                    3). Collection Agency Information --  A collection is an account that has been turned over to a collection agency by one of your creditors because you have not paid the account as agreed.  Listed here are; Collector's name, originating creditor/client, original amount, balance due and account number.                    4). Credit Information  -- This section makes up the bulk of the report.  It will include Mortgage, Installment, Revolving, Other, Open and Closed Accounts.  It will also list Accounts in Good Standing, Accounts Currently Past due and Negative Account History.  Merchant/Creditor name, Subscriber Number, account number, Date opened, Date closed, Current Balance, Highest credit limit, Highest amount of credit used, and your Repayment History.  Your Repayment History is shown as a string of numbers showing your payment history.                    With each credit account, you will see listed the account's status and history.  They are generally marked as follows;                    • Current Account - ""Account Open"" or ""Closed in Good Standing""                  • Closed Account - Credit Account Closed                  • Paid Account - Closed Account or Zero Balance                  • Credit Account Reinstated - Previously Closed Account Now Available for use                  • Foreclosure - Collateral sold to collect Defaulted Mortgage                  • Collection Account - Credit Account Assigned to Collection Agency                  • Inquiry - your credit information was requested by this Company or Creditor                     5). Inquiries that display                    All authorized and legitimate requests to see your credit history.                     6). Inquiries that DO NOT display                    These inquiries are displayed only to you and are not considered when tabulating  your credit score. Examples of this inquiry type include a pre-approved offer of credit, insurance or periodic account reviews by an existing creditor.                    7). Consumer Statements                    If for some reason you cannot prove that a negative item is an error or if you are having a disagreement with a certain creditor, you have the right to tell your side of the story in 100 words or less. This statement will be ADDED to your report.                                                              SUMMARY OF WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN YOUR CREDIT HISTORY REPORT                    Credit Reports seem rather cryptic at first, but once you see how they are laid out they will start to make sense. These are the important things to examine:                                        Make sure your personal Information is correct                      Make sure your accounts are listed correctly                      Make sure your credit lines are listed correctly                      Make sure your balances are listed correctly                      If YOU closed an account, it should say ""Account closed BY CONSUMER.""                                                                                 STATING YOUR DISPUTE                    Make certain that all information is current and accurate, including the Personal Identification information (address, social security, etc…). If you find an error (for example, a loan that you have PAID OFF is still listed as outstanding), tell the Credit Bureau (in writing) EXACTLY what the mistake is, and explain the way that the information SHOULD be listed. For example, ""My Loan to Bank of Fred is NOT outstanding. It was paid in full on 02/14//05.""  Send photocopies along with all the necessary information to backup your claim.                            After you have done this send it to the credit bureau by ""CERTIFIED MAIL."" When the credit bureau receives your report and the information in question, they are required to investigate and ADVISE YOU of the results of their investigation. They must do this Free of charge.                    Anytime that you are denied credit you have the right to know why.  If you are turned down for a credit account at a store, you will receive a statement from the store stating that you were denied credit and their reason why. If the store based their decision on your credit history, they must provide you with the name and address of the agency that reported it.                    If for some reason you cannot prove that a negative item is an error or if you are having a disagreement with a certain creditor, you have the right to tell your side of the story in 100 words or less. This statement will be ADDED to your report.                    When correcting items on your credit report, you have the right to demand that the credit bureau send corrected copies of your report to all creditors who have received the incorrect reports for the past six months. Note: Credit bureaus will not do this automatically! They will only do it if you ask.  So make sure you ask.  It's your right!                                                              SAMPLE DISPUTE LETTER                    Here is a sample letter with sample dispute items.  Use the ones you need and delete the rest.

I understand that under 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1681i(a), you must complete this reinvestigation within 30 days of receipt of this letter.  Please send an updated copy of my credit report to the above address. According to the act, there shall be no charge for this updated report. I also request that you please send notices of corrections to anyone who received my credit report in the past six months.                    Thank you time and help in this matter.                                    Sincerely,                    _____________________________________                  [Signature]                                     Make sure you send this letter by certified mail.  Enclose a copy of the credit report containing the items you are disputing.  It may also help to circle the items.  Also include copies (not originals) of any paperwork you may have that validates your claims.                                                              DEALING WITH NEGATIVE (BUT CORRECT) INFORMATION ON YOUR REPORT  (AND COLLECTION AGENCIES)                    Despite popular belief, it is often possible to negotiate removal of negative items on your credit reports posted by creditors.  In some cases, you might not even have to pay them the full amount owed*. The important thing is to be positive, be patient and get in contact with them to try to work out a deal.                    If you've ignored (or never received) a creditor's bills or phone calls, or if you failed to keep up with payments, your bill may be turned over to a collection agency.  Keep in mind that collection agencies are hired by the creditor and their only goal is to collect the money owed (or as much of it as they can) as quickly as possible.  For their efforts, they are paid a percentage of what they collect.                     If you feel that the amount in question is being billed in error, you have the right to ask for proof and verification of the charges.  If the charges are indeed yours it may be in your best interest to negotiate with the collection agency.  You may be able to negotiate payment of the total sum (or even a partial amount) in return for their removing their negative marks on your Credit History Report.  You might be able to settle on paying a portion of your debt, or you might be able to work out a payment installment plan with them.  Many of the Creditor letters in the STOREROOM  can be used with collection agencies for these situations.  Whatever deal you make with them, be sure that you have it all in writing prior to paying them.                    Collection agencies can be very aggressive when it comes to collecting money.  Remember that you have rights.  You have the right to ask a collection agency stop contacting you, especially if you feel harassed. Use these letters below to give yourself breathing room while working through your plan to reorganize your finances.                    *See the letters in the Storeroom section.                                                              SEVEN STEPS TO BOOST YOUR FICO SCORE                                                             Correct all inaccuracies on your Credit Report.                                         Go through your credit reports very carefully.  Especially look for; Late payments, charge-offs, collections or other negative items that aren't yours, Accounts listed as ""settled,"" ""paid derogatory,"" ""paid charge-off"" or anything other than ""current"" or ""paid as agreed"" if you paid on time and in full, Accounts that are still listed as unpaid that were included in a bankruptcy, Negative items older than seven years (10 in the case of bankruptcy) that should have automatically fallen off your report (you must be careful with this last one, because sometimes scores actually go down when bad items fall off your report. It's a quirk in the FICO credit-scoring software, and the potential effect of eliminating old negative items is difficult to predict in advance).  Also make sure you don't have duplicate collection notices listed.  For example; if you have an account that has gone to collections, the original creditor may list the debt, as well as the collection agency.  Any duplicates must be removed!                                          Make sure that your proper credit lines are posted on your Credit Reports.                                         Often, in an effort to make you less desirable to their competitors, some creditors will not post your proper credit line.  Showing less available credit can negatively impact your credit score.  If you see this happening on your credit report, you have a right to complain and bring this to their attention.  If you have bankruptcies that should be showing a zero balance…make sure they show a zero balance! Very often the creditor will not report a ""bankruptcy charge-off"" as a zero balance until it's been disputed.                      If you have any negative marks on your credit report, negotiate with the creditor/lender to remove it.                      If you are a long time customer and it's something simple like a one-time late payment, a creditor will often wipe it away to keep you as a loyal customer.  If you have a serious negative mark (such as a long overdue bill that has gone to collections), always negotiate a payment in exchange for removal of the negative item.  Always make sure you have this agreement with them in writing.  Do not pay off a bill that has gone to collections unless the creditor agrees in writing that they will remove the derogatory item from your credit report.  This is important; when speaking with the creditor or collection agency about a debt that has gone to collections, do not admit that the debt is yours.  Admission of debt can restart the statute of limitations, and may enable the creditor to sue you.  You are also less likely to be able to negotiate a letter of deletion if you admit that this debt is yours.   Simply say ""I'm calling about account number ________"" instead of ""I'm calling about my past due debt.""                                              Pay all credit cards and any revolving credit down to below 30% of the available credit line.                                           The scoring system wants to make sure you aren't overextended, but at the same time, they want to see that you do indeed use your credit. 30% of the available credit line seems to be the magic ""balance vs. credit line"" ratio to have.  For example; if you have a Credit Card with a $10,000 credit line, make sure that never more than $3000 (even if you pay your account off in full each month).  If your balances are higher than 30% of the available credit line, pay them down.   Here is another thing you can try; ask your long time creditors if they will raise your Credit Line without checking your FICO score or your Credit Report.  Tell them that you're shopping for a house and you can't afford to have any hits on your credit report.  Many will not but some will.                                          Do not close your old credit card accounts.                                          Old established accounts show your history, and tell about your stability and paying habits.  If you have old credit card accounts that you want to stop using, just cut up the cards or keep them in a drawer, but keep the accounts open.                                           Avoid applying for new credit.                     Each time you apply for new credit, your credit report gets checked. New credit cards will not help your credit score and a credit account less than one year old may hurt your credit score.  Use your cards and credit as little as possible until the next credit scoring.                                           Have at least three revolving credit lines and one active (or paid) installment loan listed on your Credit Report.                      The scoring system wants to see that you maintain a variety of credit accounts.  It also wants to see that you have 3 revolving credit lines.  If you do not have three active credit cards, you might want to open some (but keep in mind that if you do, you will need to wait some time before rescoring).  If you have poor credit and are not approved for a typical credit card, you might want to set up a ""secured credit card"" account.  This means that you will have to make a deposit that is equal or more than your limit, which guarantees the bank that you will repay the loan.  It's an excellent way to establish credit.  Examples of an installment loan would be a car loan, or it could be for furniture or a major appliance.  In addition to the above, having a mortgage listed will bring your score even higher.                                      Throughout this process, always remember:                    I t takes up to 30 Days for any of these things to get reported and often longer to reflect on your Credit History Reports.  It feels like a slow process, but hang in there, because it DOES work.  This tedious process can be made much simpler with the automated help of Credit Doctor™ Software  www.creditdoctorsoftware.com .   Credit Doctor™ stores your user information to merge into its database of letters, saving you many long hours of letter writing.                                                                            A SUMMARY OF YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT                    The Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) promotes the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. There are many types of consumer reporting agencies, including credit bureaus and specialty agencies (such as agencies that sell information about check writing histories, medical records, and rental history records). Here is a summary of your major rights under the FCRA. For more information, including information about additional rights, go to www.ftc.gov or write to: Consumer Response Center, Room 130-A, Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Ave. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20580.                                     • You must be told if information in your file has been used against you. Anyone who uses a credit report or another type of consumer report to deny your application for credit, insurance, or employment - or to take another adverse action against you - must tell you, and must give you the name, address, and phone number of the agency that provided the information.                    • You have the right to know what is in your file. You may request and obtain all the information about you in the files of a consumer reporting agency (your ""file disclosure""). You will be required to provide proper identification, which may include your Social Security number. In many cases, the disclosure will be free.                    You are entitled to a free file disclosure if:                                        a person has taken adverse action against you because of information in your credit report                      you are the victim of identify theft and place a fraud alert in your file                      your file contains inaccurate information as a result of fraud                      you are on public assistance                      you are unemployed but expect to apply for employment within 60 days. In addition, by September 2005 all consumers will be entitled to one free disclosure every 12 months upon request from each nationwide credit bureau and from nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies. See www.ftc.gov for additional information.                                      You have the right to ask for a credit score. Credit scores are numerical summaries of your credit-worthiness based on information from credit bureaus. You may request a credit score from consumer reporting agencies that create scores or distribute scores used in residential real property loans, but you will have to pay for it. In some mortgage transactions, you will receive credit score information for free from the mortgage lender.                    You have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information. If you identify information in your file that is incomplete or inaccurate, and report it to the consumer reporting agency, the agency must investigate unless your dispute is frivolous. See www.ftc.gov for an explanation of dispute procedures.                    Consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information. Inaccurate, incomplete or unverifiable information must be removed or corrected, usually within 30 days. However, a consumer reporting agency may continue to report information it has verified as accurate.                    Consumer reporting agencies may not report outdated negative information. In most cases, a consumer reporting agency may not report negative information that is more than seven years old, or bankruptcies that are more than 10 years old.                    Access to your file is limited. A consumer reporting agency may provide information about you only to people with a valid need -- usually to consider an application with a creditor, insurer, employer, landlord, or other business. The FCRA specifies those with a valid need for access.                  You must give your consent for reports to be provided to employers. A consumer reporting agency may not give out information about you to your employer, or a potential employer, without your written consent given to the employer. Written consent generally is not required in the trucking industry. For more information, go to www.ftc.gov.                    You may limit ""prescreened"" offers of credit and insurance you get based on information in your credit report. Unsolicited ""prescreened"" offers for credit and insurance must include a toll-free phone number you can call if you choose to remove your name and address from the lists these offers are based on. You may opt-out with the nationwide credit bureaus at 1-888-5-OPTOUT (1-888-567-8688).                    You may seek damages from violators. If a consumer reporting agency, or, in some cases, a user of consumer reports or a furnisher of information to a consumer reporting agency violates the FCRA, you may be able to sue in state or federal court.                    Identity theft victims and active duty military personnel have additional rights. For more information, visit www.ftc.gov.

You can have negative misinformation wiped away from your reports, you can negotiate with creditors to remove negative postings and lower your payments, and you can raise your credit score higher so you can get the loan that you want at the low interest rated you deserve.  All it takes is perseverance, a positive attitude and knowledge.  You're reading this book, and that's good positive start.                     Just remember:  If every single day you do at least one (1) thing to better your credit, you will generate momentum to bring you closer to your goal.                    I hope you enjoy this booklet and find it useful!  Good luck to you on your journey to better credit.                    ─ Credit Doctor                                                                                                  TWO THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT CREDIT REPAIR                                                             Credit Repair Companies are very expensive.  They can charge anywhere from a few hundred dollars to thousands.  You do not need to pay a credit repair company a lot of money to repair your credit.  Anything they can do for you, you can do for yourself for free or little cost.                                          You do not need a Software Program to repair your credit.  However, there is an awful lot of letter writing and record keeping involved, and an inexpensive program to help automate the process and point you in the right directions can literally save you hundreds of hours and aggravation and can keep you organized, so you never again find yourself in a credit nightmare.                                                                              YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                    A credit report is the equivalent of a consumer's financial report card. It details your credit history as it has been reported to the credit reporting agency by the lenders who've given you credit. Your credit report lists the types of credit you use, the amount of time your accounts have been open, and if you pay your bills on time.                    Your credit report is used by many different companies to make decisions about you. Credit card companies, Banks, mortgage companies, auto loan and insurance companies, also landlords and employers check credit reports to check on your credit history. Why? They know that if you were responsible in the past, you are likely be responsible in the future (and vice versa).                                                              CREDIT SCORING                    ""Credit scoring"" of is a system creditors use to help determine whether to give you credit, and how much to charge you for it.  When you apply for credit, the creditor or lender will often request your report (or credit score) from one of the big three bureaus (Equifax, Experian and Trans-Union).  In some instances, however (such as when applying for a Mortgage), the broker or lender will pull reports from all three. These Bureaus grade your ""credit worthiness"" by calculating your credit history against a system called the Fair Isaac Model.  Fair Isaac uses a variety of factors to determine your score, such as; your bill-paying history, the number and type of accounts you have, late payments, collection actions, outstanding debt, and the age of your accounts.                    The final outcome of those calculations is referred to as your FICOscore.  FICOscores range from 300 to 850, but the majority of scores fall between the 600s and 700s. Higher scores indicate a lower credit risk.  A FICOscore above 700 will get you a very good mortgage rate.  A score above 720 will get you an excellent rate.  A score below 700 will make it very difficult for you, and definitely should be worked on.                    Correcting mistakes on a credit report in order to repair an undesirable credit score takes time. It's your responsibility to correct mistakes that may appear in your credit report. To do this, you must regularly obtain copies of your credit reports, and contact each of the big three credit reporting bureaus to correct any misinformation.                                                              HOW TO GET COPIES OF YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                    The three nationwide consumer reporting companies Equifax, Experian and Trans-union are the three major bureaus that maintain credit reports on you.  To order your reports, you simply write or call them at the numbers below.                     You are also eligible for Free Credit Reports once a year.                                     Requests for free Annual Reports are not made to the bureaus themselves, they are made to their Combined Service.  You can order your free reports online instantly thru  Credit Doctor Software , or complete an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mail it to: Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281.  With the new laws, you are now entitled to one free copy from each of the nationwide consumer reporting companies every 12 months.                    You need to provide your name, address, Social Security number, and date of birth. If you have moved in the last two years, you may have to provide your previous address. To maintain the security of your file, each nationwide consumer reporting company may ask you for some information that only you would know, like the amount of your monthly mortgage payment. Each company may ask you for different information because the information each has in your file may come from different sources.                    There are also other circumstances which will allow you to receive free credit history reports.  Under federal law, you're entitled to a free report if a company takes adverse action against you, such as denying your application for credit, insurance, or employment, and you ask for your report within 60 days of receiving notice of the action. The notice will give you the name, address, and phone number of the consumer reporting company. You're also entitled to one free report per year if you're unemployed and plan to look for a job within 60 days; if you're on welfare; or if your report is inaccurate because of fraud or identity theft. Otherwise, any of the three consumer reporting companies may charge you up to $10.00 for another copy of your report within a 12-month period.                    To buy copies of your credit history report, contact:                    Equifax                  800-685-1111                                    Experian                  888-EXPERIAN (397-3742)                                    Trans Union                  800-916-8800                    Under state law, consumers in Colorado, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Vermont already have free access to their credit reports                                         REVIEWING YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                      Recent studies by a Public Interest Research Group found that over 70% of credit reports contain errors. Incorrect information in your credit file lowers your credit score. As the result you get a higher interest rate when you: take a loan, open a new credit card account, lease a car, etc.  29% of the credit reports in this study contained even more serious errors that could result in the denial of credit. These errors included false delinquencies, public records, judgments and credit accounts that did not belong to the consumer.  Sometimes these errors are the work of sloppy data entry, but it is also often due to the ever growing epidemic of identity theft.                     Since your Credit Reports are used to determine IF you are to be given credit (and what rates you will be charged), it is in your best interest to examine your reports carefully, correct inaccurate information and make every effort to remove ALL Unfavorable information.  If you see problems on your report, such as an unpaid bill that you simply forgot about, act right away to resolve the debt. Then ask that creditor to send a letter to the credit reporting agencies stating that the matter has been resolved.                     Check for accounts you didn't open, charges you haven't made, and delinquencies you didn't cause. If you suspect fraud on one of your reports, contact that credit bureau IMMEDIATELY. Explain the situation and ask them to place a fraud alert on your file. Also report the fraud to the police.                    Your credit reports follow you throughout your life and can help you greatly -- or hurt you. Review them carefully!                                                              HOW TO READ YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                    The bulk of the report will be filled with credit information showing the following:                    1). Identification Information  The first thing listed will be your name, date of birth and Social Security number. These are used for identification. Employment information may also be listed.  As well as current and past addresses, spouse's name (if you're married) and date of birth are also listed for further identification.                      2). Public Record Information -- Data from federal, state or county court records. Bankruptcies, liens or judgments and other types of claims.  Info listed will be; Date filed, court case number, amount, status and date settled.                    3). Collection Agency Information --  A collection is an account that has been turned over to a collection agency by one of your creditors because you have not paid the account as agreed.  Listed here are; Collector's name, originating creditor/client, original amount, balance due and account number.                    4). Credit Information  -- This section makes up the bulk of the report.  It will include Mortgage, Installment, Revolving, Other, Open and Closed Accounts.  It will also list Accounts in Good Standing, Accounts Currently Past due and Negative Account History.  Merchant/Creditor name, Subscriber Number, account number, Date opened, Date closed, Current Balance, Highest credit limit, Highest amount of credit used, and your Repayment History.  Your Repayment History is shown as a string of numbers showing your payment history.                    With each credit account, you will see listed the account's status and history.  They are generally marked as follows;                    • Current Account - ""Account Open"" or ""Closed in Good Standing""                  • Closed Account - Credit Account Closed                  • Paid Account - Closed Account or Zero Balance                  • Credit Account Reinstated - Previously Closed Account Now Available for use                  • Foreclosure - Collateral sold to collect Defaulted Mortgage                  • Collection Account - Credit Account Assigned to Collection Agency                  • Inquiry - your credit information was requested by this Company or Creditor                     5). Inquiries that display                    All authorized and legitimate requests to see your credit history.                     6). Inquiries that DO NOT display                    These inquiries are displayed only to you and are not considered when tabulating  your credit score. Examples of this inquiry type include a pre-approved offer of credit, insurance or periodic account reviews by an existing creditor.                    7). Consumer Statements                    If for some reason you cannot prove that a negative item is an error or if you are having a disagreement with a certain creditor, you have the right to tell your side of the story in 100 words or less. This statement will be ADDED to your report.                                                              SUMMARY OF WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN YOUR CREDIT HISTORY REPORT                    Credit Reports seem rather cryptic at first, but once you see how they are laid out they will start to make sense. These are the important things to examine:                                        Make sure your personal Information is correct                      Make sure your accounts are listed correctly                      Make sure your credit lines are listed correctly                      Make sure your balances are listed correctly                      If YOU closed an account, it should say ""Account closed BY CONSUMER.""                                                                                 STATING YOUR DISPUTE                    Make certain that all information is current and accurate, including the Personal Identification information (address, social security, etc…). If you find an error (for example, a loan that you have PAID OFF is still listed as outstanding), tell the Credit Bureau (in writing) EXACTLY what the mistake is, and explain the way that the information SHOULD be listed. For example, ""My Loan to Bank of Fred is NOT outstanding. It was paid in full on 02/14//05.""  Send photocopies along with all the necessary information to backup your claim.                            After you have done this send it to the credit bureau by ""CERTIFIED MAIL."" When the credit bureau receives your report and the information in question, they are required to investigate and ADVISE YOU of the results of their investigation. They must do this Free of charge.                    Anytime that you are denied credit you have the right to know why.  If you are turned down for a credit account at a store, you will receive a statement from the store stating that you were denied credit and their reason why. If the store based their decision on your credit history, they must provide you with the name and address of the agency that reported it.                    If for some reason you cannot prove that a negative item is an error or if you are having a disagreement with a certain creditor, you have the right to tell your side of the story in 100 words or less. This statement will be ADDED to your report.                    When correcting items on your credit report, you have the right to demand that the credit bureau send corrected copies of your report to all creditors who have received the incorrect reports for the past six months. Note: Credit bureaus will not do this automatically! They will only do it if you ask.  So make sure you ask.  It's your right!                                                              SAMPLE DISPUTE LETTER                    Here is a sample letter with sample dispute items.  Use the ones you need and delete the rest.

It is my understanding that you will recheck these items with the creditor who has posted them.  Please remove any information that the creditor cannot verify.                    I understand that under 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1681i(a), you must complete this reinvestigation within 30 days of receipt of this letter.  Please send an updated copy of my credit report to the above address. According to the act, there shall be no charge for this updated report. I also request that you please send notices of corrections to anyone who received my credit report in the past six months.                    Thank you time and help in this matter.                                    Sincerely,                    _____________________________________                  [Signature]                                     Make sure you send this letter by certified mail.  Enclose a copy of the credit report containing the items you are disputing.  It may also help to circle the items.  Also include copies (not originals) of any paperwork you may have that validates your claims.                                                              DEALING WITH NEGATIVE (BUT CORRECT) INFORMATION ON YOUR REPORT  (AND COLLECTION AGENCIES)                    Despite popular belief, it is often possible to negotiate removal of negative items on your credit reports posted by creditors.  In some cases, you might not even have to pay them the full amount owed*. The important thing is to be positive, be patient and get in contact with them to try to work out a deal.                    If you've ignored (or never received) a creditor's bills or phone calls, or if you failed to keep up with payments, your bill may be turned over to a collection agency.  Keep in mind that collection agencies are hired by the creditor and their only goal is to collect the money owed (or as much of it as they can) as quickly as possible.  For their efforts, they are paid a percentage of what they collect.                     If you feel that the amount in question is being billed in error, you have the right to ask for proof and verification of the charges.  If the charges are indeed yours it may be in your best interest to negotiate with the collection agency.  You may be able to negotiate payment of the total sum (or even a partial amount) in return for their removing their negative marks on your Credit History Report.  You might be able to settle on paying a portion of your debt, or you might be able to work out a payment installment plan with them.  Many of the Creditor letters in the STOREROOM  can be used with collection agencies for these situations.  Whatever deal you make with them, be sure that you have it all in writing prior to paying them.                    Collection agencies can be very aggressive when it comes to collecting money.  Remember that you have rights.  You have the right to ask a collection agency stop contacting you, especially if you feel harassed. Use these letters below to give yourself breathing room while working through your plan to reorganize your finances.                    *See the letters in the Storeroom section.                                                              SEVEN STEPS TO BOOST YOUR FICO SCORE                                                             Correct all inaccuracies on your Credit Report.                                         Go through your credit reports very carefully.  Especially look for; Late payments, charge-offs, collections or other negative items that aren't yours, Accounts listed as ""settled,"" ""paid derogatory,"" ""paid charge-off"" or anything other than ""current"" or ""paid as agreed"" if you paid on time and in full, Accounts that are still listed as unpaid that were included in a bankruptcy, Negative items older than seven years (10 in the case of bankruptcy) that should have automatically fallen off your report (you must be careful with this last one, because sometimes scores actually go down when bad items fall off your report. It's a quirk in the FICO credit-scoring software, and the potential effect of eliminating old negative items is difficult to predict in advance).  Also make sure you don't have duplicate collection notices listed.  For example; if you have an account that has gone to collections, the original creditor may list the debt, as well as the collection agency.  Any duplicates must be removed!                                          Make sure that your proper credit lines are posted on your Credit Reports.                                         Often, in an effort to make you less desirable to their competitors, some creditors will not post your proper credit line.  Showing less available credit can negatively impact your credit score.  If you see this happening on your credit report, you have a right to complain and bring this to their attention.  If you have bankruptcies that should be showing a zero balance…make sure they show a zero balance! Very often the creditor will not report a ""bankruptcy charge-off"" as a zero balance until it's been disputed.                      If you have any negative marks on your credit report, negotiate with the creditor/lender to remove it.                      If you are a long time customer and it's something simple like a one-time late payment, a creditor will often wipe it away to keep you as a loyal customer.  If you have a serious negative mark (such as a long overdue bill that has gone to collections), always negotiate a payment in exchange for removal of the negative item.  Always make sure you have this agreement with them in writing.  Do not pay off a bill that has gone to collections unless the creditor agrees in writing that they will remove the derogatory item from your credit report.  This is important; when speaking with the creditor or collection agency about a debt that has gone to collections, do not admit that the debt is yours.  Admission of debt can restart the statute of limitations, and may enable the creditor to sue you.  You are also less likely to be able to negotiate a letter of deletion if you admit that this debt is yours.   Simply say ""I'm calling about account number ________"" instead of ""I'm calling about my past due debt.""                                                                                                                                   Pay all credit cards and any revolving credit down to below 30% of the available credit line.                                           The scoring system wants to make sure you aren't overextended, but at the same time, they want to see that you do indeed use your credit. 30% of the available credit line seems to be the magic ""balance vs. credit line"" ratio to have.  For example; if you have a Credit Card with a $10,000 credit line, make sure that never more than $3000 (even if you pay your account off in full each month).  If your balances are higher than 30% of the available credit line, pay them down.   Here is another thing you can try; ask your long time creditors if they will raise your Credit Line without checking your FICO score or your Credit Report.  Tell them that you're shopping for a house and you can't afford to have any hits on your credit report.  Many will not but some will.                                          Do not close your old credit card accounts.                                          Old established accounts show your history, and tell about your stability and paying habits.  If you have old credit card accounts that you want to stop using, just cut up the cards or keep them in a drawer, but keep the accounts open.                                           Avoid applying for new credit.                     Each time you apply for new credit, your credit report gets checked. New credit cards will not help your credit score and a credit account less than one year old may hurt your credit score.  Use your cards and credit as little as possible until the next credit scoring.                                           Have at least three revolving credit lines and one active (or paid) installment loan listed on your Credit Report.                      The scoring system wants to see that you maintain a variety of credit accounts.  It also wants to see that you have 3 revolving credit lines.  If you do not have three active credit cards, you might want to open some (but keep in mind that if you do, you will need to wait some time before rescoring).  If you have poor credit and are not approved for a typical credit card, you might want to set up a ""secured credit card"" account.  This means that you will have to make a deposit that is equal or more than your limit, which guarantees the bank that you will repay the loan.  It's an excellent way to establish credit.  Examples of an installment loan would be a car loan, or it could be for furniture or a major appliance.  In addition to the above, having a mortgage listed will bring your score even higher.                                      Throughout this process, always remember:                    I t takes up to 30 Days for any of these things to get reported and often longer to reflect on your Credit History Reports.

There are many types of consumer reporting agencies, including credit bureaus and specialty agencies (such as agencies that sell information about check writing histories, medical records, and rental history records). Here is a summary of your major rights under the FCRA. For more information, including information about additional rights, go to www.ftc.gov or write to: Consumer Response Center, Room 130-A, Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Ave. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20580.                                     • You must be told if information in your file has been used against you. Anyone who uses a credit report or another type of consumer report to deny your application for credit, insurance, or employment - or to take another adverse action against you - must tell you, and must give you the name, address, and phone number of the agency that provided the information.                    • You have the right to know what is in your file. You may request and obtain all the information about you in the files of a consumer reporting agency (your ""file disclosure""). You will be required to provide proper identification, which may include your Social Security number. In many cases, the disclosure will be free.                    You are entitled to a free file disclosure if:                                        a person has taken adverse action against you because of information in your credit report                      you are the victim of identify theft and place a fraud alert in your file                      your file contains inaccurate information as a result of fraud                      you are on public assistance                      you are unemployed but expect to apply for employment within 60 days. In addition, by September 2005 all consumers will be entitled to one free disclosure every 12 months upon request from each nationwide credit bureau and from nationwide specialty consumer reporting agencies. See www.ftc.gov for additional information.                                      You have the right to ask for a credit score. Credit scores are numerical summaries of your credit-worthiness based on information from credit bureaus. You may request a credit score from consumer reporting agencies that create scores or distribute scores used in residential real property loans, but you will have to pay for it. In some mortgage transactions, you will receive credit score information for free from the mortgage lender.                    You have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information. If you identify information in your file that is incomplete or inaccurate, and report it to the consumer reporting agency, the agency must investigate unless your dispute is frivolous. See www.ftc.gov for an explanation of dispute procedures.                    Consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information. Inaccurate, incomplete or unverifiable information must be removed or corrected, usually within 30 days. However, a consumer reporting agency may continue to report information it has verified as accurate.                    Consumer reporting agencies may not report outdated negative information. In most cases, a consumer reporting agency may not report negative information that is more than seven years old, or bankruptcies that are more than 10 years old.                    Access to your file is limited. A consumer reporting agency may provide information about you only to people with a valid need -- usually to consider an application with a creditor, insurer, employer, landlord, or other business. The FCRA specifies those with a valid need for access.                  You must give your consent for reports to be provided to employers. A consumer reporting agency may not give out information about you to your employer, or a potential employer, without your written consent given to the employer. Written consent generally is not required in the trucking industry. For more information, go to www.ftc.gov.                    You may limit ""prescreened"" offers of credit and insurance you get based on information in your credit report. Unsolicited ""prescreened"" offers for credit and insurance must include a toll-free phone number you can call if you choose to remove your name and address from the lists these offers are based on. You may opt-out with the nationwide credit bureaus at 1-888-5-OPTOUT (1-888-567-8688).                    You may seek damages from violators. If a consumer reporting agency, or, in some cases, a user of consumer reports or a furnisher of information to a consumer reporting agency violates the FCRA, you may be able to sue in state or federal court.                    Identity theft victims and active duty military personnel have additional rights. For more information, visit www.ftc.gov.

They can charge anywhere from a few hundred dollars to thousands.  You do not need to pay a repair company a lot of money to repair your credit.  Anything they can do for you, you can do for yourself for free or little cost.                                     You do not need a Software Program applications to repair your credit.  However, there is an awful lot of letter writing and record keeping involved, and an inexpensive program to help automate the process and point you in the right directions can literally save you hundreds of hours and aggravation and can keep you organized, so you never again find yourself in a financial nightmare.                                                                                    YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                 A credit report is the equivalent of a consumer's financial report card. It details your history as it has been reported to the credit reporting agency by the lenders who've given you credit. Your credit report lists the types of credit you use, the amount of time your accounts have been open, and if you pay your bills on time.                 These credit reports are used by many different companies to make decisions about you. Banks, mortgage companies, auto loan and insurance companies, also landlords and employers make check on your credit history. Why? They know that if you were responsible in the past, you are likely be responsible in the future (and vice versa).                                                      CREDIT SCORING                                ""Scoring"" of is a system Lenders use to help determine whether to give you credit, and how much to charge you for it.  When you fill out a loan application, bank or lender will often request your credit report (or score) from one of the big three bureaus (Equifax, Experian and Trans-Union).  In some instances, however (such as when applying for a Mortgage), the broker or lender will pull credit reports from all three. These Bureaus grade your ""credit worthiness"" by calculating your credit history against a system called the Fair Isaac Model.  Fair Isaac uses a variety of factors to determine your score, such as; your bill-paying history, the number and type of accounts you have, late payments, collection actions, outstanding debt, and the age of your accounts.                 The final outcome of those calculations is referred to as your FICOscore.  FICOsc ores range from 300 to 850, but the majority of scores fall between the 600s and 700s. Higher scores indicate a lower credit risk.  A FICOscore above 700 will get you a very good mortgage rate.  A score above 720 will get you an excellent rate.  A score below 700 will make it very difficult for you, and definitely should be worked on.                 Correcting mistakes on a credit report in order to repair an undesirable score takes time. It's your responsibility to correct mistakes that may appear in your credit report. To do this, you must regularly obtain copies of your credit reports, and contact each of the big three credit reporting bureaus to correct any misinformation.                                                      HOW TO GET COPIES OF YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                 The three nationwide consumer credit reporting companies Equifax, Experian and Trans-union are the three major bureaus that maintain credit reports on you.  To order your credit reports, you simply write or call them at the numbers below.                  You are also eligible for Free Credit Reports once a year.                                     Requests for free Annual Credit Reports are not made to the bureaus themselves, they are made to their Combined Service.  You can order your free credit reports online instantly thru  Credit Doctor Software , or complete an Annual credit report Request Form and mail it to: Annual credit report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281.  With the new laws, you are now entitled to one free copy from each of the nationwide consumer credit reporting companies every 12 months.                 You need to provide your name, address, Social Security number, and date of birth. If you have moved in the last two years, you may have to provide your previous address. To maintain the security of your file, each nationwide consumer credit reporting company may ask you for some information that only you would know, like the amount of your monthly mortgage payment. Each company may ask you for different information because the information each has in your file may come from different sources.                 There are also other circumstances which will allow you to receive free credit history reports.  Under federal law, you're entitled to a free credit report if a company takes adverse action against you, such as denying your application for credit, insurance, or employment, and you ask for your credit report within 60 days of receiving notice of the action. The notice will give you the name, address, and phone number of the consumer credit reporting company. You're also entitled to one free credit report per year if you're unemployed and plan to look for a job within 60 days; if you're on welfare; or if your credit report is inaccurate because of fraud or identity theft. Otherwise, any of the three consumer credit reporting companies may charge you up to $10.00 for another copy of your credit report within a 12-month period.                 To buy copies of your credit reports, contact:                 Equifax                800-685-1111                                Experian                888-EXPERIAN (397-3742)                                Trans Union                800-916-8800                                 Under state law, consumers in Colorado, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Vermont already have free access to their credit reports                                   REVIEWING YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                   Recent studies by a Public Interest Research Group found that over 70% of credit reports contain errors. Incorrect information in your file lowers your score. As the result you get a higher interest rate when you: take a loan, open a new credit card account, lease a car, etc.  29% of the credit reports in this study contained even more serious errors that could result in the denial of credit. These errors included false delinquencies, public records, judgments and accounts that did not belong to the consumer.  Sometimes these errors are the work of sloppy data entry, but it is also often due to the ever growing epidemic of identity theft.                  Since your credit reports are used to determine IF you are to be given credit (and what rates you will be charged), it is in your best interest to examine your credit reports carefully, correct inaccurate information and make every effort to remove ALL Unfavorable information.  If you see problems on your credit report, such as an unpaid bill that you simply forgot about, act right away to resolve the debt. Then ask that creditor to send a letter to the credit reporting agencies stating that the matter has been resolved.                  Check for accounts you didn't open, charges you haven't made, and delinquencies you didn't cause. If you suspect fraud on one of your credit reports, contact that bureau IMMEDIATELY. Explain the situation and ask them to place a fraud alert on your file. Also report the fraud to the police.                 Your credit reports follow you throughout your life and can help you greatly -- or hurt you. Review them carefully!                                                                      HOW TO READ YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                 The bulk of the credit report will be filled with information showing the following:                 1). Identification Information  The first thing listed will be your name, date of birth and Social Security number. These are used for identification. Employment information may also be listed.  As well as current and past addresses, spouse's name (if you're married) and date of birth are also listed for further identification.                   2). Public Record Information -- Data from federal, state or county court records. Bankruptcies, liens or judgments and other types of claims.  Info listed will be; Date filed, court case number, amount, status and date settled.                 3). Collection Agency Information --  A collection is an account that has been turned over to a collection agency by one of your creditors because you have not paid the account as agreed.  Listed here are; Collector's name, originating creditor/client, original amount, balance due and account number.                 4). Account Information  -- This section makes up the bulk of the credit report.  It will include Mortgage, Installment, Revolving, Other, Open and Closed Accounts.  It will also list Accounts in Good Standing, Accounts Currently Past due and Negative Account History.  Merchant/Creditor name, Subscriber Number, account number, Date opened, Date closed, Current Balance, Highest credit limit, Highest amount of credit used, and your Repayment History.  Your Repayment History is shown as a string of numbers showing your payment history.                 With each credit account, you will see listed the account's status and history.  They are generally marked as follows;                 • Current Account - ""Account Open"" or ""Closed in Good Standing""                  • Closed Account - Account Closed                  • Paid Account - Closed Account or Zero Balance                  • Credit Account Reinstated - Previously Closed Account Now Available for use                  • Foreclosure - Collateral sold to collect Defaulted Mortgage                  • Collection Account - Account Assigned to Collection Agency                  • Inquiry - your credit information was requested by this Company                  5). Inquiries that display                 All authorized and legitimate requests to see your credit history.                  6). Inquiries that DO NOT display                 These inquiries are displayed only to you and are not considered when tabulating  your credit score. Examples of this inquiry type include a pre-approved offer of credit, insurance or periodic account reviews by an existing creditor.                 7). Consumer Statements                 If for some reason you cannot prove that a negative item is an error or if you are having a disagreement with a certain creditor, you have the right to tell your side of the story in 100 words or less. This statement will be ADDED to your credit report.                                                      SUMMARY OF WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN YOUR CREDIT REPORT                                Credit Reports seem rather cryptic at first, but once you see how they are laid out they will start to make sense. These are the important things to examine:                                   Make sure your personal Information is correct                                     Make sure your accounts are listed correctly                   Make sure your credit lines are listed correctly                                     Make sure your balances are listed correctly                                                                                      If YOU closed an account, it should say ""Account closed BY CONSUMER.""                                                                                                                          STATING YOUR DISPUTE                 Make certain that all information is current and accurate, including the Personal Identification information (address, social security, etc…). If you find an error (for example, a loan that you have PAID OFF is still listed as outstanding), tell the Bureau (in writing) EXACTLY what the mistake is, and explain the way that the information SHOULD be listed. For example, ""My Loan to Bank of Fred is NOT outstanding. It was paid in full on 02/14//05.""  Send photocopies along with all the necessary information to backup your claim.                  After you have done this send it to the credit bureau by ""CERTIFIED MAIL."" When the credit bureau receives your credit report and the information in question, they are required to investigate and ADVISE YOU of the results of their investigation. They must do this Free of charge.                 Anytime that you are denied credit you have the right to know why.  If you are turned down for a credit account at a store, you will receive a statement from the store stating that you were denied credit and their reason why. If the store based their decision on your credit history, they must provide you with the name and address of the agency that reported it.                 If for some reason you cannot prove that a negative item is an error or if you are having a disagreement with a certain creditor, you have the right to tell your side of the story in 100 words or less. This statement will be ADDED to your credit report.                 When correcting items on your credit report, you have the right to demand that the bureau send corrected copies of your credit report to all creditors who have received the incorrect credit reports for the past six months. Note: The bureaus will not do this automatically! They will only do it if you ask.  So make sure you ask.  It's your right!                                   SAMPLE CREDIT REPORT DISPUTE LETTER                 Here is a sample letter with sample dispute items.  Use the ones you need and delete the rest.

See the attached copy of my credit report, the errors have been highlighted.                 Here as follows are items in error:                 Explanation                 By the provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I demand that these items be investigated and removed from my credit report.                 It is my understanding that you will recheck these items with the creditor who has posted them.  Please remove any information that cannot be verified.                 I understand that under 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1681i(a), you must complete this reinvestigation within 30 days of receipt of this letter.  Please send an updated copy of my credit report to the above address. According to the act, there shall be no charge for this updated credit report. I also request that you please send notices of corrections to anyone who received my credit report in the past six months.                 Thank you time and help in this matter.                                    Sincerely,                                 _____________________________________                  [Signature]                                  Make sure you send this letter by certified mail.  Enclose a copy of the credit report containing the items you are disputing.  It may also help to circle the items.  Also include copies (not originals) of any paperwork you may have that validates your claims.                                                                      DEALING WITH NEGATIVE (BUT CORRECT) INFORMATION ON YOUR CREDIT REPORT  (AND COLLECTION AGENCIES)                 Despite popular belief, it is often possible to negotiate removal of negative items on your credit reports posted by creditors.  In some cases, you might not even have to pay them the full amount owed*. The important thing is to be positive, be patient and get in contact with them to try to work out a deal.                 If you've ignored (or never received) a lender's bills or phone calls, or if you failed to keep up with payments, your bill may be turned over to a collection agency.  Keep in mind that collection agencies are hired by the creditor and their only goal is to collect the money owed (or as much of it as they can) as quickly as possible.  For their efforts, they are paid a percentage of what they collect.                  If you feel that the amount in question is being billed in error, you have the right to ask for proof and verification of the charges.  If the charges are indeed yours it may be in your best interest to negotiate with the collection agency.  You may be able to negotiate payment of the total sum (or even a partial amount) in return for their removing their negative marks on your Credit History Report.  You might be able to settle on paying a portion of your debt, or you might be able to work out a payment installment plan with them.  Many of the letters in the STOREROOM  can be used with collection agencies for these situations.  Whatever deal you make with them, be sure that you have it all in writing prior to paying them.                 Collection agencies can be very aggressive when it comes to collecting money.  Remember that you have rights.  You have the right to ask a collection agency stop contacting you, especially if you feel harassed. Use these letters below to give yourself breathing room while working through your plan to reorganize your finances.                 *See the letters in the Storeroom section.                                                                      SEVEN STEPS TO BOOST YOUR FICO SCORE                                                      Correct all inaccuracies in your Credit Reports.                                         Go through your credit reports very carefully.  Especially look for; Late payments, charge-offs, collections or other negative items that aren't yours, Accounts listed as ""settled,"" ""paid derogatory,"" ""paid charge-off"" or anything other than ""current"" or ""paid as agreed"" if you paid on time and in full, Accounts that are still listed as unpaid that were included in a bankruptcy, Negative items older than seven years (10 in the case of bankruptcy) that should have automatically fallen off your credit report (you must be careful with this last one, because sometimes scores actually go down when bad items fall off your credit report. It's a quirk in the FICO credit-scoring software, and the potential effect of eliminating old negative items is difficult to predict in advance).  Also make sure you don't have duplicate collection notices listed.  For example; if you have an account that has gone to collections, the original creditor may list the debt, as well as the collection agency.  Any duplicates must be removed!                                                         Make sure that your proper credit lines are posted on your Credit Reports.                                         Often, in an effort to make you less desirable to their competitors, some creditors will not post your proper credit line.  Showing less available credit can negatively impact your score.  If you see this happening on your credit report, you have a right to complain and bring this to their attention.  If you have bankruptcies that should be showing a zero balance…make sure they show a zero balance! Very often the Lender will not report a ""bankruptcy charge-off"" as a zero balance until it's been disputed.                                                         If you have any negative marks on your credit report, negotiate with the creditor/lender to remove it.                                        If you are a long time customer and it's something simple like a one-time late payment, a creditor will often wipe it away to keep you as a loyal customer.  If you have a serious negative mark (such as a long overdue bill that has gone to collections), always negotiate a payment in exchange for removal of the negative item.  Always make sure you have this agreement with them in writing.  Do not pay off a bill that has gone to collections unless the creditor agrees in writing that they will remove the derogatory item from your credit report.  This is important; when speaking with the creditor or collection agency about a debt that has gone to collections, do not admit that the debt is yours.  Admission of debt can restart the statute of limitations, and may enable the creditor to sue you.  You are also less likely to be able to negotiate a letter of deletion if you admit that this debt is yours.   Simply say ""I'm calling about account number ________"" instead of ""I'm calling about my past due debt.""                                         Pay all cards and any revolving credit down to below 30% of the available line.                                           The scoring system wants to make sure you aren't overextended, but at the same time, they want to see that you do indeed use your credit. 30% of the available credit line seems to be the magic ""balance vs. credit line"" ratio to have.  For example; if you have a card with a $10,000 line, make sure that never more than $3000 (even if you pay your account off in full each month).  If your balances are higher than 30% of the available line, pay them down.   Here is another thing you can try; ask your long time creditors if they will raise your Line without checking your FICO score or your credit report.  Tell them that you're shopping for a house and you can't afford to have any hits on your credit report.  Many will not but some will.                                                         Do not close your old credit card accounts.                                          Old established accounts show your history, and tell about your stability and paying habits.  If you have old card accounts that you want to stop using, just cut up the credit cards or keep them in a drawer, but keep the accounts open.                                                          Avoid applying for new credit.                                         Each time you apply, your credit report gets checked. New cards will not help your score and an account less than one year old may hurt your score.  Use your cards as little as possible until the next scoring.                                                          Have at least three revolving credit lines and one active (or paid) installment loan listed on your Credit Report.                                        The credit scoring system wants to see that you maintain a variety of accounts.  It also wants to see that you have 3 revolving credit lines.  If you do not have three active credit cards, you might want to open some (but keep in mind that if you do, you will need to wait some time before rescoring).  If you have poor credit and are not approved for a typicalcredit card, you might want to set up a ""secured card"" account.  This means that you will have to make a deposit that is equal or more than your limit, which guarantees the bank that you will repay the loan.  It's an excellent way to establish credit.  Examples of an installment loan would be a car loan, or it could be for furniture or a major appliance.  In addition to the above, having a mortgage listed will bring your credit score even higher.                                                   Throughout this process, always remember:                 I t takes up to 30 Days for any of these things to get reported and often longer to reflect on your Credit History Reports.

Under the new Vantage Score model used by all three bureaus, your credit score (FICO score), is a number between 501 (worst) and 990 (best) that is used to determine a consumer’s credit worthiness and potential risk to the lender. It is determined by one’s credit history. NOTICE: Not all institutions that check credit worthiness use the VantageScore. Some still rely on the traditional credit score systems of each individual Credit Bureau.   Get Your Report for $39.95 in 4 Minutes.

Equifax, Experian and TransUnion sometimes have access to different information, so your credit reports at each will reflect that different information. Your credit score also almost certainly will be different. Even through every agency uses the same software to compute credit scores – Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) – they use a different formula.

Sometimes your information can be sold to potential creditors so that they can offer you pre-approved credit offers. If you want off the list you should call 1-888-5-OPTOUT.

This does not change the requirement for credit reporting agencies            to provide a free copy if a consumer receives an adverse credit action            or is unemployed and actively seeking work.           Request credit report online at  www.annualcreditreport.com           Print and mail  request form  (DOC format)           Remember: If you are making the request jointly with a spouse, each            spouse must supply all the requested information, and both spouses must            sign the request. In addition, if you are living at a new address or            if your report has any ""mixed file"" issues, then the credit            reporting agencies can write back to you asking for additional proof            of your identity or address. In these cases, to save time you should            include with this request some definite proof that you live at your            current address, such as a copy of your driver's license, a copy of            a bank or insurance statement, or a utility bill.           When your credit report is sent to you, it will include directions            on what to do if your file contains errors. You will be asked to mail            your written dispute back to the credit reporting agency, and the agency            is required by law to promptly investigate your dispute and remove or            correct any erroneous, outdated or incomplete information.

Now you can do that for free. Thanks to a new federal law, consumers can get one free credit report a year from each of the three national credit bureaus.  Those bureaus are Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. 1  You can also get your reports for free from pecialtycredit bureaus. These companies prepare reports on your employment, insurance claims, rental and other histories.   Checking your credit reports at least once a year is a good way to discover identity theft. And the sooner identity theft is discovered, the easier it is to clear up. You can also identify errors in your credit reports that could be raising your cost of credit            Nationwide Consumer Reporting Agencies            The  three nationwide consumer credit reporting agencies, also called credit  bureaus, are Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. They compile credit histories on  consumers. Your credit history contains information from financial  institutions, utilities, landlords, insurers, and others. The credit bureaus  provide information on you to potential credit granters, insurers, landlords,  and employers. You have the right to get a free copy of your credit history in  several situations: 1) If a company denies you credit or makes another adverse  decision based on your credit history; 2) If you’re unemployed; 3) If you’re on  welfare; and 4) If your report is inaccurate because of fraud. You also have  the right to a free copy of your report from each of the credit bureaus every  year.         How to Order Your Free Annual Reports from Equifax, Experian and TransUnion               You can order your free annual credit reports through a toll-free phone number, online, or by mailing the Order Form at the end of this Information Sheet.           1-877-322-8228             www.annualcreditreport.com            Annual Credit Report Request Service            P. O. Box 105281            Atlanta, GA 30348-5281           You have the option of requesting all  three reports at once or staggering them. You could create a no-cost version of  a credit-monitoring service. Just order a free report from one credit bureau,  then four months later from another, and four months after that from the third  bureau. That approach won’t give you a complete  picture at any one time. Not all creditors provide information to all the  bureaus. Monitoring services from the credit bureaus cost from about $40 to  over $100 per year.        How to Review Your Credit Reports        To check your  reports for errors or possible signs of identity theft, look especially at  three areas.                 Look in the Personal Information or Personal Data section. Look for addresses where youe never lived. Make sure your name and any variations of it, your Social Security number, and your employers are correct        Look in the Accounts sections. Look for any accounts you didn open. Look for balances on your legitimate accounts that are higher than you expect.     Look for Inquiries or Requests for Your Credit History that you didn make. There are two types of inquiries. egularor ardinquiries are the ones that result when you apply for credit or when an account is transferred to a collection agency. This is the kind of inquiry you should check as possible identity theft or error. The other type, romotionalor oftinquiries, would not be an indication of problems. This type includes pre-approved credit offers, checks for employment purposes, account monitoring by your existing creditors, and your own requests for your report.     You can view sample credit reports, with the  different sections explained, on the Web sites of the three credit bureaus:   www.experian.com ,  www.transunion.com ,  www.equifax.com .            How to Correct Errors in Your Credit Report          If you see anything you believe is incorrect,  contact the credit bureau immediately. You can call the telephone number on the  report to speak with someone at the credit bureau. If you find evidence of  identity theft, the next steps to take include contacting any creditors  involved to close fraudulent accounts and filing a police report. See  Consumer Information Sheet 3:  Identity Theft Victim Checklist , on our Identity Theft Web page for more  information on what to do.           Specialty Consumer Reporting Agencies            Specialty consumer reporting agencies prepare reports on consumershistories for specific purposes. The reports cover employment, insurance claims, residential rentals, check writing, and medical records. Think about ordering a specialty report if you are ready to buy homeowners or automobile insurance, open a checking account, apply for private health or life insurance, or rent a home or apartment.                         Property Insurance Claim  Reports : Insurance companies often check reports of this kind when you apply for homeowners or automobile insurance. One of these reports is the CLUE report (Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange). 2  CLUE reports contain information on property loss claims against homeowner insurance and automobile insurance policies. A CLUE report contains personal information, such as your name, birth date, and Social Security number. It also contains a record of any auto or homeowner property loss claims you submitted to an insurance company. It includes the type of loss, date of the loss, and amount paid by the insurance company. It lists inquiries, or companies that have checked your claim history.             Another property loss report is called A-PLUS (Automated Property Loss Underwriting System). The A-PLUS database is compiled by a smaller company and is less commonly used than the CLUE database. You may order a CLUE report and an A-PLUS for free once every 12 months.   Tenant History Reports:  Landlords  sometimes check your tenant history as well as your credit history. You may  order a free copy of your tenant history report once every 12 months.     Employment  History Reports:  Employers  sometimes check your employment history when you apply for a job. Your current  employer may also check your history. You must give your consent for a current  or prospective employer to check your history. State and federal law entitle  you to a free copy of your report if any employer requests your permission for  a background check.   You can also get one free copy every 12 months.  Consider ordering an Employment History Report if you’ve been frequently turned  down when applying for jobs.   Medical Insurance Reports:  Insurance companies often check with the Medical  Information Bureau (MIB) when you apply for health or life insurance as an  individual (not as part of a group plan). Insurance companies give the MIB  information on their customers’ medical conditions that the companies consider  significant. A report from the MIB contains codes for specific medical  conditions and lifestyle choices.   Examples include conditions like asthma and diabetes and activities such  as smoking or high-risk sports like skydiving.   A report from the MIB includes the nature of any  information MIB has on you, the names of companies that reported information on  you to the MIB, and the names of the companies that received a copy of your MIB  record in the previous 12 months.    You  may not be in the MIB database.  If you  did not apply for individual health or life insurance, the MIB will probably  have no records on you. You may order a report from the MIB for free once every  12 months.                      How to Order Your Free Annual Reports from Specialty Consumer Reporting Agencies          All of these reports are ordered through automated  telephone systems. The system will ask you for personal information, including  your Social Security number, to identify your file. In some cases, you will be  sent an order form to fill out and mail in.

Pittsburgh Mortgage & Allegheny County Refinance           Home                                                       Getting Your Credit Reports                                     When refinancing your current mortgage or applying for a new mortgage, getting your credit report is easy. The cost of obtaining a tri-merge credit report is about thirty five dollars.         A tri-merge credit report is a combination of reports from all three credit bureaus. When applying for a mortgage, a single credit report is not sufficient, a tri-merge credit report is required. Mortgage lenders evaluate the three credit scores and use the score which ranks in the middle as your final credit score.           Each time your credit is checked a record is added to your credit report. If there are too many checks on your credit in a short period of time your score may be negatively impacted. At a minimum, the credit checks will be displayed to all subsequent creditors, who may be more cautious if they see too many credit checks.       Credit scores range from about 350 to 850. A score of 700 is considered ""Perfect""; 620 and up is acceptable for Conventional Financing.  If your score is less than 620 you will generally be offered a non-conforming loan which is a riskier loan and therefore has a higher interest rate and higher fees.

What Is a 403(b) Plan?          A 403(b) plan is a type of tax-deferred retirement savings program that       is available to employees of public schools, employees of certain       non-profit entities, and some members of the clergy.  Because you do       not have to pay taxes on the amount you contribute to a 403(b) plan for       the year in which you contributed to the plan, investing in a 403(b) plan       can lower your overall tax burden — at least in the present.  You can       defer the income tax on your contributions until you begin making       withdrawals from your account — typically after you retire.  The       earnings on your account also grow tax-free until withdrawal.          Investment Options          If you are eligible to participate in a 403(b) plan, you may have to       choose among different types of investments, depending on how your       employer structures the plan. It will be up to you to choose investments       that will best meet your financial objectives. 403(b) plans typically       offer fixed annuities, variable annuities, and mutual funds. Here is a       brief description of each:                                            Fixed             Annuities  are contracts with insurance companies that guarantee             that you will earn a minimum rate of interest during the time that             your account is growing. The insurance company also guarantees that             the periodic payments will be a guaranteed amount per dollar in your             account. These periodic payments may last for a definite period,             such as 20 years, or an indefinite period, such as your lifetime or             the lifetime of you and your spouse.                                                Equity             Indexed Annuities  are a special type of contract between you and             an insurance company. During the accumulation period — when you make             either a lump sum payment or a series of payments — the insurance             company credits you with a return that is based on changes in an             equity index, such as the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index.             The insurance company typically guarantees a minimum return.             Guaranteed minimum return rates vary. After the accumulation period,             the insurance company will make periodic payments to you under the             terms of your contract, unless you choose to receive your contract             value in a lump sum. For more information, please see our ""Fast             Answer"" on  Equity             Indexed Annuities , and read NASD's investor alert entitled  Equity-Indexed             Annuitiies — A Complex Choice .                                                Variable Annuities  are contracts with             insurance companies under which you make a lump-sum payment or             series of payments into a tax deferred account. In return, the             insurer agrees to make periodic payments to you beginning             immediately or at some future date. You can choose to invest your             purchase payments in a range of investment options, which are             typically mutual funds. The value of your account in a variable             annuity will vary, depending on the performance of the investment             options you have chosen.              Tip :             Make sure that the features you're buying when you invest in a             variable annuity are worth the money you're paying. If you invest in             a variable annuity through a tax-advantaged retirement plan (such as             a 403(b) plan), be aware that you receive  no additional tax             advantage  from the variable annuity. Investors typically pay for             each benefit provided by any given product. Be sure you understand             the impact of these costs and all others fees and expenses.                                                                            Mutual             Funds  are companies that pool money from many investors and             invest the money in stocks, bonds, short-term money-market             instruments, or other securities. Mutual funds come in many             varieties. For example, there are  index             funds ,  stock funds ,  bond             funds ,  money market funds , and             more. Each of these may have a different investment objective and             strategy and a different investment portfolio. Different mutual             funds may also be subject to different risks, volatility, and  fees             and expenses .                        What Questions Should I Ask About My Investment Choices?         The best tip we can give on how to invest wisely boils down to two       words: ask questions. Over the years, we've seen far too many investors       who suffered avoidable losses because they didn't ask basic questions from       the start. When it comes to planning your financial future, take nothing       for granted — ask questions, demand answers, and make sure you understand       the consequences of your choices before you commit your hard-earned money.         Although you may be eligible to participate in a 403(b) plan, don't       assume that your employer has checked out or approved any particular       investment product or any firm or professional that sells potential 403(b)       investments. School districts typically do not engage in that sort of       screening, and some states prevents school districts from limiting the       companies that can sell 403(b) plan investments. That's why it's so       important to do some homework on your own to assure yourself that the       choices you make as the best for you in light of your personal       circumstances and financial objectives.         For starters, be sure to ask at least the following three key       questions:                   Will I have to pay any penalties if I change my investment           choices? If so, how much?                           Make sure you know the answer to this critically important question         before you make your investment choices. The answer will depending on         the type of product you initially chose and when you purchased that         product in your account. For example, if you withdraw money from a         variable annuity within a certain period after a purchase payment         (typically within six to eight years, but sometimes as long as ten         years), the insurance company usually will assess a  ""surrender""         charge . A surrender charge is a type of sales charge that         compensates the financial professional who sold the variable annuity to         you. Generally, the surrender charge is a percentage of the amount you         sell or exchange, and it will decline gradually over a period of several         years, known as the ""surrender period."" For example, a 7%         charge might apply in the first year after a purchase payment, 6% in the         second year, 5% in the third year, and so on until the eighth year, when         the surrender charge no longer applies. Some variable annuity contracts         will allow you to withdraw part of your account value each year — 10% or         15% of your account value, for example — without paying a surrender         charge.            Some mutual funds have a back-end sales load known as a  ""contingent         deferred sales load""  (also referred to as a ""CDSC"" or         ""CDSL""). Like a surrender charge for a variable annuity, the         amount of this type of load will depend on how long the investor holds         his or her shares, and it typically decreases to zero if the investor         hold his or her shares long enough. The rate at which this fee will         decline is disclosed in the fund's  prospectus .            A  redemption fee  is another type of fee that some funds charge         their shareholders when the shareholders redeem their shares. Although a         redemption fee is deducted from redemption proceeds just like a deferred         sales load, it is not considered to be a sales load. Unlike a sales         load, a redemption fee is typically used to defray fund costs associated         with a shareholder's redemption and is paid directly to the fund, not to         a broker. The SEC generally limits redemption fees to 2%.           Note:         The question of whether you must pay a penalty or other fees for         switching among investment choices in your plan is completely different         from whether you must pay a penalty for taking money out of your 403(b).         The tax laws generally impose penalties for early withdrawals from         tax-deferred retirement plans, such as 403(b) plans, IRAs, and 401(k)s.         Before you take money out of your 403(b) account, be sure to consult         with a tax adviser.                           What annual fees will I pay?                           As you might expect, fees and expenses vary from product to product —         and they can take a huge bite out of your returns. An investment with         high costs must perform better than a low-cost investment in order to         generate the same returns for you. Even small differences in fees can         translate into large differences in returns over time.            For example, if you invested $10,000 in a product that produced a 10%         annual return before expenses and had annual operating expenses of 1.5%,         then after 20 years you would have roughly $49,725. But if the         investment had expenses of only 0.5%, then you would end up with         $60,858 —  an 18% difference . It takes only minutes to use the  SEC's         Mutual Fund Cost Calculator  to compute how the costs of different         mutual funds add up over time and eat into your returns.            For mutual funds and variable annuities, you can find information on         costs and fees in the prospectuses. For fixed annuities, check the sales         literature or the contract.                           Does my financial professional make more money for selling one           product over another?                           Regardless of how much you trust your financial professional, it is         always legitimate to ask how - and how much - he or she receives for         selling a particular product. For example, you could ask the following:                                                      Do you receive a commission for selling               Product X to me? If so, how much?                                                        Do you get any other type of               compensation for selling Product X? If so, what? (This could               include a bonus or points toward some other reward, such as a trip               or a cruise.)                                                        Do you get more for selling Product X               over Product Y?                                                        Are there any other products that can               meet my financial objectives at a lower cost to me (even               if you do not sell those products)?                                 It will be critical for you to know in advance which products can         best meet your financial objectives and to identify a financial         professional who sells those products. Different         types of financial professionals sell different types of products, and         some financial professionals will offer only a limited number of         choices. When deciding what's best for you, shop around for the best         fit. When brokers or insurance salespersons stand to earn more         money for selling Product X over Product Y, they have a natural         incentive to steer you toward Product X — even if Product Y might         ultimately be a better choice for you.

Background of the Roth 403b   Starting in January 2006, operators of traditional 403b plans can offer their employees what's being called a Roth 403b plan.  In essence, offering ""Roth"" treatment of funds going into a 403b account.           Additional Resources         403b    403b Contribution Rules     403b Distributions and Transfers     403b Rollover     403b Loans    Final 403b Regulations     Roth 403b Plans     Roth IRA versus 403b Plan   A Roth 403b combines the contribution features of  403b plans  with the tax-free growth advantage of  Roth IRAs .  Employees currently offered the ability to fund their retirement plans via 403b plans may now be offered the option of participating in a Roth 403b.  With this new plan, you'll never have to pay  federal income taxes  on the growth portion of your account, or your contributions, when you withdraw the money.   Roth 403b Fund Requirements   There are very few requirements of these new Roth 403b plans.  Employers have the opportunity to consolidate a variety of retirement funds into what are called Employer Retirement Savings Accounts, or ERSAs.  These ERSAs will be available to all employers that meet some pretty simple qualifications.   As previously mentioned, the proposal becomes effective for the years beginning after December 31, 2005.  In most situations, that translated into January 1, 2006.  Retirement money placed into a Roth 403b has to be kept in an account that is separate from other funding.  That's about it as far as employers are concerned.   Benefits of Roth 403b Plans   Many employees already participating in a 403b plan at work will be offered the opportunity to participate in Roth 403b.  For those people, the question they are going to be asking themselves is simply this:  ""Should I fund a Roth 403b or stick with my existing 403b plan?""   The answer to that question has to do with each plan's income tax treatment of contributions and withdrawals and what they believe their  income tax bracket  will be in retirement.  By making before before-tax contributions to your traditional 403b plan, you're reducing your current tax liability.  With Roth 403b contributions, you'll be making after-tax contributions:     While before-tax contributions act to reduce your taxable income today, you're going to pay income taxes on the contributions and earnings when they're distributed to you at retirement.    Roth 403b contributions won't reduce your taxable income right now.  But these contributions, and the earnings on them, are tax-free at retirement - as long as you're at least age 591/2 and your Roth 403b account is at least five years old.   So if you believe you're in a higher tax bracket today than you will be in retirement, then sticking with a 403b plan might be your best move.  If you think your tax bracket will stay the same or increase in your retirement years, then a Roth 403b is probably your best move.   Roth Treatment of 403b Contributions   The key here is that plan administrators can elect to make available to their employees Roth treatment of contributions to retirement savings plans such as a 403b plan.  The intention of the proposed change would be to help consolidate all of the retirement accounts that permit employees to make after-tax contributions to a retirement savings account.   Roth 403b Contribution Limits   ESRAs need to follow the rules previously outlined for 401k plans with additional simplifications - we've already talked about  401k contribution rules  in a previous article.  Employees can defer or contribute up to $15,500 in wages annually in 2008, and $16,500 in 2009.  And like other retirement plans, there is an additional catch-up contribution of $5,000 for employees 50 and older in 2008, and $5,500 in 2009.  The maximum total contribution limit - which also includes employer contributions - is the lesser of $46,000 or 100% of the employee's compensation in 2008.  The maximum total contribution limit in the year 2009 is $49,000.   For information on the contribution limits for the years 2010 and beyond, take a look at our article on  403b Contribution Rules .   Roth 403b Withdrawals and Distributions   Like its predecessors, the Roth 403b was established as a retirement plan.  That means the IRS looks down on early withdrawals that occur before age 59 1/2.  Hardship or other types of withdrawals are subject to the same 403b rules and penalties that are currently on the books.  And the Roth 403b  minimum distribution rules  are also similar to 403b withdrawals plans - meaning you need to start to take mandatory distributions when you reach age 70 1/2.   Taxes on Roth 403b Distributions and Contributions   The tax liabilities associated with employee contributions and distributions from an ERSA would be the same as the plans that the ESRA is replacing.  That means the employee could fund an ERSA with pre-tax monies, after-tax contributions, or Roth contributions.  The exact type of contribution will depend on the plan's design.   Distributions of Roth 403b (after-tax) contributions, and the earnings of those same contributions, would not be included in income for tax purposes.  Other distributions - such as those made on a before-tax basis - would be included as taxable income. So the rules are similar to those of existing plans, but the introduction of the ""Roth"" concept and its benefits add to the plan's overall attractiveness as a retirement fund.   Roth 403b Income Tax Rules   The income tax rules for a Roth 403b are fairly easy to remember if you think of the plan using these two rules of thumb:     This type of plan allows you to put money into your account on an after-tax basis - just like a Roth IRA.  And just like a Roth IRA, the distributions from a Roth 403b are free from federal income taxes.    If your employer contributes to your Roth 403b - such as the case when employers match funds - then those contributions have gone into an account on a before-tax basis (you never paid income taxes on your employer's contributions.)  Therefore the portion of your Roth 403b funding that comes from employer contributions is subject to federal income taxes upon withdrawal.   In most cases, an employer's matching contributions to Roth 403b will be placed in a traditional 403b account.

There are only two sources of money that can be directed to your 403b account - through a salary reduction agreement, or by an employer making contributions directly to the fund itself.  Even though you might be able to establish the contribution rules for your particular 403b plan, only your employer can make the actual contributions to your 403b account - you cannot make direct deposits into this kind of retirement plan.   Contributions to 403b Accounts           Additional Resources         403b    403b Contribution Rules     403b Distributions and Transfers     403b Rollover     403b Loans    Final 403b Regulations     Roth 403b Plans     Roth IRA versus 403b Plan   This last point is subtle, but it's also an important one. Unlike a  Roth IRA  plan, you cannot wake up one day and decide to contribute $3,000 to your 403b.  The money has to come out of your paycheck each week, and your employer is one that establishes your account based on your instructions.   That being said, there are three distinct ways to contribute to a  403b plan  plus you can use any combination of the below methods:   Elective Deferrals   Elective deferrals are contributions you make under a salary-reduction agreement.  This agreement allows your employer to withhold money from your paycheck to be contributed to your 403b account.  Elective deferrals are not taxed until withdrawn from the account.   Non-Elective Contributions   Non-elective contributions are employer contributions and do not require a salary-reduction agreement.  These can include matching contributions, discretionary contributions, and even mandatory contributions to the employee's account as part of the overall contribution rules or policies established by the plan.  As was the case with elective deferrals, non-elective contributions are not taxable until withdrawn.   After-Tax Contributions   The final way that contributions can be made to a 403b account is via after-tax contributions.  If your plan allows this type of contribution, these are salary payments taken from your paycheck on an after-tax basis.  You cannot deduct this type of contribution from your  federal income taxes , however upon withdrawal the taxed portion of the contribution will not be taxed again (but any appreciation, or growth, of this contribution over time will be taxed).   Annual Contributions to 403b Accounts   There are limits to the contributions you can make to your 403b account each year.  If you contribute too much to your account, then certain tax penalties may apply.  Normally, your program administrator will prevent you from over-funding your account automatically, thereby shielding you from any penalty.   Maximum Allowable Contributions or MAC   In general, you need to take into consideration two components of your maximum allowable contribution, or MAC, to understand what contribution limits may apply in a given year.  Those two components include your limit on annual additions (those you and others make to your account) and your limits on elective deferrals (contributions from your paycheck).   The limit that applies to your individual situation depends on the types of contributions made to you account each year.  In general, the contribution limit to your 403b will be the lesser of your limit on annual additions, or your limit on elective deferrals.   Only Elective Deferrals   If the only contributions made to your 403b were elective deferrals, then you will need to calculate both of the limits mentioned above.  You MAC will be the lower of the two limits calculated.   Only Non-Elective Contributions   If the only contributions made to your 403b account were non-elective contributions (employer contributions to your account), then your MAC will be determined by calculating your limit on annual additions.   Elective and Non-Elective Contributions   If contributions to your 403b account include both elective and non-elective contributions, then you will need to calculate both limits, however, your MAC is the limit on annual additions.   Calculating Your MAC   You should calculate your MAC each year based on your actual compensation.  It is advisable to use a conservative estimate of your compensation when calculating your MAC.  If your compensation should change during the calendar year, you can recalculate your new MAC based on this better information.   Annual Additions   The first component of the MAC calculation is your limit on annual additions.  This is the limits on all contributions to you 403b account and includes:     Elective deferrals    Non-elective contributions    After tax contributions   The limit in 2007 for annual additions was the smaller of $45,000 or 100% of your includable compensation.  In 2008, the limit for annual additions moved to $46,000 or 100% of your includable compensation.  In 2009, the limit was increased to $49,000.  In 2010, this limit will be indexed for inflation and can move up in $1,000 increments.   Elective Deferrals    The limit on elective deferrals to your 403b was $15,500 in 2007.  In 2008, this contribution limit remained at $15,500.  In 2009, the limit was increased to $16,500.  In 2010, the limit can move up in $500 increments based on a measure of inflation.   There is, however, one exception to this guideline that is known as the 15-Year Rule.     15-Year Rule   If you have at least 15 years of service, then the limit on your elective deferrals, or contributions, to your 403b is increased by the lower of:     $3,000    $15,500 - reduced by the increases to the limit you were allowed in earlier years because of the 15-year rule.    $5,000 times the number of years of service you have with the organization minus the total elective deferrals made by your employer in earlier years   If you happen to qualify for the 15-year rule, then your elective deferrals under this limit can be as high as $18,500 in 2007 and 2008 - and again, that number should move higher in 2009.    Catch-Up Contributions   Finally, if you reach the age of 50 or older by the end of any calendar year, you may be eligible to make additional catch-up contributions to your 403b account.  You cannot make catch up contributions with after-tax contributions and the maximum catch up contribution you can make in 2007 and 2008 is $5,000, or your includable compensation minus your other elective deferrals for the year.  In 2009, the limit increased to $5,500.   In 2010, the rule for catch-up contributions is similar to the ones mentioned earlier.  Catch-up contributions will be indexed to inflation and can move up in $500 increments.  Keep in mind that catch-up contributions are not used when calculating your MAC.  This means the maximum you are allowed to contribute to your 403b account is your catch-up contribution plus your MAC.

According to the State of California Franchise Tax Board, over six million California residents are eligible to e-file their 2007 state income tax returns for free.   Who Qualifies for Free State Tax Return Filing through CalFile   There are some exceptions, but generally speaking, anyone who lived in California the entire year, is filing an original return (i.e. not amended), and whose only other reportable tax is Use Tax, may qualify to use CalFile. The state has set qualification criteria, which is listed on the Franchise Tax Board website. In general, those eligible for CalFile must claim five or fewer dependents and have federal adjusted gross income (AGI) below $155,416 per individual filer. (This limit is $233,129 for head of household and $310,837 for married/registered domestic partnership, filing jointly and qualifying widowers). Additionally, there is qualification criteria related to sources of income, federal AGI adjustments, state adjustments to income, itemized deductions, tax payments, exemptions, and credits.   California taxpayers may use CalFile whether they do not owe taxes, owe a payment, or are due a refund.   Who Cannot Use CalFile   The FTB website lists several exceptions that prohibit an individual from using the free filing program. Among taxpayers who may not qualify are those with unique situations such as Roth IRA conversions, individuals claiming a disaster loss or military-related extension, and those who need to make certain state adjustments to federal itemized deductions. Also, taxpayers must use original, not substituted or corrected W-2s. A complete list of exceptions is available on the Franchise Tax Board’s website.   Tips for Using CalFile   Thoroughly review the qualification criteria and exceptions . There are many exceptions to qualification; fortunately, there are other free state filing programs available to those who do not qualify to use CalFile. Know what last name was used on the most recently filed return.  The CalFile system looks up taxpayer information by searching for a last name as it appeared on a 2006 tax return. A taxpayer whose name changed since filing a 2006 tax return must access the system using their old name, then update their last name within CalFile upon log in. Those who have never filed a California tax return must call the Taxpayer Services Center. Set aside enough time to complete the return in one sitting.  The CalFile program allows a maximum of twenty minutes per webpage, so individuals may not be able to walk away and finish later. Fortunately, the California Franchise Tax Board claims that individuals with straightforward returns should be able to complete their returns in approximately 15 minutes, assuming they have all tax information on hand. Taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes under certain thresholds may qualify for  free federal tax return e-filing  as well.   Furthermore, anyone who doesn’t qualify for free state tax return filing through CalFile may have luck finding  free state return  filing through an IRS Free File provider.

We provide indexed annuities rates and quotes from over 30 different insurance companies.   Indexed annuities are unlike any product in the marketplace. By legal definition they are a fixed annuity product, but with greater potential returns than those provided with guaranteed rate annuities. Indexed annuities allow you to benefit from potential gains when the stock market is up, but also prevent you from being penalized when it down. Unlike a variable   annuity  or mutual fund, the risk of losing your money due to a market decline does not exist with indexed annuities. So even if the stock market were to go down in value, your annuity contract value can never decline. In addition, like all fixed annuities, youe protected by a lifetime guaranteed minimum interest rate.    If you would like to research and compare actual indexed annuities product offerings from a number of top-rated insurance companies, please visit our  Indexed Annuities Data  page.   As stated above, Indexed Annuities offer the potential of higher returns without exposing principal to market risk. In exchange for this guarantee of no downside risk, Indexed Annuities policyholders must generally be willing to give up some of their upside market potential. This is what makes these newer annuity products so attractive to retired persons and to those approaching retirement. In exchange for having their retirement assets fully protected from loss (and in fact, a gain is guaranteed) an indexed   annuities  owner shares in market gains without realizing 100% of the gain. For most individual investors who have recently been stung by market volatility, this constitutes a prudent and desirable trade-off.    All of this is usually accomplished by linking (indexing) the credited rate to an equity index, such as the S&P 500 Composite Stock Index. To repeat: although the credited rate is linked to stock market performance, safety of principal is assured. A decline in the stock-market will NOT reduce the asset value of indexed annuities.

The government’s goal is to make sure that consumers stay informed, fight identity theft, and get fair treatment.   Credit reports are important because they are the raw data that go into your credit score.    How Credit Scores Work   How to Get Free Credit Scores      In the past, not everybody was entitled to a free credit report.  Instead, consumers had to pay or qualify based on certain activity within the credit report.  Some states required that residents periodically be entitled to a free credit report, but it is now nationwide.     How do I Get my Free Credit Report?    The nation’s credit reporting agencies have teamed up and built a website that you should use to get your free credit report.  The site is  www.annualcreditreport.com .  You can also call them at 877-322-8228 and request your free credit report.       Contacting the Credit Agencies Directly    You can also call the major credit agencies directly and ask about a free credit report.  However, the FCRA-mandated “Annual Free Credit Reports” are only available through the website and phone number above.

clueweb09-en0006-91-36070	                                            EIA Book  |  Book  |  Equity-Indexed   Annuities                   U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC )   Equity-Indexed Annuities     Are you considering buying an equity-indexed annuity? This brochure explains   equity-indexed annuities and provides resources for obtaining additional information.     What Is An Equity-Indexed Annuity?     An equity-indexed annuity is a special type of contract between you and an   insurance company. During the accumulation period – when you make   either a lump sum payment or a series of payments  – the insurance company   credits you with a return that is based on changes in an equity index, such   as the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index. The insurance company   typically guarantees a minimum return. Guaranteed minimum return rates vary.   After the accumulation period, the insurance company will make periodic payments   to you under the terms of your contract, unless you choose to receive your   contract value in a lump sum.     Can You Lose money Buying An Equity-Indexed Annuity?     You can lose money buying an equity-indexed annuity, especially if you need   to cancel your annuity early. Even with a guarantee, you can still lose money   if your guarantee is based on an amount that’s less than the full amount   of your purchase payments. In many cases, it will take several years for an   equity-index annuity’s minimum guarantee to “break even.”     You also may have to pay a significant surrender charge and tax penalties if   you cancel early. In addition, in some cases, insurance companies may not credit   you with index-linked interest if you do not hold your contract to maturity.     What Are Some Of The Contract Features Of Equity-Indexed Annuities?     Equity-indexed annuities are complicated products that may contain several   features that can affect your return. You should fully understand how an equity-indexed   annuity computes its index-linked interest rate before you buy. An insurance   company may credit you with a lower return than the actual index’s gain.   Some common features used to compute an equity-indexed annuity’s interest   rate include:             Participation Rates.  The participation rate determines how       much of the index’s increase will be used to compute the index-linked       interest rate. For example, if the participation rate is 80% and the index       increases 9%, the return credited to your annuity would be 7.2% (9% x 80%       = 7.2%).               Interest Rate Caps .  Some equity-indexed annuities set       a maximum rate of interest that the equity-indexed annuity can earn. If a       contract has an upper limit, or cap, of 7% and the index linked to the annuity       gained 7.2%, only 7% would be credited to the annuity.               Margin/Spread/Administrative Fee.  The index-linked interest for       some annuities is determined by subtracting a percentage from any gain       in the index. This fee is sometimes called the “margin,” “spread,” or “administrative       fee.” In the case of an annuity with a  “spread” of 3%,       if the index gained 9%, the return credited to the annuity would be 6%       (9% - 3% = 6%).         Another feature that can have a dramatic impact on an equity-indexed annuity’s   return is its indexing method (or how the amount of change in the relevant   index is determined). Some common indexing methods include:             Annual Reset  (or Ratchet).  This method credits index-linked       interest based on any increase in index value from the beginning to the end       of the year.               Point-to-Point .  This method credits index-linked interest       based on any increase in index value from the beginning to the end of the       contract’s term.               High Water Mark .  This method credits index-linked interest       based on any increase in index value from the index level at the beginning       of the contract’s term to the highest index value at various points       during the contract’s term, often annual anniversaries of when you       purchased the annuity.         These and other features may be included in an equity-indexed annuity you   are considering. Before you decide to buy an equity-indexed annuity, you should   understand how each feature works and what impact, together with other features,   it may have on the annuity’s potential return.      Are Equity-Indexed Annuities Registered With The Securities And Exchange     Commission?     Equity-indexed annuities combine features of traditional insurance products   (guaranteed minimum return) and traditional securities (return linked to equity   markets). Depending on the mix of features, an equity-indexed annuity may or   may not be a security. The typical equity-indexed annuity is not registered   with the SEC.     Who Should I Contact If I Have A Problem?     If you have a problem with an equity-indexed annuity, you should contact your   state insurance commissioner. In addition, we would also like to hear from   you, although we will likely only have jurisdiction to resolve your particular   issue if your equity-indexed annuity is a security.

Washington, D.C. 20549-0213         Where Can I Find More Information?     Before you purchase an equity-indexed annuity, you should understand how it   works, what factors to consider in making your decision, and how you can avoid   common problems.  An  “investor alert” concerning equity-indexed   annuities is available on the NASD’s website.

They can charge anywhere from a few hundred dollars to thousands.  You do not need to pay a credit repair company a lot of money to repair your credit.  Anything they can do for you, you can do for yourself for free or little cost.                              You do not need a Software Program to repair your credit.  However, there is an awful lot of letter writing and record keeping involved, and an inexpensive program to help automate the process and point you in the right directions can literally save you hundreds of hours and aggravation and can keep you organized, so you never again find yourself in a credit nightmare.                                                                   YOUR CREDIT REPORT                             A credit report is the equivalent of a consumer's financial report card. It details your credit history as it has been reported to the credit reporting agency by the lenders who've given you credit. Your credit report lists the types of credit you use, the amount of time your accounts have been open, and if you pay your bills on time.              Your credit report is used by many different companies to make decisions about you. Credit card companies, Banks, mortgage companies, auto loan and insurance companies, also landlords and employers check credit reports to check on your credit history. Why? They know that if you were responsible in the past, you are likely be responsible in the future (and vice versa).                             CREDIT SCORING              ""Credit scoring"" of is a system creditors use to help determine whether to give you credit, and how much to charge you for it.  When you apply for credit, the creditor or lender will often request your report (or credit score) from one of the big three bureaus (Equifax, Experian and Trans-Union).  In some instances, however (such as when applying for a Mortgage), the broker or lender will pull reports from all three. These Bureaus grade your ""credit worthiness"" by calculating your credit history against a system called the Fair Isaac Model.  Fair Isaac uses a variety of factors to determine your score, such as; your bill-paying history, the number and type of accounts you have, late payments, collec tion actions, outstanding debt, and the age of your accounts.              The final outcome of those calculations is referred to as your FICOscore.  FICOscores range from 300 to 850, but the majority of scores fall between the 600s and 700s. Higher scores indicate a lower credit risk.  A FICOscore above 700 will get you a very good mortgage rate.  A score above 720 will get you an excellent rate.  A score below 700 will make it very difficult for you, and definitely should be worked on.              Correcting mistakes on a credit report in order to repair an undesirable credit score takes time. It's your responsibility to correct mistakes that may appear in your credit report. To do this, you must regularly obtain copies of your credit reports, and contact each of the big three credit reporting bureaus to correct any misinformation.                                            HOW TO GET COPIES OF YOUR CREDIT REPORTS              The three nationwide consumer reporting companies Equifax, Experian and Trans-union are the three major bureaus that maintain credit reports on you.  To order your reports, you simply write or call them at the numbers below.               You are also eligible for Free Credit Reports once a year.                         Requests for free Annual Reports are not made to the bureaus themselves, they are made to their Combined Service.  You can order your free reports online instantly thru  Credit Doctor Software , or complete an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mail it to: Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281.  With the new laws, you are now entitled to one free copy from each of the nationwide consumer reporting companies every 12 months.              You need to provide your name, address, Social Security number, and date of birth. If you have moved in the last two years, you may have to provide your previous address. To maintain the security of your file, each nationwide consumer reporting company may ask you for some information that only you would know, like the amount of your monthly mortgage payment. Each company may ask you for different information because the information each has in your file may come from different sources.              There are also other circumstances which will allow you to receive free credit history reports.  Under federal law, you're entitled to a free report if a company takes adverse action against you, such as denying your application for credit, insurance, or employment, and you ask for your report within 60 days of receiving notice of the action. The notice will give you the name, address, and phone number of the consumer reporting company. You're also entitled to one free report per year if you're unemployed and plan to look for a job within 60 days; if you're on welfare; or if your report is inaccurate because of fraud or identity theft. Otherwise, any of the three consumer reporting companies may charge you up to $10.00 for another copy of your report within a 12-month period.              To buy copies of your credit history report, contact:              Equifax            800-685-1111                        Experian            888-EXPERIAN (397-3742)                        Trans Union            800-916-8800              Under state law, consumers in Colorado, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Vermont already have free access to their credit reports.                                            REVIEWING YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                Recent studies by a Public Interest Research Group found that over 70% of credit reports contain errors. Incorrect information in your credit file lowers your credit score. As the result you get a higher interest rate when you: take a loan, open a new credit card account, lease a car, etc.  29% of the credit reports in this study contained even more serious errors that could result in the denial of credit. These errors included false delinquencies, public records, judgments and credit accounts that did not belong to the consumer.  Sometimes these errors are the work of sloppy data entry, but it is also often due to the ever growing epidemic of identity theft.               Since your Credit Reports are used to determine IF you are to be given credit (and what rates you will be charged), it is in your best interest to examine your reports carefully, correct inaccurate information and make every effort to remove ALL Unfavorable information.  If you see problems on your report, such as an unpaid bill that you simply forgot about, act right away to resolve the debt. Then ask that creditor to send a letter to the credit reporting agencies stating that the matter has been resolved.               Check for accounts you didn't open, charges you haven't made, and delinquencies you didn't cause. If you suspect fraud on one of your reports, contact that credit bureau IMMEDIATELY. Explain the situation and ask them to place a fraud alert on your file. Also report the fraud to the police.              Your credit reports follow you throughout your life and can help you greatly -- or hurt you. Review them carefully!                               HOW TO READ YOUR CREDIT REPORTS              The bulk of the report will be filled with credit information showing the following:              1). Identification Information  The first thing listed will be your name, date of birth and Social Security number. These are used for identification. Employment information may also be listed.  As well as current and past addresses, spouse's name (if you're married) and date of birth are also listed for further identification.                2). Public Record Information -- Data from federal, state or county court records. Bankruptcies, liens or judgments and other types of claims.  Info listed will be; Date filed, court case number, amount, status and date settled.              3). Collection Agency Information --  A collection is an account that has been turned over to a collection agency by one of your creditors because you have not paid the account as agreed.  Listed here are; Collector's name, originating creditor/client, original amount, balance due and account number.              4). Credit Information  -- This section makes up the bulk of the report.  It will include Mortgage, Installment, Revolving, Other, Open and Closed Accounts.  It will also list Accounts in Good Standing, Accounts Currently Past due and Negative Account History.  Merchant/Creditor name, Subscriber Number, account number, Date opened, Date closed, Current Balance, Highest credit limit, Highest amount of credit used, and your Repayment History.  Your Repayment History is shown as a string of numbers showing your payment history.              With each credit account, you will see listed the account's status and history.  They are generally marked as follows;              • Current Account - ""Account Open"" or ""Closed in Good Standing""            • Closed Account - Credit Account Closed            • Paid Account - Closed Account or Zero Balance            • Credit Account Reinstated - Previously Closed Account Now Available for use            • Foreclosure - Collateral sold to collect Defaulted Mortgage            • Collection Account - Credit Account Assigned to Collection Agency            • Inquiry - your credit information was requested by this Company or Creditor               5). Inquiries that display              All authorized and legitimate requests to see your credit history.               6). Inquiries that DO NOT display              These inquiries are displayed only to you and are not considered when tabulating  your credit score. Examples of this inquiry type include a pre-approved offer of credit, insurance or periodic account reviews by an existing creditor.              7). Consumer Statements              If for some reason you cannot prove that a negative item is an error or if you are having a disagreement with a certain creditor, you have the right to tell your side of the story in 100 words or less. This statement will be ADDED to your report.                                            SUMMARY OF WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN YOUR CREDIT HISTORY REPORT              Credit Reports seem rather cryptic at first, but once you see how they are laid out they will start to make sense. These are the important things to examine:                            Make sure your personal Information is correct                              Make sure your accounts are listed correctly                              Make sure your credit lines are listed correctly                              Make sure your balances are listed correctly                              If YOU closed an account, it should say ""Account closed BY CONSUMER.""                                            STATING YOUR DISPUTE              Make certain that all information is current and accurate, including the Personal Identification information (address, social security, etc…). If you find an error (for example, a loan that you have PAID OFF is still listed as outstanding), tell the Credit Bureau (in writing) EXACTLY what the mistake is, and explain the way that the information SHOULD be listed. For example, ""My Loan to Bank of Fred is NOT outstanding. It was paid in full on 02/14//05.""  Send photocopies along with all the necessary information to backup your claim.                      After you have done this send it to the credit bureau by ""CERTIFIED MAIL."" When the credit bureau receives your report and the information in question, they are required to investigate and ADVISE YOU of the results of their investigation. They must do this Free of charge.              Anytime that you are denied credit you have the right to know why.  If you are turned down for a credit account at a store, you will receive a statement from the store stating that you were denied credit and their reason why. If the store based their decision on your credit history, they must provide you with the name and address of the agency that reported it.              If for some reason you cannot prove that a negative item is an error or if you are having a disagreement with a certain creditor, you have the right to tell your side of the story in 100 words or less. This statement will be ADDED to your report.              When correcting items on your credit report, you have the right to demand that the credit bureau send corrected copies of your report to all creditors who have received the incorrect reports for the past six months. Note: Credit bureaus will not do this automatically! They will only do it if you ask.  So make sure you ask.  It's your right!

Enclose a copy of the credit report containing the items you are disputing.  It may also help to circle the items.  Also include copies (not originals) of any paperwork you may have that validates your claims.                                          DEALING WITH NEGATIVE INFORMATION ON YOUR REPORTS (AND COLLECTION AGENCIES)              Despite popular belief, it is often possible to negotiate removal of negative items on your credit reports posted by creditors.  In some cases, you might not even have to pay them the full amount owed*. The important thing is to be positive, be patient and get in contact with them to try to work out a deal.              If you've ignored (or never received) a creditor's bills or phone calls, or if you failed to keep up with payments, your bill may be turned over to a collection agency.  Keep in mind that collection agencies are hired by the creditor and their only goal is to collect the money owed (or as much of it as they can) as quickly as possible.  For their efforts, they are paid a percentage of what they collect.               If you feel that the amount in question is being billed in error, you have the right to ask for proof and verification of the charges.  If the charges are indeed yours it may be in your best interest to negotiate with the collection agency.  You may be able to negotiate payment of the total sum (or even a partial amount) in return for their removing their negative marks on your Credit History Report.  You might be able to settle on paying a portion of your debt, or you might be able to work out a payment installment plan with them.  Many of the Creditor letters in the STOREROOM  can be used with collection agencies for these situations.  Whatever deal you make with them, be sure that you have it all in writing prior to paying them.              Collection agencies can be very aggressive when it comes to collecting money.  Remember that you have rights.  You have the right to ask a collection agency stop contacting you, especially if you feel harassed. Use these letters below to give yourself breathing room while working through your plan to reorganize your finances.              *See the letters in the Storeroom section.                               SEVEN STEPS TO BOOST YOUR FICO SCORE                                           Correct all inaccuracies on your Credit Report.                             Go through your credit reports very carefully.  Especially look for; Late payments, charge-offs, collections or other negative items that aren't yours, Accounts listed as ""settled,"" ""paid derogatory,"" ""paid charge-off"" or anything other than ""current"" or ""paid as agreed"" if you paid on time and in full, Accounts that are still listed as unpaid that were included in a bankruptcy, Negative items older than seven years (10 in the case of bankruptcy) that should have automatically fallen off your report (you must be careful with this last one, because sometimes scores actually go down when bad items fall off your report. It's a quirk in the FICO credit-scoring software, and the potential effect of eliminating old negative items is difficult to predict in advance).  Also make sure you don't have duplicate collection notices listed.  For example; if you have an account that has gone to collections, the original creditor may list the debt, as well as the collection agency.  Any duplicates must be removed!                              Make sure that your proper credit lines are posted on your Credit Reports.                             Often, in an effort to make you less desirable to their competitors, some creditors will not post your proper credit line.  Showing less available credit can negatively impact your credit score.  If you see this happening on your credit report, you have a right to complain and bring this to their attention.  If you have bankruptcies that should be showing a zero balance…make sure they show a zero balance! Very often the creditor will not report a ""bankruptcy charge-off"" as a zero balance until it's been disputed.                If you have any negative marks on your credit report, negotiate with the creditor/lender to remove it.                If you are a long time customer and it's something simple like a one-time late payment, a creditor will often wipe it away to keep you as a loyal customer.  If you have a serious negative mark (such as a long overdue bill that has gone to collections), always negotiate a payment in exchange for removal of the negative item.  Always make sure you have this agreement with them in writing.  Do not pay off a bill that has gone to collections unless the creditor agrees in writing that they will remove the derogatory item from your credit report.  This is important; when speaking with the creditor or collection agency about a debt that has gone to collections, do not admit that the debt is yours.  Admission of debt can restart the statute of limitations, and may enable the creditor to sue you.  You are also less likely to be able to negotiate a letter of deletion if you admit that this debt is yours.   Simply say ""I'm calling about account number ________"" instead of ""I'm calling about my past due debt.""                                  Pay all credit cards and any revolving credit down to below 30% of the available credit line.                               The scoring system wants to make sure you aren't overextended, but at the same time, they want to see that you do indeed use your credit. 30% of the available credit line seems to be the magic ""balance vs. credit line"" ratio to have.  For example; if you have a Credit Card with a $10,000 credit line, make sure that never more than $3000 (even if you pay your account off in full each month).  If your balances are higher than 30% of the available credit line, pay them down.   Here is another thing you can try; ask your long time creditors if they will raise your Credit Line without checking your FICO score or your Credit Report.  Tell them that you're shopping for a house and you can't afford to have any hits on your credit report.  Many will not but some will.                              Do not close your old credit card accounts.                              Old established accounts show your history, and tell about your stability and paying habits.  If you have old credit card accounts that you want to stop using, just cut up the cards or keep them in a drawer, but keep the accounts open.                               Avoid applying for new credit.               Each time you apply for new credit, your credit report gets checked. New credit cards will not help your credit score and a credit account less than one year old may hurt your credit score.  Use your cards and credit as little as possible until the next credit scoring.                               Have at least three revolving credit lines and one active (or paid) installment loan listed on your Credit Report.                The scoring system wants to see that you maintain a variety of credit accounts.  It also wants to see that you have 3 revolving credit lines.  If you do not have three active credit cards, you might want to open some (but keep in mind that if you do, you will need to wait some time before rescoring).  If you have poor credit and are not approved for a typical credit card, you might want to set up a ""secured credit card"" account.  This means that you will have to make a deposit that is equal or more than your limit, which guarantees the bank that you will repay the loan.  It's an excellent way to establish credit.  Examples of an installment loan would be a car loan, or it could be for furniture or a major appliance.  In addition to the above, having a mortgage listed will bring your score even higher.                          Throughout this process, always remember:              I t takes up to 30 Days for any of these things to get reported and often longer to reflect on your Credit History Reports.

A SUMMARY OF YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT              The Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) promotes the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. There are many types of consumer reporting agencies, including credit bureaus and specialty agencies (such as agencies that sell information about check writing histories, medical records, and rental history records). Here is a summary of your major rights under the FCRA. For more information, including information about additional rights, go to www.ftc.gov or write to: Consumer Response Center, Room 130-A, Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Ave. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20580.                         • You must be told if information in your file has been used against you. Anyone who uses a credit report or another type of consumer report to deny your application for credit, insurance, or employment - or to take another adverse action against you - must tell you, and must give you the name, address, and phone number of the agency that provided the information.              • You have the right to know what is in your file. You may request and obtain all the information about you in the files of a consumer reporting agency (your ""file disclosure""). You will be required to provide proper identification, which may include your Social Security number. In many cases, the disclosure will be free.              You are entitled to a free file disclosure if:                            a person has taken adverse action against you because of information in your credit report                you are the victim of identify theft and place a fraud alert in your file                your file contains inaccurate information as a result of fraud                you are on public assistance                you are unemployed but expect to apply for employment within 60 days.                          You have the right to ask for a credit score. Credit scores are numerical summaries of your credit-worthiness based on information from credit bureaus. You may request a credit score from consumer reporting agencies that create scores or distribute scores used in residential real property loans, but you will have to pay for it. In some mortgage transactions, you will receive credit score information for free from the mortgage lender.              You have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information. If you identify information in your file that is incomplete or inaccurate, and report it to the consumer reporting agency, the agency must investigate unless your dispute is frivolous. See www.ftc.gov for an explanation of dispute procedures.              Consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information. Inaccurate, incomplete or unverifiable information must be removed or corrected, usually within 30 days. However, a consumer reporting agency may continue to report information it has verified as accurate.              Consumer reporting agencies may not report outdated negative information. In most cases, a consumer reporting agency may not report negative information that is more than seven years old, or bankruptcies that are more than 10 years old.              Access to your file is limited. A consumer reporting agency may provide information about you only to people with a valid need -- usually to consider an application with a creditor, insurer, employer, landlord, or other business. The FCRA specifies those with a valid need for access.            You must give your consent for reports to be provided to employers. A consumer reporting agency may not give out information about you to your employer, or a potential employer, without your written consent given to the employer. Written consent generally is not required in the trucking industry. For more information, go to www.ftc.gov.              You may limit ""prescreened"" offers of credit and insurance you get based on information in your credit report. Unsolicited ""prescreened"" offers for credit and insurance must include a toll-free phone number you can call if you choose to remove your name and address from the lists these offers are based on. You may opt-out with the nationwide credit bureaus at 1-888-5-OPTOUT (1-888-567-8688).              You may seek damages from violators. If a consumer reporting agency, or, in some cases, a user of consumer reports or a furnisher of information to a consumer reporting agency violates the FCRA, you may be able to sue in state or federal court.              Identity theft victims and active duty military personnel have additional rights. For more information, visit www.ftc.gov.

This brochure explains equity-indexed annuities and provides resources for obtaining additional information.                What is an equity-indexed annuity?    An equity-indexed annuity is a special type of contract between you and an insurance company. During the accumulation period when you make either a lump sum payment or a series of payments the insurance company credits you with a return that is based on changes in an equity  index , such as the S&P 500 Composite Stock Price Index. The insurance company typically guarantees a minimum return. Guaranteed minimum return rates vary. After the accumulation period, the insurance company will make periodic payments to you under the terms of your contract, unless you choose to receive your contract value in a lump sum.    Can you lose money buying an equity-indexed annuity?    You can lose money buying an equity-indexed annuity, especially if you need to cancel your annuity early. Even with a guarantee, you can still lose money if your guarantee is based on an amount that less than the full amount of your purchase payments. In many cases, it will take several years for an equity-index annuity minimum guarantee to reak even.   You also may have to pay a significant surrender charge and tax penalties if you cancel early. In addition, in some cases, insurance companies may not credit you with index-linked interest if you do not hold your contract to maturity.    What are some of the contract features of equity-indexed annuities?    Equity-indexed annuities are complicated products that may contain several features that can affect your return. You should fully understand how an equity-indexed annuity computes its index-linked interest rate before you buy. An insurance company may credit you with a lower return than the actual index gain. Some common features used to compute an equity-indexed annuity interest rate include:              Participation Rates . The participation rate determines how much of the index increase will be used to compute the index-linked interest rate. For example, if the participation rate is 80% and the index increases 9%, the return credited to your annuity would be 7.2% (9% x 80% = 7.2%).         Interest Rate Caps . Some equity-indexed annuities set a maximum rate of interest that the equity-indexed annuity can earn. If a contract has an upper limit, or cap, of 7% and the index linked to the annuity gained 7.2%, only 7% would be credited to the annuity.         Margin/Spread/Administrative Fee . The index-linked interest for some annuities is determined by subtracting a percentage from any gain in the index. This fee is sometimes called the argin,pread,or dministrative fee.In the case of an annuity with a preadof 3%, if the index gained 9%, the return credited to the annuity would be 6% (9% - 3% = 6%).                    Another feature that can have a dramatic impact on an equity-indexed annuity return is its indexing method (or how the amount of change in the relevant index is determined). Some common indexing methods include:                   Annual Reset (or Ratchet) . This method credits index-linked interest based on any increase in index value from the beginning to the end of the year.         Point-to-Point . This method credits index-linked interest based on any increase in index value from the beginning to the end of the contract term.         High Water Mark . This method credits index-linked interest based on any increase in index value from the index level at the beginning of the contract term to the highest index value at various points during the contract term, often annual anniversaries of when you purchased the annuity.                       These and other features may be included in an equity-indexed annuity you are considering. Before you decide to buy an equity-indexed annuity, you should understand how each feature works and what impact, together with other features, it may have on the annuity potential return.

They can charge anywhere from a few hundred dollars to thousands.  You do not need to pay a credit repair company a lot of money to repair your credit.  Anything they can do for you, you can do for yourself for free or little cost.                              You do not need a Software Program to repair your credit.  However, there is an awful lot of letter writing and record keeping involved, and an inexpensive program to help automate the process and point you in the right directions can literally save you hundreds of hours and aggravation and can keep you organized, so you never again find yourself in a credit nightmare.                                                                   YOUR CREDIT REPORT                             A credit report is the equivalent of a consumer's financial report card. It details your credit history as it has been reported to the credit reporting agency by the lenders who've given you credit. Your credit report lists the types of credit you use, the amount of time your accounts have been open, and if you pay your bills on time.              Your credit report is used by many different companies to make decisions about you. Credit card companies, Banks, mortgage companies, auto loan and insurance companies, also landlords and employers check credit reports to check on your credit history. Why? They know that if you were responsible in the past, you are likely be responsible in the future (and vice versa).                             CREDIT SCORING              ""Credit scoring"" of is a system creditors use to help determine whether to give you credit, and how much to charge you for it.  When you apply for credit, the creditor or lender will often request your report (or credit score) from one of the big three bureaus (Equifax, Experian and Trans-Union).  In some instances, however (such as when applying for a Mortgage), the broker or lender will pull reports from all three. These Bureaus grade your ""credit worthiness"" by calculating your credit history against a system called the Fair Isaac Model.  Fair Isaac uses a variety of factors to determine your score, such as; your bill-paying history, the number and type of accounts you have, late payments, collec tion actions, outstanding debt, and the age of your accounts.              The final outcome of those calculations is referred to as your FICOscore.  FICOscores range from 300 to 850, but the majority of scores fall between the 600s and 700s. Higher scores indicate a lower credit risk.  A FICOscore above 700 will get you a very good mortgage rate.  A score above 720 will get you an excellent rate.  A score below 700 will make it very difficult for you, and definitely should be worked on.              Correcting mistakes on a credit report in order to repair an undesirable credit score takes time. It's your responsibility to correct mistakes that may appear in your credit report. To do this, you must regularly obtain copies of your credit reports, and contact each of the big three credit reporting bureaus to correct any misinformation.                                            HOW TO GET COPIES OF YOUR CREDIT REPORTS              The three nationwide consumer reporting companies Equifax, Experian and Trans-union are the three major bureaus that maintain credit reports on you.  To order your reports, you simply write or call them at the numbers below.               You are also eligible for Free Credit Reports once a year.                         Requests for free Annual Reports are not made to the bureaus themselves, they are made to their Combined Service.  You can order your free reports online instantly thru  Credit Doctor Software , or complete an Annual Credit Report Request Form and mail it to: Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281.  With the new laws, you are now entitled to one free copy from each of the nationwide consumer reporting companies every 12 months.              You need to provide your name, address, Social Security number, and date of birth. If you have moved in the last two years, you may have to provide your previous address. To maintain the security of your file, each nationwide consumer reporting company may ask you for some information that only you would know, like the amount of your monthly mortgage payment. Each company may ask you for different information because the information each has in your file may come from different sources.              There are also other circumstances which will allow you to receive free credit history reports.  Under federal law, you're entitled to a free report if a company takes adverse action against you, such as denying your application for credit, insurance, or employment, and you ask for your report within 60 days of receiving notice of the action. The notice will give you the name, address, and phone number of the consumer reporting company. You're also entitled to one free report per year if you're unemployed and plan to look for a job within 60 days; if you're on welfare; or if your report is inaccurate because of fraud or identity theft. Otherwise, any of the three consumer reporting companies may charge you up to $10.00 for another copy of your report within a 12-month period.              To buy copies of your credit history report, contact:              Equifax            800-685-1111                        Experian            888-EXPERIAN (397-3742)                        Trans Union            800-916-8800              Under state law, consumers in Colorado, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Vermont already have free access to their credit reports.             Free Credit Reports ordered from the Bureaus of the Annual Service DO NOT HAVE SCORES             For getting reports WITH scores, we recommend clicking here:                                                                                                                                                                                              REVIEWING YOUR CREDIT REPORTS                Recent studies by a Public Interest Research Group found that over 70% of credit reports contain errors. Incorrect information in your credit file lowers your credit score. As the result you get a higher interest rate when you: take a loan, open a new credit card account, lease a car, etc.  29% of the credit reports in this study contained even more serious errors that could result in the denial of credit. These errors included false delinquencies, public records, judgments and credit accounts that did not belong to the consumer.  Sometimes these errors are the work of sloppy data entry, but it is also often due to the ever growing epidemic of identity theft.               Since your Credit Reports are used to determine IF you are to be given credit (and what rates you will be charged), it is in your best interest to examine your reports carefully, correct inaccurate information and make every effort to remove ALL Unfavorable information.  If you see problems on your report, such as an unpaid bill that you simply forgot about, act right away to resolve the debt. Then ask that creditor to send a letter to the credit reporting agencies stating that the matter has been resolved.               Check for accounts you didn't open, charges you haven't made, and delinquencies you didn't cause. If you suspect fraud on one of your reports, contact that credit bureau IMMEDIATELY. Explain the situation and ask them to place a fraud alert on your file. Also report the fraud to the police.              Your credit reports follow you throughout your life and can help you greatly -- or hurt you. Review them carefully!                                            HOW TO READ YOUR CREDIT REPORTS              The bulk of the report will be filled with credit information showing the following:              1). Identification Information  The first thing listed will be your name, date of birth and Social Security number. These are used for identification. Employment information may also be listed.  As well as current and past addresses, spouse's name (if you're married) and date of birth are also listed for further identification.                2). Public Record Information -- Data from federal, state or county court records. Bankruptcies, liens or judgments and other types of claims.  Info listed will be; Date filed, court case number, amount, status and date settled.              3).

Listed here are; Collector's name, originating creditor/client, original amount, balance due and account number.              4). Credit Information  -- This section makes up the bulk of the report.  It will include Mortgage, Installment, Revolving, Other, Open and Closed Accounts.  It will also list Accounts in Good Standing, Accounts Currently Past due and Negative Account History.  Merchant/Creditor name, Subscriber Number, account number, Date opened, Date closed, Current Balance, Highest credit limit, Highest amount of credit used, and your Repayment History.

They are generally marked as follows;              • Current Account - ""Account Open"" or ""Closed in Good Standing""            • Closed Account - Credit Account Closed            • Paid Account - Closed Account or Zero Balance            • Credit Account Reinstated - Previously Closed Account Now Available for use            • Foreclosure - Collateral sold to collect Defaulted Mortgage            • Collection Account - Credit Account Assigned to Collection Agency            • Inquiry - your credit information was requested by this Company or Creditor               5). Inquiries that display              All authorized and legitimate requests to see your credit history.               6). Inquiries that DO NOT display              These inquiries are displayed only to you and are not considered when tabulating  your credit score. Examples of this inquiry type include a pre-approved offer of credit, insurance or periodic account reviews by an existing creditor.              7). Consumer Statements              If for some reason you cannot prove that a negative item is an error or if you are having a disagreement with a certain creditor, you have the right to tell your side of the story in 100 words or less. This statement will be ADDED to your report.                                                         SUMMARY OF WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN YOUR CREDIT HISTORY REPORT              Credit Reports seem rather cryptic at first, but once you see how they are laid out they will start to make sense. These are the important things to examine:                            Make sure your personal Information is correct                              Make sure your accounts are listed correctly                              Make sure your credit lines are listed correctly                              Make sure your balances are listed correctly                              If YOU closed an account, it should say ""Account closed BY CONSUMER.""                                                         STATING YOUR DISPUTE              Make certain that all information is current and accurate, including the Personal Identification information (address, social security, etc…). If you find an error (for example, a loan that you have PAID OFF is still listed as outstanding), tell the Credit Bureau (in writing) EXACTLY what the mistake is, and explain the way that the information SHOULD be listed. For example, ""My Loan to Bank of Fred is NOT outstanding. It was paid in full on 02/14//05.""  Send photocopies along with all the necessary information to backup your claim.                      After you have done this send it to the credit bureau by ""CERTIFIED MAIL."" When the credit bureau receives your report and the information in question, they are required to investigate and ADVISE YOU of the results of their investigation. They must do this Free of charge.              Anytime that you are denied credit you have the right to know why.  If you are turned down for a credit account at a store, you will receive a statement from the store stating that you were denied credit and their reason why. If the store based their decision on your credit history, they must provide you with the name and address of the agency that reported it.              If for some reason you cannot prove that a negative item is an error or if you are having a disagreement with a certain creditor, you have the right to tell your side of the story in 100 words or less. This statement will be ADDED to your report.              When correcting items on your credit report, you have the right to demand that the credit bureau send corrected copies of your report to all creditors who have received the incorrect reports for the past six months. Note: Credit bureaus will not do this automatically! They will only do it if you ask.  So make sure you ask.  It's your right!

Also include copies (not originals) of any paperwork you may have that validates your claims.                                          DEALING WITH NEGATIVE INFORMATION ON YOUR REPORTS (AND COLLECTION AGENCIES)              Despite popular belief, it is often possible to negotiate removal of negative items on your credit reports posted by creditors.  In some cases, you might not even have to pay them the full amount owed*. The important thing is to be positive, be patient and get in contact with them to try to work out a deal.              If you've ignored (or never received) a creditor's bills or phone calls, or if you failed to keep up with payments, your bill may be turned over to a collection agency.  Keep in mind that collection agencies are hired by the creditor and their only goal is to collect the money owed (or as much of it as they can) as quickly as possible.  For their efforts, they are paid a percentage of what they collect.               If you feel that the amount in question is being billed in error, you have the right to ask for proof and verification of the charges.  If the charges are indeed yours it may be in your best interest to negotiate with the collection agency.  You may be able to negotiate payment of the total sum (or even a partial amount) in return for their removing their negative marks on your Credit History Report.  You might be able to settle on paying a portion of your debt, or you might be able to work out a payment installment plan with them.  Many of the Creditor letters in the STOREROOM  can be used with collection agencies for these situations.  Whatever deal you make with them, be sure that you have it all in writing prior to paying them.              Collection agencies can be very aggressive when it comes to collecting money.  Remember that you have rights.  You have the right to ask a collection agency stop contacting you, especially if you feel harassed. Use these letters below to give yourself breathing room while working through your plan to reorganize your finances.              *See the letters in the Storeroom section.                                            SEVEN STEPS TO BOOST YOUR FICO SCORE                                           Correct all inaccuracies on your Credit Report.                             Go through your credit reports very carefully.  Especially look for; Late payments, charge-offs, collections or other negative items that aren't yours, Accounts listed as ""settled,"" ""paid derogatory,"" ""paid charge-off"" or anything other than ""current"" or ""paid as agreed"" if you paid on time and in full, Accounts that are still listed as unpaid that were included in a bankruptcy, Negative items older than seven years (10 in the case of bankruptcy) that should have automatically fallen off your report (you must be careful with this last one, because sometimes scores actually go down when bad items fall off your report. It's a quirk in the FICO credit-scoring software, and the potential effect of eliminating old negative items is difficult to predict in advance).  Also make sure you don't have duplicate collection notices listed.  For example; if you have an account that has gone to collections, the original creditor may list the debt, as well as the collection agency.  Any duplicates must be removed!                              Make sure that your proper credit lines are posted on your Credit Reports.                             Often, in an effort to make you less desirable to their competitors, some creditors will not post your proper credit line.  Showing less available credit can negatively impact your credit score.  If you see this happening on your credit report, you have a right to complain and bring this to their attention.  If you have bankruptcies that should be showing a zero balance…make sure they show a zero balance! Very often the creditor will not report a ""bankruptcy charge-off"" as a zero balance until it's been disputed.                                            If you have any negative marks on your credit report, negotiate with the creditor/lender to remove it.                If you are a long time customer and it's something simple like a one-time late payment, a creditor will often wipe it away to keep you as a loyal customer.  If you have a serious negative mark (such as a long overdue bill that has gone to collections), always negotiate a payment in exchange for removal of the negative item.  Always make sure you have this agreement with them in writing.  Do not pay off a bill that has gone to collections unless the creditor agrees in writing that they will remove the derogatory item from your credit report.  This is important; when speaking with the creditor or collection agency about a debt that has gone to collections, do not admit that the debt is yours.  Admission of debt can restart the statute of limitations, and may enable the creditor to sue you.  You are also less likely to be able to negotiate a letter of deletion if you admit that this debt is yours.   Simply say ""I'm calling about account number ________"" instead of ""I'm calling about my past due debt.""                                                Pay all credit cards and any revolving credit down to below 30% of the available credit line.                               The scoring system wants to make sure you aren't overextended, but at the same time, they want to see that you do indeed use your credit. 30% of the available credit line seems to be the magic ""balance vs. credit line"" ratio to have.  For example; if you have a Credit Card with a $10,000 credit line, make sure that never more than $3000 (even if you pay your account off in full each month).  If your balances are higher than 30% of the available credit line, pay them down.   Here is another thing you can try; ask your long time creditors if they will raise your Credit Line without checking your FICO score or your Credit Report.  Tell them that you're shopping for a house and you can't afford to have any hits on your credit report.  Many will not but some will.                              Do not close your old credit card accounts.                              Old established accounts show your history, and tell about your stability and paying habits.  If you have old credit card accounts that you want to stop using, just cut up the cards or keep them in a drawer, but keep the accounts open.                               Avoid applying for new credit.               Each time you apply for new credit, your credit report gets checked. New credit cards will not help your credit score and a credit account less than one year old may hurt your credit score.  Use your cards and credit as little as possible until the next credit scoring.                               Have at least three revolving credit lines and one active (or paid) installment loan listed on your Credit Report.                The scoring system wants to see that you maintain a variety of credit accounts.  It also wants to see that you have 3 revolving credit lines.  If you do not have three active credit cards, you might want to open some (but keep in mind that if you do, you will need to wait some time before rescoring).  If you have poor credit and are not approved for a typical credit card, you might want to set up a ""secured credit card"" account.  This means that you will have to make a deposit that is equal or more than your limit, which guarantees the bank that you will repay the loan.  It's an excellent way to establish credit.  Examples of an installment loan would be a car loan, or it could be for furniture or a major appliance.  In addition to the above, having a mortgage listed will bring your score even higher.                          Throughout this process, always remember:              I t takes up to 30 Days for any of these things to get reported and often longer to reflect on your Credit History Reports.

A SUMMARY OF YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT              The Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) promotes the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies. There are many types of consumer reporting agencies, including credit bureaus and specialty agencies (such as agencies that sell information about check writing histories, medical records, and rental history records). Here is a summary of your major rights under the FCRA. For more information, including information about additional rights, go to www.ftc.gov or write to: Consumer Response Center, Room 130-A, Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Ave. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20580.                         • You must be told if information in your file has been used against you. Anyone who uses a credit report or another type of consumer report to deny your application for credit, insurance, or employment - or to take another adverse action against you - must tell you, and must give you the name, address, and phone number of the agency that provided the information.              • You have the right to know what is in your file. You may request and obtain all the information about you in the files of a consumer reporting agency (your ""file disclosure""). You will be required to provide proper identification, which may include your Social Security number. In many cases, the disclosure will be free.              You are entitled to a free file disclosure if:                            a person has taken adverse action against you because of information in your credit report                you are the victim of identify theft and place a fraud alert in your file                your file contains inaccurate information as a result of fraud                you are on public assistance                you are unemployed but expect to apply for employment within 60 days.                          You have the right to ask for a credit score. Credit scores are numerical summaries of your credit-worthiness based on information from credit bureaus. You may request a credit score from consumer reporting agencies that create scores or distribute scores used in residential real property loans, but you will have to pay for it. In some mortgage transactions, you will receive credit score information for free from the mortgage lender.              You have the right to dispute incomplete or inaccurate information. If you identify information in your file that is incomplete or inaccurate, and report it to the consumer reporting agency, the agency must investigate unless your dispute is frivolous. See www.ftc.gov for an explanation of dispute procedures.              Consumer reporting agencies must correct or delete inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information. Inaccurate, incomplete or unverifiable information must be removed or corrected, usually within 30 days. However, a consumer reporting agency may continue to report information it has verified as accurate.              Consumer reporting agencies may not report outdated negative information. In most cases, a consumer reporting agency may not report negative information that is more than seven years old, or bankruptcies that are more than 10 years old.              Access to your file is limited. A consumer reporting agency may provide information about you only to people with a valid need -- usually to consider an application with a creditor, insurer, employer, landlord, or other business. The FCRA specifies those with a valid need for access.            You must give your consent for reports to be provided to employers. A consumer reporting agency may not give out information about you to your employer, or a potential employer, without your written consent given to the employer. Written consent generally is not required in the trucking industry. For more information, go to www.ftc.gov.              You may limit ""prescreened"" offers of credit and insurance you get based on information in your credit report. Unsolicited ""prescreened"" offers for credit and insurance must include a toll-free phone number you can call if you choose to remove your name and address from the lists these offers are based on. You may opt-out with the nationwide credit bureaus at 1-888-5-OPTOUT (1-888-567-8688).              You may seek damages from violators. If a consumer reporting agency, or, in some cases, a user of consumer reports or a furnisher of information to a consumer reporting agency violates the FCRA, you may be able to sue in state or federal court.              Identity theft victims and active duty military personnel have additional rights. For more information, visit www.ftc.gov.

The FTC has received complaints from consumers who thought they were ordering their free annual credit     report online.

clueweb09-enwp01-91-15544	"                     Universal life insurance          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search                    This article  does not  cite  any  references or sources . Please help  improve this article  by adding citations to  reliable sources .  Unverifiable  material may be challenged and removed.  (November 2008)       Universal Life  is a type of permanent  life insurance  based on a cash value. That is, the policy is established with the insurer where premium payments above the cost of insurance are credited to the cash value. The cash value is credited each month with  interest , and the policy is debited each month by a cost of insurance ( COI ) charge, and any other policy charges and fees which are drawn from the cash value if no premium payment is made that month. The interest credited to the account is determined by the insurer; sometimes it is pegged to a  financial index  such as a bond or other interest rate index.

VUL's allow the cash value to be directed to a number of  separate accounts  that operate like  mutual funds  and can be invested in  stock  or  bond  investments with greater risk and potential reward. Additionally, there is the recent addition of Equity Indexed Universal Life contracts analogous to  Equity Indexed Annuities  that invest in Index Options on the movement of an Index such as the S&P 500, Russell 2000, and the Dow (to name a few). These type of contracts only participate in the movement of Index and not the actual purchase of stocks, bonds or mutual funds. They may have a cap (but not always) as to the maximum amount they will credit interest to and a minimum guarantee which keeps the principal of the contract from losing money in a down year. Typically each year the starting point is last year's ending point which means that: (1) the policy amount is locked in at the end of the year; and, (2)the beginning value from which the movement measured is reset.   Universal life is similar in some ways to, and was developed from  whole life insurance . [ 1 ]  The potential advantage of the universal life policy is in its flexibility and the potential for greater cash value growth if the interest rates offered outperform the insurer's general account (that whole life policy cash value growth is based on). Universal life is more flexible than whole life in two primary ways: the death benefit and usually the premium payment are flexible. The death benefit can be increased (subject to insurability) and decreased without surrendering the policy or getting a new one as would be required with whole life. Also a range of premium payments can be made to the policy, from a minimum amount to cover various guarantees the policy may offer to the maximum amount allowed by IRS rules. The primary difference is that the universal life policy shifts some of the risk for maintaining the death benefit to the insured. In a whole life policy, as long as every premium payment is made, the death benefit is guaranteed to be paid if the insured dies. In a UL the policy will lapse (the death benefit will no longer be in force) if the cash value or premium payments are not enough to cover the cost of insurance. To make their policies more attractive insurers often add guarantees, where if certain premium payments are made for a given period, the policy will remain in force for the guarantee period even if the cash value drops to zero. There are two other areas that differentiate Universal Life from Whole Life Insurance. The first is that the expenses, charges and cost of insurance within a Universal Life contract are transparently disclosed to the insured, whereas a Whole Life Insurance policy has traditionally hidden this type of information from the policyholder. Secondly, there are more flexible provisions within a Universal Life contract including zero interest or wash loans which in limited cases can provide the policyholder the ability to access the growth inside the contract without paying income tax. However if the policy lapses while the growth has been withdrawn, there may be substantial income tax owed.     [ edit ]   Uses   Universal Life is used as a tax-advantaged way to purchase life insurance. In the early years of the contract, the  premium  far exceeds the cost of insurance (COI) charges. The difference between the two (the ""cash value"") will grow tax-deferred so long as the policy remains in force. If the policy is held until death, the cash value will escape taxation entirely. This is because the premiums are paid with after-tax money, so the money going in has already been taxed, and only growth would be taxed. However, since you only pay taxes on the growth of an investment, and you rarely see growth relative to premiums paid, the money in the end is able to escape taxation. Also the death benefit of life insurance policies generally does not face income tax as long as certain circumstances don't occur.     [ edit ]   Types     [ edit ]   Single Premium   Single Premium UL is paid for by a single, substantial, initial payment. The policy remains in force so long as the COI charges have not depleted the account. Since changes in the tax code, this type of policy is now called a ""Modified Endowment Contract (MEC)"" and is subject to less advantageous tax treatment. All policies paid up in 5 or less years are subject to this same negative tax treatment. While the premiums and accumulation will be taxed just like an annuity upon withdrawing, the accumulations will grow tax deferred and will still transfer tax free to the beneficiary under Internal Revenue Service Code 101a under certain circumstances.     [ edit ]   Fixed Premium   Fixed Premium UL is paid for by periodic premium payments. Generally these payments will be for a shorter period of time than the policy is in force; for example payments may be made for 10 years, with the intention that thereafter the policy is paid-up. If the experience of the plan is not as good as predicted, the account value at the end of the premium period may not be adequate to continue the policy as originally written. In this case, the policyholder may have the choice to either:     Leave the policy alone, and let it potentially expire early (if COI charges deplete the account), or   Make additional or higher premium payments, to keep the death benefit level, or   Lower the death benefit.     Many universal life contracts taken out in the high interest periods of the 1970s and 1980s faced this situation and lapsed when the premiums paid were not enough to cover the cost of insurance.     [ edit ]   Flexible Premium   Flexible Premium UL allows the policyholder to determine how much they wish to pay each time premium is due. In addition, Flexible Premium UL may offer a number of different death benefit options, which typically include at least the following:     A level death benefit (often called  Option A  or  Option 1 ,  Type 1 , etc), or   A level amount at risk (often called  Option B , etc). This is also referred to as an increasing death benefit.     Policyholders may also buy Flexible Premium UL with a large initial deposit, thereafter making payments irregularly.     [ edit ]   Criticism     [ edit ]   Conflict of Interest   Agents who sell Universal Life Insurance often receive commissions near or equal to the first year of premiums providing an inordinate financial incentive to sell these policies over other less expensive policies.     [ edit ]   Illegally sold as an investment   In the US it is illegal to offer Universal Life Insurance as an  investment  option, but it is frequently offered by agents as a tax-sheltered investment scheme from which they can borrow as needed later without tax penalties.

Please  help  by adding  relevant  internal links , or by improving the article's  layout .  (January 2008)       An  equity index annuity  in the United States is a type of tax-deferred  annuity  whose credited interest is linked to an equity index --SEE EXAMPLE HERE>> [1] , and typically uses the  S&P 500  or international index. It guarantees a minimum interest rate (typically between 1% and 3%) if held to the end of the surrender term and protects against a loss of principal. An equity index annuity is a contract with an insurance or annuity company. The returns may be higher than fixed instruments such as CDs, money market accounts, and bonds but not as high as market returns. Equity Index Annuities are insured by the State Guarantee Fund which is similar to the insurance provided by the FDIC. The guarantees in the contract are backed by the relative strength of the insurer.   The contracts may be suitable for a portion of the asset portfolio for those who want to avoid risk and are in retirement or nearing retirement age. The objective of purchasing an equity index annuity is to realize greater gains than those provided by CDs, money markets or bonds, while still protecting principal. The long term ability of Equity Index Annuities to beat the returns of other fixed instruments is a matter of debate.   Indexed annuities represent about 30% of all fixed annuity sales in 2006 according to the Advantage Group (see www.indexannuity.org)   Equity Indexed Annuities may also be referred to as Fixed Indexed Annuities or simple indexed annuity. The mechanics of how Equity Index Annuities work are often complex and the returns can vary greatly depending on the month and year the annuity is purchased. Like many other types of annuities, equity-indexed annuities usually carry a surrender charge for early withdrawal. These ""surrender periods"" range between 3 and 16 years, typically about ten.   A Different way to Credit Interest   The indexed annuity is virtually identical to a fixed annuity except in the way interest in calculated. As an example consider a $100,000 fixed annuity that credits a 4% annual effect interest rate. The owner then receives an interest credit of $4000. However, in an equity indexed annuity the interest credit is linked to the equity markets. For example assume the index is the S&P 500 and a one year point-to-point method is used and that the annuity offers a 8% cap. The $100,000 annuity could credit anything between 0% and 8% based on the change in the S&P 500. The cap, 8% in this example, is determined by how much is afforded by budget which is usually at or near the 4% fixed rate. If fixed rates increase then it would be expected that the cap would increase as well.   This allows the owner the security of knowing that the $100,000 is safe but rather than receiving the sure 4% they can receive up to 8%. Historically since 1950, an 8% cap on the S&P 500 has resulted in an average interest credit of 5.2%, very similar to what is considered the ""risk free rate of return"" delivered by T-bills, 5.1% over a similar period. The return may also be adjusted by other factors such as the participation rate and market value adjustments to cover bring the cost of the option into the budget available.   This means the owner of the indexed annuity now has assumed more risk than a fixed annuity but less than being in the equity markets themselves. The result is that the expected yield (risk adjusted) for an indexed annuity is higher than a fixed annuity, CD, etc. However, the expected yield of being in the market is higher for several reasons.   The principal (in our example the $100,000) is at risk of loss when owning the index outright. It should be noted that Equity Index Annuity does not participate in dividends as owning the index outright would and similar there are no ongoing transaction expenses or fees. Interest is compounded as frequently as when interest is credited and this is almost always annually but contracts are available that credit interest over a 5 year term.   The taxation of the gains in an indexed annuity are identical to that of fixed annuities. Taxes are deferred until monies are received and then interest is withdrawn first and taxed as ordinary income.   Understanding Options   This way of linking to an equity index like the S&P 500 or Dow Jones is accomplished through an option, usually a call option. A call option is the right but not the obligation to purchase something at a future date for a specified price.   The naming conventions for options used by the insurance industry is different than that of Wall Street but the options are structurally identical. Here's a sample of options commonly seen in indexed annuities.     Insurance  vs.  Wall Street   Point-to-Point vs. European   Monthly Average vs.Asian   Monthly Point-to_Point vs. Cliquet   Performance Triggered vs. Binary     The options in indexed annuities can usually be fit into the following taxonomy developed by the National Association of Fixed Annuities.   Term  - the length of time before option matures, usually one year. Two, three, four, and ten are also prevalent in the market. Some longer term options are but have a ""highwater"" feature that allows interest to be credited more frequently. An example of this would be a ten year Monthly Average option that credits interest each year if there is a gain.   Index  - the equity, stock, bond, or other index to which the interest credit is linked.   Gain Formula  - the method used to determine the gain in the index. Point to point, monthly averaging, daily averaging are the most common methods of calculating the gain. For example of the S&P 500 index starts at 1120 and ends at 1300 then the point to point gain is 16.07%.   Adjustment Method  - the way the option is limited in order to reduce the cost (and subsequent return) so that it becomes affordable. As an example the point to point option may cost 7% of the account value but will be ""adjusted"" to reduce the cost.   ""Market Value Adjustment"" - the company may reserve the right to adjust the value of your account based on current market conditions. This adjustment is most often applied to distributions, partial or complete withdrawals, and exchanges to other accounts.   The most common adjustments are: cap, fee, participation rate or a combination of the three. Other adjustments are less common. In keeping with the preceding example and allowing for an 8% cap as the adjustment the policyholder would not receive the 16.07% point to point gain but rather 8% as an interest credit.   Should provide examples for: P2P with Participation Rate Monthly Averaging with Cap Monthly Averaging with Fee   Should also link to the Withdrawal Benefits provided in variable annuities and indexed annuties at this point. These concepts were added because of the risk associated with the accumulation in both variable annuities and indexed annuities.

clueweb09-en0005-67-00716	"                                              Equity Indexed Annuity Rates Look through a comprehensive list of the most competitive Index Annuities that we offer.                             Equity-Indexed Annuities   An equity-indexed annuity, or EIA for short, is an annuity that earns interest that is  linked to a stock or other equity index. One of the most commonly used indices  is the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index (the S&P 500).  EIAs offer consumers what could be described as the best of both worlds: a market-driven investment with potentially attractive returns, plus a guaranteed minimum return. In short: You get less upside but much less downside.     An equity-indexed annuity is in the category of ""Fixed"" annuities. That means, you may earn a comfortable return on your money while deferring the taxes on your gains. Fixed annuities also offer specified annual company-guaranteed returns. Variable annuities, on the other hand, let you decide where to allocate your funds in any number of mutual funds and, therefore, perhaps offer better returns, but at a higher risk. While variable annuity products must be registered with the SEC, must issue prospectuses and can only be sold by professionals with securities licenses, EIAs are not federally regulated and brokers don't need a securities license to sell them.   Understanding Equity-Indexed Annuities     Understanding the equity-indexed annuities market can be a somewhat daunting task. They're all different.     While it's a lot like investing directly in the stock market, you don't get the full boost of a rising market. With equity-indexed annuities, the money put down by you, as a purchaser, isn't invested directly in the stock market. Instead, you are offered a percentage of how much the index gains over a period of time, and a guaranteed minimum return if the stock market declines.     At predetermined times during the annuity's life, you are credited with a percentage of the gain of the index. The schedule varies with each annuity. Some offer annual ""indexing,"" while others use various averages taken over the life of the annuity.     How Are Indexed Annuities Different From Other Fixed Annuities?   An equity-indexed annuity is different from other fixed annuities because of the way it credits interest to your annuity's value. Most fixed annuities  credit interest calculated at a rate set in the contract. EIAs credit interest using a formula based on changes in the index to which the annuity is linked. The formula decides how the additional interest, if any, is calculated and credited. How much excess interest you get and when you get it depends on the features of your particular annuity.   Your equity-indexed annuity, like other fixed annuities, also promises to pay a minimum interest rate. The rate that will be applied will not be less than this minimum guaranteed rate even if the index-linked interest rate is lower. The value of your annuity also will not drop below a guaranteed minimum. For example, many single premium annuity contracts guarantee the minimum value will never be less than 90 percent (100 percent in some contracts) of the premium paid, plus at least 3% in annual interest (less any partial withdrawals). The insurance company will adjust the value of the annuity at the end of each term to reflect any index increases.   Note that most EIAs have surrender charges which are assessed in the early years of the contract if the owner surrenders it before the company has had the opportunity to recover its costs. The earnings portion of withdrawals are taxable as ordinary income and, if made prior to age 59½ are subject to a 10% federal penalty tax.        An equity-indexed annuity typically offers other benefits that are not generally included in traditional policies: a 100 percent money-back guarantee, no front-end sales charges, and no annual management fees or administrative fees. However, equity-indexed annuities can contain mortality and expense charges, cost-of-insurance charges, and administrative fees. Equity-indexed annuity values fluctuate with changes in market conditions.   The performance of any index is not indicative of the performance of any particular investment. Individuals cannot invest directly in any index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.    Benefits of the Equity-Indexed Annuity   No-Loss Provision:  The first and possibly most attractive provision of an equity-indexed annuity is the no-loss provision. This means that once a premium payment has been made or interest has been credited to the account, the account value will never decrease below that amount. This provides safety against the volatility of the S&P 500.   Interest Guarantees:  The next benefit of an equity-indexed annuity with wide appeal is interest guarantees. Most policies have a cap (the maximum interest rate that can be credited to a policy in a policy year) and a floor (the minimum interest rate that can be credited in a policy year). The cap rate can vary from no cap to a fixed percentage, but the floor is generally zero. This allows the policyholder to benefit from potentially high returns and be guaranteed at the same time that no money will be lost.   Competitive Rates of Return:  With concerns over inflation and making sure that investments will meet our future needs, many people have turned to the equity market for higher returns. It makes sense when you consider how well the S&P 500 index has performed historically.   Two contract features that have the greatest effect on the amount of additional interest that may be credited to an equity-indexed annuity are the indexing method and the participation rate. It is important to understand these features and how they work together. We devote a full section below to Indexing Methods, followed by a discussion of participation rates.   Indexing Methods of Equity-Indexed Annuities     There are six main indexing methods of equity-indexed annuities, each with its own variations and benefits:     The  European, or Point-to-Point, Method  divides the index on the   maturity date by the index on the issue date and subtracts 1 from the result.   (Other indexing methods use this same formula, with different data points.)   This ignores all the fluctuations between start and finish, and makes this   method the simplest both to understand and to calculate. One drawback   is that market fluctuations can produce very different results for customers   who bought the policy just a few days apart. The method's name comes   from European stock markets, where options can only be exercised on their   expiration date.   Again, the Point-to-Point method refers to the change, say, in the S&P 500 Index from the beginning of the term to the end of the term. The term period may be one policy year or 3, 5 7 policy years. The index-linked interest, if any, is based on the difference between the index value at the end of the term and the index value at the start of the term. Interest is added to your annuity at the end of the term.     Advantage:  Since interest cannot be calculated before the end of the term, use of this design may permit a higher participation rate than annuities using other designs.   Disadvantage:  Since interest is not credited until the end of the term, typically six or seven years, you may not be able to get the index-linked interest until the end of the term.   The  Asian Method  involves averaging several points of the index to establish the beginning and/or ending index. This method can help shield you from the risk of a market decline on the maturity date. Some companies take an average of the 12 monthly indices to establish the policy's maturity index level. This method takes its name from the Asian stock markets.   The  Look-back or High-water Mark Method  is another popular approach. On each policy anniversary, the company notes the index level. The highest of these is then taken and figured as the index level on the maturity date. In other words, the index-linked interest, if any, is decided by looking at the index value at various points during the term, usually the annual anniversaries of the date you bought the annuity. The interest is based on the difference between the highest index value and the index value at the start of the term. Interest is added to your annuity at the end of the term.     Advantages:  Since interest is calculated using the highest value of the index on a contract anniversary during the term, this design may credit higher interest than some other designs if the index reaches a high point early or in the middle of the term, then drops off at the end of the term.   Disadvantages:  Interest is not credited until the end of the term. In some annuities, if you surrender your annuity before the end of the term, you may not get index-linked interest for that term. In other annuities, you may receive index-linked interest, based on the highest anniversary value to date and the annuity's vesting schedule. Also, contracts with this design may have a lower participation rate than annuities using other designs or may use a cap to limit the total amount of interest you might earn.   The  Low-water Mark Method  uses the lowest of the indices on each of the policy anniversaries before maturity as the level of the index at issue. This method tends to lessen the risk of market decline. Here the index-linked interest, if any, is decided by looking at the index value at various points during the term, usually the annual anniversaries of the date you bought the annuity. The interest is based on the difference between the index value at the end of the term and the lowest index value. Interest is added to your annuity at the end of the term.     The  Annual Reset or Ratchet Method  is among the most complicated. The increase in the index is calculated each policy year by comparing the indices on the beginning and ending anniversaries. Any resulting decreases are ignored. Appreciation is figured by adding or compounding the increases for each policy year. In other words, index-linked interest, if any, is determined each year by comparing the index value at the end of the contract year with the index value at the start of the contract year. Interest is added to your annuity each year during the term. This method locks in the gain for that period which is usually one policy year. Once the interest is credited to your policy it becomes the value on which the next years gain is calculated.   Advantages:  Since the interest earned is ""locked in"" annually and the  index value is ""reset"" at the end of each year, future decreases in the index will not affect the interest you have already earned. Therefore, your annuity using the annual reset method may credit more interest than annuities using other methods when the index fluctuates up and down often during the term. This design is more likely than others to give you access to index-linked interest before the term ends.   Disadvantages:  Your annuity's participation rate may change each year and generally will be lower than that of other indexing methods. Also, an annual reset design may use a cap or averaging to limit the total amount of interest you might earn each year.   The  Spread Method  calculates the increase in the S&P 500 for that policy year or term then subtract a percentage from that change. For example if the the gain in the S&P 500 for a policy year was 12% and the company used a spread of 2%, then, 10% would be credited to your policy for that year.     Participation Rate   The participation rate decides how much of the increase in the index will be used to calculate index-linked interest. For example, if the calculated change in the index is 9% and the participation rate is 70%, the index-linked interest rate for your annuity will be 6.3% (9% x 70% = 6.3%). A company may set a different participation rate for newly issued annuities as often as each day. Therefore, the initial participation rate in your annuity will depend on when it is issued by the company. The company usually guarantees the participation rate for a specific period (from one year to the entire term). When that period is over, the company sets a new participation rate for the next period. Some annuities guarantee that the participation rate will never be set lower than a specified minimum or higher than a specified maximum.   The participation rate may vary greatly from one annuity to another and from time to time within a particular annuity. Therefore, it is important for you to know how your annuity's participation rate works with the indexing method. A high participation rate may be offset by other features, such as averaging, or a point-to-point indexing method. On the other hand, an insurance company may offset a lower participation rate by also offering a feature such as an annual reset indexing method.     Most equity-indexed annuities offer participation rates between 70 and 90 percent, and some place a cap on how much you can gain. If the product has a 14 percent cap, and the market gains 34 percent, you're stuck with 14 percent.     Say you plunk down $5,000 (a typical sum) for an equity-indexed annuity with an 80 percent participation rate and a 14 percent cap. If the S&P 500 goes up 15 percent, you'll gain $600. If you'd invested your $5,000 directly in the stock market, you'd have gained $750.     Cap Rate or Cap   Some annuities may put an upper limit, or cap, on the index-linked interest rate. This is the maximum rate of interest the annuity will earn. In the example given above, if the contract has a 6% cap rate, 6%, and not 6.3%, would be credited. Not all annuities have a cap rate. While a cap limits the amount of interest you might earn each year, annuities with this feature may have other product features you want, such as annual interest crediting or the ability to take partial withdrawals. Also, annuities that have a cap may have a higher participation rate.   Floor on Equity Index-Linked Interest   The floor is the minimum index-linked interest rate you will earn. The most common floor is 0%. A 0% floor assures that even if the index decreases in value, the index-linked interest that you earn will be zero and not negative.   Averaging   In some annuities, the average of an index's value is used rather than the actual value of the index on a specified date. The index averaging may occur at the beginning, the end, or throughout the entire term of the annuity. Averaging at the beginning of a term protects you from buying your annuity at a high point, which would reduce the amount of interest you might earn. Averaging at the end of the term protects you against severe declines in the index and losing index-linked interest as a result. On the other hand, averaging may reduce the amount of index-linked interest you earn when the index rises either near the start or at the end of the term.   Margin/Spread/Administrative Fee   In some annuities, the index-linked interest rate is computed by subtracting a specific percentage from any calculated change in the index. This percentage, sometimes referred to as the ""margin,"" ""spread,"" or ""administrative fee,"" might  be instead of, or in addition to, a participation rate. For example, if the calculated change in the index is 10%, your annuity might specify that 2.25% will be subtracted from the rate to determine the interest rate credited. In this example, the rate would be 7.75% (10% - 2.25% = 7.75%). In this example, the company subtracts the percentage only if the change in the index produces a positive interest rate.   Are Equity-Indexed Annuities a Good Investment?     If you had bought an equity-indexed annuity just before the collapse of the stock market instead of investing in the stock market itself, you would be very happy right now!     Before you invest in an equity-indexed annuity you will want to read the fine print. There are surrender charges for early withdrawal, although most companies now allow yearly withdrawals at set amounts. Notably, the surrender charges often decrease the longer you let the company keep your money.   This type of investment is advantageous for someone who is young and willing to allow the earnings to mount for retirement. If you don't need the money and are not dependent on it, an indexed annuity is your best bet. Depending on your situation, all of your earning potential may be ahead of you, so leaving it alone is the way to go.          © 2005 appei.org         "

While caps, participation rates and other limitations will     keep the EIA from realizing the full growth of the index, there is still the     potential for the annuity to grow at a better rate than by a simple interest     rate. So long as no withdrawals are made from the annuity during the surrender     period or before the consumer reaches age 59½, it is unlikely that a     consumer will lose money with an EIA. Because of this inherent safety, EIA     are a desired vehicle for retirement planning.     Equity-Indexed Annuities: The Smart Consumer’s     Guide  is a general reference that provides easy-to-understand explanations     of the basic features of this advanced form of fixed annuity. This book does     not claim to be a comprehensive product guide, or to compare different equity-indexed     annuity products.     This book provides a consumer-level explanation of the basic operation of     EIAs.            Chapter 1  introduces       the equity-indexed annuity  and describes it as a variation of a fixed annuity.        Chapter       2  discusses how the  minimum         interest rate is credited  to the annuity.        Chapter       3  describes how  index         crediting  can provide the maximum return for the annuity.        Chapter       4  talks about the various  methods         by which the annuity is linked to the index for crediting purposes .        Chapter       5  addresses the various  payout         options  that are available.        Chapter 6  discusses       the  annuity company  and       financial ratings.        Chapter 7  discusses  suitability       issues, including complexity, disclosure, liquidity and withdrawals .        Chapter       8  talks about the  portfolio         role of EIAs .        Chapter 9  addresses  tax       considerations  and how EIAs should be integrated into estate       planning.        Chapter       10  discusses  asset protection  issues.       Finally,        Chapter 11  offers  questions  that       each consumer should ask before purchasing an equity-indexed annuity.           This book is also an excellent resource for agents to provide to their prospective     clients so that their clients will better understand what equity-indexed annuities     are and how they work. The book contains the full text of publications about     EIAs from the NASD, NAIC, and SEC for prospective clients to read.     Few individuals have done more to educate the American public about financial     scams than  Jay Adkisson .     As the creator of  Quatloos.com ,     Jay has helped many thousands of people worldwide avoid being scammed out of     many millions of dollars to various investment schemes. The U.S. Senate Finance     Committee has twice called Jay as an expert witness on abusive tax schemes.     As one of the authors of “ Asset       Protection: Concepts and Strategies ” (McGraw-Hill 2004), Jay has     similarly helped thousands of people avoid dubious asset protection schemes.     In his latest book,  Equity-Indexed Annuities:     The Smart Consumer’s Guide , Jay gives a balanced and objective     overview of this advanced form of fixed annuity to better educate consumers     of the advantages, disadvantages, and the numerous product options that     are available when considering the purchase of this popular retirement     vehicle.     This short guide covers all the most important issues that consumers should     address before purchasing an equity-indexed annuity, including:                   How the minimum interest rate is paid, how the maximum return is linked         to the stock index, and how participation rates and caps may limit returns.                     How surrender charges may limit withdrawal rights for a period of years         after the annuity is purchased, and why the annuity should not be purchased         if the consumer will need the cash during this period.                     How the annuity payments may be made, and what can happen upon the death         of the annuitant.                     How annuities benefit from tax-deferral, how taxes are paid upon withdrawal         or when annuity payments are made, and tax considerations upon the death         of the annuitant.                     How the annuity and annuity payments may be protected from creditors in         some states, and how in other states they may be protected by proper planning         done in advance of claims.                 This guide does not claim to address all issues that might arise from the     many types of equity-indexed annuities now available to consumers, but it should     give enough of a basic overview that consumers will be able to ask the right     questions of their agent, and be able to compare the most important features     between competing products. This guide should also give consumers the ability     to intelligently answer the most fundamental question: Is an equity-indexed     annuity right for me?     About the Author     Jay D.

Read more at  http://www.jayadkisson.com     Some Warnings     Equity-Indexed Annuities are excellent products in the abstract and work for     many consumers. For some consumers, however, equity-indexed annuities may not     turn out to be a good purchase. These disappointed consumers will be those     who discover too late that they needed their money during the surrender period     or before they turned 59½, but they could not access it without penalty.     These consumers should never have purchased an EIA in the first place, and     a purpose of this book is to set out those circumstances in which a person     should instead place their money into something that is more liquid so that     they can meet their cash needs.           Securities Law Issues             When you should absolutely not buy an Equity-Indexed Annuity     You should absolutely NOT buy an Equity-Indexed Annuity if:                   You anticipate needing most of you money from the Equity-Indexed Annuity         during the surrender period.                     You anticipate needing any amount of money from the Equity-Indexed Annuity         prior to the time that you turn 59½.                     You are having difficulty understanding the fundamental terms of the Equity-Indexed         Annuity being offered to you.                 If any of these three conditions apply, then you should absolutely not buy     an Equity-Indexed Annuity. Do not allow yourself to be placed into a contract     for which your situation is unsuitable.     Particular Things That You Absolutely Must Know     You must understand at least the following contractual terms of the Equity-Indexed     Annuity that you are considering buying:                   What is the financial rating of the annuity company?                     What is the minimum guaranteed interest rate return? What is the         participation rate for interest crediting?                     How many years will surrender charges be charged? What are the surrender         charges in each year?                     How is the annuity linked to the index? What is the participation rate for         index crediting? Are there caps?                     What happens to the annuity if you die? Will the surrender charges be         waived? Will your beneficiaries receive any money?                     What are the exchange options? Will you be forced to annuitize?                     Are there any tax consequences that you should know about?                 What are the moving parts to this annuity? What terms or rates does the     annuity company have the right to change?

clueweb09-enwp00-04-18930	"                     Annuity (US financial products)          From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia                 Jump to:  navigation ,  search          For other uses, see  Annuity .   In the U.S. an  annuity  contract is created when an individual gives a life insurance company money which may grow on a tax-deferred basis and then can be distributed back to the owner in several ways. The defining characteristic of all  annuity contracts  is the option for a guaranteed distribution of income until the death of the person or persons named in the contract. Perhaps confusingly, the majority of modern annuity customers use annuities only to accumulate funds and to take lump-sum withdrawals without using the guaranteed-income-for-life feature.

Variable annuities have features of both  life insurance  and  investment  products. [ 1 ]  In the U.S., annuity contracts may be issued only by life  insurance companies , although private annuity contracts may be arranged between donors to non-profits to reduce taxes. Insurance companies are regulated by the states, so contracts or options that may be available in some states may not be available in others. Their federal tax treatment, however, is governed by the Internal Revenue Code. Variable annuities are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the sale of variable annuities is overseen by FINRA (the largest non-governmental regulator for all securities firms doing business in the United States).   There are two possible phases for an annuity, one phase in which the customer deposits and accumulates money into an account (the deferral phase), and another phase in which customers receive payments for some period of time (the annuity or income phase). During this latter phase, the insurance company makes income payments that may be set for a stated period of time, such as five years, or continue until the death of the customer(s) (the ""annuitant(s)"") named in the contract. Annuitization over a lifetime can have a death benefit guarantee over a certain period of time, such as ten years. Annuity contracts with a deferral phase always have an annuity phase and are called deferred annuities. An annuity contract may also be structured so that it has only the annuity phase; such a contract is called an immediate annuity.     [ edit ]   Immediate annuity   The term ""annuity,"" as used in financial theory, is most closely related to what is today called an  immediate annuity . This is an  insurance policy  which, in exchange for a sum of money, guarantees that the issuer will make a series of payments. These payments may be either level or increasing periodic payments for a fixed term of years or until the ending of a life or two lives, or even whichever is longer. It is also possible to structure the payments under an immediate annuity so that they vary with the performance of a specified set of investments, usually bond and equity mutual funds. Such a contract is called a variable immediate annuity. See also life annuity, below.   The overarching characteristic of the immediate annuity is that it is a vehicle for distributing  savings  with a tax-deferred growth factor. A common use for an immediate annuity might be to provide a  pension  income. In the U.S., the tax treatment of an immediate annuity is that every payment is a combination of a return of principal (which part is not taxed) and income (which is taxed at  ordinary income  rates, not capital gain rates). When a deferred annuity is annuitized, it works like an immediate annuity from that point on, but with a lower cost basis and thus more of the payment is taxed.     [ edit ]   Annuity with period certain   This type of immediate annuity pays the annuitant for a designated number of years (i.e., a period certain) and is used to fund a need that will end when the period is up (for example, it might be used to fund the premiums for a term life insurance policy). Thus this option is not necessarily suitable for an individual's retirement income, as the person may outlive the number of years the annuity will pay.     [ edit ]   Life annuity   A life or lifetime immediate annuity is used to provide an income for the life of the annuitant similar to a  defined benefit  or  pension  plan.   A  life annuity  works somewhat like a loan that is made by the purchaser (contract owner) to the issuing (insurance) company, which pays back the original capital or principal (which isn't taxed) with interest and/or gains (which is taxed as ordinary income) to the  annuitant  on whose life the annuity is based. The assumed period of the loan is based on the life expectancy of the annuitant. In order to guarantee that the income continues for life, the insurance company relies on a concept called  cross-subsidy  or the ""law of large numbers"". Because an  annuity population  can be expected to have a distribution of lifespans around the population's  mean  (average) age, those dying earlier will give up income to support those living longer whose money would otherwise run out. Thus it is a form of  longevity insurance  (see also below).   A life annuity, ideally, can reduce the ""problem"" faced by a person that he/she doesn't know how long he/she will live, and so he/she doesn't know the optimal speed at which to spend his/her savings. Life annuities with payments indexed to the Consumer Price Index might be an acceptable solution to this problem, but there is only a thin market for them in North America.     [ edit ]   Life annuity variants   For an additional expense (either by way of an increase in payments (premium) or a decrease in benefits), an annuity or benefit  rider  can be purchased on another life such as a spouse, family member or friend for the duration of whose life the annuity is wholly or partly guaranteed. For example, it is common to buy an annuity which will continue to pay out to the spouse of the annuitant after death, for so long as the spouse survives. The annuity paid to the spouse is called a reversionary annuity or survivorship annuity. However, if the annuitant is in good health, it may be more advantageous to select the higher payout option on his or her life only and purchase a life insurance policy that would pay income to the survivor.   The pure life annuity can have harsh consequences for the annuitant who dies before recovering his or her investment in the contract. Such a situation, called a forfeiture, can be mitigated by the addition of a period-certain feature under which the annuity issuer is required to make annuity payments for a least a certain number of years; if the annuitant outlives the specified period certain, annuity payments continue until the annuitant's death, and if the annuitant dies before the expiration of the period certain, the annuitant's estate or beneficiary is entitled to the remaining payments certain. The tradeoff between the pure life annuity and the life-with-period-certain annuity is that the annuity payment for the latter is smaller. A viable alternative to the life-with-period-certain annuity is to purchase a single-premium life policy that would cover the lost premium in the annuity.   Impaired-life annuities for  smokers  or those with a particular illness are also available from some insurance companies. Since the life expectancy is reduced, the annual payment to the purchaser is raised.   Life annuities are priced based on the probability of the annuitant surviving to receive the payments.  Longevity insurance  is a form of annuity that defers commencement of the payments until very late in life. A common longevity contract would be purchased at or before retirement but would not commence payments until 20 years after retirement. If the nominee dies before payments commence there is no payable benefit. This drastically reduces the cost of the annuity while still providing protection against outliving one's resources.     [ edit ]   Deferred annuity   The second usage for the term  annuity  came into being during the 1970s. Such a contract is more properly referred to as a  deferred annuity  and is chiefly a vehicle for accumulating savings with a view to eventually distributing them either in the manner of an immediate annuity or as a lump-sum payment.   All varieties of deferred annuities owned by individuals have one thing in common: any increase in account values is not taxed until those gains are withdrawn. This is also known as tax-deferred growth.   A deferred annuity which grows by interest rate earnings alone is called a  fixed deferred annuity  (FA). A deferred annuity that permits allocations to stock or bond funds and for which the account value is not guaranteed to stay above the initial amount invested is called a  variable annuity  (VA).   A new category of deferred annuity, called the  equity indexed annuity  (EIA) emerged in 1995. [ 2 ]  Equity indexed annuities may have features of both fixed and variable deferred annuities. The insurance company typically guarantees a minimum return for EIA. An investor can still lose money if he or she cancels (or surrenders) the policy early, before a ""break even"" period. An oversimplified expression of a typical EIA's  rate of return  might be that it is equal to a stated ""participation rate"" multiplied by a target  stock market index 's performance excluding dividends. Interest rate caps or an administrative fee may be applicable.   Deferred annuities in the United States have the advantage that taxation of all capital gains and ordinary income is deferred until withdrawn. In theory, such tax-deferred compounding allows more money to be put to work while the savings are accumulating, leading to higher returns. A disadvantage, however, is that when amounts held under a deferred annuity are withdrawn or inherited, the interest/gains are immediately taxed as ordinary income.     [ edit ]   Features   A variety of features and guarantees have been developed by insurance companies in order to make annuity products more attractive. These include death and living benefit options, extra credit options, account guarantees, spousal continuation benefits, reduced contingent deferred sales charges (or surrender charges), and various combinations thereof. Each feature or benefit added to a contract will typically be accompanied by an additional expense either directly (billed to client) or indirectly (inside product).   Deferred annuities are usually divided into two different kinds:     Fixed annuities offer some sort of guaranteed rate of return over the life of the contract. In general such contracts are often positioned to be somewhat like bank CDs and offer a rate of return competitive with those of CDs of similar time frames. Many fixed annuities, however, do not have a fixed rate of return over the life of the contract, offering instead a guaranteed minimum rate and a first year introductory rate. The rate after the first year is often an amount that may be set at the insurance company's discretion subject, however, to the minimum amount (typically 3%). There are usually some provisions in the contract to allow a percentage of the interest and/or principal to be withdrawn early and without penalty (usually the interest earned in a 12-month period or 10%), unlike most CDs. Fixed annuities normally become fully liquid upon the owner's death. Most equity index annuities are properly categorized as fixed annuities and their performance is typically tied to a stock market index (usually the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average). These products are guaranteed but are not as easy to understand as standard fixed annuities as there are usually caps, spreads, margins, and crediting methods that can reduce returns. These products also don't pay any of the participating market indices' dividends; the trade-off is that contract holder can never earn less than 0% in a negative year.       Variable annuities allow money to be invested in insurance company ""separate accounts"" (which are sometimes referred to as ""subaccounts"" and in any case are functionally similar to mutual funds) in a tax-deferred manner. [ 3 ]  Their primary use is to allow an investor to engage in tax-deferred investing for retirement in amounts greater than permitted by individual retirement or  401(k)  plans. In addition, many variable annuity contracts offer a guaranteed minimum rate of return (either for a future withdrawal and/or in the case of the owner's death), even if the underlying separate account investments perform poorly. This can be attractive to people uncomfortable investing in the equity markets without the guarantees. Of course, an investor will pay for each benefit provided by a variable annuity, since insurance companies must charge a premium to cover the insurance guarantees of such benefits. Variable annuities are regulated both by the individual states (as insurance products) and by the Securities and Exchange Commission (as securities under the federal securities laws). The SEC requires that all of the charges under variable annuities be described in great detail in the prospectus that is offered to each variable annuity customer. Of course, potential customers should review these charges carefully, just as one would in purchasing mutual fund shares. People who sell variable annuities are usually regulated by  FINRA , whose rules of conduct require a careful analysis of the suitability of variable annuities (and other securities products) to those to whom they recommend such products. These products are often criticized as being sold to the wrong persons, who could have done better investing in a more suitable alternative, since the commissions paid under this product are often high relative to other investment products.     There are several types of performance guarantees, and one may often choose them a la carte, with higher risk charges for guarantees that are riskier for the insurance companies. The first type is comprised of guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDBs), which can be received only if the owner of the annuity contract, or the covered annuitant, dies.   GMDBs come in various flavors, in order of increasing risk to the insurance company:     Return of premium (a guarantee that you will not have a negative return)   Roll-up of premium at a particular rate (a guarantee that you will achieve a minimum rate of return, greater than 0)   Maximum anniversary value (looks back at account value on the anniversaries, and guarantees you will get at least as much as the highest values upon death)   Greater of maximum anniversary value or particular roll-up     Insurance companies provide even greater insurance coverage on guaranteed living benefits, which tend to be elective. Unlike death benefits, which the contractholder generally can't time, living benefits pose significant risk for insurance companies as contractholders will likely exercise these benefits when they are worth the most. Annuities with guaranteed living benefits (GLBs) tend to have high fees commensurate with the additional risks underwritten by the issuing insurer.   Some GLB examples, in no particular order:     Guaranteed minimum income benefit (a guarantee that one will get a minimum income stream upon annuitization at a particular point in the future)   Guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit (a guarantee that the account value will be at a certain amount at a certain point in the future)   Guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (a guarantee similar to the income benefit, but one that doesn't require annuitizing)   Guaranteed-for-life income benefit (a guarantee similar to a withdrawal benefit, where withdrawals begin and continue until cash value becomes zero, withdrawals stop when cash value is zero and then annuitization occurs on the guaranteed benefit amount for a payment amount that is not determined until annuitization date.)       [ edit ]   Criticisms of deferred annuities   Deferred annuities are generally sold by financial professionals, some of whom may work directly for an insurance company. Most financial professionals, however, are independent agents of the insurance company, not employees. The financial professional who sells an annuity collects a commission from the insurance company. This commission will be a percentage of the total premium paid by the investor. This percentage can be as little as 1% and as high as 12%; the average is 6%. Since these commissions appear high and there are deferred sales charges on annuities, many financial gurus have criticized annuity products.   The investor will, generally, not pay any of this commission directly to the financial professional; the commission is paid by the insurance company to the financial professional up front. The insurance company will recapture the commission paid to the financial professional through the fees charged to the customer (in a variable or equity indexed annuity) or the spread in the interest rate market (for a fixed annuity). There are also deferred back-end charges that will be applied if the investor closes out his or her contract before the agreed-upon time frame, usually 8 years. These charges can last for as little as 1 year or as many as 20 years, depending on the type of annuity and issuing company. These back-end charges concern many financial professionals and financial gurus.   Some annuities do not have any deferred surrender charges and do not pay the financial professional a commission, although the financial professional may charge a fee for his or her advice. These contracts are called ""no-load"" variable annuity products and are usually available from a fee-based financial planner or directly from a no-load mutual fund company. Of course various charges are still imposed on these contracts, but they are less than those sold by commissioned brokers. It is important that potential purchasers -- of annuities, mutual funds, tax-exempt municipal bonds, commodities futures, interest-rate swaps, in short, any financial instrument -- understand the fees on the product and the fees a financial planner may charge.   Variable annuities are controversial because many believe the extra fees (i.e., the fees above and beyond those charged for similar retail mutual funds that offer no principal protection or guarantees of any kind) may reduce the rate of return compared to what the investor could make by investing directly in similar investments outside of the variable annuity. A big selling point for variable annuities is the guarantees many have, such as the guarantee that the customer will not lose his or her principal. Critics say that these guarantees are not necessary because over the long term the market has always been positive, while others say that with the uncertainty of the financial markets many investors simply will not invest without guarantees. Past returns are no guarantee of future performance, of course, and different investors have different risk tolerances, different investment horizons, different family situations, and so on. The sale of any security product should involve a careful analysis of the suitability of the product for a given individual.   A controversial practice of insurance sales is the selling of insurance contracts within an IRA or 401(k) plan. Since these investment vehicles are already tax deferred, investors do not receive additional tax shelters from the annuities. The benefit of the annuity contract is the guaranteed lifetime income that all annuity contracts must have by state law. Approximately 90% of annuitants, however, have not taken the life annuity upon retirement. If an investor does not intend to take the life income option from an annuity contract at retirement he or she may want to consider a low-cost deferred annuity.   If an investor needs to take lifetime income at retirement, on the other hand, he or she may want to try to buy an annuity upon retirement or might consider selecting a 401(k) plan account with an option to buy the annuity just before retirement.   In the October 2003 edition of  Wealth Manager , an article titled ""Photo Finish"" by W. McAfee, Jr.  [1]  examined the effects of taxation on annuities relative to other investment vehicles. The author found that annuities are generally not effective as a tax-deferral vehicle and that there are significant flaws in the use of annuities for financial planning during the accumulation phase.     [ edit ]   Taxation   In the  U.S.   Internal Revenue Code , the growth of the annuity value during the accumulation phase is tax-deferred, that is, not subject to current  income tax , for annuities owned by individuals. The tax deferred status of deferred annuities has led to their common usage in the United States. Under the U.S. tax code, the benefits from annuity contracts do not always have to be taken in the form of a fixed stream of payments (annuitization), and many of annuity contracts are bought primarily for the tax benefits rather than to receive a fixed stream of income. If an annuity is used in a qualified pension plan or an IRA funding vehicle, then 100% of the annuity payment is taxable as current income upon distribution (because the taxpayer has no tax basis in any of the money in the annuity). If the annuity contract is purchased with after-tax dollars, then the contractholder upon annuitization recovers his basis pro-rata in the ratio of basis divided by the expected value, according to the tax regulation Section 1.72-5. (This is commonly referred to as the exclusion ratio.) After the taxpayer has recovered all of his basis, then 100% of the payments thereafter are subject to ordinary income tax.   Since the  Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 , the use of variable annuities as a tax shelter has greatly diminished, because the growth of mutual funds and now most of the dividends of the fund are taxed at long term capital gains rates. This taxation, contrasted with the taxation of all the growth of variable annuities at income rates, means that in most cases, variable annuities shouldn't be used for tax shelters unless very long holding periods apply (for example, more than 20 years).   Also, any withdrawals before an investor reaches the age of 59  are generally subject to a 10% tax penalty in addition to any gain being taxed as ordinary income.  [ 4 ]   In the October 2003 edition of Wealth Manager, an article titled ""Photo Finish"" by W. McAfee, Jr. [4] examined the effects of taxation on annuities relative to other investment vehicles. The author found that annuities are generally not effective as a tax-deferral vehicle and that there are significant flaws in the use of annuities for financial planning during the accumulation phase.     [ edit ]   Insurance company default risk and state guaranty associations   An investor should consider the financial strength of the insurance company that writes annuity contracts. Major insolvencies have occurred at least 62 times since the conspicuous collapse of the  Executive Life Insurance Company  in 1991. [2]   Insurance company defaults are governed by state law. The laws are, however, broadly similar in most states. Annuity contracts are protected against insurance company insolvency up to a specific dollar limit, often $100,000, but as high as $500,000 in New York [3] , New Jersey [4] , and the state of Washington [5] . This protection is not insurance and is not provided by a government agency. It is provided by an entity called the state Guaranty Association. When an insolvency occurs, the Guaranty Association steps in to protect annuity holders, and decides what to do on a case-by-case basis. Sometimes the contracts will be taken over and fulfilled by a solvent insurance company.   The state Guaranty Association is not a government agency, but states usually require insurance companies to belong to it as a condition of being licensed to do business. The Guaranty Associations of the fifty states are members of a national umbrella association, the  National Organization of Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Associations  (NOLHGA). The  NOLHGA website  provides a description of the organization, links to websites for the individual state organizations, and links to the actual text of the governing state laws.   A difference between guaranty association protection and the protection e.g. of bank accounts by FDIC, credit union accounts by NCUA, and brokerage accounts by SIPC, is that it is difficult for consumers to learn about this protection. Usually, state law prohibits insurance agents and companies from using the guaranty association in any advertising and agents are prohibited by statute from using this Web site or the existence of the guaranty association as an inducement to purchase insurance(e.g.  [6] ). Presumably this is a response to concerns by stronger insurance companies about  moral hazard .     [ edit ]   Compensation for advisors or salespeople   Deferred annuities, including fixed, equity indexed and variable, typically pay the advisor or salesperson 1 percent to 4 percent of the amount invested as a commission, with possible trail options of 25 basis points to 1 percent. Sometimes the advisor can select his payout option, which might be either 7 percent up front, or 5 percent up front with a 25 basis point trail, or 1 percent to 3 percent up front with a 1 percent trail.   Some firms allow an investor to pick an annuity share class, which determines the salesperson's commission schedule. The main variables are the up-front commission and the trailing commission.   ""No-load"" variable annuities are available on a direct-to-consumer basis from several no-load  mutual fund  companies. ""No-load"" means the products have no sales commissions or surrender charges. Even these lower cost variable annuities often make sense only after an investor has exhausted all other forms of tax shelters, and only if being held for quite some time.   Fixed and Indexed Annuity commissions are paid by the insurance companies the licensed agent represents. Commissions are not paid out of the clients principal.

Please  help  by adding  relevant   internal links , or by improving the article's  layout .  (January 2008)       An  equity index annuity  in the United States is a type of tax-deferred  annuity  whose credited interest is linked to an equity index --SEE EXAMPLE HERE>> [1] , and typically uses the  S&P 500  or international index. It guarantees a minimum interest rate (typically between 1% and 3%) if held to the end of the surrender term and protects against a loss of principal. An equity index annuity is a contract with an insurance or annuity company. The returns may be higher than fixed instruments such as CDs, money market accounts, and bonds but not as high as market returns. Equity Index Annuities are insured by the State Guarantee Fund which is similar to the insurance provided by the FDIC. The guarantees in the contract are backed by the relative strength of the insurer.   The contracts may be suitable for a portion of the asset portfolio for those who want to avoid risk and are in retirement or nearing retirement age. The objective of purchasing an equity index annuity is to realize greater gains than those provided by CDs, money markets or bonds, while still protecting principal. The long term ability of Equity Index Annuities to beat the returns of other fixed instruments is a matter of debate.   Indexed annuities represent about 30% of all fixed annuity sales in 2006 according to the Advantage Group (see www.indexannuity.org)   Equity Indexed Annuities may also be referred to as Fixed Indexed Annuities or simple indexed annuity. The mechanics of how Equity Index Annuities work are often complex and the returns can vary greatly depending on the month and year the annuity is purchased. Like many other types of annuities, equity-indexed annuities usually carry a surrender charge for early withdrawal. These ""surrender periods"" range between 3 and 16 years, typically about ten.   A Different way to Credit Interest   The indexed annuity is virtually identical to a fixed annuity except in the way interest in calculated. As an example consider a $100,000 fixed annuity that credits a 4% annual effect interest rate. The owner then receives an interest credit of $4000. However, in an equity indexed annuity the interest credit is linked to the equity markets. For example assume the index is the S&P 500 and a one year point-to-point method is used and that the annuity offers a 8% cap. The $100,000 annuity could credit anything between 0% and 8% based on the change in the S&P 500. The cap, 8% in this example, is determined by how much is afforded by budget which is usually at or near the 4% fixed rate. If fixed rates increase then it would be expected that the cap would increase as well.   This allows the owner the security of knowing that the $100,000 is safe but rather than receiving the sure 4% they can receive up to 8%. Historically since 1950, an 8% cap on the S&P 500 has resulted in an average interest credit of 5.2%, very similar to what is considered the ""risk free rate of return"" delivered by T-bills, 5.1% over a similar period. The return may also be adjusted by other factors such as the participation rate and market value adjustments to cover bring the cost of the option into the budget available.   This means the owner of the indexed annuity now has assumed more risk than a fixed annuity but less than being in the equity markets themselves. The result is that the expected yield (risk adjusted) for an indexed annuity is higher than a fixed annuity, CD, etc. However, the expected yield of being in the market is higher for several reasons.   The principal (in our example the $100,000) is at risk of loss when owning the index outright. It should be noted that Equity Index Annuity does not participate in dividends as owning the index outright would and similar there are no ongoing transaction expenses or fees. Interest is compounded as frequently as when interest is credited and this is almost always annually but contracts are available that credit interest over a 5 year term.   The taxation of the gains in an indexed annuity are identical to that of fixed annuities. Taxes are deferred until monies are received and then interest is withdrawn first and taxed as ordinary income.   Understanding Options   This way of linking to an equity index like the S&P 500 or Dow Jones is accomplished through an option, usually a call option. A call option is the right but not the obligation to purchase something at a future date for a specified price.   The naming conventions for options used by the insurance industry is different than that of Wall Street but the options are structurally identical. Here's a sample of options commonly seen in indexed annuities.     Insurance  vs.  Wall Street   Point-to-Point vs. European   Monthly Average vs.Asian   Monthly Point-to_Point vs. Cliquet   Performance Triggered vs. Binary     The options in indexed annuities can usually be fit into the following taxonomy developed by the National Association of Fixed Annuities.   Term  - the length of time before option matures, usually one year. Two, three, four, and ten are also prevalent in the market. Some longer term options are but have a ""highwater"" feature that allows interest to be credited more frequently. An example of this would be a ten year Monthly Average option that credits interest each year if there is a gain.   Index  - the equity, stock, bond, or other index to which the interest credit is linked.   Gain Formula  - the method used to determine the gain in the index. Point to point, monthly averaging, daily averaging are the most common methods of calculating the gain. For example of the S&P 500 index starts at 1120 and ends at 1300 then the point to point gain is 16.07%.   Adjustment Method  - the way the option is limited in order to reduce the cost (and subsequent return) so that it becomes affordable. As an example the point to point option may cost 7% of the account value but will be ""adjusted"" to reduce the cost.   ""Market Value Adjustment"" - the company may reserve the right to adjust the value of your account based on current market conditions. This adjustment is most often applied to distributions, partial or complete withdrawals, and exchanges to other accounts.   The most common adjustments are: cap, fee, participation rate or a combination of the three. Other adjustments are less common. In keeping with the preceding example and allowing for an 8% cap as the adjustment the policyholder would not receive the 16.07% point to point gain but rather 8% as an interest credit.   Should provide examples for: P2P with Participation Rate Monthly Averaging with Cap Monthly Averaging with Fee   Should also link to the Withdrawal Benefits provided in variable annuities and indexed annuties at this point. These concepts were added because of the risk associated with the accumulation in both variable annuities and indexed annuities.

This association helps the various insurance departments to coordinate insurance     laws for the benefit of all consumers.       This guide does not endorse any company or policy.       Reprinted by the Illinois Division of Insurance       This Guide has been written to help you understand annuities in general and equity-indexed annuities in particular. There are different kinds of annuities. It is important for you to     understand the differences among various annuities so you can choose the kind that best fits your needs. At the end of this Guide are questions you should ask your agent or the company. Make sure     you are satisfied with the answers before you make a purchase.       WHAT IS AN ANNUITY?       An annuity is a series of income payments made at regular intervals by an insurance company in return for a premium or premiums you have paid. The most frequent use of income payments from an     annuity is for retirement.       An annuity is neither a life insurance nor a health insurance policy. It is not a savings account or a savings certificate. You should not buy an annuity for short-term purposes.       WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF ANNUITY CONTRACTS?       Individual or Group       An individual contract covers only one or two persons. A group contract covers a specific group of people, for example, the employees of an employer.       Immediate or Deferred       An immediate annuity begins to make income payments soon after you pay the premium. The income payments from a deferred annuity start later, often many years later. Deferred annuities have an     ""accumulation"" period, which is the time between when you start paying premiums and when income payments start. The time after income payments start is called the ""payout"" period.       Single Premium or Installment Premium       You pay the insurance company only one premium for a single premium annuity. You pay for an installment premium annuity through a series of payments. There are two kinds of installment premium     annuities. One kind is a flexible premium contract. You can pay as much as you want, whenever you want, within set limits. The other kind is a scheduled premium contract, which specifies how much     your premiums will be and how often you will pay them.       Fixed or Variable       During the accumulation period of a fixed deferred annuity, premiums (less any applicable charges) earn interest at rates set by the company or in a way spelled out in the annuity contract.     The company guarantees that it will pay no less than a minimum rate of interest. During the payout phase, the amount of each income payment you receive is generally set when the payments start     and does not change.       During the accumulation period of a variable annuity, premiums (less any applicable charges) are put into a separate account of the insurance company. You decide how those premiums will be     invested, from stock or bond mutual fund choices. The value of the separate account, and therefore, the value of your variable annuity, varies with the investment experience of the funds you     choose. There is no guarantee that you will receive all of your premiums back. There is also no guarantee that you will earn any return on your annuity. During the payout period of a variable     annuity, the amount of each income payment you receive may be fixed (predetermined) or variable (changing with the value of the investments in the separate account).       WHAT ARE EQUITY-INDEXED ANNUITIES?       An equity-indexed annuity is a fixed annuity, either immediate or deferred, that earns interest or provides benefits that are linked to an external equity reference or an equity index. The     value of the index might be tied to a stock or other equity index. One of the most commonly used indices is Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index (the S&P 500), which is an     equity index. The value of any index varies from day to day and is not predictable.       When you buy an equity-indexed annuity you own an insurance contract. You are not buying shares of any stock of index.       While immediate equity-indexed annuities may be available, this Buyer's Guide will focus on deferred equity-indexed annuities.       HOW ARE THEY DIFFERENT FROM OTHER FIXED ANNUITIES?       An equity-indexed annuity is different from other fixed annuities because of the way it credits interest to your annuity's value. Some fixed annuities only credit interest calculated at a rate     set in the contract. Other fixed annuities also credit interest at rates set from time to time by the insurance company. Equity-indexed annuities credit interest using a formula based on changes     in the index to which the annuity is linked. The formula decides how the additional interest, if any, is calculated and credited. How much additional interest you get and when you get it depends     on the features of your particular annuity.       Your equity-indexed annuity, like other fixed annuities, also promises to pay a minimum interest rate. The rate that will be applied will not be less than this minimum guaranteed rate even if     the index-linked interest rate is lower. The value of your annuity also will not drop below a guaranteed minimum. For example, many single premium annuity contracts guarantee the minimum value     will never be less than 90 percent of the premium paid, plus at least 3% in annual interest (less any partial withdrawals). The guaranteed value is the minimum amount available during a term for     withdrawals, as well as for some annuitizations (see ""Annuity Income Payments"") and death benefits. The insurance company will adjust the value of the annuity at the end of each term to reflect     any index increases.       WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CONTRACT FEATURES?       Two features that have the greatest effect on the amount of additional interest that may be credited to an equity-indexed annuity are the indexing method and the participation rate. It is     important to understand the features and how they work together. The following describes some other equity-indexed annuity features that affect the index-linked formula.       Since new equity indexed annuity products are being developed, the contract you are interested in may contain a feature that is not discussed in this Buyer's Guide. If this is the case, ask     your agent for an explanation that you understand.       Indexing Method       The indexing method means the approach used to measure the amount of change, if any, in the index. Some of the most common indexing methods, which are explained more fully later on, include     annual reset (ratcheting), high-water mark and point-to-point.       Term       The index term is the period over which index-linked interest is calculated. In most product designs, interest is credited to your annuity at the end of a term. Terms are generally from one to     ten years, with six or seven years being most common. Some annuities offer single terms while others offer multiple, consecutive terms. If your annuity has multiple terms, there will usually be a     window at the end of each term, typically 30 days, during which you may withdraw your money without penalty. For installment premium annuities, the payment of each premium may begin a new term     for that premium.       Participation Rate       The participation rate decides how much of the increase in the index will be used to calculate index-linked interest. For example, if the calculated change in the index is 9% and the     participation rate is 70%, the index-linked interest rate for your annuity will be 6.3% (9% x 70% = 6.3%). A company may set a different participation rate for newly issued annuities as often as     each day. Therefore, the initial participation rate in your annuity will depend on when it is issued by the company. The company usually guarantees the participation rate for a specific period     (from one year to the entire term). When that period is over, the company sets a new participation rate for the next period. Some annuities guarantee that the participation rate will never be set     lower than a specified minimum or higher than a specified maximum.       Cap Rate or Cap       Some annuities may put an upper limit, or cap, on the index-linked interest rate. This is the maximum rate of interest the annuity will earn. In the example given above, if the contract has a     6% cap rate, 6%, and not 6.3%, would be credited. Not all annuities have a cap rate.       Floor on Equity Index-Linked Interest       The floor is the minimum index-linked interest rate you will earn. The most common floor is 0%. A 0% floor assures that even if the index decreases in value, the index-linked interest that you     earn will be zero and not negative. As in the case of a cap, not all annuities have a stated floor on index-linked interest rates. But in all cases, your fixed annuity will have a minimum     guaranteed value.       Averaging       In some annuities, the average of an index's value is used rather than the actual value of the index on a specified date. The index averaging may occur at the beginning, the end, or throughout     the entire term of the annuity.       Interest Compounding       Some annuities pay simple interest during an index term. That means index-linked interest is added to your original premium amount but does not compound during the term. Others pay compound     interest during a term, which means that index-linked interest that has already been credited also earns interest in the future. In either case, however, the interest earned in one term is     usually compounded in the next.       Margin/Spread/Administrative Fee       In some annuities, the index-linked interest rate is computed by subtracting a specific percentage from any calculated change in the index. This percentage, sometimes referred to as the     ""margin,"" ""spread,"" or ""administrative fee,"" might be instead of, or in addition to, a participation rate. For example, if the calculated change in the index is 10%, your annuity might specify     that 2.25% will be subtracted from the rate to determine the interest rate credited. In this example, the rate would be 7.75% (10% - 2.25% = 7.75%). In this example, the company subtracts the     percentage only if the change in the index produces a positive interest rate.       Vesting       Some annuities credit none of the index-linked interest or only part of it, if you take out all your money before the end of the term. The percentage that is vested, or credited, generally     increases as the term comes closer to its end and is always 100% at the end of the term.       HOW DO THE COMMON INDEXING METHODS DIFFER?       Annual Reset       Index-linked interest, if any, is determined each year by comparing the index value at the end of the contract year with the index value at the start of the contract year. Interest is added to     your annuity each year during the term.       High-Water Mark       The index-linked interest, if any, is decided by looking at the index value at various points during the term, usually the annual anniversaries of the date you bought the annuity. The interest     is based on the difference between the highest index value and the index value at the start of the term. Interest is added to your annuity at the end of the term.       Point-to-Point       The index-linked interest, if any, is based on the  difference  between the index value at the end of the term and the index value at the start of the term. Interest is added to your     annuity at the end of the term.       WHAT ARE SOME OF THE FEATURES AND TRADE-OFFS OF DIFFERENT INDEXING METHODS?       Generally, annuities offer  preset  combinations of features. You may have to make trade-offs to get features you want in an annuity. This means the annuity you choose may also have     features you don't want.                                                             Features           Trade-Offs                           Annual Reset                                       Since the interest earned is ""locked in"" annually and the index value is ""reset"" at the end of each year, future decreases in the index will not affect the interest you have already         earned. Therefore, your annuity using the annual reset method may credit more interest than annuities using other methods when the index fluctuates up and down often during the term. This         design is more likely than others to give you access to index-linked interest before the term ends.           Your annuity's participation rate may change each year and generally will be lower than that of other indexing methods. Also an annual reset design may use a cap or averaging to limit the         total amount of interest you might earn each year.                           High-Water Mark                                       Since interest is calculated using the highest value of the index on a contract anniversary during the term, this design may credit higher interest than some other designs if the index         reaches a high point early or in the middle of the term, then drops off at the end of the term.           Interest is not credited until the end of the term. In some annuities, if you surrender your annuity before the end of the term, you may not get index-linked interest for that term. In         other annuities, you may receive index-linked interest, based on the highest anniversary value to date and the annuity's vesting schedule. Also, contracts with this design may have a lower         participation rate than annuities using other designs or may use a cap to limit the total amount of interest you might earn.                           Point-to-Point                                       Since interest cannot be calculated before the end of the term, use of this design may permit a higher participation rate than annuities using other designs.           Since interest is not credited until the end of the term, typically six or seven years, you may not be able to get the index-linked interest until the end of the term.                                 WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF SOME OTHER PRODUCT FEATURES?       Cap on Interest Earned       While a cap limits the amount of interest you might earn each year, annuities with this feature may have other product features you want, such as annual interest crediting or the ability to     take partial withdrawals. Also, annuities that have a cap may have a higher participation rate.       Averaging       Averaging at the beginning of a term protects you from buying your annuity at a high point, which would reduce the amount of interest you might earn. Averaging at the end of the term protects     you against severe declines in the index and losing index-linked interest as a result. On the other hand, averaging may reduce the amount of index-linked interest you earn when the index rises     either near the start or at the end of the term.       Participation Rate       The participation rate may vary greatly from one annuity to another and from time to time within a particular annuity. Therefore, it is important for you to know how your annuity's     participation rate works with the indexing method. A high participation rate may be offset by other features, such as simple interest, averaging, or a point-to-point indexing method. On the other     hand, an insurance company may offset a lower participation rate by also offering a feature such as an annual reset indexing method.       Interest Compounding       It is important for you to know whether your annuity pays compound or simple interest during a term. While you may earn less from an annuity that pays simple interest, it may have other     features you want, such as a higher participation rate.       If there is a product feature that you do not understand, ask your agent. If you still do not understand, send the company a letter telling them that you want a written response so you can     study their reply. You will be doing yourself a service!       CAN I TAKE MY MONEY OUT DURING THE TERM?       In most cases, you can take all or part of the money out of a deferred annuity at any time during the term. There may be a cost if you do. Sometimes the cost is a stated dollar amount. In     other cases, you give up index-linked interest on the amount withdrawn. Some annuities do not let you make a partial withdrawal until the end of a term.       WHAT WILL IT COST ME TO TAKE MY MONEY OUT EARLY?       If you withdraw all or part of the value in your annuity before the end of the term, a  withdrawal or surrender charge  may be applied. A withdrawal charge is usually a percentage of the     amount being withdrawn. The percentage may be reduced or eliminated after the annuity has been in force for a certain number of years. Sometimes the charge is a reduction in the interest rate     credited to the annuity.       Some annuities credit none of the index-linked interest or only part of it if you take out all your money before the end of the term. The percentage that is vested, or credited, generally     increases as the term comes closer to its end and is always 100% at the end of the term.       IS THERE ALWAYS A CHARGE TO TAKE MY MONEY OUT EARLY?       Your annuity may have a limited ""free withdrawal"" provision. This lets you make one or more withdrawals without charge each year. The size of the free withdrawal is limited to a set percentage     of your annuity's guaranteed or accumulated value. If you make a larger withdrawal, you may pay withdrawal charges. You may also lose index-linked interest on amounts you withdraw.       Most annuities waive withdrawal charges on withdrawals made within a set number of days at the end of each term. Some annuities waive withdrawal charges if you are confined to a nursing home     or diagnosed with a terminal illness. You may, however, lose index-linked interest on withdrawals.       ARE DIVIDENDS INCLUDED IN THE INDEX?       Depending on the index used, stock dividends may or may not be included in the index's value. For example, the S&P 500 is a stock price index and only considers the prices of stocks. It     does not recognize any dividends paid on those stocks.       WHAT ARE SOME OTHER EQUITY-INDEXED ANNUITY CONTRACT BENEFITS?       Annuity Income Payments       One of the most important benefits of deferred annuities is the right to use the value built up during the accumulation period to provide income payments during the payout period. While income     payments are usually made monthly, you can often choose more or less frequent payments. The size of income payments is based on both the accumulated value in your annuity and the annuity's     ""benefit rate"" that is in effect when income payments begin.       The insurance company uses the benefits rate to compute the amount of income payment it will pay you for each $1,000 of accumulated value in your annuity. The benefit rate usually depends on     your age and sex, and the form of annuity payment you have chosen. You can usually choose from many forms of annuity payments. You might choose payments that continue as long as you live, or as     long as either you or your spouse live, or payments that continue for a set number of years.       Death Benefit       Annuities provide a variety of death benefits. The most common death benefit is either the guaranteed minimum value or the value determined by the index-linked formula.       Tax Deferral       Federal income tax on interest accumulated in an annuity is deferred until you take the interest out of the annuity. You may be required to pay taxes then on the tax-deferred accumulation. You     may have to pay a tax penalty if you withdraw the accumulation before you are age 59½. The advantage of tax deferral is that you will probably be in a lower tax bracket in retirement than     while you are employed. Also, during the accumulation period, you will be earning interest on money that you would otherwise have used to pay taxes. Tax-qualified annuities are subject to     different rules. In any case, you should consult your own tax advisor.       HOW DO I KNOW IF AN EQUITY-INDEXED ANNUITY IS RIGHT FOR ME?       The questions listed below may help you decide which type of annuity, if any, meets your retirement planning and financial needs. You should consider what your goals are for the money you may     put into the annuity. You need to think about how much risk you're willing to take with the money. Ask yourself:               How long can I leave my money in the annuity?         What do I expect to use the money for in the future?         Am I interested in a variable annuity with the potential for higher earnings that are not guaranteed and willing to risk losing the principal?         Is a guaranteed interest rate more important to me, with little or no risk of losing the principal?         Or, am I somewhere in between these two extremes and willing to take some risks?             HOW DO I KNOW WHICH EQUITY-INDEXED ANNUITY IS BEST FOR ME?       As with any other insurance product, you must carefully consider your own personal situation and how you feel about the choices available. No single annuity design may have all the features     you want. It is important to understand the features and trade-offs available so you can choose the annuity that is right for you. Keep in mind that it may be misleading to compare one annuity to     another unless you compare all the other features of each annuity. You must decide for yourself what combination of features makes the most sense for you. Also, remember that it is not possible     to predict the future market behavior of an index.       QUESTIONS YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR AGENT OR THE COMPANY               What is the guaranteed minimum interest rate?         What charges, if any, are deducted from my premium?         What charges, if any, are deducted from my contract value?         How long is the term?         What is the participation rate?         For how long is the participation rate guaranteed?         Is there a minimum participation rate?         Does my contract have a cap?         Is averaging used? How does it work?         Is interest compounded during a term?         Is there a margin, spread, or administrative fee? Is that in addition to or instead of a participation rate?         Which indexing method is used in my contract?         What are the surrender charges or penalties if I want to end my contract early and take out all of my money?         Can I get a partial withdrawal without paying charges or losing interest? Does my contract have vesting?         Does my annuity waive withdrawal charges if I am confined to a nursing home or diagnosed with a terminal illness?         What annuity income payment options do I have?         What is the death benefit?             FINAL POINTS TO CONSIDER       It is very important that you choose an annuity that you understand well. The purpose of this Buyer's Guide is to help you to understand your annuity. Your agent or insurance company can guide     you. Remember that the quality of service you can expect from the company and the agent should also be important to you when you buy an annuity.       When you receive your contract, read it carefully. It may offer a ""free look"" period for you to decide if you want to keep the contract. Ask your agent or insurance company for an explanation     of anything you don't understand. If you have a specific complaint or can't get the answers you need from your agent or company, contact your state insurance department.                        Copyright ©2009  DOI                 Contact Us   |  Privacy/Disclaimer  |  Illinois Privacy Information   |  Kids Privacy   |  Web Accessibility                 "

The FCRA promotes the accuracy and privacy of information in the files of the nation’s consumer reporting companies. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the nation’s consumer protection agency, enforces the FCRA with respect to consumer reporting companies.             A credit report includes information on where you live, how you pay your bills, and whether you’ve been sued or arrested, or have filed for bankruptcy. Nationwide consumer reporting companies sell the information in your report to creditors, insurers, employers, and other businesses that use it to evaluate your applications for credit, insurance, employment, or renting a home.             Here are the details about your rights under the FCRA and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions (FACT) Act, which established the free annual credit report program.            Q: How do I order my free report?             A:  The three nationwide consumer reporting companies have set up a central website, a toll-free telephone number, and a mailing address through which you can order your free annual report.            To order, visit  annualcreditreport.com , call            1-877-322-8228, or complete the Annual Credit Report Request Form and mail it to: Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. The form is on the back of this brochure; or you can print it from           ftc.gov/credit . Do not contact the three nationwide consumer reporting companies individually. They are providing free annual credit reports only through  annualcreditreport.com , 1-877-322-8228, and Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281.            You may order your reports from each of the three nationwide consumer reporting companies at the same time, or you can order your report from each of the companies one at a time. The law allows you to order one free copy of your report from each of the nationwide consumer reporting companies every 12 months.            A Warning About “Imposter” Websites             Only one website is authorized to fill orders for the free annual credit report you are entitled to under law —  annualcreditreport.com. Other websites that claim to offer “free credit reports,” “free credit scores,” or “free credit monitoring” are not part of the legally mandated free annual credit report program. In some cases, the “free” product comes with strings attached. For example, some sites sign you up for a supposedly “free” service that converts to one you have to pay for after a trial period. If you don’t cancel during the trial period, you may be unwittingly agreeing to let the company start charging fees to your credit card.            Some “imposter” sites use terms like “free report” in their names; others have URLs that purposely misspell annualcreditreport.com in the hope that you will mistype the name of the official site. Some of these “imposter” sites direct you to other sites that try to sell you something or collect your personal information.            Annualcreditreport.com and the nationwide consumer reporting companies will not send you an email asking for your personal information. If you get an email, see a pop-up ad, or get a phone call from someone claiming to be from annualcreditreport.com or any of the three nationwide consumer reporting companies, do not reply or click on any link in the message. It’s probably a scam. Forward any such email to the FTC at  spam@uce.gov .             Q: What information do I need to provide to get my free report?             A:  You need to provide your name, address, Social Security number, and date of birth. If you have moved in the last two years, you may have to provide your previous address. To maintain the security of your file, each nationwide consumer reporting company may ask you for some information that only you would know, like the amount of your monthly mortgage payment. Each company may ask you for different information because the information each has in your file may come from different sources.            Q: Why do I want a copy of my credit report?             A:  Your credit report has information that affects whether you can get a loan — and how much you will have to pay to borrow money. You want a copy of your credit report to:                          make sure the information is accurate, complete, and up-to-date before you apply for a loan for a major purchase like a house or car, buy insurance, or apply for a job.              help guard against identity theft. That’s when someone uses your personal information — like your name, your Social Security number, or your credit card number — to commit fraud. Identity thieves may use your information to open a new credit card account in your name. Then, when they don’t pay the bills, the delinquent account is reported on your credit report. Inaccurate information like that could affect your ability to get credit, insurance, or even a job.            Q: How long does it take to get my report after I order it?              A:  If you request your report online at annualcreditreport.com, you should be able to access it immediately. If you order your report by calling toll-free 1-877-322-8228, your report will be processed and mailed to you within 15 days. If you order your report by mail using the Annual Credit Report Request Form, your request will be processed and mailed to you within 15 days of receipt.            Whether you order your report online, by phone, or by mail, it may take longer to receive your report if the nationwide consumer reporting company needs more information to verify your identity.             There also may be times when the nationwide consumer reporting companies receive a high volume of requests for credit reports. If that happens, you may be asked to re-submit your request. Or, you may be told that your report will be mailed to you sometime after 15 days from your request. If either of these events occurs, the nationwide consumer reporting companies will let you know.            Q: Are there any other situations where I might be eligible for a free report?             A:  Under federal law, you’re entitled to a free report if a company takes adverse action against you, such as denying your application for credit, insurance, or employment, and you ask for your report within 60 days of receiving notice of the action. The notice will give you the name, address, and phone number of the consumer reporting company. You’re also entitled to one free report a year if you’re unemployed and plan to look for a job within 60 days; if you’re on welfare; or if your report is inaccurate because of fraud, including identity theft. Otherwise, a consumer reporting company may charge you up to $10.50 for another copy of your report within a           12-month period.            To buy a copy of your report, contact:                         Equifax:1-800-685-1111;  equifax.com              Experian: 1-888-397-3742;  experian.com              TransUnion: 1-800-916-8800;  transunion.com                     Under state law, consumers in Colorado, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Vermont already have free access to their credit reports.                     Q: Should I order a report from each of the three nationwide consumer reporting companies?              A:  It’s up to you. Because nationwide consumer reporting companies get their information from different sources, the information in your report from one company may not reflect all, or the same, information in your reports from the other two companies. That’s not to say that the information in any of your reports is necessarily inaccurate; it just may be different.            Q: Should I order my reports from all three of the nationwide consumer reporting companies at the same time?             A:  You may order one, two, or all three reports at the same time, or you may stagger your requests. It’s your choice. Some financial advisors say staggering your requests during a 12-month period may be a good way to keep an eye on the accuracy and completeness of the information in your reports.            Q:  What if I find errors — either inaccuracies or incomplete information — in my credit report?             A:  Under the FCRA, both the consumer report­ing company and the information provider (that is, the person, company, or organization that provides information about you to a consumer reporting company) are responsible for correcting inaccurate or incomplete information in your report. To take full advantage of your rights under this law, contact the consumer reporting company and the information provider.                       Tell the consumer reporting company, in writing, what information you think is inaccurate.              Consumer reporting companies must investigate the items in question — usually within 30 days — unless they consider your dispute frivolous. They also must forward all the relevant data you provide about the inaccuracy to the organization that provided the information. After the information provider receives notice of a dispute from the consumer reporting company, it must investigate, review the relevant information, and report the results back to the consumer reporting company. If the information provider finds the disputed information is inaccurate, it must notify all three nationwide consumer reporting companies so they can correct the information in your file.              When the investigation is complete, the consumer reporting company must give you the written results and a free copy of your report if the dispute results in a change. (This free report does not count as your annual free report under the FACT Act.) If an item is changed or deleted, the consumer reporting company cannot put the disputed information back in your file unless the information provider verifies that it is accurate and complete. The consumer reporting company also must send you written notice that includes the name, address, and phone number of the information provider.               Tell the creditor or other information provider in writing that you dispute an item. Many providers specify an address for disputes. If the provider reports the item to a consumer reporting company, it must include a notice of your dispute. And if you are correct — that is, if the information is found to be inaccurate — the information provider may not report it again.            Q: What can I do if the consumer reporting company or information provider won’t correct the information I dispute?             A:  If an investigation doesn’t resolve your dispute with the consumer reporting company, you can ask that a statement of the dispute be included in your file and in future reports. You also can ask the consumer reporting company to provide your state­ment to anyone who received a copy of your report in the recent past. You can expect to pay a fee for this service.            If you tell the information provider that you dispute an item, a notice of your dispute must be included any time the information provider reports the item to a consumer reporting company.             Q:  How long can a consumer reporting company report negative information?             A:  A consumer reporting company can report most accurate negative information for seven years and bankruptcy information for 10 years. There is no time limit on reporting information about crimi­nal convictions; information reported in response to your application for a job that pays more than $75,000 a year; and information reported because you’ve applied for more than $150,000 worth of credit or life insurance. Information about a lawsuit or an unpaid judgment against you can be reported for seven years or until the statute of limitations runs out, which­ever is longer.            Q:  Can anyone else can get a copy of my credit report?             A:  The FCRA specifies who can access your credit report. Creditors, insurers, employers, and other businesses that use the information in your report to evaluate your applications for credit, insurance, em­ployment, or renting a home are among those that have a legal right to access your report.             Q:  Can my employer get my credit report?             A:  Your employer can get a copy of your credit report only if you agree. A consumer reporting company may not provide information about you to your employer, or to a prospective employer, without your written consent.

This file is known as your credit report. It is chock  full of information on where you live, how you pay your bills, and whether  you've been sued or arrested, or have filed for bankruptcy. Consumer reporting  companies sell the information in your report to creditors, insurers, employers,  and other businesses with a legitimate need for it. They use the information to  evaluate your applications for credit, insurance, employment, or a lease.           Having a good credit report means it will be easier for you to get loans and  lower interest rates. Lower interest rates usually translate into smaller  monthly payments.           Nevertheless, newspapers, radio, TV, and the Internet are filled with ads for  companies and services that promise to erase accurate negative information in  your credit report in exchange for a fee. The scam artists who run these ads not  only don't deliver — they can't deliver. Only time, a deliberate effort, and a  plan to repay your bills will improve your credit as it's detailed in your  credit report.           The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the nation's consumer protection agency,  has written this booklet to help explain how to build a better credit report. It  has six sections:           Section 1 : Explains your rights under  the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act.            Section 2 : Tells how you can  legally improve your credit report.            Section 3 : Offers tips on dealing  with debt.            Section 4 : Cautions about  credit-related scams and how to avoid them.            Section 5 : Offers information  about identity theft.            Section 6 : Lists resources for  additional information.                            The Fair Credit Reporting  Act                 The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) promotes the accuracy, fairness, and  privacy of information in the files of the nation's consumer reporting  companies. The FTC enforces the FCRA with respect to these  companies. Recent amendments to the FCRA expand consumer rights and place  additional requirements on consumer reporting companies. Businesses that provide  information about consumers to consumer reporting companies and businesses that  use credit reports also have new responsibilities under the law.                 Here are answers to some of the questions consumers have asked the FTC about consumer reports  and consumer reporting companies                           Q. Do I have a right to know what's in my  report?                  A. You have the right to know what's in your report, but you  have to ask for the information. The consumer reporting company must tell you  everything in your report, and give you a list of everyone who has requested  your report within the past year — or the past two years if the requests were  related to employment.                         Q. What type of information do consumer reporting  companies collect and sell?                  A. Consumer reporting companies collect  and sell four basic types of information:                                                                                                        Identification and employment information:  Your name, birth date, Social Security number, employer, and spouse's name are  noted routinely. The consumer reporting company also may provide information  about your employment history, home ownership, income, and previous address, if  a creditor asks.                               Payment history: Your accounts with different  creditors are listed, showing how much credit has been extended and whether  you've paid on time. Related events, such as the referral of an overdue account  to a collection agency, also may be noted.                         Inquiries: Consumer reporting companies must  maintain a record of all creditors who have asked for your credit history within  the past year, and a record of individuals or businesses that have asked for  your credit history for employment purposes for the past two years.                         Public record information: Events that are a  matter of public record, such as bankruptcies, foreclosures, or tax liens, may  appear in your report.                       Q. Is there a charge for my report?           A.  Under the Free File Disclosure Rule of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions  Act (FACT Act), each of the nationwide consumer reporting companies — Equifax,  Experian, and TransUnion — is required to provide you with a free copy of your  credit report once every 12 months, if you ask for it.                            Q: How do I order my free report?  A: The  three nationwide consumer reporting companies are using one website, one  toll-free telephone number, and one mailing address for consumers to order their  free annual report. To order, click on  annualcreditreport.com , call 1-877-322-8228, or complete  the  Annual Credit Report Request Form  and mail it to: Annual Credit Report  Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. The form is at the  back of this brochure; or you can print it from  ftc.gov/credit . Do not contact the three nationwide consumer  reporting companies individually. You may order your free annual reports from  each of the consumer reporting companies at the same time, or you can order them one at a time. The law allows you to order one free copy from each of the  nationwide consumer reporting companies every 12 months.                            Q: What information do I have to provide to get my  free report?  A: You need to provide your name, address, Social  Security number, and date of birth. If you have moved in the last two years, you  may have to provide your previous address. To maintain the security of your  file, each nationwide consumer reporting company may ask you for some  information that only you would know, like the amount of your monthly mortgage  payment. Each company may ask you for different information because the  information each has in your file may come from different sources.    Still,  annualcreditreport.com  is the only authorized online source for  your free annual credit report from the three nationwide consumer reporting  companies. Neither the website nor the companies will call you first to ask for  personal information or send you an email asking for personal information. If  you get a phone call or an email — or see a pop-up ad — claiming it's from  annualcreditreport.com  (or any of the three nationwide  consumer reporting companies), it's probably a scam. Don't reply or click on any  link in the message. Instead, forward any email that claims to be from   annualcreditreport.com  (or any of the three consumer reporting companies) to  spam@uce.gov , the FTC's  database of deceptive spam.            Q: Are there other situations where I might be  eligible for a free report?          A: Under federal law, you're entitled to a  free report if a company takes adverse action against you, such as denying your  application for credit, insurance, or employment, and you ask for your report  within 60 days of receiving notice of the action. The notice will give you the  name, address, and phone number of the consumer reporting company. You're also  entitled to one free report a year if you're unemployed and plan to look for a  job within 60 days; if you're on welfare; or if your report is inaccurate  because of fraud, including identity theft. Otherwise, any of the three consumer  reporting companies may charge you up to $10.50 for another copy of your report  within a 12-month period.            To buy a copy of your report, contact:                                                                       Equifax                        1-800-685-1111                         equifax.com                       Experian                        1-888-397-3742                         experian.com                       TransUnion                        1-800-916-8800                         transunion.com                                                           Under state law, consumers in Colorado, Georgia, Maine, Maryland,  Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Vermont already have free access to their credit  reports.           For more information, see Your Access to Free Credit  Reports at  ftc.gov/credit .                           Credit Scores                               Q. What is a  credit score, and how does it affect my ability to get credit?          A:  Credit scoring is a system creditors use to help determine whether to give you  credit, and how much to charge you for it.          Information about you and your credit experiences, like your bill-paying  history, the number and type of accounts you have, late payments, collection  actions, outstanding debt, and the age of your accounts, is collected from your  credit application and your credit report. Using a statistical formula,  creditors compare this information to the credit performance of consumers with  similar profiles. A credit scoring system awards points for each factor. A total  number of points — a credit score — helps predict how creditworthy you are; that  is, how likely it is that you will repay a loan and make the payments on time.  Generally, consumers who are good credit risks have higher credit scores.           You can get your credit score from the three nationwide consumer reporting  companies, but you will have to pay a fee for it. Many other companies also  offer credit scores for sale alone or as part of a package of products.           For more information, see Need Credit or Insurance? Your Credit Score Helps Determine What You’ll Pay at  ftc.gov/credit .                           Improving Your Credit Report                 Under the FCRA, both the consumer reporting company and the information  provider (the person, company, or organization that provides information about  you to a consumer reporting company) are responsible for correcting inaccurate  or incomplete information in your report. To take advantage of all your rights  under the FCRA, contact the consumer reporting company and the information  provider if you see inaccurate or incomplete information.           1. Tell the consumer reporting company, in writing, what information you  think is inaccurate. Include copies (NOT originals) of documents that support  your position. In addition to providing your complete name and address, your  letter should clearly identify each item in your report that you dispute, state  the facts and explain why you dispute the information, and request that the  information be deleted or corrected. You may want to enclose a copy of your  report with the items in question circled. Your letter may look something like  the one on page 8. Send your letter by certified mail, return receipt requested,  so you can document what the consumer reporting company received. Keep copies of  your dispute letter and enclosures.           Consumer reporting companies must investigate the items in question — usually  within 30 days — unless they consider your dispute frivolous. They also must  forward all the relevant data you provide about the inaccuracy to the  organization that provided the information. After the information provider  receives notice of a dispute from the consumer reporting company, it must  investigate, review the relevant information, and report the results back to the  consumer reporting company. If the information provider finds the disputed  information is inaccurate, it must notify all three nationwide consumer  reporting companies so they can correct the information in your file.           When the investigation is complete, the consumer reporting company must give  you the written results and a free copy of your report if the dispute results in  a change. (This free report does not count as your annual free report under the  FACT Act.) If an item is changed or deleted, the consumer reporting company  cannot put the disputed information back in your file unless the information  provider verifies that the information is, indeed, accurate and complete. The  consumer reporting company also must send you written notice that includes the  name, address, and phone number of the information provider.           If you request, the consumer reporting company must send notices of any  correction to anyone who received your report in the past six months. A  corrected copy of your report can be sent to anyone who received a copy during  the past two years for employment purposes.           If an investigation doesn't resolve your dispute with the consumer reporting  company, you can ask that a statement of the dispute be included in your file  and in future reports. You also can ask the consumer reporting company to  provide your statement to anyone who received a copy of your report in the  recent past. Expect to pay a fee for this service.           2. Tell the creditor or other information provider, in writing, that you  dispute an item. Be sure to include copies (NOT originals) of documents that  support your position. Many providers specify an address for disputes. If the  provider reports the item to a consumer reporting company, it must include a  notice of your dispute. And if you are correct  — that is, if the information is  found to be inaccurate  — the information provider may not report it  again.                     Sample Dispute Letter                                                                       Date                        Your Name                        Your Address                        Your City, State, Zip  Code                           Complaint Department                            Name of Company                            Address                            City,  State, Zip Code                         Dear Sir or Madam:                          I am writing to dispute the following  information in my file.

Sincerely,                          Your name                                                   Enclosures: (List what you are  enclosing)                                                                                     Accurate Negative Information                                   When  negative information in your report is accurate, only the passage of time can  assure its removal. A consumer reporting company can report most accurate  negative information for seven years and bankruptcy information for 10 years.  Information about an unpaid judgment against you can be reported for seven years  or until the statute of limitations runs out, whichever is longer. There is no  time limit on reporting information about criminal convictions; information  reported in response to your application for a job that pays more than $75,000 a  year; and information reported because you've applied for more than $150,000  worth of credit or life insurance. There is a standard method for calculating  the seven-year reporting period. Generally, the period runs from the date that  the event took place.                                  Adding Accounts to Your File                            Your  credit file may not reflect all your credit accounts. Most national department  store and all-purpose bank credit card accounts are included in your file, but  not all. Some local retailers, credit unions, and travel, entertainment, and gasoline  card companies are among those that usually aren't included.           If you've been told that you were denied credit because of an ""insufficient  credit file"" or ""no credit file"" and you have accounts with creditors that don't  appear in your credit file, ask the consumer reporting companies to add this  information to future reports. Although they are not required to do so, many  consumer reporting companies will add verifiable accounts for a fee. However, if  these creditors do not generally report to the consumer reporting company, the  added items will not be updated in your file.                           Dealing with Debt                 Having trouble paying your bills? Getting dunning notices from creditors? Are  your accounts being turned over to debt collectors? Are you worried about losing  your home or your car?           You're not alone. Many people face financial crises at some time in their  lives. Whether the crisis is caused by personal or family illness, the loss of a  job, or simple overspending, it can seem overwhelming. But often, it can be  overcome. The fact is that your financial situation doesn't have to go from bad  to worse.           If you or someone you know is in financial hot water, consider these options:  realistic budgeting, credit counseling from a reputable organization, debt  consolidation, or bankruptcy. How do you know which will work best for you? It  depends on your level of debt, your level of discipline, and your prospects for  the future.                      Self-Help                      Developing a Budget            The first step toward taking  control of your financial situation is to do a realistic assessment of how much  money you take in and how much money you spend. Start by listing your income  from all sources. Then, list your ""fixed"" expenses — those that are the same  each month — like mortgage payments or rent, car payments, and insurance  premiums. Next, list the expenses that vary — like entertainment, recreation,  and clothing. Writing down all your expenses, even those that seem  insignificant, is a helpful way to track your spending patterns, identify  necessary expenses, and prioritize the rest. The goal is to make sure you can  make ends meet on the basics: housing, food, health care, insurance, and  education.           Your public library and bookstores have information about budgeting and money  management techniques. In addition, computer software programs can be useful  tools for developing and maintaining a budget, balancing your checkbook, and  creating plans to save money and pay down your debt.           Contacting Your Creditors             Contact your  creditors immediately if you're having trouble making ends meet. Tell them why  it's difficult for you, and try to work out a modified payment plan that reduces  your payments to a more manageable level. Don't wait until your accounts have  been turned over to a debt collector. At that point, your creditors have given  up on you.                       Dealing with Debt Collectors             The Fair Debt  Collection Practices Act is the federal law that dictates how and when a debt  collector may contact you. A debt collector may not call you before 8 a.m.,  after 9 p.m., or while you're at work if the collector knows that your employer  doesn't approve of the calls. Collectors may not harass you, lie, or use unfair  practices when they try to collect a debt. And they must honor a written request  from you to stop further contact.            Credit Counseling             If you're not disciplined  enough to create a workable budget and stick to it, can't work out a repayment  plan with your creditors, or can't keep track of mounting bills, consider  contacting a credit counseling organization. Many credit counseling  organizations are nonprofit and work with you to solve your financial problems.  But be aware that just because an organization says it's ""nonprofit,"" there's no  guarantee that its services are free, affordable, or even legitimate. In fact,  some credit counseling organizations charge high fees, which may be hidden, or  pressure consumers to make large ""voluntary"" contributions that can cause more  debt.           Most credit counselors offer services through local offices, the Internet, or  on the telephone. If possible, find an organization that offers in-person  counseling. Many universities, military bases, credit unions, housing  authorities, and branches of the U.S. Cooperative Extension Service operate  nonprofit credit counseling programs. Your financial institution, local consumer  protection agency, and friends and family also may be good sources of  information and referrals.           Reputable credit counseling organizations can advise you on managing your  money and debts, help you develop a budget, and offer free educational materials  and workshops. Their counselors are certified and trained in the areas of  consumer credit, money and debt management, and budgeting. Counselors discuss  your entire financial situation with you, and help you develop a personalized  plan to solve your money problems. An initial counseling session typically lasts  an hour, with an offer of follow-up sessions.           Auto and Home Loans             Your debts can be  secured or unsecured. Secured debts usually are tied to an asset, like your car  for a car loan, or your house for a mortgage. If you stop making payments,  lenders can repossess your car or foreclose on your house. Unsecured debts are  not tied to any asset, and include most credit card debt, bills for medical  care, signature loans, and debts for other types of services.           Most automobile financing agreements allow a creditor to repossess your car  any time you're in default. No notice is required. If your car is repossessed,  you may have to pay the balance due on the loan, as well as towing and storage  costs, to get it back. If you can't do this, the creditor may sell the car. If  you see default approaching, you may be better off selling the car yourself and  paying off the debt: You'll avoid the added costs of repossession and a negative  entry on your credit report.           If you fall behind on your mortgage, contact your lender immediately to avoid  foreclosure. Most lenders are willing to work with you if they believe you're  acting in good faith and the situation is temporary. Some lenders may reduce or  suspend your payments for a short time. When you resume regular payments,  though, you may have to pay an additional amount toward the past due total.  Other lenders may agree to change the terms of the mortgage by extending the  repayment period to reduce the monthly debt. Ask whether additional fees would  be assessed for these changes, and calculate how much they total in the long  term.           If you and your lender cannot work out a plan, contact a housing counseling  agency. Some agencies limit their counseling services to homeowners with FHA  mortgages, but many offer free help to any homeowner who's having trouble making  mortgage payments. Call the local office of the Department of Housing and Urban  Development or the housing authority in your state, city, or county for help in  finding a legitimate housing counseling agency near you.                   Debt Consolidation                        You may be able to  lower your cost of credit by consolidating your debt through a second mortgage  or a home equity line of credit. Remember that these loans require you to put up  your home as collateral. If you can't make the payments — or if your payments  are late — you could lose your home.          What's more, the costs of consolidation loans can add up. In addition to  interest on the loans, you may have to pay ""points,"" with one point equal to one  percent of the amount you borrow. Still, these loans may provide certain tax  advantages that are not available with other kinds of credit.                   Bankruptcy           Personal bankruptcy  generally is considered the debt management option of last resort because the  results are long-lasting and far-reaching. A bankruptcy stays on your credit  report for 10 years, and can make it difficult to obtain credit, buy a home, get  life insurance, or sometimes get a job. Still, it is a legal procedure that  offers a fresh start for people who can't satisfy their debts. People who follow  the bankruptcy rules receive a discharge — a court order that says they don't  have to repay certain debts.           The consequences of bankruptcy are significant and require careful  consideration. Other factors to think about: Effective October 2005, Congress  made sweeping changes to the bankruptcy laws. The net effect of these changes is  to give consumers more incentive to seek bankruptcy relief under Chapter 13  rather than Chapter 7. Chapter 13 allows you, if you have a steady income, to  keep property, such as a mortgaged house or car, that you might otherwise lose.  In Chapter 13, the court approves a repayment plan that allows you to use your  future income to pay off your debts during a three-to-five-year period, rather  than surrender any property. After you have made all the payments under the  plan, you receive a discharge of your debts.           Chapter 7, known as straight bankruptcy, involves the sale of all assets that  are not exempt. Exempt property may include cars, work-related tools, and basic  household furnishings. Some of your property may be sold by a court-appointed  official — a trustee — or turned over to your creditors. The new bankruptcy laws  have changed the time period during which you can receive a discharge through  Chapter 7. You now must wait eight years after receiving a discharge in Chapter  7 before you can file again under that chapter. The Chapter 13 waiting period is  much shorter and can be as little as two years between filings.           Both types of bankruptcy may get rid of unsecured debts and stop  foreclosures, repossessions, garnishments, utility shut-offs, and debt  collection activities. Both also provide exemptions that allow you to keep  certain assets, although exemption amounts vary by state. Personal bankruptcy  usually does not erase child support, alimony, fines, taxes, and some student  loan obligations. Also, unless you have an acceptable plan to catch up on your  debt under Chapter 13, bankruptcy usually does not allow you to keep property  when your creditor has an unpaid mortgage or security lien on it.            Another major change to the bankruptcy laws involves certain hurdles that you  must clear before even filing for bankruptcy, no matter what the chapter. You  must get credit counseling from a government-approved organization within six  months before you file for any bankruptcy relief. You can find a state-by-state  list of government-approved organizations at  usdoj.gov/ust . That is the  website of the U.S. Trustee Program, the organization within the U.S. Department  of Justice that supervises bankruptcy cases and trustees. Also, before you file  a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, you must satisfy a “means test.” This test requires  you to confirm that your income does not exceed a certain amount. The amount  varies by state and is publicized by the U.S. Trustee Program at  usdoj.gov/ust .           For more information, see Before You File for Personal Bankruptcy:  Information About Credit Counseling and Debtor Education, Knee Deep in Debt, and  Fiscal Fitness: Choosing a Credit Counselor at  ftc.gov/credit .           Avoiding Scams           Turning to a business that offers help in solving debt problems may seem like  a reasonable solution when your bills become unmanageable. Be cautious. Before  you do business with any company, check it out with your local consumer  protection agency or the Better Business Bureau in the company's location.                   Ads Promising Debt Relief May Really Be Offering  Bankruptcy          Whether your debt dilemma is the result of an illness, unemployment,  or overspending, it can seem overwhelming. In your effort to get solvent, be on  the alert for advertisements that offer seemingly quick fixes. And read between  the lines when faced with ads in newspapers, magazines, or even telephone  directories that say:                                                                                 ""Consolidate your bills into  one monthly                        payment without borrowing""                           ""STOP credit harassment,  foreclosures,                             repossessions, tax levies, and  garnishments""                         ""Keep Your  Property""                         ""Wipe out your debts!  Consolidate your bills! How?                          By using the protection and assistance provided  by federal law. For once, let the law work for  you!""                                                           While the ads pitch the promise of debt relief, they rarely say relief may be  spelled b-a-n-k-r-u-p-t-c-y. And although bankruptcy is one option to deal with  financial problems, it's generally considered the option of last resort. The  reason: it has a long-term negative impact on your creditworthiness. A  bankruptcy stays on your credit report for 10 years, and can hinder your ability  to get credit, a job, insurance, or even a place to live. What's more, it can  cost you attorneys' fees.                   Advance-Fee Loan Scams          These scams  often target consumers with bad credit problems or those with no credit. In  exchange for an up-front fee, these companies ""guarantee"" that applicants will  get the credit they want — usually a credit card or a personal loan.           The up-front fee may be as high as several hundred dollars. Resist the  temptation to follow up on advance-fee loan guarantees. They may be illegal.  Many legitimate creditors offer extensions of credit, such as credit cards,  loans, and mortgages through telemarketing, and require an application fee or  appraisal fee in advance. But legitimate creditors never guarantee in advance  that you'll get the loan. Under the federal Telemarketing Sales Rule, a seller  or telemarketer who guarantees or represents a high likelihood of your getting a  loan or some other extension of credit may not ask for or receive payment until  you've received the loan.           Recognizing an Advance-Fee Loan Scam             Ads  for advance-fee loans often appear in the classified ad section of local and  national newspapers and magazines. They also may appear in mailings, radio  spots, and on local cable stations. Often, these ads feature ""900"" numbers,  which result in charges on your phone bill. In addition, these companies often  use delivery systems other than the U.S. Postal Service, such as overnight or  courier services, to avoid detection and prosecution by postal authorities.           It's not hard to confuse a legitimate credit offer with an advance-fee loan  scam. An offer for credit from a bank, savings and loan, or mortgage broker  generally requires your verbal or written acceptance of the loan or credit  offer. The offer usually is subject to a check of your credit report after you  apply to make sure you meet their credit standards. Usually, you are not  required to pay a fee to get the credit.           Hang up on anyone who calls you on the phone and says they can guarantee you  will get a loan if you pay in advance. It's against the law.           Protecting Yourself                     Here are some tips to  keep in mind before you respond to ads that promise easy credit, regardless of  your credit history:                              Most legitimate lenders will not ""guarantee"" that you will get a loan or a  credit card before you apply, especially if you have bad credit or a  bankruptcy.              It is an accepted and common practice for reputable lenders to require  payment for a credit report or appraisal. You also may have to pay a processing  or application fee.              Never give your credit card account number, bank account information, or  Social Security number out over the telephone unless you are familiar with the  company and know why the information is necessary.                                      Credit Repair Scams                You see the ads in  newspapers, on TV, and on the Internet. You hear them on the radio. You get  fliers in the mail. You may even get calls from telemarketers offering credit  repair services. They all make the same claims:                                                                       ""Credit problems? No  problem!""                           ""We can erase your bad  credit-100% guaranteed.""                         ""Create a new credit  identity — legally.""                         ""We can remove bankruptcies,  judgments, liens, and bad loans from your credit file  forever!""                                                           Do yourself a favor and save some money, too. Don't believe these statements.  They're just not true. Only time, a conscientious effort, and a plan for  repaying your debt will improve your credit report.           The Warning Signs            If you should decide to  respond to an offer to repair your credit, think twice. Don't do business with  any company that:                              wants you to pay for credit repair services before any services are provided              does not tell you your legal rights and what you can do yourself — for free              recommends that you not contact a consumer reporting company directly              suggests that you try to invent a ""new"" credit report by applying for an  Employer Identification Number to use instead of your Social Security number              advises you to dispute all information in your credit report or take any  action that seems illegal, such as creating a new credit identity. If you follow  illegal advice and commit fraud, you may be subject to prosecution.                      You could be charged and prosecuted for mail or wire fraud if you use the  mail or telephone to apply for credit and provide false information. It's a  federal crime to make false statements on a loan or credit application, to  misrepresent your Social Security number, and to obtain an Employer  Identification Number from the Internal Revenue Service under false  pretenses.           The Credit Repair Organizations Act            By law,  credit repair organizations must give you a copy of the ""Consumer Credit File  Rights Under State and Federal Law"" before you sign a contract. They also must  give you a written contract that spells out your rights and obligations. Read  these documents before signing the contract. The law contains specific consumer  protections. For example, a credit repair company cannot:                              make false claims about their services              charge you until they have completed the promised services              perform any services until they have your signature on a written contract  and have completed a three-day waiting period. During this time, you can cancel  the contract without paying any fees.                      Your contract must specify:                              the total cost of the services              a detailed description of the services to be performed              how long it will take to achieve the results              any ""guarantees"" they offer              the company's name and business address                     Where to Complain            If you've had a problem  with any of the scams described here, contact your local consumer protection  agency, state Attorney General (AG), or Better Business Bureau. Many AGs have  toll-free consumer hotlines. Check with your local directory assistance.                           Identity Theft                 An identity thief is someone who obtains some piece of your sensitive  information, like your Social Security number, date of birth, address, and phone  number, and uses it without your knowledge to commit fraud or theft.                            How Identity Thieves Get Your Information                                 Skilled identity thieves use a variety of methods to gain access to your  personal information. For example, they may:                              get information from businesses or other institutions by:                                            stealing records or information while they're on the job                        bribing an employee who has access to these records                        hacking these records                        conning information out of employees                                                    rummage through your trash, the trash of businesses, or public trash dumps  in a practice known as ""dumpster diving""              get your credit reports by abusing their employers' authorized access to  them, or by posing as a landlord, employer, or someone else who may have a legal  right to access your report              steal your credit or debit card numbers by capturing the information in a  data storage device in a practice known as ""skimming."" They may swipe your card  for an actual purchase, or attach the device to an ATM machine where you may  enter or swipe your card.              steal wallets and purses containing identification and credit and bank  cards             steal mail, including bank and credit card statements, new checks, or tax  information              complete a ""change of address form"" to divert your mail to another location              steal personal information from your home              scam information from you by posing as a legitimate business person or  government official                                  How Identity Thieves Use Your Information                    Once identity thieves have your personal information, they may:                              go on spending sprees using your credit and debit card account numbers to  buy ""big-ticket"" items like computers that they can easily sell              open a new credit card account, using your name, date of birth, and Social  Security number. When they don't pay the bills, the delinquent account is  reported on your credit report.              change the mailing address on your credit card account. The imposter then  runs up charges on the account. Because the bills are being sent to the new  address, it may take some time before you realize there's a problem.              take out auto loans in your name              establish phone or wireless service in your name              counterfeit checks or debit cards, and drain your bank account              open a bank account in your name and write bad checks on that account              file for bankruptcy under your name to avoid paying debts they've incurred,  or to avoid eviction              give your name to the police during an arrest. If they are released and  don't show up for their court date, an arrest warrant could be issued in your  name.                                  Protecting Yourself                      Managing your personal  information is key to minimizing your risk of becoming a victim of identity  theft.                              Keep an eye on your purse or wallet, and keep them in a safe place at all  times.              Don't carry your Social Security card.              Don't share your personal information with random people you don't know.  Identity thieves are really good liars, and could pretend to be from banks,  Internet service providers, or even government agencies to get you to reveal  identifying information.              Read the statements from your bank and credit accounts and look for unusual  charges or suspicious activity. Report any problems to your bank and creditors  right away.              Tear up or shred your charge receipts, checks and bank statements, expired  charge cards, and any other documents with personal information before you put  them in the trash.                                  How To Tell If You're a Victim of Identity  Theft                     Monitor the balances of your financial accounts. Look for  unexplained charges or withdrawals. Other indications of identity theft can be:                              failing to receive bills or other mail signaling an address change by the  identity thief             receiving credit cards for which you did not apply             denial of credit for no apparent reason             receiving calls from debt collectors or companies about merchandise or  services you didn't buy.                                  What To Do If Your Identity's Been  Stolen                    If you suspect that your personal information has been used to  commit fraud or theft, take the following four steps right away. Follow up all  calls in writing; send your letter by certified mail, and request a return  receipt, so you can document what the company received and when; and keep copies  for your files.                              Place a fraud alert on your credit reports and  review your credit reports.                    Contact any one of the nationwide consumer  reporting companies to place a fraud alert on your credit report. Fraud alerts  can help prevent an identity thief from opening any more accounts in your name.  The company you call is required to contact the other two, which will place an  alert on their versions of your report, too.

Close the accounts that you know, or believe, have  been tampered with or opened fraudulently.                       Contact the security or  fraud department of each company where you know, or believe, accounts have been  tampered with or opened fraudulently. Follow up in writing, and include copies  (NOT originals) of supporting documents. It's important to notify credit card  companies and banks in writing. Send your letters by certified mail, return  receipt requested, so you can document what the company received and when. Keep  a file of your correspondence and enclosures.               When you open new accounts, use new Personal Identification Numbers (PINs)  and passwords. Avoid using easily available information like your mother's  maiden name, your birth date, the last four digits of your Social Security  number,  your phone number, or  a series of consecutive numbers.                                            File a report with your local police or the police in  the community where the identity theft took place.                       Get a copy of the  police report or, at the very least, the number of the report. It can help you  deal with creditors who need proof of the crime. If the police are reluctant to  take your report, ask to file a ""Miscellaneous Incidents"" report, or try another  jurisdiction, like your state police. You also can check with your state  Attorney General's office to find out if state law requires the police to take  reports for identity theft. Check the Blue Pages of your telephone directory for  the phone number or check  naag.org  for a list of state Attorneys  General.                                                File a complaint with the Federal Trade  Commission.                             By sharing your identity theft complaint with the FTC, you  will provide important information that can help law enforcement officials  across the nation track down identity thieves and stop them. The FTC also can  refer your complaint to other government agencies and companies for further  action, as well as investigate companies for violations of laws that the FTC  enforces.               You can file a complaint online at  www.ftc.gov/idtheft .

The Fair Credit Reporting Act gives you the  right to learn what information is being distributed about you by credit  reporting companies.           The Truth in Lending Act requires lenders to  give you written disclosures of the cost of credit and terms of repayment before  you enter into a credit transaction.           The Fair Credit Billing Act establishes  procedures for resolving billing errors on your credit card accounts.           The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act  prohibits debt collectors from using unfair or deceptive practices to collect  overdue bills that your creditor has forwarded for collection.                The FTC works for   the consumer to prevent fraudulent, deceptive, and unfair business practices in   the marketplace and to provide information to help consumers spot, stop, and   avoid them.

Like many people looking forward to retirement, you may be concerned about market instability and other potential hazards on the journey ahead—what’s around the bend?   A variety of risks—market declines; inflation; inadequate pension, Social Security, 401(k); etc.—could threaten your retirement journey.                             Other potential dangers include declining interest rates; rising taxes; increasing costs for health care, prescriptions, and long-term care; and outliving your assets.  These potential dangers could seriously interfere with your retirement plans by forcing you to do one or more of the following:               Postpone your retirement.   Cut back on your standard of living.   Re-enter the workforce to supplement your income.                    Protect your retirement.   Help protect your retirement journey from unexpected hazards with strong, flexible safeguards.  Beneficial’s Index Annuity with Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit Rider give you income, access, protection, and interest, in one convenient package.  You get:         Guaranteed lifetime retirement income  that will last as long as you do.  Your lifetime-guaranteed income is like a pension—you can’t outlive it.    Guaranteed access  to your retirement account, which means you control your money, as you would with a 401(k) at the time of your retirement.  But, unlike a 401(k), you have the guarantee that your income won’t run out even if your account value is $0.  You always have guaranteed access 2  to 100% of your Index Annuity cash value (penalties may apply for excess withdrawals).    Guaranteed protection and interest.   While your capital is in the Index Annuity, guaranteed principal and guaranteed minimum return preserve your capital in an up, down, or flat market.  You also get potentially higher interest that is linked to the movement of the S&P 500 ®  Index.

Your credit report contains the following information:     Where you live, whether you own your home, and how often you've moved.  How you pay your bills.  How much credit you have.  What types of credit you have.  Whether you’ve been sued, arrested, or filed for bankruptcy.    Your information is collected by, and reported to the credit bureaus by the following:      Lenders   Credit card companies   Insurance companies   Employers   Landlords   Other businesses     These businesses then use this information to determine whether they want to:      Lend you money.  Extend you credit.  Issue an insurance policy to you.  Rent you a house or apartment.  Hire you as an employee.    The information contained in your credit report is also used to help the lender determine what the interest rate should be on your credit card or loan. If you have a history of missed or late payments, you’re considered high risk, and in order to be extended credit, they will likely require that you pay a higher interest rate. Insurance companies can also use this information to determine the premiums you'll pay on various types of insurance.     The Three Credit Bureaus    It is also important to obtain a report from each of the three credit reporting bureaus. This is because some companies may only collection information from one bureau, or may only report to one or two. By looking over all three, you can make sure the information is correct for each. The three credit bureaus are:     1. Equifax   800-685-1111   www.equifax.com    2. Experian  888-397-3742   www.experian.com    3. Trans Union  800-916-8800   www.transunion.com    How Do I Order My Free Credit Report?     The three major credit bureaus have set up a central website, toll-free telephone number, and mailing address that you use to order your free credit reports.     Web Site:  www.annualcreditreport.com   Toll-free Telephone Number: 877-322-8228   Address: Complete the Annual Credit Report Request Form and mail it to: Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281.     The three credit reporting bureaus will not send you an email or call you asking you for personal information, so don't respond to such requests. If you receive an email, don’t respond or click on any links in the email as there are plenty of scams that attempt to obtain your personal information. You should only access the website directly.

Please  help  by adding  relevant  internal links , or by improving the article's  layout .  (January 2008)       An  equity index annuity  in the United States is a type of tax-deferred  annuity  whose credited interest is linked to an equity index --SEE EXAMPLE HERE>> [1] , and typically uses the  S&P 500  or international index. It guarantees a minimum interest rate (typically between 1% and 3%) if held to the end of the surrender term and protects against a loss of principal. An equity index annuity is a contract with an insurance or annuity company. The returns may be higher than fixed instruments such as CDs, money market accounts, and bonds but not as high as market returns. Equity Index Annuities are insured by the State Guarantee Fund which is similar to the insurance provided by the FDIC. The guarantees in the contract are backed by the relative strength of the insurer.   The contracts may be suitable for a portion of the asset portfolio for those who want to avoid risk and are in retirement or nearing retirement age. The objective of purchasing an equity index annuity is to realize greater gains than those provided by CDs, money markets or bonds, while still protecting principal. The long term ability of Equity Index Annuities to beat the returns of other fixed instruments is a matter of debate.   Indexed annuities represent about 30% of all fixed annuity sales in 2006 according to the Advantage Group (see www.indexannuity.org)   Equity Indexed Annuities may also be referred to as Fixed Indexed Annuities or simple indexed annuity. The mechanics of how Equity Index Annuities work are often complex and the returns can vary greatly depending on the month and year the annuity is purchased. Like many other types of annuities, equity-indexed annuities usually carry a surrender charge for early withdrawal. These ""surrender periods"" range between 3 and 16 years, typically about ten.   A Different way to Credit Interest   The indexed annuity is virtually identical to a fixed annuity except in the way interest in calculated. As an example consider a $100,000 fixed annuity that credits a 4% annual effect interest rate. The owner then receives an interest credit of $4000. However, in an equity indexed annuity the interest credit is linked to the equity markets. For example assume the index is the S&P 500 and a one year point-to-point method is used and that the annuity offers a 8% cap. The $100,000 annuity could credit anything between 0% and 8% based on the change in the S&P 500. The cap, 8% in this example, is determined by how much is afforded by budget which is usually at or near the 4% fixed rate. If fixed rates increase then it would be expected that the cap would increase as well.   This allows the owner the security of knowing that the $100,000 is safe but rather than receiving the sure 4% they can receive up to 8%. Historically since 1950, an 8% cap on the S&P 500 has resulted in an average interest credit of 5.2%, very similar to what is considered the ""risk free rate of return"" delivered by T-bills, 5.1% over a similar period. The return may also be adjusted by other factors such as the participation rate and market value adjustments to cover bring the cost of the option into the budget available.   This means the owner of the indexed annuity now has assumed more risk than a fixed annuity but less than being in the equity markets themselves. The result is that the expected yield (risk adjusted) for an indexed annuity is higher than a fixed annuity, CD, etc. However, the expected yield of being in the market is higher for several reasons.   The principal (in our example the $100,000) is at risk of loss when owning the index outright. It should be noted that Equity Index Annuity does not participate in dividends as owning the index outright would and similar there are no ongoing transaction expenses or fees. Interest is compounded as frequently as when interest is credited and this is almost always annually but contracts are available that credit interest over a 5 year term.   The taxation of the gains in an indexed annuity are identical to that of fixed annuities. Taxes are deferred until monies are received and then interest is withdrawn first and taxed as ordinary income.   Understanding Options   This way of linking to an equity index like the S&P 500 or Dow Jones is accomplished through an option, usually a call option. A call option is the right but not the obligation to purchase something at a future date for a specified price.   The naming conventions for options used by the insurance industry is different than that of Wall Street but the options are structurally identical. Here's a sample of options commonly seen in indexed annuities.     Insurance  vs.  Wall Street   Point-to-Point vs. European   Monthly Average vs.Asian   Monthly Point-to_Point vs. Cliquet   Performance Triggered vs. Binary     The options in indexed annuities can usually be fit into the following taxonomy developed by the National Association of Fixed Annuities.   Term  - the length of time before option matures, usually one year. Two, three, four, and ten are also prevalent in the market. Some longer term options are but have a ""highwater"" feature that allows interest to be credited more frequently. An example of this would be a ten year Monthly Average option that credits interest each year if there is a gain.   Index  - the equity, stock, bond, or other index to which the interest credit is linked.   Gain Formula  - the method used to determine the gain in the index. Point to point, monthly averaging, daily averaging are the most common methods of calculating the gain. For example of the S&P 500 index starts at 1120 and ends at 1300 then the point to point gain is 16.07%.   Adjustment Method  - the way the option is limited in order to reduce the cost (and subsequent return) so that it becomes affordable. As an example the point to point option may cost 7% of the account value but will be ""adjusted"" to reduce the cost.   ""Market Value Adjustment"" - the company may reserve the right to adjust the value of your account based on current market conditions. This adjustment is most often applied to distributions, partial or complete withdrawals, and exchanges to other accounts.   The most common adjustments are: cap, fee, participation rate or a combination of the three. Other adjustments are less common. In keeping with the preceding example and allowing for an 8% cap as the adjustment the policyholder would not receive the 16.07% point to point gain but rather 8% as an interest credit.   Should provide examples for: P2P with Participation Rate Monthly Averaging with Cap Monthly Averaging with Fee   Should also link to the Withdrawal Benefits provided in variable annuities and indexed annuties at this point. These concepts were added because of the risk associated with the accumulation in both variable annuities and indexed annuities.

Account Balance      For the ELM sm  Index Annuity, the account balance at any time is the total of the premiums you’ve paid plus all credited interest (less withdrawals and applicable early withdrawal fees). Interest in the Fixed Account Option is credited daily. Interest in the Index Cap Option and Index Participation Option is credited once a year on the annual interest crediting date. Note that amounts withdrawn prior to the interest crediting date will not earn index interest for that year.        The ELM sm  Income Annuity has no account balance.                  Annuitant(s)      This is generally the same  person (or persons) as the owner who receives the income payments from an annuity contract. For an annuity contract that provides lifetime income payments, it is the annuitant's life that determines how long such payments will last.                  Annuitization      The act of converting the account balance of an accumulation (or deferred) annuity (like the ELM Index Annuity) into income payments.                  Annuity      An annuity is a contract issued by an insurance company that provides the option of receiving income payments for a specified period of time, such as 20 years or for the life of the annuitant. There are two types of annuity contracts: deferred (or accumulation) annuities which grow assets and permit withdrawals in a lump sum or income payments, subject to contract provisions, and income annuity contracts which are purchased specifically for guaranteed income, typically for life.         The ELM Index Annuity is a deferred (or accumulation) annuity because it may accumulate interest before being used to provide income payments or a lump sum withdrawal. The ELM Income Annuity is, of course, an example of an income annuity.              Annuity Payout Period      This is the period of time during which money is paid out of an annuity contract. Examples are 10, 15, 20 years or lifetime.                  Annuity Start Date      The date on which the first income payment is made under an annuity contract.                            Beneficiary      The person(s) designated to receive money upon the death of the annuitant and/or joint annuitant. All deferred annuity contracts provide a death benefit; however death benefits are an optional feature with income annuities.                              CPI-U      The standard abbreviation for the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers as published by the Department of Labor. It is one of the most commonly used measures of the rate of inflation. The index is based on a national survey conducted by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics that measures the average change in prices over time in a fixed market basket of goods and services, chosen to be representative of goods and services purchased by American families for day-to-day living. This may or may not reflect your actual experience with the prices of goods and services. More complete information on the cpi-u is available at:  http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpifaq.htm .                           Diversification      For retirees, this refers to spreading assets across different asset categories, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and insurance products such as fixed annuities in order to reduce risk.                       Early withdrawal fee      For the ELM Index Annuity, this is a percentage of a withdrawal from the account balance which the insurer charges as a fee. This percentage varies from 7% in year one to 0% in year eight and thereafter. Note that 10% of the account value of the ELM Index Annuity may be withdrawn after the first year (non-cumulative) without a fee.            If you take your money out early, you may face early withdrawal fees. If you're not yet 59 you may also have to pay an additional 10% income tax penalty on top of ordinary income taxes. Naturally, if you do take an early withdrawal, your death benefit and cash value will be reduced.       Please note, the ELM Index Annuity contract does not directly participate in any stock or equity investments; that withdrawals or surrenders prior to the expiration of an index period will result in no index participation for such amounts. It is also important to understand that actual returns may be less than the return of the linked index. And, possibly even negative if part, or all, of the contract is surrendered prior to the expiration of any applicable surrender period and thereby incurs an early withdrawal fee.

Neither the company nor its representatives give legal or tax advice. Please consult your attorney or tax advisor for answers to your tax questions.                            Fixed Account Option      One of the three interest accounts available in the ELM Index Annuity. The account balance in this option grows at a known interest rate. Interest is credited daily at the rate set by Nationwide, at the beginning of each contract year. For example, if the fixed rate is 4.50%, every $100,000 in the Fixed Account Option is guaranteed to grow to $104,500 by the end of the year.                  Fixed Annuity      An annuity contract that guarantees that the benefits paid will not fall below a guaranteed value, no matter what option is elected. For example, in a fixed income annuity contract, your income payments are guaranteed by the insurer to never fall (i.e., they are fixed). Another example is a fixed deferred annuity, in which interest credits are guaranteed by the insurer not to fall below a guaranteed minimum amount for the entire contract period. Guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.                  Fixed Payments      Payments provided by an income annuity contract in which the dollar amount does not change over time, regardless of market performance or inflation.                  Free Look Period      The period of time after the annuity contract is issued when the contract may be cancelled without penalty. The free look period is typically 10 or 20 days, but varies by state.                                     Immediate Annuity      This is an income annuity that begins income payments within one year of the payment of the premium.                  Income Annuity      A contract issued by an insurance company that guarantees income payments for a specified period of time, typically for the life of the annuitant(s). The amount of the income payments depends on the annuitant’s age, and contract features (for example, inflation protection, death benefit and options selected).                  Index Accounts      This term refers to the two interest account options in the ELM Index Annuity whose interest crediting is tied to the growth in the S&P 500* Composite Stock Index without dividends or capital gains. Interest credited in the Index Cap Option and the Index Participation Option is directly related to the annual performance of the S&P 500 Index. Whichever accounts you choose, your accounts will never go down in value (except for withdrawals and applicable withdrawal fees).                  Index Cap Option      This is one of the three interest crediting methods offered by the ELM Index Annuity. The Index Cap Option's interest credit equals the percentage growth in the S&P 500 Index, up to a ""cap"" or limit. If, for example, the cap set for that year is 9.00%, and the S&P 500* Index grows by 12%, the account balance in the Index Cap Option earns only 9.00%, the maximum interest credit established by the cap. In this case, every $100,000 in this account will grow to $109,000. If, however, the S&P 500 Index had grown by 7%, your interest rate would have been the full 7%, and your $100,000 is now $107,000. If the S&P 500 Index declines, the account balance would earn no interest; but the full account balance would remain intact.         Nationwide sets and guarantees the interest crediting formula for this account. You may have the opportunity to earn more than the interest offered in the Fixed Account Option but may also earn less (even zero).                   Index Participation Option      Like the Index Cap Option, this interest crediting method also links interest credits to the growth in the S&P 500 Index but using a different crediting formula. For this option, each year, Nationwide sets a ""participation"" percentage that is used to calculate the amount of your interest credits. If the S&P 500 Index grows by 20%, for example, and the participation percentage is set at 60%, you will earn 60% of the 20%, or 12.00% on your account balance in this option. Thus, every $100,000 earns 12.00% or $12,000. Your $100,000 has grown to $112,000. If the S&P 500 Index declines, your account does not earn interest, but the full account balance remains intact.                  Inflation-protected payments      An option for the ELM Income Annuity that increases income payments annually based on changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U) published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It's intended to help offset the effects of inflation on the dollar amount of the income benefit. The cost of this feature is reflected in the premium charged by the insurer.                  Inflation Risk      This is the risk that the cost of goods and services will increase because of inflation.                  Interest Account      For the ELM Index Annuity, this is the particular interest account you select from among the three account options available. You may choose to place your premium into one account or divide your premium among two accounts or all three. (Of course, the term has no meaning for the ELM Income Annuity because income annuities do not have account values).                  Investment Risk      The risk that assets will lose value (for any number of reasons).                                      Life Annuity      This is an income annuity in which income payments last for the life of a person(s) designated as the annuitant(s).                  Longevity Risk      The risk that our retirement assets eventually become insufficient to maintain the income we need to sustain us for as long as we might live.                                 Nationwide Financial      It is the insurance company that provides the ELM Index Annuity and receives all the premiums directly. The ELM Index Annuity contract’s guarantees are backed by the full faith and credit of Nationwide. See  www.nationwide-elm.com  for more information.

Please help  improve this article  by adding  reliable references . Unsourced material may be  challenged  and removed.  (August 2007)       For other uses, see  Annuity .   The term  annuity  is used in  finance theory  to refer to any terminating stream of fixed payments over a specified period of time. This usage is most commonly seen in academic discussions of finance, usually in connection with the valuation of the stream of payments, taking into account  time value of money  concepts such as  interest rate  and  future value . [ 1 ]   Examples of annuities are regular deposits to a savings account, monthly home mortgage payments and monthly insurance payments. Annuities are classified by payment dates. The payments (deposits) may be made weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly, or at any other interval of time.           Contents       1   Ordinary annuity     1.1   Formula   1.2   Proof   1.3   Additional formula       2   Annuity-due   3   Other types of annuities   4   References   5   See also   6   External links               [ edit ]   Ordinary annuity   An  ordinary annuity  (also referred as  annuity-immediate ) is an annuity whose payments are made at the end of each period (e.g. a month, a year). The values of an ordinary annuity can be calculated through the following: [ 2 ]     [ edit ]   Formula   Let:     r  = the yearly  nominal interest rate .   t  = the number of years.   m  = the number of periods per year.   i  = the interest rate per period.   n  = the number of periods.     Note:           n  =  t m     Also let:     P  = the principal (or present value).   S  = the future value of an annuity.   R  = the periodic payment in an annuity (the amortized payment).        ( annuity notation )     Also:         Clearly, in the limit as  n  increases,     Thus even an infinite series of finite payments ( perpetuity ) with a zero discount rate has a finite present value.     [ edit ]   Proof   The next payment is to be paid in one period. Thus, the present value is computed to be:         We notice that the second term is a  geometric progression  of scale factor  1  and of common ratio  . We can write         Finally, after  simplifications , we obtain         Similarly, we can prove the formula for the future value. The payment made at the end of the last year would accumulate no interest and the payment made at the end of the first year would accumulate interest for a total of (n-1) years. Therefore,         Hence:           [ edit ]   Additional formula   If an annuity is for repaying a debt  P  with interest, the amount owed after  n  payments is:         because the scheme is equivalent with lending an amount   and putting part of that, an amount  , in the bank to grow due to interest. See also  fixed rate mortgage .     [ edit ]   Annuity-due   An  annuity-due  is an annuity whose payments are made at the beginning of each period. [ 3 ]  Deposits in savings, rent payments, and insurance premiums are examples of annuities due.   Because each annuity payment is allowed to compound for one extra period, the value of an annuity-due is equal to the value of the corresponding ordinary annuity multiplied by (1+i). Thus, the future value of an annuity-due can be calculated through the formula (variables named as above) [ 4 ] :      ( annuity notation )     It can also be written as     (1 +  i )     An annuity-due with n payments is the sum of one annuity payment now and an ordinary annuity with one payment less, and also equal, with a time shift, to an ordinary annuity with one payment more, minus the last payment.   Thus we have:      (value at the time of the first of  n  payments of 1)    (value one period after the time of the last of  n  payments of 1)       [ edit ]   Other types of annuities     Fixed annuities  - These are annuities with fixed payments. They are primarily used for low risk investments like government securities or corporate bonds. Fixed annuities offer a fixed rate but are not regulated by the  Securities and Exchange Commission .       Variable annuities  - Unlike fixed annuities, these are regulated by the SEC. They allow you to invest in portions of money markets.       Equity-indexed annuities  - Lump sum payments are made to an insurance company.     Annuity due is useful for lease payment calculations 1     [ edit ]   References     ^   ""Calculate Annuity Payment: Funding an Annuity"" .  http://www.college-cram.com/study/finance/presentations/1128 .

Check Credit Reports to Help Foil Identity Theft  One of the best ways to protect yourself from identity theft is to keep a close watch on your credit reports, which you can order free of charge. Identity theft scams are designed to let criminals loot your bank accounts, max out your credit cards, and open new loan and credit card accounts in your name before you even realize there is a problem.    By regularly monitoring your free credit reports, you may be able to spot any unusual activity on your credit card accounts--often the first sign of identity theft--and take action before it is too late.     Get Your Free Credit Reports  You can get one free credit report every year from each of the three national credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. It is important to order reports from all three credit bureaus, because not all creditors report to all three bureaus and you are likely to find discrepancies among the three reports.    You may request all three free credit reports at once, or stagger your requests by ordering from a different bureau every four months. Ordering all three free credit reports at the same time makes it easy to compare them. On the other hand, the staggered approach enables you to keep an even closer watch on your credit history, to note changes sooner, and to stay current on what potential creditors are seeing when they check your credit reports.     Free Credit Reports Can Help You Manage Your Finances  Keeping track of your credit history by checking your credit reports regularly not only helps you guard against identity theft, it also makes good financial sense for other reasons.    Stay Current : Keeping up to date on what your credit report says about you provides a strategic opportunity for you to resolve any outstanding issues that could lower your credit score and undermine your ability to get credit approval the next time you apply.    Correct Mistakes : Errors sometimes occur on credit reports—a loan listed as active that you paid off years earlier, or a bankruptcy by someone with the same name and mistakenly listed on your credit report. Getting those problems corrected is much easier and less stressful when you’re not in the middle of negotiating a mortgage loan or trying to buy a new car.     Track Your Payments : Credit reports also show whether you make your payments on time. You may be extremely conscientious about on-time payments, but you can’t control what happens after you mail the check or hit the SEND button (if you’re paying online). If some of your payments have been delayed, your credit report may show delinquencies. If you call your creditors and explain, they may agree to adjust the information. But if you don’t check your credit report regularly, you won’t know about the late payments in your credit history.     Three Ways to Order Your Free Credit Reports  You can order your free annual credit reports by phone, toll-free, at 1-877-322-8228, or online from  AnnualCreditReport.com , a service set up by the three nationwide credit bureaus to help consumers review and manage their credit histories.    If you prefer, you can also order your free credit reports by mail.

Box 105281  Atlanta, GA 30348-5281   No matter how to choose to order your free credit reports, allow 2-3 weeks for delivery.    Ordering and reviewing your free credit reports regularly is one of the best investments you can make in your financial security--by protecting yourself against identity theft and being smarter about how you manage your money.

Use our web site to compare over 300 index annuities, fixed annuities and immediate  annuities .    Index Annuities offer the potential of higher returns without exposing principal to market risk. In exchange for this guarantee of no downside risk, Index Annuities policyholders must generally be willing to give up some of their upside market potential. This is what makes these newer annuity products so attractive to retired persons and to those approaching retirement. In exchange for having their retirement assets fully protected from loss (and in fact, guaranteed a gain) an  index annuities  owner shares in market gains without realizing 100% of the gain. For most individual investors who have recently been stung by market volatility, this constitutes a prudent and desirable trade-off.    All of this is usually accomplished by linking (indexing) the credited rate to an equity index, such as the S&P 500 Composite Stock Index. To repeat: although the credited rate is linked to stock market performance, safety of principal is assured. A decline in the stock-market will NOT reduce the asset value of index annuities.   If you would like to research and compare actual index annuities product offerings from a number of top rated insurance companies, please visit our  Index Annuities Data  page.   Index annuities are unlike any product in the marketplace. By legal definition they are a fixed annuity product, but with greater potential returns than those provided with guaranteed rate annuities. Index annuities allow you to benefit from potential gains when the stock market is up, but also prevent you from being penalized when it down. Unlike a variable   annuity , the risk of losing your money due to market losses does not exist with index annuities. So even if the stock market were to decline in value, your contract value can never decline. In addition, like all fixed annuities, youe protected by a lifetime guaranteed minimum interest rate.

Learn About Equity Index Annuities      ave for a rainy dayis a wise old saying and there are many ways you can prepare for the sunset of your life. Investing in an annuity is one way. An annuity is a long-term, interest-paying contract offered through an insurance company or financial institution. An equity indexed annuity is an annuity that earns interest that is linked to a stock or other equity index. Depending on how those stocks fare will determine what you gain. The equity index annuities, as in any kind of investments, have to be kept untouched for a long period. The typical time is a minimum of 7 years. This will ensure that you get the full benefit of having invested in an equity index annuity.   The equity index annuities are basically an option of investment that is offered by insurance companies. They actually provide you with the benefit of investing in the stock market without the associated risks of losing your money. So, in an equity index annuity, your principal is never lost and even in a worst case you may take some interest back home. The flip side of this however is that even if the stocks that the equity index annuity is invested in gives high returns, you will not receive the full returns but just a percentage. So you do not get the maximum returns for your equity index annuity but just a part.              This is however the compensation that the insurance companies who offer you the equity index annuities receive, for providing you with a safety net throughout the term of the annuity. The percentage of returns (i.e. the gain of the index) that your equity index annuity brings you is determined by the participation rate. This rate is pre-decided and varies and to know this you have to read the fine print prior to signing on the documents. The general participation rate offered for most equity index annuities is between 70 to 90 percent.   The equity index annuities are therefore seen as a conservative and prudent investment.   They became quite popular during the previous bullish run in the market and insurance companies saw them as an excellent means of combining the security of a guaranteed return with the boom of the stock market. All equity index annuities offer a minimum interest rate and its value also does not fall below the guaranteed minimum percentage of the premium paid i.e. 90 percent at least.   However to achieve maximum benefits, your equity index annuities should not be withdrawn before the term. If you do even a partial withdrawal it will definitely affect the interest you receive. Like all investments, this is best kept for a long term. This will also help your equity index annuities even out and recover if the index plunges. As we know the stock market is volatile and this needs to be kept in mind when investing. Also there are definite withdrawal penalties that you would have to pay as well.   How then do the insurance agencies benefit from offering equity index annuities? The insurance companies reinvest the premium amounts that you pay and this is usually invested into bonds. Since the participation rate is fixed, they have to pay only those set rates of interest to the investors of the equity index annuities and the insurance companies profit the balance.   Equity index annuities are generally affiliated to a particular stock market index such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average. However as the equity index annuities combine features of a typical insurance product with the traditional security they do completely fall into each of those specific categories.   As a typical insurance product you are guaranteed minimum return and in terms of securities your investment is linked to the equity market. However it all depends on the features that your equity index annuity provides and it may or may not be a security. The typical equity-indexed annuity is not registered with the SEC.   So then how does one know which equity index annuity is best for oneself? The only way is to find out as much as you can about the equity index annuity before you decide.   Ask a lot of questions like which stock market index does the equity index annuity use? What participation rate is being offered to you? Are there any hidden charges in terms of any fees or deductions payable? You have to run through a number of equity index annuity offerings before making your decision.   So save for a rainy day and do it the equity index annuity way!   About The Author   Scott is a consultant at Equity Index Annuities, a directory listing site with all your annuity and finance needs.
