Instead watersheds are being grouped into classes and representative watersheds of each class are being simulated.  The critical load for each class is assummed to be the same.  Watershed classifications are based physical parameters that can be estimated from available data.

Passwords are managed separately on each NERSC system.  Passwords must not be shared with any other person.  Passwords must be changed as soon  as possible after exposure or suspected compromise.

Passwords and user accounts must  NOT  be shared  under  any  circumstances. Users who share their passwords or accounts will have their access to NERSC disabled. Users should not leave clear-text passwords in a location accessible to others or secured in a location for which protection is less than that required for protecting the information that can be accessed using the password.             See  Account Ownership Policy .        New Users    NERSC must have a signed  user policy form  on file before assigning a user a password on a NERSC system.  Once this form has been signed, the  Account Support group   will contact you by phone to assign a temporary password and to activate your username(s) on the appropriate systems.  You will have to change this password the first time you login.         Login Failures     NOTE:   Your password will be disabled if you have  three   login failures while entering your password on a NERSC machine. Contact the  Account Support group   to obtain a new one if your user account has been disabled.        Obtaining a New Password from NERSC Account Support    If you have forgotten your password, contact  the  Account Support group  to reset  your password.  You will have to change this password the next time you login.       Changing Your Password     Passwords must be changed under any one of the following circumstances:         At least every six months.        Immediately after giving your password to someone else.          As soon as possible, but at least within one business day after a    password has been compromised or after you suspect that a    password has been compromised.         On direction from NERSC staff.         To change your password, use the  passwd  command. When your password expires you will be automatically prompted to change it the next time you login.  Upon login you will be prompted to enter your current password, then to enter your new password twice in a row.  Your new password must adhere to the  Departmeny of Energy requirements  below.      NOTE:  Passwords are not shared across  any NERSC systems or resources. Changing your password on one NERSC system does not change it on other NERSC systems.         Seaborg   has  special password procedures.       Department of Energy Password Requirements     As a Department of Energy facility, NERSC is required to adhere to Department of Energy guidelines regarding passwords. The following requirements conform to the Department of Energy guidelines regarding passwords, namely DOE Order 205.3 and to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's  RPM  §9.02 Operational Procedures for Computing and Communications.    Different NERSC systems have different software environments with minor variations in software constraints on passwords. When users are selecting their own passwords for use at NERSC, the following requirements must be used. It is the responsibility of the user to select a password that adheres to the following requirements, regardless of whether or not the system is capable of enforcing them.          Passwords must contain at least eight nonblank characters.      Passwords must contain a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and at least one special character within the first seven positions.             Passwords must contain a nonnumeric letter or symbol in the      first and last positions.      Passwords must not contain the user login name.      Passwords must not include the user's own or (to the best of       his or her knowledge) a close friend's or relative's name, employee  number, Social Security number, birthdate, telephone      number, or any information about him or her that the user      believes could be readily learned or guessed.      Passwords must not (to the best of the user's knowledge) include  common words from an English dictionary or a dictionary      of another language  with which the user has familiarity.       Passwords must not (to the best of the user's knowledge) contain  commonly used proper names, including the name of any      fictional character  or place.       Passwords must not contain any simple pattern of letters or numbers such as ""qwertyxx"".

GX000-38-13853483	"美国参考     __________                   美国针对气候变化问题采取具体行动              美国资深谈判代表哈伦·沃森(Harlan Watson)12月4日在关于国际气候变化问题的国际会议上说，美国正在采取具体措施，解决他称之为对美国十分重要的气候变化问题，并在与发达国家和发展中国家的合作夥伴共同进行的气候变化行动计划中发挥领导作用。这次国际气候会议于12月1日至12日在意大利城市米兰举行。    沃森在全体会议的讲话中说，布什总统的气候变化政策重申了美国的承诺，即把大气层温室气体浓度稳定在一个防止对气候构成危险影响的水平。沃森指出，这个政策的第一项内容是，要求设定国家目标，在今后10年内把国家大气层温室气体浓度降低18%，即使目前状况得到将近30%的改善。他说，布什政策的第二项内容是对科学技术和研究机构进行投资。第三项内容是开展国际合作──沃森称这一点对于在气候变化问题上形成有效力和高效率的全球反应至关重要""。    沃森说，自2001年以来，美国就气候变化问题更新或启动了13项与发达国家和发展中国家的正式双边合作。    在技术领域，沃森呼吁在能源生产、输送、储存、转换和使用方面，开发和落实带来""全球化变革""的技术。他说，正在进行的重大国际技术努力之一是，去年6月美国发起的""碳螯合领导人论坛""(Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum)。这个有13个国家及欧洲联盟参加的论坛致力于提高回收和储藏在矿物质燃料燃烧时所释放的、导致温室效应的碳废气的技术。    就美国国内而言，沃森说，美国50个州中的40个州对大气温室气体情况做出详细目录，有27个州完成了气候变化行动计划，8个州自愿制订了减少大气层温室气体排放的目标。    (完)                    * * * * * *     *订阅〈美国参考电子稿件〉，请发送电子邮件至   LISTSERV@LISTS.STATE.GOV  收到答复后请回函确认，在电子邮件正文内注明 OK 即可。  ( 订阅说明详见〈美国参考〉网页： http://usinfo.state.gov/regional/ea/mgck )           美国国务院   国际信息局   http://usinfo.state.gov                          对不起，您需要使用具有脚本语言(JavaScript)能力的浏览器来获得最佳阅读效果。"
