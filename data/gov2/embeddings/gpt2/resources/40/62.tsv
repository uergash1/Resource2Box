GX012-22-16280346	"HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE SYSTEMS    The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has three interacting systems:     • The Support Systems Module (SSM), an outer structure that houses the other systems and provides services such as electrical power, data communications, and pointing control and maneuvering     • The Optical Telescope Assembly (OTA), which collects and concentrates the incoming light in the focal plane for use by the science instruments     • Eight major science instruments, four housed in an aft section focal plane structure (FPS) and four placed along the circumference of the spacecraft. With the exception of the Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS), the Science Instrument Control and Data Handling (SI C&DH) unit controls all.     Additional systems that also support HST operations include two Solar Arrays (SA).These generate electrical power and charge onboard batteries and communications antennas to receive commands and send telemetry data from the HST. Figure 5-1 shows the HST configuration.        The Telescope performs much like a ground observatory. The SSM is designed to support functions required by any ground astronomical observatory. It provides power, points the Telescope, and communicates with the OTA, SI C&DH unit, and instruments to ready an observation. Light from an observed target passes through the Telescope and into one or more of the science instruments, where the light is recorded. This information goes to onboard computers for processing, and then it is either temporarily stored or sent to Earth in real time, via the spacecraft communication system.     The Telescope completes one orbit every 97 minutes and maintains its orbital position along three axial planes. The primary axis, V1, runs through the center of the Telescope. The other two axes parallel the SA masts (V2) and the High Gain Antenna (HGA) masts (V3) (see Fig. 5-2). The Telescope points and maneuvers to new targets by rotating about its body axes. Pointing instruments use references to these axes to aim at a target in space, position the SA, or change Telescope orientation in orbit.         5.1 Support Systems Module      The design features of the SSM include:     • An outer structure of interlocking shells   • Reaction wheels and magnetic torquers to maneuver, orient, and attitude stabilize the Telescope   • Two SAs to generate electrical power   • Communication antennas   • A ring of Equipment Section bays that contain electronic components, such as batteries, and communications equipment. (Additional bays are provided on the +V3 side of the spacecraft to house OTA electronics as described in para 5.2.4.)   • Computers to operate the spacecraft systems and handle data   • Reflective surfaces and heaters for thermal protection   • Outer doors, latches, handrails, and footholds designed for astronaut use during on-orbit maintenance.     Figure 5-3 shows some of these features. Major component subsystems of the SSM are:     • Structures and mechanisms   • Instrumentation and communications   • Data management   • Pointing control   • Electrical power   • Thermal control   • Safing (contingency) system.         5.1.1 Structures and Mechanisms Subsystem      The outer structure of the SSM consists of stacked cylinders, with the aperture door on top and the aft bulkhead at the bottom. Fitting together are the light shield, the forward shell, the SSM Equipment Section, and the aft shroud/bulkhead – all designed and built by Lockheed Martin Missiles & Space (see Fig. 5-4).         Aperture Door.     The aperture door, approximately 10-ft (3 m) in diameter, covers the opening to the Telescope’s light shield. The door is made from honeycombed aluminum sheets. The outside is covered with solar-reflecting material, and the inside is painted black to absorb stray light.     The door opens a maximum of 105 degrees from the closed position. The Telescope aperture allows for a 50-degree field of view (FOV) centered on the +V1 axis. Sun-avoidance sensors provide ample warning to automatically close the door before sunlight can damage the Telescope’s optics. The door begins closing  when the sun is within 35 degrees of the +V1 axis and is closed by the time the sun reaches 20 degrees of +V1. This takes no more than 60 seconds.     The Space Telescope Operations Control Center (STOCC) can override the protective door-closing mechanism for observations that fall within the 20-degree limit. An example is observing a bright object, using the dark limb (edge) of the Moon to partially block the light.      Light Shield.     The light shield (see Fig. 5-4) blocks out stray light. It connects to both the aperture door and the forward shell. On the outer skin of the Telescope on opposite sides are latches to secure the SAs and HGAs when they are stowed. Near the SA latches are scuff plates,   large protective metal plates on struts that extend approximately 30 in. from the surface of the spacecraft. Trunnions lock the Telescope into the Shuttle cargo bay by hooking to latches in the bay. The light shield supports the forward Low Gain Antenna (LGA) and its communications waveguide, two magnetometers, and two sun sensors. Handrails encircle the light shield, and built-in foot restraints support the astronauts working on the Telescope.     Figure 5-5 shows the aperture door and light shield. The shield is 13-ft (4 m) long, with an internal diameter of 10-ft (3 m). It is machined from magnesium, with a stiffened, corrugated-skin barrel covered by a thermal blanket. Internally the shield has 10 light baffles, painted flat black to suppress stray light.         Forward Shell.     The forward shell, or central section of the structure, houses the OTA main baffle and the secondary mirror (see Fig. 5-6). When stowed, the SAs and HGAs are latched flat against the forward shell and light shield. Four magnetic torquers are placed 90 degrees apart around the circumference of the forward shell. The outer skin has two grapple fixtures next to the HGA drives, where the Shuttle’s Remote Manipulator System can attach to the Telescope. The forward shell also has handholds, footholds, and a trunnion, which is used to lock the Telescope into the Shuttle cargo bay.        The forward shell is 13-ft (4 m) long and 10-ft (3 m) in diameter. It is machined from aluminum plating, with external reinforcing rings and internal stiffened panels. The rings are on the outside to ensure clearance for the OTA inside. Thermal blankets cover the exterior.      Equipment Section.     This section is a ring of storage bays encircling the SSM. It contains about 90 percent of the electronic components that run the spacecraft, including equipment serviced during extravehicular activities (EVA) by Space Shuttle astronauts.     The Equipment Section is a doughnut-shaped barrel that fits between the forward shell and aft shroud. This section contains 10 bays for equipment and two bays to support aft trunnion pins and scuff plates. As shown in Fig. 5-7,   going clockwise from the +V3 (top) position, the bays contain:     1. Bay 8 – pointing control hardware  2. Bay 9 – Reaction Wheel Assembly (RWA)  3. Bay 10 – SI C&DH unit  4. Unnumbered trunnion support bay  5. Bay 1 – data management hardware   6. Bay 2 through Bay 4 – electrical power equipment  7. Unnumbered trunnion support bay   8. Bay 5 – communication hardware  9. Bay 6 – RWA   10. Bay 7 – mechanism control hardware.        The cross section of the bays is shaped like a trapezoid, with the outer diameter (the door) – 3.6-ft (1 m) – greater than the inner diameter – 2.6-ft (0.78 m). The bays are 4-ft (1.2 m) wide and 5-ft (1.5 m) deep. The Equipment Section is constructed of machined and stiffened aluminum frame panels attached to an inner aluminum barrel. Eight bays have flat honeycombed aluminum doors mounted with equipment. In Bays 6 and 9, thermal-stiffened panel doors cover the reaction wheels. A forward frame panel and aft bulkhead enclose the SSM Equipment Section. Six mounts on the inside of the bulkhead hold the OTA.    Aft Shroud and Bulkhea d .     The aft shroud (see Fig. 5-8) houses the FPS containing the axial science instruments. It is also the location of the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) unit.        The three FGSs and the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) are housed radially near the connecting point between the aft shroud and SSM Equipment Section. Doors on the outside of the shroud allow shuttle astronauts to remove and change equipment and instruments easily. Handrails and foot restraints for the crew run along the length and circumference of the shroud. During maintenance or removal of an instrument, interior lights illuminate the compartments containing the science instruments. The shroud is made of aluminum, with a stiffened skin, internal panels and reinforcing rings, and 16 external and internal longeron bars for support. It is 11.5-ft (3.5 m) long and 14-ft (4.3 m) in diameter.     The aft bulkhead contains the umbilical connections between the Telescope and the shuttle, used during launch/deployment and on-orbit maintenance. The rear LGA attaches to the bulkhead, which is made of 2-in.-thick honeycombed aluminum panels and has three radial aluminum support beams.     The shroud and bulkhead support a gas purge system that was used to prevent contamination of the science instruments before launch. All vents used to expel gases are light tight. Thus, stray light is prevented from entering the OTA focal plane.    Mechanisms.     Along the SSM structure are mechanisms that perform various functions, including:      • Latches to hold antennas and SAs     • Hinge drives to open the aperture door and erect arrays and antennas     • Gimbals to move the HGA dishes     • Motors to power the hinges and latches and to rotate arrays and antennas.     There are nine latches: four for antennas, four for arrays, and one for the aperture door. They latch and release using four-bar linkages and are driven by stepper motors called Rotary Drive Actuators (RDA).     There are three hinge drives, one for each HGA and one for the door. The hinges also use an RDA. Both hinges and latches have hex-wrench fittings so an astronaut can manually operate the mechanism to deploy the door, antenna, or array if a motor fails.      5.1.2 Instrumentation and Communications Subsystem      This subsystem provides the communications loop between the Telescope and the Tracking and Data Relay Satellites (TDRS), receiving commands and sending data through the HGAs and LGAs. All information is passed through the Data Management Subsystem (DMS).     The HGAs achieve a much higher RF signal gain, which is required, for example, when transmitting high-data-rate scientific data. These antennas require pointing at the TDRSs because of their characteristically narrow beam widths. On the other hand, the LGAs provide spherical coverage (omnidirectional) but have a much lower signal gain. The LGAs are used for low-rate- data transmission and all commanding of the Telescope.      S-Band Single Access Transmitter (SSAT).      The Telescope is equipped with two SSATs. ""S-Band"" identifies the frequency at which the science data is transmitted, and ""Single Access"" specifies the type of antenna on the TDRS satellite to which the data is sent.      High Gain Antennas.  Each HGA is a parabolic reflector (dish) mounted on a mast with a two-axis gimbal mechanism and electronics to rotate it 100 degrees in either direction (see Fig. 5-9). General Electric designed and made the antenna dishes. They are manufactured from honeycomb aluminum and graphite-epoxy facesheets.        Each antenna can be aimed with a one-degree pointing accuracy. This accuracy is consistent with the overall antenna beam width of over four degrees. The antennas transmit over two frequencies: 2255.5 MHz or 2287.5 MHz (plus or minus 10 MHz).      Low Gain Antennas.  The LGAs receive ground commands and transmit engineering data. They are set 180 degrees apart on the light shield and aft bulkhead of the spacecraft. Each antenna is a spiral cone that can operate over a frequency range from 2100 MHz to 2300 MHz. Manufactured by Lockheed Martin, the LGAs   are used for all commanding of the Telescope and for low-data-rate telemetry, particularly during Telescope deployment or retrieval on orbit, or during safemode operations.    5.1.3 Data Management Subsystem      The DMS receives communications commands from the STOCC and data from the SSM systems, OTA, and science instruments. It processes, stores, and sends the information as requested. Subsystem components are:     • DF-224 computer (will be replaced on SM3A with the Advanced Computer)     • Data Management Unit (DMU)     • Four Data Interface Units (DIU)     • Three engineering/science data recorders     • Two oscillators (clocks).     The components are located in the SSM Equipment Section, except for one DIU stored in the OTA Equipment Section. The DMS receives, processes, and transmits five types of signals:     1. Ground commands sent to the HST systems     2. Onboard computer-generated or computer-stored commands     3. Scientific data from the SI C&DH unit     4. Telescope engineering status data for telemetry     5. System outputs, such as clock signals and safemode signals.     Figure 5-10 is the subsystem functional diagram.         DF-224 Computer.     The DF-224 computer is a general-purpose digital computer for onboard  Fig. 5-10 Data Management Subsystem functional block diagram.5-9  K9322-05M  engineering computations. It executes stored commands; formats status data (telemetry); performs all Pointing Control Subsystem (PCS) computations to maneuver, point, and attitude stabilize the Telescope; generates onboard commands to orient the SAs toward the Sun; evaluates the health status of the Telescope systems; and commands the HGAs. The Advanced Computer will replace the DF-224 on SM3A and will assume its functions.      Advanced Computer.     The Advanced Computer is based on the Intel 80486 microchip. It operates 20 times faster and has six times as much memory as the DF-224.     The Advanced Computer was designed using commercially developed components. A battery of mechanical, electrical, radiation and thermal tests were performed at GSFC to assure its survival in the space environment. A successful flight test of the hardware was carried out aboard the space shuttle  Discovery  on STS-95 in October 1998.     The Advanced Computer is configured as three independent single-board computers. Each single-board computer (SBC) has two megabytes of fast static random access memory and one megabyte of non-volatile memory.     The Advanced Computer communicates with the HST by using the direct memory access capability on each SBC through the Data Management Unit (DMU). Only one SBC may control the Telescope at a time. The other SBCs can be off, in an idle state, or performing internal tasks.     Upon power on, each SBC runs a built-in self-test and then copies the operating software from slower non-volatile memory to faster random access memory. The self-test is capable of diagnosing any problems with the Advanced Computer and reporting them to the ground. Fast static random access memory is used in the Advanced Computer to eliminate wait states and allow it to run at its full-rated speed.     The Advanced Computer measures 18.8 x 18 x 13 inches (0.48 x 0.46 x 0.33 m) and weighs 70.5 lb (32 kg). It will be located in Bay 1 of the SSM Equipment Section (see Fig. 5-11).         Data Management Unit.     The DMU links with the computer. It encodes data and sends messages to selected Telescope units and all DMS units, powers the oscillators, and is the central timing source. The DMU also receives and decodes all incoming commands, then transmits each processed command to be executed.     The DMU receives science data from the SI C&DH unit. Engineering data, consisting of sensor and hardware status readings (such as temperature or voltages), comes from each Telescope subsystem. The data can be stored in the onboard data recorders if direct telemetry via a TDRS is unavailable.      The DMU is an assembly of printed-circuit boards, interconnected through a backplate and external connectors. The unit weighs 83 lb (37.7 kg), measures 26 x 30 x 7 in. (60 x 70 x 17 cm), and is attached to the door of Equipment Section Bay 1 (see Fig. 5-12).         Data Interface Unit.     The four DIUs provide a command and data link between DMS and other Telescope electronic boxes. The DIUs receive commands and data requests from the DMU and pass data or status information back to the DMU. The OTA DIU is located in the OTA Equipment Section; the other units are in Bays 3, 7, and 10 of the SSM Equipment Section. As a safeguard, each DIU is two complete units in one; either part can handle the unit’s functions. Each DIU measures 15 x 16 x 7 in. (38 x 41 x 18 cm) and weighs 35 lb (16 kg).      Engineering/Science Data Recorders.     The DMS includes three data recorders that store engineering or science data that cannot be transmitted to the ground in real time. The recorders, which are located in Equipment Section Bays 5 and 8, hold up to 12 billion bits of information. Two recorders are used in normal operations; the third is a backup. Each recorder measures 12 x 9 x 7 in. (30 x 23 x 18 cm) and weighs 20 lb (9 kg).      Solid State Recorder.     During SM2 a Solid State Recorder (SSR) was installed, replacing a reel-to- reel tape recorder. A second state-of-the-art SSR will be installed during SM3A. This digital recorder will replace one of the two remaining reel-to-reel recorders on HST. The Solid State Recorders have an expected on-orbit life of at least eight years. They can record two data streams simultaneously, allowing both science and engineering data to be captured on a single recorder. In addition, data can be recorded and played back at the same time.     The SSR has no reels or tape, and no moving parts to wear out and limit lifetime. Data is stored digitally in computer-like memory chips until HST’s operators at GSFC command the SSR to play it back. Although they are the same size as the reel-to-reel recorders, the SSRs can store over 10 times more data — 12 gigabits versus only 1.2 gigabits for the tape recorders they replace.      Oscillator.     The oscillator provides a highly stable central timing pulse required by the Telescope. It has a cylindrical housing 4 in. (10 cm) in diameter and 9 in. (23 cm) long and weighs 3 lb (1.4 kg). The oscillator and a backup are mounted in Bay 2 of the SSM Equipment Section.      5.1.4 Pointing Control Subsystem      A unique PCS maintains Telescope pointing stability and aligns the spacecraft to point to and remain locked on any target. The PCS is designed for pointing to within 0.01 arcsec and holding the Telescope in that orientation with 0.007-arcsec stability for up to 24 hours while the Telescope continues to orbit the Earth at 17,500 mph. If the Telescope were in Los Angeles, it could hold a beam of light on a dime in San Francisco without the beam straying from the coin’s diameter.     Nominally, the PCS maintains the Telescope’s precision attitude by locating guide stars into two FGSs and controlling the Telescope to keep it in the same position relative to these stars. When specific target requests require repositioning the spacecraft, the pointing system selects different reference guide stars and moves the Telescope into a new attitude.     The PCS encompasses the Advanced Computer, various attitude sensors, and two types of devices, called actuators, to move the spacecraft (see Fig. 5-13). It also includes the Pointing/ Safemode Electronics Assembly (PSEA) and the Retrieval Mode Gyro Assembly (RMGA); both used by the spacecraft safemode system. See para 5.1.7 for details.         Sensors.     The five types of sensors used by the PCS are the Coarse Sun Sensors (CSS), the Magnetic Sensing System (MSS), the Rate Gyro Assemblies (RGA), the Fixed Head Star Trackers (FHST), and the FGSs.     The CSSs measure the Telescope’s orientation to the Sun. They are used to calculate the initial deployment orientation of the Telescope, determine when to begin closing the aperture door, and point the Telescope in special sun-orientation modes during contingency operations. Five CSSs are located on the light shield and aft shroud. CSSs also provide signals to the PSEA, located in Bay 8 of the SSM Equipment Section.     The MSS measures the Telescope’s orientation relative to Earth’s magnetic field. The system consists of magnetometers and dedicated electronic units that send data to the Advanced Computer and the Safemode Electronic Assembly. Two systems are provided. Both are located on the front end of the light shield.     Three RGAs are provided on the Telescope. Each assembly consists of a Rate Sensor Unit (RSU) and an Electronics Control Unit (ECU). An RSU contains two rate-sensing gyroscopes, each measuring attitude rate motion about its sensitive axis. This output is processed by its dedicated electronics, which are contained in the ECU. Each unit has two sets of electronics. The RSUs are located behind the SSM Equipment Section, next to the FHSTs in the aft shroud. The ECUs are located inside Bay 10 of the SSM Equipment Section. The RGAs provide input to the PCS to control the orientation of the Telescope’s line of sight and to provide the attitude reference when maneuvering the Telescope.     Four of the original six rate gyros were replaced during the First Servicing Mission. All six rate gyros are planned for replacement during SM3A. Three of six gyroscopes are required to continue the Telescope science mission.     An FHST is an electro-optical detector that locates and tracks a specific star within its FOV. Three FHSTs are located in the aft shroud behind the FPS, next to the RSUs. STOCC uses star trackers as an attitude calibration device when the Telescope maneuvers into its initial orientation. The trackers also calculate attitude information before and after maneuvers to help the FGS lock onto guide stars.     Three FGSs, discussed in more detail in para 5.3, provide angular position with respect to the stars. Their precise fine-pointing adjustments, accurate to within a fraction of an arcsecond, pinpoint the guide stars. Two of the FGSs perform guide-star pointing, while the third is available for astrometry, the positional measurement of specific stars.      Pointing Control Subsystem Software.     PCS software accounts for a large percentage of the flight code executed by the Hubble’s main computer. This software translates ground targeting commands into reaction wheel torque profiles that reorient the spacecraft. All motion of the spacecraft is smoothed to minimize jitter during data collection. The software also determines Telescope orientation, or attitude, from FHST or FGS data and commands the magnetic torquer bars so that reaction wheel speeds are always minimized. In addition, the software provides various telemetry formats.     Since the Telescope was launched, major modifications have been made to the PCS. A digital filtering scheme, known as Solar Array Gain Augmentation (SAGA) was incorporated to mitigate the effect of any SA vibration or jitter on pointing stability. Software also was used to improve FGS performance when the Telescope is subjected to the same disturbances. This algorithm is referred to as the FGS Re-Centering Algorithm.     Software is used extensively to increase Telescope robustness when hardware failures are experienced. Two additional software safemodes have been provided. The spin-stabilized mode provides pointing of the Telescope -V1 axis to the Sun with only two of the four RWAs operating. The other mode allows Sun pointing of the Telescope without any input from the RGA; magnetometer and CSS data is used to derive all reference information needed to maintain Sun pointing (+V3 and -V1 are options).     A further software change ""refreshes"" the FGS configuration. This is achieved by maintaining data in the Advanced Computer memory so it can be sent periodically to the FGS electronics, which are subject to single-event upsets (logic state change) when transitioning through the South Atlantic Anomaly.      Actuators.     The PCS has two types of actuators: RWAs and magnetic torquers. Actuators move the spacecraft into commanded attitudes and provide required control torques to stabilize the Telescope’s line of sight.     The reaction wheels work by rotating a large flywheel up to 3000 rpm or braking it to exchange momentum with the spacecraft. The wheel axes are oriented so that the Telescope can provide science with only three wheels operating. Wheel assemblies are paired, two each in Bays 6 and 9 of the SSM Equipment Section. Each wheel is 23 in. (59 cm) in diameter and weighs about 100 lb (45 kg). Figure 5-14 shows the RWA configuration.        Magnetic torquers create torque on the spacecraft and are primarily used to manage reaction wheel speed. The torquers react against Earth’s magnetic field. The torque reaction occurs in the direction that reduces the reaction wheel speed, managing the angular momentum.     The magnetic torquers also provide backup control to stabilize the Telescope’s orbital attitude during the contingency modes, as described in para 5.1.2. Each torquer, located externally on the forward shell of the SSM, is 8.3   ft (2.5 m) long and 3 in. (8 cm) in circumference and weighs 100 lb (45 kg).      Pointing Control Operation.     To point precisely, the PCS uses the gyroscopes, reaction wheels, magnetic torquers, star trackers, and FGSs. The FGSs provide the precision reference point from which the Telescope can begin repositioning. Flight software commands the reaction wheels to spin, accelerating or decelerating as required to rotate the Telescope toward a new target. Rate gyroscopes sense the Telescope’s angular motion and provide a short-term attitude reference to assist fine pointing and spacecraft maneuvers. The magnetic torquers reduce reaction wheel speed.     As the Telescope nears the target area, star trackers locate preselected reference stars that stand out brightly in that region of the sky. Once the star trackers reduce the attitude error below 60 arcsec, the two FGSs take over the pointing duties. Working with the gyroscopes, the FGSs make possible pointing the Telescope to within 0.01 arcsec of the target. The PCS can maintain this position, wavering no more than 0.005 arcsec, for up to 24 hours to guarantee faint-object observation.    5.1.5 Electrical Power Subsystem    Power for the Telescope and science instruments comes from the Electrical Power Subsystem (EPS). The major components are two SA wings and their electronics, six batteries, six Charge Current Controllers (CCC), one Power Control Unit (PCU), and four Power Distribution Units (PDU). All except the SAs are located in the bays around the SSM Equipment Section.    During the servicing mission, the Shuttle will provide the electrical power. After deployment, the SAs again begin converting solar radiation into electricity. Energy will be stored in nickel-hydrogen (NiH  2  ) batteries and distributed by the PCUs and PDUs to all Telescope components as shown in Fig. 5-15. The Telescope will not be released until the batteries are fully charged.         Solar Arrays.     The SA panels, discussed later in this section, are the primary source of electrical power. Each array wing has a solar cell blanket that converts solar energy into electrical energy. Electricity produced by the solar cells charges the Telescope batteries.    Each array wing has associated electronics. These consist of a Solar Array Drive Electronics (SADE) unit, which transmits positioning commands to the wing assembly; a Deployment Control Electronics Unit, which controls the drive motors extending and retracting the wings; and diode networks to direct the electrical current flow.      Batteries and Charge Current Controllers.      Developed for the 1990 deployment mission, the Telescope’s batteries were NASA’s first flight NiH  2  batteries. They provide the observatory with a robust, long-life electrical energy storage system.     Six NiH  2  batteries support the Telescope’s electrical power needs during three periods: when demand exceeds SA capability, when the Telescope is in Earth’s shadow, and during safemode entry. The batteries reside in SSM Equipment Section Bays 2 and 3. These units have extensive safety and handling provisions to protect the Shuttle and its astronauts. The design and operation of these batteries, along with special nondestructive inspection of each cell, have allowed these units to be ""astronautrated"" for replacement during a servicing mission. To compensate for the effects of battery aging, SM3A astronauts will install a Voltage/Temperature Improvement Kit (VIK) on each of  Hubble’s six batteries. The VIK provides battery thermal stability by precluding battery overcharge when the HST enters safemode, effectively lowering the Charge Current Controller (CCC) recharge current.     Each battery consists of 22 cells in series along with heaters, heater controllers, pressure measurement transducers and electronics, and temperature-measuring devices and their associated electronics. Three batteries are packaged into a module measuring roughly 36 by 36 by 10 in. (90 x 90 x 25 cm) and weighing about 475 lb (214 kg). Each module is equipped with two large yellow handles that astronauts use to maneuver the module in and out of the Telescope in space.     The SAs recharge the batteries every orbit following eclipse (the time in the Earth’s shadow). The recharge current is controlled by the CCCs. Each battery has its own CCC that uses voltage-temperature measurements to control battery recharge.     Fully charged, each battery contains more than 75 amp-hours. This is sufficient energy to sustain the Telescope in normal science operations mode for 7.5 hours or five orbits. The batteries provide an adequate energy reserve for all possible safemode contingencies and all enhancements programmed into the Telescope since launch.      Power Control and Distribution Units.     The PCU interconnects and switches current flowing among the SAs, batteries, and CCCs. Located in Bay 4 of the Equipment Section, the PCU provides the main power bus to the four PDUs. The PCU weighs 120 lb (55 kg) and measures 43 x 12 x 8 in. (109 x 30 x 20 cm).     Four PDUs, located on the inside of the door to Bay 4, contain the power buses, switches, fuses, and monitoring devices for electrical power distribution to the rest of the Telescope. Two buses are dedicated to the OTA, science instruments, and SI C&DH; two supply the SSM. Each PDU measures 10 x 5 x 18 in. (25 x 12.5 x 45 cm) and weighs 25 lb (11 kg).      5.1.6 Thermal Control      Multilayer insulation (MLI) covers 80 percent of the Telescope’s exterior, and supplemental electric heaters maintain its temperatures within safe limits. The insulation blankets are 15 layers of aluminized Kapton, with an outer layer of aluminized Teflon flexible optical solar reflector (FOSR). Aluminized or silvered flexible reflector tape covers most of the remaining exterior. These coverings protect against the cold of space and reflect solar heat. In addition, reflective or absorptive paints are used.     The SSM Thermal Control Subsystem (TCS) maintains temperatures within set limits for the components mounted in the Equipment Section and structures interfacing with the OTA and science instruments. The TCS maintains safe component temperatures even for worst-case conditions such as environmental fluctuations, passage from ""cold"" Earth shadow to ""hot"" solar exposure during each orbit, and heat generated from equipment operation.     Specific thermal-protection features of the SSM include:     • MLI thermal blankets for the light shield and forward shell     • Aluminum FOSR tape on the aperture door surface facing the sun     • Specific patterns of FOSR and MLI blankets on the exteriors of the Equipment Section bay doors, with internal MLI blankets on the bulkheads to maintain thermal balance between bays     • Efficient placement of equipment and use of equipment bay space to match temperature requirements, such as placing heat-dissipating equipment on the side of the Equipment Section mostly exposed to orbit shadow     • Silvered FOSR tape on the aft shroud and aft bulkhead exteriors     • Radiation shields inside the aft shroud doors and MLI blankets on the aft bulkhead and shroud interiors to protect the science instruments     • More than 200 temperature sensors and thermistors placed throughout the SSM, externally and internally, to monitor individual components and control heater operations.     Figure 5-16 shows the location and type of thermal protection used on the SSM. SM2 observations identified degradations of all of the MLI. Additional material will be installed during SM3A to cover some of the degraded material and restore the external layer surface properties. The additional material has been life-tested to an equivalent of 10 years.     The layer being added to the SSM Equipment Section is a composite-coated (silicone dioxide) stainless steel layer, known as the New Outer Blanket Layer (NOBL). The light shield/ forward shell material is Teflon with a scrim backing for durability.       5.1.7 Safing (Contingency) System      Overlapping or redundant Telescope equipment safeguards against any breakdown. Nonetheless, a contingency or Safing System exists for emergency operations. It uses many pointing control and data management components as well as dedicated PSEA hardware. This system maintains stable Telescope attitude, moves the SAs for maximum Sun exposure, and conserves electrical power by minimizing power drain. The Safing System can operate the spacecraft indefinitely with no communications link to ground control.     During scientific observations (normal mode), the Safing System is relegated to monitor automatically Telescope onboard functions. The system sends Advanced-Computer-generated ""keep-alive"" signals to the PSEA that indicate all Telescope systems are functioning. Entry into the Safemode is autonomous once a failure is detected.    The Safing System is designed to follow a progression of contingency operating modes, depending on the situation aboard theTelescope. If a malfunction occurs and does not   threaten the Telescope’s survival, the Safing System moves into a Software Inertial Hold Mode. This mode holds the Telescope in the last position commanded. If a maneuver is in  progress, the Safing System completes the maneuver, then holds the Telescope in that position, suspending all science operations. Only ground control can return to science operations from Safemode.    If the system detects a marginal electrical power problem, or if an internal PCS safety check fails, the Telescope enters the Software Sun Point Mode. The Safing System maneuvers the Telescope so the SAs point toward the Sun to continuously generate solar power. Telescope  equipment is maintained within operating temperatures and above survival temperatures,anticipating a return to normal operations. The STOCC must intercede to correct the malfunction before any science operations or normal functions can be resumed.     Since deployment of the Telescope in 1990, the Safing System has seen additional improvements to increase its robustness to survive hardware failures and still protect the Telescope. Paragraph 5.1.4 describes these features.     For the modes described above, the Safing System operates through computer software. If conditions worsen, the system turns over control to the PSEA in Hardware Sun Point Mode. Problems that could provoke this action include any of the following:     • Computer malfunction     • Batteries losing more than 50 percent of their charge     • Two of the three RGAs failing     • DMS failing.     If these conditions occur, the Advanced Computer stops sending keep-alive signals. This is the ""handshake"" mechanism between the flight software and the PSEA.     In the Hardware Sun Point Mode, the PSEA computer commands the Telescope and turns off selected equipment to conserve power. Components shut down include the Advanced Computer and, within two hours, the SI C&DH. Before this, a payload (instruments) safing sequence begins and, if it has not already done so, the Telescope turns the SAs toward the Sun, guided by the CSSs. The PSEA removes operating power from equipment not required for Telescope survival.     Once ground control is alerted to a problem, NASA management of the STOCC convenes a failure analysis team to evaluate the problem and seek the best and safest corrective action while the Safing System maintains control of the Telescope.     The failure analysis team is led by a senior management representative from NASA/GSFC with the authority not only to call upon the expertise of engineers and scientists employed by NASA or its support contractors, but also to draft support from any organization previously affiliated with the Telescope Project. The failure analysis team is chartered to identify the nature of the anomaly and to recommend corrective action. This recommendation is reviewed at a higher management level of NASA/GSFC. All changes to the Telescope’s hardware and all software configurations require NASA Level I concurrence as specified in the HST Level I Operations Requirements Document.      Pointing/Safemode Electronics and Retrieval Mode Gyro Assemblies.     The PSEA consists of 40 electronic printed-board circuits with redundant functions to run the Telescope, even in the case of internal circuit failure. It weighs 86 lb (39 kg) and is installed in the Equipment Section Bay 8. A backup gyroscope package, the RMGA, is dedicated for the PSEA and is also located in Bay 8. The RMGA consists of three gyroscopes. These are lower quality rate sensors than the RGAs because they are not intended for use during observations.      5.2 Optical Telescope Assembly      The OTA was designed and built by the Perkin-Elmer Corporation (Raytheon Optical Systems, Inc.). Although the OTA is modest in size by ground-based observatory standards and has a straightforward optical design, its accuracy – coupled with its place above the Earth’s atmosphere – renders its performance superior.     The OTA uses a ""folded"" design, common to large telescopes, which enables a long focal length of 189 ft (57.6 m) to be packaged into a small telescope length of 21 ft (6.4 m). (Several smaller mirrors in the science instruments are designed similarly to lengthen the light path within the particular science instrument.) This form of telescope is called a Cassegrain, and its compactness is an essential component of an observatory designed to fit inside the Shuttle cargo bay.     Conventional in design, the OTA is unconventional in other aspects. Large telescopes at ground-based sites are limited in their performance by the resolution attainable while operating under the Earth’s atmosphere, but the HST orbits high above the atmosphere and provides an unobstructed view of the universe. For this reason the OTA was designed and built with exacting tolerances to provide near-perfect image quality over the broadest possible region of the spectrum.     The OTA is a variant of the Cassegrain, called a Ritchey-Chretien, in which both the mirrors are hyperboloidal in shape (having a deeper curvature than a parabolic mirror). This form is completely corrected for coma (an image observation having a ""tail"") and spherical aberrations to provide an aplanatic system in which aberrations are correct everywhere in the FOV. The only residual aberrations are field curvature and astigmatism. Both of these are zero exactly in the center of the field and increase toward the edge of the field. These aberrations are easily corrected within the instrument optics. For example, in the Faint Object Camera (FOC) there is a small telescope designed to remove image astigmatism.     Figure 5-17 shows the path of a light ray from a distant star as it travels through the Telescope to the focus. Light travels down the tube, past baffles that attenuate reflected light from unwanted bright sources, to the 94.5-in. (2.4-m) primary mirror. Reflecting off the front surface of the concave mirror, the light bounces back up the tube to the 12-in. (0.3-m)-diameter convex secondary mirror. The light is now reflected and converged through a 23.5-in. (60-cm) hole in the primary mirror to the Telescope focus, 3.3 ft (1.5 m) behind the primary mirror.        Four science instruments and three FGSs share the focal plane by a system of mirrors. A small ""folding"" mirror in the center of the FOV directs light into the WFPC2. The remaining ""science"" field is divided among three axial science instruments, each receiving a quadrant of the circular FOV. Around the outside of the science field, a ""guidance"" field is divided among the three FGSs by their own folding mirrors. Each FGS receives 60 arcmin  2  of field in a 90-degree sector. Figure 5-18 shows instrument/sensor fields of view.        The OTA hosts the science instruments and FGSs in that it maintains the structural support and optical-image stability required for these instruments to fulfill their functions (see Fig. 5-19). Components of the OTA are the primary mirror, the secondary mirror, the FPS, and the OTA Equipment Section. Perkin-Elmer Corporation designed and built all the optical assemblies; Lockheed Martin built the OTA equipment section.         5.2.1 Primary Mirror Assembly and Spherical Aberration      As the Telescope was put through its paces on orbit in 1990, scientists discovered its primary mirror had a spherical aberration. The outer edge of the 8-foot (2.4-m) primary mirror was ground too flat by a width equal to 1/50 the thickness of a sheet of paper (about 2 microns). After intensive investigation, the problem was traced to faulty test equipment used to define and measure mirror curvature. The optical component of this test equipment was slightly out of focus and, as a result, had shown the mirror to be ground correctly. After the discovery, Ball Aerospace scientists and engineers built the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR). The COSTAR was installed during the First Servicing Mission in December 1993 and brought the Telescope back to its original specifications.     The primary mirror assembly consists of the mirror supported inside the main ring, which is the structural backbone of the Telescope, and the main and central baffles shown in Fig. 5-20. This assembly provides the structural coupling to the rest of the spacecraft through a set of kinematic brackets linking the main ring to the SSM. The assembly also supports the OTA baffles. Its major parts are:     • Primary mirror     • Main ring structure     • Reaction plate and actuators     • Main and central baffles.         Primary Mirror.     The primary mirror blank, a product of Corning Glass Works, is known as ultralow-expansion (ULE) glass. It was chosen for its very low-expansion coefficient, which ensures the Telescope minimum sensitivity to temperature changes. The mirror is of a ""sandwich"" construction: two lightweight facesheets separated by a core, or filling, of glass honeycomb ribs in a rectangular grid (see Fig. 5-21). This construction results in an 1800-lb (818-kg) mirror instead of an 8000-lb solid-glass mirror.        Perkin-Elmer (now Raytheon Optical Systems, Inc.) ground the mirror blank, 8 ft (2.4 m) in diameter, to shape in its large optics fabrication facility. When it was close to its final hyperboloidal shape, the mirror was transferred to Perkin-Elmer’s computer-controlled polishing facility. After being ground and polished, the mirror was coated with a reflective layer of aluminum and a protective layer of magnesium fluoride only 0.1 and 0.025 micrometer thick,   respectively. The fluoride layer protects the aluminum from oxidation and enhances reflectance at the important hydrogen emission line known as Lyman-Alpha. The reflective quality of the mirror is better than 70 percent at 1216 angstroms (Lyman-Alpha) in the ultraviolet spectral range and better than 85 percent for visible light.     The primary mirror is mounted to the main ring through a set of kinematic linkages. The linkages attach to the mirror by three rods that penetrate the glass for axial constraint and by three pads bonded to the back of the glass for lateral support.      Main Ring.     The main ring encircles the primary mirror; supports the mirror, the main baffle and central baffle, and the metering truss; and integrates the elements of the Telescope to the spacecraft. The titanium ring is a hollow box beam 15 in. (38 cm) thick, weighing 1200 lb (545.5 kg), with an outside diameter of 9.8 ft (2.9 m) (see Fig. 5-22). It is suspended inside the SSM by a kinematic support.         Reaction Plate.  The reaction plate is a wheel of I-beams forming a bulkhead behind the main ring, spanning its diameter. It radiates from a central ring that supports the central baffle. Its primary function is to carry an array of heaters that warm the back of the primary mirror, maintaining its temperature at 70 degrees. Made of lightweight, stiff beryllium, the plate also supports 24 figure-control actuators attached to the primary mirror and arranged around the reaction plate in two concentric circles. These can be commanded from the ground, if necessary, to make small corrections to the shape of the mirror.      Baffles.  The baffles of the OTA prevent stray light from bright objects, such as the Sun, Moon, and Earth, from reflecting down the Telescope tube to the focal plane. The primary mirror assembly includes two of the three assembly baffles.     Attached to the front face of the main ring, the outer, main baffle is an aluminum cylinder 9 ft (2.7 m) in diameter and 15.7 ft (4.8 m) long. Internal fins help it attenuate stray light. The central baffle is 10 ft (3 m) long, conical in shape,   and attached to the reaction plate through a hole in the center of the primary mirror. It extends down the centerline of the Telescope tube. The baffle interiors are painted flat black to minimize light reflection.      5.2.2 Secondary Mirror Assembly      The Secondary Mirror Assembly cantilevers off the front face of the main ring and supports the secondary mirror at exactly the correct position in front of the primary mirror. This position must be accurate within 1/10,000 in. whenever the Telescope is operating. The assembly consists of the mirror subassembly, a light baffle, and an outer graphite-epoxy metering truss support structure (see Fig. 5-23).        The Secondary Mirror Assembly contains the mirror, mounted on three pairs of alignment actuators that control its position and orientation. All are enclosed within the central hub at the forward end of the truss support.     The secondary mirror has a magnification of 10.4X, converting the primary-mirror converging rays from f/2.35 to a focal ratio system prime focus of f/24 and sending them back toward the center of the primary mirror, where they pass through the central baffle to the focal point. The mirror is a convex hyperboloid 12 in. (0.3 m) in diameter and made of Zerodur glass coated with aluminum and magnesium fluoride. Steeply convex, its surface accuracy is even greater than that of the primary mirror.     Ground command adjusts the actuators to align the secondary mirror to provide perfect image quality. The adjustments are calculated from data picked up by tiny optical control system sensors located in the FGSs.     The principal structural element of the Secondary Mirror Assembly is the metering truss, a cage with 48 latticed struts attached to three rings and a central support structure for the secondary mirror. The truss, 16 ft (4.8 m) long and 9 ft (2.7 m) in diameter, is a graphite, fiber-reinforced epoxy structure. Graphite was chosen for its high stiffness, light weight, and ability to reduce the structure’s expansiveness to nearly zero. This is vital because the secondary mirror must stay perfectly placed relative to the primary mirror, accurate to within 0.0001 in. (2.5 micrometers) when the Telescope operates.     The truss attaches at one end to the front face of the main ring of the Primary Mirror Assembly. The other end has a central hub that houses the secondary mirror and baffle along the optical axis. Aluminized mylar MLI in the truss compensates for temperature variations of up to 30 degrees Fahrenheit when the Telescope is in Earth’s shadow so the primary and secondary mirrors remain aligned.     The conical secondary mirror subassembly light baffle extends almost to the primary mirror. It reduces the stray bright-object light from sources outside the Telescope FOV.      5.2.3 Focal Plane Structure Assembly      The FPS is a large optical bench that physically supports the science instruments and FGSs and aligns them with the image focal plane of the Telescope. The -V3 side of the structure, away from the Sun in space, supports the FHSTs and RSUs (see Fig. 5-24). It also provides facilities for on-orbit replacement of any instruments and thermal isolation between instruments.        The structure is 7 ft (2.1 m) by 10 ft (3.04 m) long and weighs more than 1200 lb (545.5 kg). Because it must have extreme thermal stability and be stiff, lightweight, and strong, the FPS is constructed of graphite-epoxy, augmented with mechanical fasteners and metallic joints at strength-critical locations. It is equipped with metallic mounts and supports for Orbital Replacement Units (ORU) used during maintenance.     The FPS cantilevers off the rear face of the main ring, attached at eight flexible points that adjust to eliminate thermal distortions. The structure provides a fixed alignment for the FGSs. It has guiderails and latches at each instrument mounting location so Shuttle crews can easily exchange science instruments and other equipment in orbit.      5.2.4 OTA Equipment Section      The Equipment Section for the OTA is a large semicircular set of compartments mounted outside the spacecraft on the forward shell of the SSM (see Fig. 5-25). It contains the OTA Electrical Power and Thermal Control Electronics (EP/TCE) System, Fine Guidance Electronics (FGE), Actuator Control Electronics (ACE), Optical Control Electronics (OCE), and the fourth DMS DIU. The OTA Equipment Section has nine bays: seven for equipment storage and two for support. All bays have outward-opening doors for easy astronaut access, cabling and connectors for the electronics, and heaters and insulation for thermal control.        The EP/TCE System distributes power from the SSM EPS and the OTA system. Thermostats regulate mirror temperatures and prevent mirror distortion from the cold of space. The electrical and thermal electronics also collect thermal sensor data for transmission to the ground.     The three FGE units provide power, commands, and telemetry to each FGS. The electronics perform computations for the sensor and interface with the spacecraft pointing system for effective Telescope line-of-sight pointing and stabilization. There is a guidance electronics assembly for each guidance sensor.     The ACE unit provides the command and telemetry interface to the 24 actuators attached to the primary mirror and to the six actuators attached to the secondary mirror. These electronics select which actuator to move and monitor its response to the command.   Positioning commands go from the ground to the electronics through the DIU.     The OCE unit controls the optical control sensors. These white-light interferometers measure the optical quality of the OTA and send the data to the ground for analysis. There is one optical control sensor for each FGS, but the OCE unit runs all control sensors. The DIU is an electronic interface between the other OTA electronics units and the Telescope command and telemetry system.      5.3 Fine Guidance Sensor      The three FGSs are located at 90-degree intervals around the circumference of the focal plane structure, between the structure frame and the main ring. Each sensor is 5.4 ft (1.5 m) long and 3.3 ft (1 m) wide and weighs 485 lb (220 kg).     Each FGS enclosure houses a guidance sensor and a wavefront sensor. The wavefront sensors are elements of the optical control sensor used to align and optimize the optical system of the Telescope.     The Telescope’s ability to remain pointing at a distant target to within 0.005 arcsec for long periods of time is due largely to the accuracy of the FGSs. They lock on a star and measure any apparent motion to an accuracy of 0.0028 arcsec. This is equivalent to seeing from New York City the motion of a landing light on an aircraft flying over San Francisco.     When two sensors lock on a target, the third measures the angular position of a star, a process called astrometry. Sensor astrometric functions are discussed in Section 4. During SM2 a re-certified FGS (S/N 2001) was installed as a replacement in the HST FGS Bay 1. During SM3A a re-certified FGS (S/N 2002) will be installed in the HST FGS Bay 2.      5.3.1 Fine Guidance Sensor Composition and Function      Each FGS consists of a large structure housing a collection of mirrors, lenses, servos to locate an image, prisms to fine-track the image, beam splitters, and four photomultiplier tubes, as shown in Fig. 5-26. The entire mechanism adjusts to move the Telescope into precise alignment with a target star. Each FGS has a large (60 arcmin  2  ) FOV to search for and track stars, and a 5.0 arcsec  2  FOV used by the detector prisms to pinpoint the star.        The sensors work in pairs to aim the Telescope. The Guide Star Selection System, developed by the Science Institute, catalogs and charts guide stars near each observation target to make it   easier to find the target. First, one sensor searches for a target guide star. After the first sensor locks onto a guide star, the second sensor locates and locks onto another target guide star. The guide stars, once designated and located, keep the image of the observation target in the aperture of the selected science instrument.     Each FGS uses a 90-degree sector of the Telescope’s FOV outside the central ""science"" field. This region of the FOV has the greatest astigmatic and curvature distortions. The size of the FGS’s FOV was chosen to heighten the probability of finding an appropriate guide star, even in the direction of the lowest star population near the galactic poles.     An FGS ""pickoff"" mirror intercepts the incoming stellar image and projects it into the sensor’s large FOV. Each FGS FOV has 60 arcmin  2  available. The guide star of interest can be anywhere within this field, so the FGS will look anywhere in that field to find it. After finding the star, the sensor locks onto it and sends error signals to the Telescope, telling it how to move to keep the star image perfectly still.     The FGS can move its line of sight anywhere within its large FOV using a pair of star selector servos. Each can be thought of as an optical gimbal: One servo moves in a north-south direction, the other east and west. They steer the small FOV (5 arcsec  2  ) of the FGS detectors to any position in the sensor field. Encoders within each servo system send back the exact coordinates of the detector field centers at any point.     Because the exact location of a guide star may be uncertain, the star selector servos also can cause the detector to search the region around the most probable guide star position. It searches in a spiral pattern, starting at the center and spiraling out until it finds the guide star it seeks. Then the detectors are commanded to go into fine-track mode and hold the star image exactly centered in the FOV, while the star selector servo encoders send information about the position of the star to the spacecraft PCS.     The detectors are a pair of interferometers, called Koester’s prisms, coupled to photomultiplier tubes (see Fig. 5-27). Each detector operates in one axis, so two detectors are needed. Operating on the incoming wavefront from the distant guide star, the interferometers compare the wave phase at one edge of the Telescope’s entrance aperture with   the phase at the opposite edge. When the phases are equal, the star is exactly centered. Any phase difference shows a pointing error that must be corrected.        Along the optical path from Telescope to detector are additional optical elements that turn or fold the beam to fit everything inside the FGS enclosure, and to correct the Telescope’s astigmatism and field curvature. All optical elements are mounted on a temperature-controlled, graphite-epoxy composite optical bench.      5.3.2 Articulated Mirror System      Analysis of the FGS on-orbit data revealed that minor misalignments of the optical pupil centering on Koester’s prism interferometer in the presence of spherical aberration prevented the FGS from achieving its optimum performance. During the recertification of FGS (S/N 2001), fold flat #3 in the radial bay module optical train was mechanized to allow on-orbit alignment of the pupil.     Implementation of this system utilized existing signals and commands by rerouting them with a unique interface harness enhancement kit (OCE-EK) interfacing the OCE, the DIU, and the Fine Guidance System/Radial Bay Module (FGS/RBM). The OCE-EK was augmented with the Actuator Mechanism Electronics (AME) and the fold flat #3 Actuator Mechanism Assembly (AMA) located internal to the FGS/RBM. Ground tests indicate a substantial increase in performance of the FGS with this innovative design improvement.      5.4 Solar Array and Jitter Problems      From the beginning, in the late 1970s, the SAs – designed by the European Space Agency and built by British Aerospace, Space Systems – have been scheduled for replacement because of their power loss from radiation exposure in space. However, as engineers put the Telescope through its paces in April 1990, they discovered two problems: a loss of focus and images that jittered briefly when the Telescope flew into and out of Earth’s shadow. The jitter problem was traced to the two large SAs. Abrupt temperature changes, from -150 to 200 degrees Fahrenheit during orbit, cause the panels to distort twice during each orbit. As a temporary fix, engineers created software that commanded the PCS to compensate for the jitter automatically. The problem was mitigated during SM1 by the replacement of the old arrays with new ones that had been modified to reduce thermal swings of the bi-stems.      5.4.1 Configuration      The SAs are two large rectangular wings of retractable solar cell blankets fixed on a two-stem frame. The blanket unfurls from a cassette in the middle of the wing. A spreader bar at each end of the wing stretches the blanket and maintains tension. For the replacement SAs delivered to the Telescope during the First Servicing Mission, the spring-loaded roller assembly was replaced by a series of springs connecting the spreader bar to the blanket. This change eliminated the jitter induced into the Telescope as it passed from eclipse (night) into sunlight (day) each orbit.     The wings are on arms that connect to a drive assembly on the SSM forward shell at one end and to the secondary deployment mechanism (blankets and bistems) on the other end. The total length of the cassette, arm, and drive is 15.7 ft (4.8 m) (see Fig. 5-28).        Each wing has 10 panels that roll out from the cassette. The panels are made of 2438 solar cells attached to a glass-fiber/Kapton surface, with silver mesh wiring underneath, covered by another layer of Kapton. The blankets are less than 500 micrometers thick, so they roll up tightly when the wings are stowed. Each wing weighs 17 lb (7.7 kg) and, at full extension, is 40 ft (12.1 m) long and 8.2 ft (2.5 m) wide.      5.4.2 Solar Array Subsystems      The SA subsystems include the primary and secondary deployment mechanisms, their drives, and associated electronics.     The primary deployment mechanism raises the SA mast from the side of the SSM to a standing position perpendicular to the Telescope. There are two mechanisms, one for each wing. Each mechanism has motors to raise the mast and supports to hold it in place when erect.     An astronaut can raise the array mast manually if the drive power fails. Using a wrench fitting on the deployment drive, the astronaut handcranks the mast after releasing the latches.     Once the SA is raised, the secondary deployment mechanism unfurls the wing blankets. Each wing has a secondary mechanism assembly: a cassette drum to hold solar panels, a cushion to protect the blanket, and motors and subassemblies. The assembly rolls out the blanket, applies tension evenly so the blankets stretch, and transfers data and power along the wing assembly. The blanket can roll out completely or part way. The secondary deployment mechanism also has a manual override (see Fig. 5-29).       A SA drive at the base of each mast rotates the deployed array toward the Sun, turning in either direction. Each drive has a motor that rotates the mast on command and a brake to keep the array in a fixed position with respect to the Telescope. The drive can move and lock the SA into any position.     Each drive has a clamp ring that acts as a release mechanism if opened. This allows a crew member to jettison the entire SA if necessary.     Two electronics assemblies (boxes) – the Solar Array Deployment Electronics and the Solar Array Drive Electronics – control and monitor all functions of each SA. They provide the electronic interface to the other Telescope systems and generate the commands for the primary and secondary deployment mechanisms and the SA drive.      5.4.3 Solar Array Configuration for Servicing Mission 3A      The Solar Array wings will remain deployed during servicing. This will allow the Telescope’s batteries to remain fully charged during the mission and will not impact servicing activities.      5.5 Science Instrument Control and Data Handling Unit      The SI C&DH unit keeps all science instrument systems synchronized. It works with the DMU to process, format, temporarily store on the data recorders, or transmit all science and engineering data created by the instruments to the ground. Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corporation and IBM built this unit.      5.5.1 Components      The SI C&DH unit is a collection of electronic components attached to an ORU tray mounted on the door of Bay 10 in the SSM Equipment Section (see Fig. 5-30). Small Remote Interface Units (RIU), also part of the system, provide the interface to individual science instruments. Components of the SI C&DH unit are the NASA Standard Spacecraft Computer (NSCC-I), two standard interface circuit boards for the computer, two control units/science data formatter units, two CPU modules, a PCU, two RIUs, and various memory, data, and command communications lines (buses) connected by couplers. The SI C&DH components are redundant so the system can recover from any single failure.         NASA Computer.     The NSSC-I has a CPU and eight memory modules, each holding 8,192 eighteen-bit words. One embedded software program (the ""executive"") runs the computer. It moves data, commands, and operation programs (called applications) for individual science instruments in and out of the processing unit. The application programs monitor and control specific instruments and analyze and manipulate the collected data. The memory stores operational commands for execution when the Telescope is not in contact with the ground. Each memory unit has five areas reserved for commands and programs unique to each science instrument. The computer can be reprogrammed from the ground for future requests or for working around failed equipment.      Standard Interface Unit.     The standard interface board is the communications bridge between the computer and the CU/SDF.      Control Unit/Science Data Formatter.     The heart of the SI C&DH unit is the CU/SDF. It formats and sends all commands and data to designated destinations such as the DMU of the SSM, the NASA computer, and the science instruments. The unit has a microprocessor for control and formatting functions.      The CU/SDF receives ground commands, data requests, science and engineering data, and system signals. Two examples of system signals are ""time tags,"" clock signals that synchronize the entire spacecraft, and ""processor interface tables,"" or communications codes. The CU/SDF transmits commands and requests after formatting them so that the specific destination unit can read. For example, ground commands and SSM commands are transmitted with different formats. Ground commands use 27-bit words, and SSM commands use 16-bit words. The formatter translates each command signal into a common format. The CU/SDF also reformats and sends engineering and science data. Onboard analysis of the data is an NSSC-I function.      Power Control Unit.     The PCU distributes and switches power among components of the SI C&DH unit. It conditions the power required by each unit. For example: The computer memory boards typically need +5 volts, -5 volts, and +12 volts; the CU/SDF, on the other hand, requires +28 volts. The PCU ensures that all voltage requirements are met.      Remote Interface Units.     RIUs transmit commands, clock and other system signals, and engineering data between the science instruments and the SI C&DH unit. The RIUs do not send science data. There are six RIUs in the Telescope: five attached to the science instruments and one dedicated to the CU/SDF and PCUs in the SI C&DH unit. Each RIU can be coupled with up to two expander units.    Communications Buses.     The SI C&DH unit contains data bus lines that pass signals and data between the unit and the science instruments. Each bus is multiplexed: one line sends system messages, commands, and engineering data requests to the module units, and a reply line transmits requested information and science data back to the SI C&DH unit. A coupler attaches the bus to each remote unit. This isolates the module if the RIU should fail. The SI C&DH coupler unit is on the ORU tray.      5.5.2 Operation      The SI C&DH unit handles science instrument system monitoring (such as timing and system checks), command processing, and data processing.      System Monitoring.     Engineering data tells the monitoring computer whether instrument systems are functioning. At regular intervals, varying from every 500 milliseconds to every 40 seconds, the SI C&DH unit scans all monitoring devices for engineering data and passes data to the NSCC-I or SSM computer. The computers process or store the information. Any failure indicated by these constant tests could initiate a ""safing hold"" situation (see para 5.1.7), and thus a suspension of science operations.      Command Processing.     Figure 5-31 shows the flow of commands within the SI C&DH unit. Commands enter the CU/SDF (bottom right in the drawing) through the SSM Command DIU (ground commands) or the DIU (SSM commands). The CU/SDF checks and reformats the commands, which then go either to the RIUs or to the NSCC-I for storage. ""Time-tagged"" commands, stored in the computer’s memory (top right of drawing), also follow this process.        Each command is interpreted as ""real time,"" as if the SI C&DH just received it. Many commands actually are onboard stored commands activated by certain situations. For example, when the Telescope is positioned for a programmed observation using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph, that program is activated. The SI C&DH can issue certain requests to the SSM, such as to execute a limited number of pointing control functions to make small Telescope maneuvers.      Science Data Processing.     Science data can come from all science instruments at once. The CU/ SDF transfers incoming data through computer memory locations called packet buffers. It fills each buffer in order, switching among them as the buffers fill and empty. Each data packet goes from the buffer to the NSCC-I for further processing, or directly to the SSM for storage in the data recorders or transmission to the ground. Data returns to the CU/SDF after computer processing. When transmitting, the CU/ SDF must send a continuous stream of data, either full packet buffers or empty buffers called filler packets, to maintain a synchronized link with the SSM. Special checking codes (Reed-Solomon and pseudo-random noise) can be added to the data as options. Figure 5-32 shows the flow of science data in the Telescope.         5.6 Space Support Equipment      The Hubble Space Telescope was designed to be maintained, repaired, and enhanced while in orbit, extending its life and usefulness. For servicing, the Space Shuttle will capture and position the Telescope vertically in the aft end of the cargo bay, and the crew will perform maintenance and replacement tasks. The Space Support Equipment (SSE) to be used during the mission provides a maintenance platform to hold the Telescope, provides electrical support of the Telescope during servicing, and provides storage for replacement components known as ORUs.      The major SSE items used for the Servicing Mission 3A are the Flight Support System (FSS) and the ORU Carrier (ORUC). Additionally, crew aids and tools will be used during servicing.      5.6.1 Flight Support System      The FSS provides the platform that holds the Telescope during servicing (see Fig. 5-33). The FSS has been used in different configurations for the HST First and Second Servicing Missions, the Solar Maximum Repair Mission, and the Upper Atmospheric Research Satellite Deploy Mission. The FSS consists of two major components: a horseshoe-shaped cradle and a supporting latch beam providing a structural and electrical interface with the Shuttle. A circular ring called the Berthing and Positioning System (BAPS) interfaces with the Telescope, allowing it to pivot or rotate during the mission.        The BAPS ring is pivoted down and locked for liftoff. During the mission, the ring is pivoted up to a horizontal position. A closed-circuit television camera mounted to the FSS helps astronauts guide the Telescope onto the ring. Three remote-controlled latches on the ring grab and hold three towel-rack-like pins on the rear of the Telescope. A remote-controlled electrical umbilical connector on the FSS engages the Telescope, providing it with orbiter power through the FSS. This power helps relieve the drain on the Telescope’s batteries during the mission. Radio communications provide telescope telemetry data and control.     Once the Telescope is berthed to the ring (see Fig. 5-34), the FSS can pivot (tilt) or rotate the Telescope. This positions the appropriate region of the Telescope for access during extravehicular activity. Additionally, the ring can pivot the Telescope to an appropriate attitude for orbiter reboost.        During the first EVA, crew members will install the BAPS Support Post (BSP). The BSP provides an additional linkage to support and isolate   Telescope during EVAs and for any orbital reboosts. The BSP will remain in position for landing.    Astronauts remotely control all FSS mechanisms – berthing latches, umbilical connector, pivoter, BSP lock, rotator, and ring down-lock – from the orbiter’s aft flight deck, providing the crew maximum flexibility. Besides being fully electrically redundant, each mechanism contains manual overrides and backups to ensure mission success and astronaut safety.      5.6.2 Orbital Replacement Unit Carrier      An ORUC is used to carry replacements into orbit and to return replaced units to Earth. The carrier consists of a Spacelab pallet outfitted with shelves and protective enclosures to hold the replacement units (see Fig. 5-35). Items on the ORUC for SM3A include (1) the Advanced Computer and two spare VIKs in the LOPE and (2) a Solid State Recorder, an S-Band Single Access Transmitter, the Rate Sensor Units, and associated flight harnesses in the COPE.        The FGS will be transported in the FGS Scientific Instrument Protective Enclosure (FSIPE). A spare Advanced Computer, a spare Rate Sensor Unit, and Multi-Layer Insulation patches will be carried in the Axial Scientific Instrument Protective Enclosure (ASIPE). The NOBL will be carried in a NOBL Protective Enclosure (NPE).     All ORUs and scientific instruments are carried within protective enclosures to provide them a benign environment throughout the mission. The enclosures protect the instruments from contamination and maintain the temperature of the instruments or ORUs within tight limits.     Instruments are mounted in the enclosures using the same manually driven latch system that holds instruments in the Telescope. The ASIPE and FSIPE are mounted to the pallet on a spring system that reduces the level of vibration the instruments receive, especially during liftoff and landing.     The other ORUs are carried in an additional enclosure called the Large ORU Protective Enclosure (LOPE). The enclosure also provides contamination and thermal control, though not to such stringent requirements as the SIPE. The LOPE contains Transport Modules that are designed to custom fit each ORU. The transport modules have foam or Visco-Elastic Material that surrounds the ORU and isolates it from launch and landing vibration environments.     During the change-out process, replaced science instruments are stored temporarily in the ORUC. A typical change-out begins with an astronaut removing the old instrument from the Telescope and attaching it to a bracket on the ORUC. The astronaut then removes the new instrument from its protective enclosure and installs it in the Telescope. Finally, the astronaut places the old instrument in the appropriate protective enclosure for return to Earth.      The ORUC receives power for its TCS from the FSS. The carrier also provides temperature telemetry data through the FSS for readout in the Shuttle and on the ground during the mission.      5.6.3 Crew Aids      Astronauts perform extravehicular activities using many tools to replace instruments and equipment, to move around the Telescope and the cargo bay, and to operate manual override drives. Tools and equipment, bolts, connectors, and other hardware were standardized not only for the Telescope but also between the Telescope and the Shuttle. For example, grappling receptacles share common features.     To move around the Telescope, the crew uses 225 ft of handrails encircling the spacecraft. For visibility, the rails are painted yellow. In addition, the crew can hold onto guiderails, trunnion bars, and scuff plates fore and aft.     The astronauts can install portable handhold plates where there are no permanent holds, such as on the FGS. Another tool is the Portable Foot Restraint (PFR), shown in Fig. 5-36.        While the astronauts work, they use tethers to hook tools to their suits and tie replacement units to the Telescope. Each crew member has a ratchet wrench to manually crank the antenna and array masts if power for the mast drives fails. A power wrench also is available if handcranking is too time consuming. Other hand tools include portable lights and a jettison handle, which attach to sockets on the aperture door and to SA wings so the crew can push the equipment away from the Telescope."

GX236-44-14051926	"December 2000  CLASSIFICATION DEFINITIONS  376 - 1  CLASS 376, INDUCED NUCLEAR REACTIONS: PROCESSES, SYSTEMS, AND ELEMENTS SECTION I - CLASS DEFINITION This class provides for patents directed to processes involving induced nuclear reactions and structures which implement such processes. (1) Note. For purposes of classification in this class, an induced nuclear reaction is defined as a change in the nucleus of an atom brought about by subjecting it (the nucleus) to (a) an impact with other nuclei of the same or different type, or (b) an impact with, or bombardment by, subatomic particles or high energy electromag netic radiations. Note. Reactions of type (a) in (1) Note, above, include those which cause or result in the combining or uniting of at least two nuclei to form a different nucleus which reactions are generally referred to as fusion reactions. Reactions of type (b) in (1) Note, above, include (1) those which cause a splitting or subdivision of the nucleus (usu ally a heavy nucleus) into a plurality of dif ferent nuclei and are generally referred to as fission reactions, and (2) those which result in a single but different nucleus of the same or a different element and are gener ally referred to as transmutations. Note. A basis for placing a patent into this class is that a nuclear reactor be claimed or that it be utilized to obtain a nuclear reac tion even though the sole or primary aim of the patent in regard to the reactor is to obtain useful nuclear energy or to utilize such nuclear energy yielding system for conversion into other forms of useful energy or power. This is true even though from a chemical view there may be nothing novel, or from an economical view, nothing of value, with respect to the products or materials resulting from the nuclear reac tion. Note. Patents to processes are not segre gated from patents to the structure, but are classified together depending upon the type of structure claimed or used in the claimed process.  Included within the scope of the class are patents directed to (a) the nuclear reactor as a system of elements or parts so interrelated as to produce induced nuclear reactions and to (b) such elements or parts, per se, as are essential and peculiar components of nuclear reactors. Included among (a), for example, are neutron detectors wherein the detection takes place by means of an induced nuclear reaction. Included among (b), for example, are fuel element structures (including fuel ""targets"" or ""pellets""), con trol component structures, moderator com ponent structures, fuel element storage structures, and refueling machines.  SECTION II - LINES WITH OTHER CLASSES AND WITHIN THIS CLASS Also included in this class are the following (see Subclass References to the Current Class, below, for subclass references): (1) Note. Patents to processes or apparatus including a step or means for (a) converting the nucleus of a substance other than the reactor fuel to a nucleus of another substance, (b) treating or irradiating of material, or (c) making a material radioactive, all within such reactor, including for such purposes as the production of nuclear fuel or experimentation, study or research, etc. Note. Patents to processes or apparatus including a step or means for converting the nucleus of a substance or for making a substance radioactive by bombardment with accelerated particles from a source other than a nuclear reactor. Note. Patents directed to combination of a process or apparatus under the class defini tion with a step or means, e.g., (a) of cool ing or heat exchange even though the purpose is to generate steam for extraneous uses, or (b) with a step or means for carry ing out of a chemical reaction, etc. Note. Patents to processes or apparatus including an arrangement of steps or means for amplifying neutrons of a subcritical mass to controllable fission reaction levels, i.e., subcritical reactors.  (2)  (3)  (2)  (3)  (4)  (4)  December 2000 Edition   376 - 2  CLASSIFICATION DEFINITIONS  December 2000  (5)  Note. Patents to all devices, structures, and processes for irradiating a nucleus with its antinucleus (e.g., protonantproton) so as to produce annihilation radiation, i.e., induced matter-antimatter reaction. Note. Patents to processes or devices that utilize a gaseous or light element fuel material, the particles of which are electrically charged or excited to the point where they become highly ionized and the forces of repulsion of like nuclei is overcome, or substantially so, wherein it is the intent of the patent that this be the result of such ion ization, to the end that nuclear fusion of such like nuclei is obtained or sought to be obtained. Reactor structure in combination with any other art device is classified in this class. Note. The line between the subject matter of this class and those classes utilizing nuclear energy reactors or reactions in an ancillary fashion for such purposes as the production of power either electrical or mechanical and for similar purposes is as follows: this class provides for claimed apparatus and processes wherein the reactor or reaction is recited either specifically or broadly and wherein structure utilizing the reactor or reaction, e.g., motor, generator, ship, aircraft, etc., is recited either specifi cally or broadly. Note. Patents to processes utilizing nuclear energy to bring about chemical reactions between either inorganic or organic com pounds in order to provide a different com pound or product, provided neither reactor structure nor a nuclear reaction is claimed are classified elsewhere (see References to Other classes, below). Class 376, however, takes such patents if some reactor structure is claimed or if the resulting compound or product is either claimed, or is disclosed as being radioactive. Note. This class also provides for patents to all processes and to certain devices or structures for irradiating a substance of a subject specimen or sample for research and related purposes or for making such substance radioactive. This holds true (4)  however only if the irradiation produces a transformation or similar modification of the nucleus of the substance, or if the treat ment makes the substance radioactive. For other types of irradiation, see References to Other classes, below. Note. Elements and subcombinations of nuclear reactors which may, if recited in general terms, be provided for elsewhere, are classified in this class if recited in terms of the subject matter of this class. Note. A process of utilizing nuclear energy to bring about chemical reactions that treat or prepare a synthetic resin or rubber, pro vided neither nuclear reactor structure nor a nuclear reaction is claimed, is elsewhere (see References to Other Classes, below).

FISSILE MATERIAL See Fissionable Material. FISSION  See Control Element. CONVERSION For the purpose of this class, is the process of artificially bringing about a change or transformation in the nucleus of an atom. Nuclear conversion is generally caused by subjecting a material to particle bombardment, usually by neutron irradiation as happens in a fission reactor. See also Transmutation. COOLANT A fluid (liquid, gaseous, or particulate) whose function is to absorb heat from the reactor core and to deliver this absorbed heat to a heat exchanger or other utilization means exterior to the reactor core. CORE, REACTOR See Reactor Core. CRITICAL For the purpose of this class, is the term used to describe the condition in which a chain reaction is being main tained at a constant level, i.e., it is just self-sustaining. In order for this state to exist a sufficient quantity of fissile material (critical mass) must be assembled in the proper shape and concentration. FAST NEUTRONS See Thermal Neutrons. FAST (FISSION) REACTOR A nuclear reactor in which most of the fissions are caused by neutrons moving with substantially the high speeds they possess at the time of their birth in fission. Such reactors contain little or no moderator. FERTILE MATERIAL An element (isotope) capable of being readily transThe splitting of a heavy nucleus into two (or, very rarely, more) fragments (fission products) of more or less equal mass accompanied by the emission of neu trons and the release of energy. It can be spontaneous or it can be caused by the impact or a neutron, a fast charged particle or a photon. See Fissionable Material. Cf. Spallation. FISSIONABLE MATERIAL Any element or isotope the nucleus of which can be caused by nuclear bombardment to undergo nuclear fis sion and to produce a fission chain reaction U233, U235, and Pu239, are examples. Unless a patent refers to a dis tinction, ""fissionable"" and ""fissile"" are considered syn onymous for the purpose of this class. FLUIDIZED BED (FISSION) REACTOR A reactor in which the fuel in the form of particles is maintained in a fluidized state by a fluid medium. (The fuel and the fluid are general moving in opposite direc tions). See subclass 355. (Includes also support of fuel in pellet form in a liquid bath by an upwardly flowing liquid). FUEL, FUEL ELEMENT, OR FUEL COMPONENT See Nuclear Fuel. FULLY IONIZED For the purpose of this class, is state in which atoms are entirely stripped of their orbital electrons for atoms of low mass number, this occurs at kinetic temperatures in the region of 1 Kev or more. In other words, matter is in a state of complete ionization; it consists of a gas com posed of positively charged nuclei and an equivalent number of negative electrons with no neutral particles. See also Plasma. FUSION For the purpose of this class, is a nuclear reaction in  December 2000 Edition   376 - 6  CLASSIFICATION DEFINITIONS  December 2000  which light nuclei combine to form a nucleus of a heavier mass number. See also Thermonuclear Fusion Reaction. HOMOGENEOUS FUEL See Homogeneous Fission Reactor. HOMOGENEOUS (FISSION) REACTOR A reactor in which the fuel and moderator are intimately mixed or dispersed (e.g., the fuel may be a uranium salt dissolved in heavy water) as a solution or slurry. INDUCED NUCLEAR REACTION See section I, (1) Note. INTERMEDIATE NEUTRONS See Thermal Neutrons. IONIZED See (a) Fully Ionized and (b) Plasma. MAGNETIC MIRRORS See Mirror Field. MIRROR FIELD For confinement of plasma, a system has been devised whereby a longitudinal magnetic field is applied to the plasma, but instead of being uniform, the field strength is increased at spaced points. The region of enhanced magnetic field is referred to as a mirror field or mag netic mirror. Substantially all of the charged particles moving from the region of lower to that of the higher field strength, will be reflected back into the former region. This field thus acts as a sort of potential well which inhibits escape of many of the charged particles (and consequent loss of energy). MODERATOR For the purpose of this class, is a substance used within a fission reactor core in special relationship with the fuel to reduce the energy, and hence speed, of fast neutrons (so far as possible) emanating from the fuel by means of collisions without capturing them. Graphite and heavy water are examples. MODERATED NEUTRONS  See Thermal Neutrons. NEUTRON ABSORBING MATERIAL As it relates to nuclear reactors, a substance that poses a high neutron absorption ability. NEUTRON APLIFICATION See Subcritical Reactor. NUCLEAR FUEL (a) Light elements such as hydrogen, deuterium tritium, lithium, boron beryllium, etc., which are capable of fus ing or combining to form a nucleus of higher mass num ber, (b) fissionable fissile, or special nuclear material such as U233, U235, or uranium enriched with either of these Pu239, etc., capable of sustaining a chain reaction. NUCLEAR REACTION For the purpose of this class, a change in the composi tion or physical characteristics of an atomic nucleus pro duced (a) directly or indirectly, by its irradiation or bombardment by high energy alpha particles, protons, deuterons, slow or fast neutrons or high energy radia tions (gamma rays) or (b) by fusing or combining nuclei of low atomic number to produce a nucleus of higher mass number. See also class definition, section I, and (1) Note. NUCLEAR REACTOR For the purpose of this class, a structure inside which an induced nuclear reaction is confined, manipulated, or controlled. A nuclear fission reactor is a structure in which a fission chain reaction is a fissionable material can be maintained and controlled. Besides the fuel, it generally contains control apparatus, moderator, coolant, etc., and is often surrounded by a biological shield. A nuclear fusion reactor is a structure in which a fusion reaction in a nuclear fuel capable of fusing is controlled or manipulated. Although it is implied that the rate of such reactions increases as the relative velocities of such particles at the time of collision, nothing is implied about the means by which such precollision velocities are attained. The same reaction may and usually does produce one or more other particles such as neutrons or protons, in accordance with well-known reactions. PINCH EFFECT  December 2000 Edition   December 2000  CLASSIFICATION DEFINITIONS  376 - 7  The self-constriction that occurs in a plasma as a result of the passage of a unindirectional current, which current produces an azimuthal self-magnetic field that tends to constrict (or pinch) the plasma; or the equiva lent effect which is produced when a plasma is con tained between parallel circuits carrying current in the same direction attracting each other. PLASMA For the purpose of this class is a very hot, at least par tially, ionized gaseous system consisting of equivalent (substantially so) numbers of positive ions and elec trons, irrespective of whether neutral particles are present or not. It is nearly neutral electrically and highly conducting. See also Fully Ionized and subclasses 100+. REACTION BY-PRODUCTS See By-Product Materials. REACTIVITY A measure of the amount of the possible departure of a reactor from the critical condition where the reaction is just self- supporting. At any steady state of operation the reactivity is zero. Addition of positive reactivity causes divergence; addition of negative reactivity causes the reaction to die down. REACTIVITY AFFECTING MATERIAL  See subclasses 347+. REFLECTOR A volume of material placed around the active volume (core) or other neutron yielding source serving to scatter back into the active volume some of the neutrons which would otherwise be lost to the chain reaction thus per mitting a reduction in the critical size of the active vol ume. SAFETY ELEMENT OR ROD See Control Element. SCRAM ROD See Control Element. SHIELD For the purpose of this class, generally a mass or armor of concrete, lead or other heavy material or other neu tron absorbing material erected around a reactor or other radioactive source to shield operating staff by absorbing and reducing dangerous radiations (especially neutrons and gamma rays) to permissible levels. See also Neutron Absorbing Material. SHIM See Control Element.  As it relates to fission nuclear reactors, this is a material which affects the criticality of the reactor and can be (a) a neutron absorbing material (which for the purpose of this class is a material which can absorb neutrons without reproducing them, e.g., boron, or a fertile material such a uranium (U238 or thorium) thus providing a decrease in reactivity, (b) a fissionable material such as U235, Pu239, U233 (thus providing an increase in reactiv ity), and (c) a reflector (moderator) material such as graphite or water (thus providing an increase in reactiv ity). REACTOR CORE (FISSION REACTOR) The central or heart of a nuclear reactor containing as its main constituent the nuclear fuel (e.g., enriched ura nium, Pu239, etc.), and the moderator, if any. Also known as the active volume of the reactor. REACTOR GEOMETRY (FISSION REACTOR)  SLURRY See Homogeneous Reactor. SPALLATION A nuclear reaction induced by high energy bombard ment and involving the ejection of two or more small particles or fragments leaving only one large residual nucleus.

SUBATOMIC PARTICLES All particles of less than atomic mass, i.e., the elemen tary particles (proton, neutron, electron, positron, neu trino, meson, etc.) as well as the alpha particles and deutrons, the charge and mass of which indicates them to be composite particles. SUBCRITICAL (FISSION) REACTOR For the purpose of this class, is a reactor which has (a) an active volume (core) containing less than the neces sary amount of fissionable material (fuel) to become critical, and (b) an auxiliary neutron source combined therewith in such a way as to trigger fissioning with the active volume and with proper amplification of neutrons whereby a steady state chain reaction results, i.e., it becomes critical. TARGET The substance which is subjected bombardment by par ticles of photons of high energy in order to produce nuclear reactions therein. THERMAL NEUTRONS As the energy of any substance has a temperature factor, that of the prevailing temperature is termed thermal energy, and when neutrons reach equilibrium with the moderator they are called thermal neutrons. Their most probable energy is about 0.025 ev; or the speed of a gas molecule at room temperature. It is this type of neutron that can best enter the nucleus of a fissionable atom and remain there long enough to excite the atom to the breaking point, attaining fission. Two other categories of neutrons are intermediate and fast. Fast neutrons are those resulting from fission that have lost relatively little of their energy by collision, etc.; having energies exceeding 0.1 Mev. Intermediate neutrons have energies lying between thermal and fast neutrons. THERMONUCLEAR FUEL See Nuclear Fuel. THERMONUCLEAR (FUSION) REACTORS Apparatus in which fusion reactions occur primarily as the result of random collisions within the apparatus between gas particles having a Maxwellian distribution  of velocities about some average temperature. It is implied that such reactions are not the result of acceler ating one particle into another. While it is also implied that a high average gas temperature is sought for to attain a high thermonuclear reaction rate, nothing is implied as to the attainment of any minimum tempera ture. TRANSMUTATION The bombardment of a nucleus by particle or photon so as to bring about a change in the nucleus resulting in a different isotope of the original nucleus or resulting in different element(s).

Special tools are required to disassemble the computer. Don't use excessive force when inserting PCMCIA cards in the PCMCIA slots, as they may break. Don't use BIOS files interchangeably between color and monochrome units. This will result in system damage and the unit will have to be returned to technical support.    2    Hardware Operation Turning on the unit  Pen Operations The pen is the primary screen navigation and data entry tool for the HAMMERHEAD 3. Without a keyboard attached, the pen is the only means of communicating with the computer. Do not lose or misplace the pen. The pen is usually tethered to its carrying case. Attaching the tether to one of the zippers on the carrying case with a split ring allows the tether to be anchored on either side of the computer. By shifting the position of the zipper, the tethered pen is convenient for right or left-handed users. All users are encouraged to purchase a spare pen as a backup. The pen functions like a two-button mouse. There are two switches in the pen, one in the pen tip and another on the barrel of the pen. The tip switch performs the same functions as the left button on a mouse and the barrel switch performs like the right mouse button. Very few applications require the use of the pen's barrel button. Do not depress the barrel switch when writing on the display; it will adversely affect handwriting recognition. To activate the tip switch, simply press the tip of the pen against the display. This is similar to clicking the left button of a mouse. Double clicking is accomplished by double tapping with the pen. Move an icon by pressing the pen directly overhead and dragging it to the desired destination, keeping the pen in constant contact with the display. Attributes related to use of the pen (e.g. tap speed) can be adjusted in MS Windows' Control Panel in the Handwriting directory. The HAMMERHEAD 3 utilizes a proximity-sensing electromagnetic digitizer. This component tells the computer the pen's exact position. The computer senses the pen as it nears the display and the cursor appears when the pen is approximately an inch away. This allows 21 WalkAbout Computers HAMMERHEAD 3 User's Guide  v021101  All units are shipped ready for operation with a lithium ion battery freshly installed at the factory. Turn the computer on by pressing the on/off button on the upper right-hand side. The button is recessed to prevent accidentally turning the unit on or off. The HAMMERHEAD 3 will perform its self-check routines during the start up process. All units are configured at the factory to automatically boot to the Microsoft Windows Desktop unless a custom configuration has been requested.  Use and Care The HAMMERHEAD 3 is a hardened field computer, but it is an electronic device and reasonable precautions should be taken:     Avoid severe impacts, especially on the display glass. Don't throw the computer anywhere, even on the seat of a car. Don't subject the computer to extreme heat by placing it on the dashboard of a vehicle with the display facing the sun. Don't leave the computer in temperatures below -25F. Don't pile tools or heavy objects on top of the computer. Don't place the unit on the hood or roof of any vehicle, as it might be left behind.      WalkAbout Computers HAMMERHEAD 3 User's Guide  v021101  22   Chapter 2  Hardware Operation visibility of the exact location of input before making actual contact with the display. The location of the cursor on the display is the location of input regardless of the location of the pen tip. The cursor and the pen tip should be closely aligned when the pen is in contact with the display. If the pen and the cursor are out of alignment, realignment is accomplished by following the instructions provided in the pen directory of the MS Windows Control Panel. The pen will appear to be out of alignment if the display settings have been changed from 640 x 480 resolution or 800 x 600 for color displays. Confirm the display is on the appropriate setting before attempting to realign the pen. Tapping the pen requires only light to moderate pressure. It is possible to damage the pen by pounding the tip against the display with force. Most problems using the pen are related to tapping speed and the tapping area size. Both of these functions can be adjusted and tested using the handwriting control software in the MS Windows Control Panel. The width of the line created by the pen is also defined in the Control Panel.  Chapter 2  Hardware Operation  Touch Operations Touch Screen Operation The touch screen replaces a mouse in normal Windows operation. Wherever you touch the screen with your finger or stylus, the computer interprets it as a mouse click. Due to the nature of the touch screen, it is sometimes hard to drag objects across the screen and it is also hard to move the pointer around the screen without selecting the object below the cursor. This should be taken into account when applications are being developed for touch screen devices. In Windows 98, there is a right click button which can be moved around on the desktop while the control panel application for the ELO touch screen is open. The right click button emulates a right click with a standard mouse. To use this function, you click on the right click button, then click on what you want to right click with the stylus.  Caring for the Touch Screen  Pen Maintenance The pen is powered by a 1.5 volt, alkaline, AAAA battery that can be purchased in retail stores. Replacement batteries are manufactured by several companies, the comparable part numbers follow: Eveready E96 Varta 4061 101501 Duracell AAAA battery Radio Shack 23-559 To replace the battery, unscrew the top and bottom sections of the pen at the silver ring just above the barrel switch. The battery is installed with the flat, negative (-) terminal entering the pen barrel first. The nominal voltage supplied to the pen electronics is 1.5 volts, but the pen will operate with the battery voltage in the range of 1.1 to 1.6 volts. The pen electronics will not be destroyed or compromised in any way if the battery is inserted in reverse.  With minimal maintenance, the touch screen will last many years. When using the touch screen, you should not use an abrasive or metallic pointer. You can use your finger or a plastic tipped stylus, etc. The touch screen is easily scratched if an abrasive stylus is used. Be careful not to let sand or grit sit on the screen. Cleaning of the touch screen can be done with a regular plastic cleaner such as Plexus.

Batteries and Charging Procedures Battery Status Indicators The green LED's on the lower left front of the unit indicate the power status of the battery. At full charge, all five LED indicators will light. As the battery power availability decreases, the LED's will turn off from top to bottom. Each LED represents approximately 20% of the total charge. So if three LED's are lit, an estimated 60% of the total battery charge remains. The last LED indicator will begin to flash when approximately three to five minutes of battery power remain. When the remaining battery power becomes critical, all data should be saved and the HAMMERHEAD 3 must be turned off or placed in the standby mode. Failure to do so may result in lost data! Replace one of the batteries with a fresh battery or recharge the unit. See Installing New Batteries below. When the indicators When the indicators HAMMERHEAD 3 is turned off, will also turn off after a delay of unit is placed in standby mode, will remain lit as a reminder the the battery status a few seconds. the battery status unit is on standby.  Installing New Batteries The HAMMERHEAD 3 has the capability to run on one or two batteries in the field. The unit does not require both batteries to run. The two-battery design allows users to hot swap batteries without turning the computer off. To install or replace a new battery, turn the round knob on the back of the unit. The knob holds the batteries in place and is designed so the batteries cannot be taken out at the same time. Simply turn the knob until the quarter piece exposes the corner of the battery that is to be replaced. A lip on the battery aids for easy removal. Install the new battery by placing it into the compartment and turning the knob to cover the edges of both batteries. When power runs down in one battery, a warning message will display to report the status of the charge in each battery.  Battery Use/Care The HAMMERHEAD 3 uses long lasting lithium ion batteries that are custom made for WalkAbout Computers. Do not substitute any other batteries. Substituting batteries may result in a void warranty. Lithium ion batteries are smart batteries that do not need to discharge then recharge to view the charge status on the computer. They have a low self-discharge rate and a long shelf life. Keep them dry and store them at room temperature. The battery is not considered hazardous waste by EPA regulations, however local regulations may require specific methods of disposal. We strongly encourage recycling. WalkAbout will be happy to recycle batteries for you. To order additional batteries, contact your area representative.  Actual battery life is dependent on several factors including temperature, backlight requirements and computer usage. The use of power management may significantly extend this time.  Recharging Batteries The HAMMERHEAD 3's batteries automatically fast charge any time the HAMMERHEAD 3 is connected to an external power source (AC or DC). When charging, the green charge indicator light will flash while the unit is recharging. When charging two batteries, the first battery will charge to 80% of full charge, then the second battery will charge to 80%. After both batteries reach 80%, the first battery will then charge the remaining 20%, after which the second battery will complete its recharging process. This method provides the best ratio of charge time to run time for short battery charge cycles.  WalkAbout Computers HAMMERHEAD 3 User's Guide  v021101  25  WalkAbout Computers HAMMERHEAD 3 User's Guide  v021101  26   Chapter 2  Hardware Operation  Chapter 2  Hardware Operation  Charging Batteries To recharge the battery using the AC adapter, plug the circular connector of the AC adapter into the AC connector in the HAMMERHEAD 3 or in the power supply port on the replicator. Charging begins automatically as the unit is docked when using a vehicle docking mount, desktop docking station or a wall mount docking station. The HAMMERHEAD 3 is fully functional as it charges. Using the unit as it charges will only slightly lengthen the recharging process. The HAMMERHEAD 3 requires at least 13 v DC for fast charging. Do not use any external power source other than the AC or DC adapters provided with the HAMMERHEAD 3; permanent damage to the battery or computer may occur.  Heater Option The HAMMERHEAD 3 supports an optional heater package including a LCD heater that greatly improves display readability in colder environments and a hard drive heater that prevents drive freezing. You can enable the heaters to automatically activate while your machine is running, booting or even while it is turned off. If enabled, the heaters will automatically activate each time the ambient temperature falls below a predetermined level.  PCMCIA Cards PCMCIA cards can be purchased and inserted into the card slot by the user. The PCMCIA compartment is sealed from the internal components of the HAMMERHEAD 3 to prevent dust and moisture from entering the computer. To insert the PCMCIA card, take off the hatch plate by removing the two Phillips screws that hold the PCMCIA hatch cover. The PCMCIA cards are inserted upside down (i.e. the up arrow on the card should point toward the back of the HAMMERHEAD 3). Do not apply excessive pressure w hen loading cards. They should slide in easily. Remove the card in the same manner. Cardbus cards are not supported. Forcing Cardbus cards in the PCMCIA expansion slot could cause damage. Many PCMCIA devices require connections for communications (RJ-11 or RJ-45) or antenna for wireless activity (wireless modems, GPS) or some other external function. Most PCMCIA devices are too fragile for direct connections in field environments. In response, WalkAbout provides a variety of hatch plates with a milled cavity or ""lump"" containing combinations of connectors and the cable assemblies needed to connect to common PCMCIA devices. For example, a ""lump"" to accommodate a PCMCIA fax/modem and network connection includes a RJ-11 and RJ-45 connector. A ""lump"" for a CDPD modem and wire-line fax/modem would include an antenna mount and RJ-11. The ""lumps"" serve two purposes: 1) they provide for a sturdy and highly reliable connection not possible when connecting directly to a PCMCIA device, and 2) they maintain the  Removable Hard Drive Please contact WalkAbout technical support 888-872-1100 before removing the cover plate of the hard drive compartment.

Press   and the pointer will move to the middle of the taskbar along the edge of the display and become a twoway arrow. 6. Using the cursor key, size the task bar until it is the size you prefer. 7. Press the   key to set the task bar size.  To avoid this problem in the future, try sizing the task bar to be larger than the default. This can be done at your discretion.  What if the pen still w ill not align?  Check that the user has not altered the Windows Display settings to a screen resolution other than factory default. If so, adjust the setting to factory default, reboot the unit and attempt pen alignment. See supporting documentation for instructions on reinstalling the pen services software. This will typically cure problems with damaged support files that impact the pen function.  How long is the battery good for in the HammerHead unit?  WalkAbout recommends replacing the HammerHead battery annually.    What factors can influence the life of the battery charge?    PCMCIA devices require power and are known to shorten battery life. Constant reading and writing of the Hard Disk will shorten battery life. Old batteries will begin to exhibit signs of ""charge memory"" which results in shortened battery life.  What can I do w hen the ""Start"" button disappears?  In pen computing, it is not uncommon for the user to inadvertently resize the task bar so that it is not visible on the screen. First, attempt to recover the start button and task bar by moving around the edges of the display to see if you will get a double arrow. If you get a double arrow, simply drag the task bar to the size you need. If not, follow these directions (note: you will need a keyboard to perform this function. Do not attempt to use the pen during this process. 1. Press the  ,   keys in combination to display the ""Start"" menu. 2. Press the   button and the menu will disappear.

GX259-10-2433856	"HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE SYSTEMS  T  he Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has three interacting systems:   The Support Systems Module (SSM), an outer structure that houses the other systems and provides services such as electrical power, data communications, and pointing control and maneuvering  The Optical Telescope Assembly (OTA), which collects and concentrates the incoming light in the focal plane for use by the science instruments  Eight major science instruments, four housed in an aft section focal plane structure (FPS) and four placed along the circumference of the spacecraft. With the exception of the Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS), the Science Instrument Control and Data Handling (SI C&DH) unit controls all. Additional systems that also support HST operations include two Solar Arrays (SA).  These generate electrical power and charge onboar d batteries and communications antennas to r eceive commands and send telemetry data from the HST. Figure 5-1 shows the HST configuration. The Telescope performs much like a ground observatory. The SSM is designed to support functions required by any ground astronomical observatory. It provides power, points the Telescope, and communicates with the OTA, SI C&DH unit, and instr uments to r eady an observation. Light from an observed target passes through the Telescope and into one or more of the science instruments, where the light is recorded. This information goes to onboard computers for processing, and then it is either temporarily stored or sent to Earth in real time, via the spacecraft communication system. The Telescope completes one orbit every 97 minutes and maintains its orbital position along MAGNETIC TORQUER (4) HIGH GAIN ANTENNA (2) LIGHT SHIELD  SUPPORT SYSTEMS MODULE FORWARD SHELL OPTICAL TELESCOPE ASSEMBLY SECONDARY MIRROR ASSEMBLY SECONDARY MIRROR BAFFLE CENTRAL BAFFLE OPTICAL TELESCOPE ASSEMBLY PRIMARY MIRROR AND MAIN RING FINE GUIDANCE OPTICAL CONTROL SENSOR (3) OPTICAL TELESCOPE ASSEMBLY FOCAL PLANE STRUCTURE AXIAL SCIENCE INSTRUMENT MODULE(4)  APERTURE DOOR  SOLAR ARRAY (2) MAIN BAFFLE OPTICAL TELESCOPE ASSEMBLY METERING TRUSS SUPPORT SYSTEMS MODULE EQUIPMENT SECTION  OPTICAL TELESCOPE ASSEMBLY EQUIPMENT SECTION RADIAL SCIENCE INSTRUMENT MODULE (1) FIXED HEAD STAR TRACKER (3) AND RATE SENSOR UNIT (3) SUPPORT SYSTEMS MODULE AFT SHROUD  K70110-501  Fig. 5-1 Hubble Space Telescope  exploded view 5-1 K9322-05M   three axial planes. The primary axis, V1, runs through the center of the Telescope. The other two axes parallel the SA masts (V2) and the High Gain Antenna (HGA) masts (V3) (see Fig. 5-2). The Telescope points and maneuvers to new targets by rotating about its body axes. Pointing instruments use references to these axes to aim at a target in space, position the SA, or change Telescope orientation in orbit.   Reflective surfaces and heaters for thermal protection  Outer doors, latches, handrails, and footholds designed for astronaut use during on-orbit maintenance. Figure 5-3 shows some of these features.

Fitting together are the light shield, the forward shell, the SSM Equipment Section, and the aft shroud/bulkhead  all designed and built by Lockheed Martin Missiles & Space (see Fig. 5-4). Aperture Door. The apertur e door, approximately 10-ft (3 m) in diameter, covers the opening to the Telescope's light shield. The door is made from honeycombed aluminum sheets. The outside is covered with solar reflecting material, and the inside is painted black to absorb stray light. The door opens a maximum of 105 degrees from the closed position. The Telescope aperture allows for a 50-degree field of view (FOV) centered on the +V1 axis. Sun-avoidance sensors provide ample warning to automatically close the door befor e sunlight can damage the Telescope's optics.

This takes no more than 60 seconds. The Space Telescope Operations Control Center (STOCC) can override the protective doorclosing mechanism for observations that fall within the 20-degree limit. An example is observing a bright object, using the dark limb (edge) of the Moon to partially block the light. Light Shield. The light shield (see Fig. 5-4) blocks out stray light. It connects to both the aperture door and the forward shell. On the outer skin of the Telescope on opposite sides are latches to secure the SAs and HGAs when they are stowed. Near the SA latches are scuff plates, 5-3  EQUIPMENT SECTION  AFT SHROUD  K70110-504  Fig. 5-4 Structural components of Support Systems Module  K9322-05M   large protective metal plates on struts that extend approximately 30 in. from the surface of the spacecraft. Trunnions lock the Telescope into the Shuttle cargo bay by hooking to latches in the bay. The light shield supports the forward Low Gain Antenna (LGA) and its communications waveguide, two magnetometers, and two sun sensors. Handrails encircle the light shield, and built-in foot restraints support the astronauts working on the Telescope. Figure 5-5 shows the aperture door and light shield. The shield is 13-ft (4 m) long, with an internal diameter of 10-ft (3 m). It is machined from magnesium, with a stiffened, corrugatedskin barrel cover ed by a thermal blanket. Internally the shield has 10 light baffles, painted flat black to suppress stray light. Forward Shell. The forward shell, or central section of the structure, houses the OTA main baffle and the secondary mirror (see Fig. 5-6). When stowed, the SAs and HGAs are latched flat against the forward shell and light shield. Four magnetic torquers are placed 90 degrees  apart around the circumference of the forward shell. The outer skin has two grapple fixtures next to the HGA drives, where the Shuttle's Remote Manipulator System can attach to the Telescope. The forward shell also has handholds, footholds, and a trunnion, which is used to lock the Telescope into the Shuttle cargo bay. The forward shell is 13-ft (4 m) long and 10-ft (3 m) in diameter. It is machined from aluminum plating, with external reinforcing rings and internal stiffened panels. The rings are on the outside to ensure clearance for the OTA inside. Thermal blankets cover the exterior. Equipment Section. This section is a ring of storage bays encircling the SSM. It contains about 90 percent of the electronic components that run the spacecraft, including equipment serviced during extravehicular activities (EVA) by Space Shuttle astronauts. The Equipment Section is a doughnut-shaped barrel that fits between the forward shell and aft shr oud. This section contains 10 bays for equipment and two bays to support aft trunnion pins and scuff plates.

The bays are 4-ft (1.2 m) wide and 5-ft (1.5 m) deep. The Equipment Section is constr ucted of machined and stif fened aluminum frame panels attached to an inner aluminum barr el. Eight bays have flat honeycombed aluminum doors mounted with equipment. In Bays 6 and 9, thermal-stiffened panel doors cover the r eaction wheels. A forward frame panel and aft bulkhead enclose the SSM Equipment Section. Six mounts on the inside of the bulkhead hold the OTA. Aft Shroud and Bulkhead. The aft shroud (see Fig. 5-8) houses the FPS containing the axial science instruments. It is also the location of the Corr ective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) unit. The three FGSs and the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) are housed radially near the connecting point between the aft shroud and SSM Equipment Section. Doors on the outside of the shroud allow shuttle astronauts to remove and change equipment and instruments easily. Handrails and foot restraints for the crew run along the length and circumference of the 5-6 K9322-05M  Fig. 5-8 Support Systems Module aft shroud and bulkhead  shroud. During maintenance or removal of an instr ument, interior lights illuminate the compartments containing the science instruments. The shroud is made of aluminum, with a stiffened skin, internal panels and reinforcing rings, and 16 external and internal longeron bars for support. It is 11.5-ft (3.5 m) long and 14-ft (4.3 m) in diameter. The aft b ulkhead contains the umbilical connections between the Telescope and the shuttle, used during launch/deployment and on-orbit maintenance. The rear LGA attaches to the bulkhead, which is made of 2-in.-thick honeycombed aluminum panels and has three radial aluminum support beams. The shroud and bulkhead support a gas purge system that was used to prevent contamination of the science instruments before launch. All vents used to expel gases are light tight. Thus, stray light is prevented from entering the OTA focal plane. Mechanisms. Along the SSM str ucture are mechanisms that perform various functions, including:    Latches to hold antennas and SAs  Hinge drives to open the aperture door and erect arrays and antennas  Gimbals to move the HGA dishes  Motors to power the hinges and latches and to rotate arrays and antennas. There are nine latches: four for antennas, four for arrays, and one for the aperture door. They latch and release using four-bar linkages and are driven by stepper motors called Rotary Drive Actuators (RDA). There are three hinge drives, one for each HGA and one for the door. The hinges also use an RDA. Both hinges and latches have hex-wrench fittings so an astronaut can manually operate the mechanism to deploy the door, antenna, or array if a motor fails.  science data is transmitted, and ""Single Access"" specifies the type of antenna on the TDRS satellite to which the data is sent. High Gain Antennas. Each HGA is a parabolic reflector (dish) mounted on a mast with a twoaxis gimbal mechanism and electronics to rotate it 100 degrees in either direction (see Fig. 5-9). General Electric designed and made the antenna dishes. They ar e manufactur ed fr om honeycomb aluminum and graphite-epoxy facesheets. Each antenna can be aimed with a one-degree pointing accuracy. This accuracy is consistent with the overall antenna beam width of over four degrees. The antennas transmit over two frequencies: 2255.5 MHz or 2287.5 MHz (plus or minus 10 MHz). Low Gain Antennas. The LGAs receive ground commands and transmit engineering data. They are set 180 degrees apart on the light shield and aft bulkhead of the spacecraft. Each antenna is a spiral cone that can operate over a frequency range fr om 2100 MHz to 2300 MHz. Manufactured by Lockheed Martin, the LGAs  5.1.2 Instrumentation and Communications Subsystem This subsystem provides the communications loop between the Telescope and the Tracking and Data Relay Satellites (TDRS), receiving commands and sending data through the HGAs and LGAs. All information is passed through the Data Management Subsystem (DMS). The HGAs achieve a much higher RF signal gain, which is required, for example, when transmitting high-data-rate scientific data. These antennas require pointing at the TDRSs because of their characteristically narrow beam widths. On the other hand, the LGAs provide spherical coverage (omnidirectional) but have a much lower signal gain. The LGAs are used for lowrate-data transmission and all commanding of the Telescope. S-Band Single Access Transmitter (SSAT). The Telescope is equipped with two SSATs. ""S-Band"" identifies the frequency at which the 5-7 K9322-05M  HIGH GAIN ANTENNA  TWIN-AXIS GIMBALS  K70110-509  Fig. 5-9 High Gain Antenna   are used for all commanding of the Telescope and for low-data-rate telemetry, particularly during Telescope deployment or retrieval on orbit, or during safemode operations.  The components ar e located in the SSM Equipment Section, except for one DIU stored in the OTA Equipment Section. The DMS receives, processes, and transmits five types of signals: 1. Ground commands sent to the HST systems 2. Onboard computer-generated or computerstored commands 3. Scientific data from the SI C&DH unit 4. Telescope engineering status data for telemetry 5. System outputs, such as clock signals and safemode signals. Figur e 5-10 is the subsystem functional diagram. DF-224 Computer. The DF-224 computer is a general-purpose digital computer for onboard  5.1.3 Data Management Subsystem The DMS r eceives communications commands from the STOCC and data from the SSM systems, OTA, and science instruments. It processes, stores, and sends the information as r equested. Subsystem components are:  DF-224 computer (will be replaced on SM3A with the Advanced Computer)  Data Management Unit (DMU)  Four Data Interface Units (DIU)  Three engineering/science data recorders  Two oscillators (clocks).  Fig. 5-10 Data Management Subsystem functional block diagram 5-8 K9322-05M   engineering computations. It executes stored commands; formats status data (telemetry); performs all Pointing Control Subsystem (PCS) computations to maneuver, point, and attitude stabilize the Te lescope; generates onboard commands to orient the SAs toward the Sun; evaluates the health status of the Telescope systems; and commands the HGAs. The Advanced Computer will replace the DF-224 on SM3A and will assume its functions. Advanced Computer. The Advanced Computer is based on the Intel 80486 microchip. It operates 20 times faster and has six times as much memory as the DF-224. The Advanced Computer was designed using commercially developed components. A battery of mechanical, electrical, radiation and thermal tests were performed at GSFC to assure its survival in the space environment. A successful flight test of the hardware was carried out aboard the space shuttle Discovery on STS-95 in October 1998. The Advanced Computer is configured as three independent single-board computers. Each single-boar d computer (SBC) has two megabytes of fast static random access memory and one megabyte of non-volatile memory. The Advanced Computer communicates with the HST by using the direct memory access capability on each SBC thr ough the Data Management Unit (DMU). Only one SBC may control the Telescope at a time. The other SBCs can be off, in an idle state, or performing internal tasks. Upon power on, each SBC runs a built-in selftest and then copies the operating software from slower non-volatile memory to faster random access memory. The self-test is capable of diagnosing any problems with the Advanced 5-9 K9322-05M  Computer and reporting them to the ground. Fast static random access memory is used in the Advanced Computer to eliminate wait states and allow it to run at its full-rated speed. The Advanced Computer measures 18.8 x 18 x 13 inches (0.48 x 0.46 x 0.33 m) and weighs 70.5 lb (32 kg). It will be located in Bay 1 of the SSM Equipment Section (see Fig. 5-11). Data Management Unit. The DMU links with the computer. It encodes data and sends messages to selected Telescope units and all DMS units, powers the oscillators, and is the central timing source. The DMU also receives and decodes all incoming commands, then transmits each pr ocessed command to be executed. The DMU receives science data from the SI C&DH unit. Engineering data, consisting of sensor and hardware status readings (such as temperature or voltages), comes from each Telescope subsystem. The data can be stored in the onboard data recorders if direct telemetry via a TDRS is unavailable.

The unit weighs 83 lb (37.7 kg), measures 26 x 30 x 7 in. (60 x 70 x 17 cm), and is attached to the door of Equipment Section Bay 1 (see Fig. 5-12). Data Interface Unit. The four DIUs provide a command and data link between DMS and other Telescope electronic boxes. The DIUs receive commands and data requests from the DMU and pass data or status information back to the DMU. The OTA DIU is located in the OTA Equipment Section; the other units are in Bays 3, 7, and 10 of the SSM Equipment Section. As a safeguard, each DIU is two complete units in one; either part can handle the unit's functions. Each DIU measures 15 x 16 x 7 in. (38 x 41 x 18 cm) and weighs 35 lb (16 kg). Engineering/Science Data Recorders. The DMS includes thr ee data r ecor ders that stor e POWER SUPPLY NO. 2 (CDI DC-DC CONVERTER) TOP COVER (WITH COMPRESSION PAD)  engineering or science data that cannot be transmitted to the ground in real time. The recorders, which are located in Equipment Section Bays 5 and 8, hold up to 12 billion bits of information. Two recorders are used in normal operations; the third is a backup. Each recorder measures 12 x 9 x 7 in. (30 x 23 x 18 cm) and weighs 20 lb (9 kg). Solid State Recorder. During SM2 a Solid State Recorder (SSR) was installed, replacing a reelto-reel tape recorder. A second state-of-the-art SSR will be installed during SM3A. This digital recorder will replace one of the two remaining reel-to-reel recorders on HST. The Solid State Recorders have an expected on-orbit life of at least eight years. They can record two data streams simultaneously, allowing both science and engineering data to be captured on a single recorder. In addition, data can be recorded and played back at the same time. The SSR has no reels or tape, and no moving parts to wear out and limit lifetime. Data is stored digitally in computer-like memory chips until HST's operators at GSFC command the SSR to play it back. Although they are the same size as the reel-to-reel recorders, the SSRs can store over 10 times more data -- 12 gigabits versus only 1.2 gigabits for the tape recorders they replace. Oscillator. The oscillator provides a highly stable central timing pulse required by the Telescope. It has a cylindrical housing 4 in. (10 cm) in diameter and 9 in. (23 cm) long and weighs 3 lb (1.4 kg). The oscillator and a backup are mounted in Bay 2 of the SSM Equipment Section.  PC BOARD STANDARD (5 X 7 in.) HEAT SHIELD PARTITION (TYP)  CARD GUIDE ENCLOSURE (DIP-BRAZED AL.)

The PCS is designed for pointing to within 0.01 arcsec and holding the Telescope in that orientation with 0.007-arcsec stability for up to 24 hours while the Telescope continues to orbit the Earth at 17,500 mph. If the Telescope wer e in Los Angeles, it could hold a beam of light on a dime in San Francisco without the beam straying from the coin's diameter. Nominally, the PCS maintains the Telescope's precision attitude by locating guide stars into two FGSs and controlling the Telescope to keep it in the same position relative to these stars. When specific tar get r equests r equir e r epositioning the spacecraft, the pointing system selects different reference guide stars and moves the Telescope into a new attitude. The PCS encompasses the Advanced Computer, various attitude sensors, and two types of devices, called actuators, to move the spacecraft (see Fig. 5-13). It also includes the Pointing/ Safemode Electronics Assembly (PSEA) and the Retrieval Mode Gyro Assembly (RMGA); both used by the spacecraft safemode system. See para 5.1.7 for details. Sensors. The five types of sensors used by the PCS are the Coarse Sun Sensors (CSS), the Magnetic Sensing System (MSS), the Rate Gyro Assemblies (RGA), the Fixed Head Star Trackers (FHST), and the FGSs. The CSSs measure the Telescope's orientation to the Sun. They are used to calculate the initial deployment orientation of the Telescope, determine when to begin closing the aperture door, and point the Telescope in special sunorientation modes during contingency operations. Five CSSs are located on the light shield and aft shroud. CSSs also provide signals to the PSEA, located in Bay 8 of the SSM Equipment Section. K9322-05M  The MSS measures the Telescope's orientation relative to Earth's magnetic field. The system consists of magnetometers and dedicated electronic units that send data to the Advanced Computer and the Safemode Electr onic Assembly. Two systems are provided. Both are located on the front end of the light shield. Three RGAs are provided on the Telescope. Each assembly consists of a Rate Sensor Unit (RSU) and an Electronics Control Unit (ECU). An RSU contains two rate-sensing gyroscopes, each measuring attitude rate motion about its sensitive axis. This output is processed by its dedicated electronics, which are contained in the ECU. Each unit has two sets of electronics. The RSUs are located behind the SSM Equipment Section, next to the FHSTs in the aft shroud. The ECUs are located inside Bay 10 of the SSM Equipment Section. The RGAs provide input to the PCS to control the orientation of the Telescope's line of sight and to provide the attitude reference when maneuvering the Telescope. Four of the original six rate gyros were replaced during the First Servicing Mission. All six rate gyros are planned for replacement during SM3A. Three of six gyroscopes are required to continue the Telescope science mission. An FHST is an electro-optical detector that locates and tracks a specific star within its FOV. Three FHSTs are located in the aft shroud behind the FPS, next to the RSUs. STOCC uses star trackers as an attitude calibration device when the Telescope maneuvers into its initial orientation. The trackers also calculate attitude information before and after maneuvers to help the FGS lock onto guide stars. Three FGSs, discussed in more detail in para 5.3, provide angular position with respect to the stars.

Two of the FGSs perform guide-star pointing, while the third is available for astr ometry, the positional measurement of specific stars. Pointing Control Subsystem Software. PCS software accounts for a large percentage of the flight code executed by the Hubble's main computer. This software translates ground targeting commands into reaction wheel torque profiles that reorient the spacecraft. All motion of the spacecraft is smoothed to minimize jitter during data collection. The software also determines Telescope orientation, or attitude, from FHST or FGS data and commands the magnetic torquer bars so that reaction wheel speeds are always minimized. In addition, the software provides various telemetry formats. Since the Telescope was launched, major modifications have been made to the PCS. A digital filtering scheme, known as Solar Array Gain Augmentation (SAGA) was incorporated to mitigate the effect of any SA vibration or jitter on pointing stability. Software also was used to improve FGS performance when the Telescope is subjected to the same disturbances. This algorithm is referred to as the FGS Re-Centering Algorithm. Software is used extensively to increase Telescope robustness when hardwar e failures are experienced. Two additional software safemodes have been provided. The spin-stabilized mode provides pointing of the Telescope -V1 axis to the Sun with only two of the four RWAs operating. The other mode allows Sun pointing of the Telescope without any input from the RGA; magnetometer and CSS data is used to derive all reference information needed to maintain Sun pointing (+V3 and -V1 are options). A further software change ""refreshes"" the FGS configuration. This is achieved by maintaining  data in the Advanced Computer memory so it can be sent periodically to the FGS electronics, which are subject to single-event upsets (logic state change) when transitioning through the South Atlantic Anomaly. Actuators. The PCS has two types of actuators: RWAs and magnetic torquers. Actuators move the spacecraft into commanded attitudes and provide required control torques to stabilize the Telescope's line of sight. The reaction wheels work by rotating a large flywheel up to 3000 rpm or braking it to exchange momentum with the spacecraft. The wheel axes are oriented so that the Telescope can provide science with only three wheels operating. Wheel assemblies are paired, two each in Bays 6 and 9 of the SSM Equipment Section. Each wheel is 23 in. (59 cm) in diameter and weighs about 100 lb (45 kg). Figure 5-14 shows the RWA configuration. Magnetic torquers create torque on the spacecraft and are primarily used to manage reaction wheel speed. The torquers react against Earth's magnetic field. The torque reaction occurs in the direction that reduces the reaction wheel speed, managing the angular momentum. The magnetic torquers also provide backup contr ol to stabilize the Telescope's orbital attitude during the contingency modes, as described in para 5.1.2. Each torquer, located externally on the forward shell of the SSM, is 8.3  RWA  RWA  K70110-514  Fig. 5-14 Reaction Wheel Assembly  5-13 K9322-05M   ft (2.5 m) long and 3 in. (8 cm) in circumference and weighs 100 lb (45 kg). Pointing Control Operation. To point precisely, the PCS uses the gyroscopes, reaction wheels, magnetic torquers, star trackers, and FGSs. The FGSs provide the precision reference point from which the Telescope can begin repositioning. Flight software commands the reaction wheels to spin, accelerating or decelerating as required to rotate the Telescope toward a new target. Rate gyr oscopes sense the Telescope's angular motion and pr ovide a short-term attitude reference to assist fine pointing and spacecraft maneuvers. The magnetic torquers r educe reaction wheel speed. As the Telescope nears the target area, star trackers locate preselected reference stars that stand out brightly in that region of the sky. Once the star trackers reduce the attitude error below 60 arcsec, the two FGSs take over the pointing duties. Working with the gyroscopes, the FGSs make possible pointing the Telescope to within 0.01 arcsec of the target. The PCS can maintain this position, wavering no more than 0.005 arcsec, for up to 24 hours to guarantee faintobject observation.  into electricity. Energy will be stored in nickelhydrogen (NiH2) batteries and distributed by the PCUs and PDUs to all Telescope components as shown in Fig. 5-15. The Telescope will not be released until the batteries are fully charged. Solar Arrays. The SA panels, discussed later in this section, are the primary source of electrical power. Each array wing has a solar cell blanket that converts solar energy into electrical energy. Electricity produced by the solar cells charges the Telescope batteries. Each array wing has associated electronics. These consist of a Solar Array Drive Electronics (SADE) unit, which transmits positioning commands to the wing assembly; a Deployment Control Electronics Unit, which controls the drive motors extending and retracting the wings; and diode networks to dir ect the electrical current flow. Batteries and Charge Current Controllers. Developed for the 1990 deployment mission, the Telescope's batteries were NASA's first flight NiH2 batteries. They provide the observatory with a robust, long-life electrical energy storage system. Six NiH 2 batteries support the Telescope's electrical power needs during three periods: when demand exceeds SA capability, when the Telescope is in Earth's shadow, and during safemode entry. The batteries reside in SSM Equipment Section Bays 2 and 3. These units have extensive safety and handling provisions to protect the Shuttle and its astronauts. The design and operation of these batteries, along with special nondestructive inspection of each cell, have allowed these units to be ""astronaut-rated"" for replacement during a servicing mission. To compensate for the effects of battery aging, SM3A astronauts will install a Voltage/Temperature Im provement Kit (VIK) on each of  5.1.5 Electrical Power Subsystem Power for the Telescope and science instruments comes from the Electrical Power Subsystem (EPS). The major components are two SA wings and their electr onics, six batteries, six Char ge Curr ent Contr ollers (CCC), one Power Control Unit (PCU), and four Power Distribution Units (PDU). All except the SAs are located in the bays around the SSM Equipment Section. During the servicing mission, the Shuttle will provide the electrical power. After deployment, the SAs again begin converting solar radiation K9322-05M  5-14   COMMANDS  POWER SOLAR ARRAY  POWER POWER POWER POWER POWER POWER POWER BATTERY  6 5 4 3 2 NO. 1  SOLAR ARRAY MECHANISMS SOLAR ARRAY  POWER COMMANDS  SOLAR ARRAY ELECTRONICS CONTROL ASSEMBLY  COMMANDS POWER CONTROL UNIT TELEMETRY  COMMANDS TELEMETRY POWER POWER POWER POWER  PWR DISTR UNIT 1 2 3 4  SSM SA SIs OTA  SI C&DH  TELEMETRY ORBITER POWER (PREDEPLOYMENT)  K70110-515  Fig. 5-15 Electrical Power Subsystem functional block diagram  Hubble's six batteries. The VIK provides battery thermal stability by precluding battery overcharge when the HST enters safemode, effectively lowering the Charge Current Controller (CCC) recharge current. Each battery consists of 22 cells in series along with heaters, heater contr ollers, pr essur e measurement transducers and electronics, and temperatur e-measuring devices and their associated electronics. Thr ee batteries ar e packaged into a module measuring roughly 36 by 36 by 10 in. (90 x 90 x 25 cm) and weighing about 475 lb (214 kg). Each module is equipped with two large yellow handles that astronauts use to maneuver the module in and out of the Telescope in space. The SAs recharge the batteries every orbit following eclipse (the time in the Earth's shadow). The recharge current is controlled by the CCCs. Each battery has its own CCC that uses voltage-temperature measurements to control battery recharge.  Fully charged, each battery contains more than 75 amp-hours. This is sufficient energy to sustain the Telescope in normal science operations mode for 7.5 hours or five orbits. The batteries provide an adequate energy reserve for all possible safemode contingencies and all enhancements programmed into the Telescope since launch. Power Control and Distribution Units. The PCU interconnects and switches current flowing among the SAs, batteries, and CCCs. Located in Bay 4 of the Equipment Section, the PCU provides the main power bus to the four PDUs. The PCU weighs 120 lb (55 kg) and measures 43 x 12 x 8 in. (109 x 30 x 20 cm). Four PDUs, located on the inside of the door to Bay 4, contain the power buses, switches, fuses, and monitoring devices for electrical power distribution to the rest of the Telescope. Two buses are dedicated to the OTA, science instruments, and SI C&DH; two supply the SSM. Each PDU measures 10 x 5 x 18 in. (25 x 12.5 x 45 cm) and weighs 25 lb (11 kg).  5-15 K9322-05M   5.1.6  Thermal Control  Multilayer insulation (MLI) covers 80 percent of the Telescope's exterior, and supplemental electric heaters maintain its temperatures within safe limits. The insulation blankets are 15 layers of aluminized Kapton, with an outer layer of aluminized Teflon flexible optical solar reflector (FOSR). Aluminized or silvered flexible reflector tape covers most of the remaining exterior. These coverings protect against the cold of space and r eflect solar heat. In addition, reflective or absorptive paints are used. The SSM Thermal Control Subsystem (TCS) maintains temperatures within set limits for the components mounted in the Equipment Section and structures interfacing with the OTA and science instruments. The TCS maintains safe component temperatures even for worst-case conditions such as environmental fluctuations, passage from ""cold"" Earth shadow to ""hot"" solar exposure during each orbit, and heat generated from equipment operation. Specific thermal-protection features of the SSM include:  MLI thermal blankets for the light shield and forward shell  Aluminum FOSR tape on the aperture door surface facing the sun  Specific patterns of FOSR and MLI blankets on the exteriors of the Equipment Section bay doors, with internal MLI blankets on the bulkheads to maintain thermal balance between bays  Efficient placement of equipment and use of equipment bay space to match temperature requirements, such as placing heat-dissipating equipment on the side of the Equipment Section mostly exposed to orbit shadow  Silvered FOSR tape on the aft shroud and aft bulkhead exteriors K9322-05M   Radiation shields inside the aft shroud doors and MLI blankets on the aft bulkhead and shroud interiors to protect the science instruments  More than 200 temperature sensors and thermistors placed throughout the SSM, externally and internally, to monitor individual components and control heater operations. Figure 5-16 shows the location and type of thermal pr otection used on the SSM. SM2 observations identified degradations of all of the MLI. Additional material will be installed during SM3A to cover some of the degraded material and restore the external layer surface properties. The additional material has been life-tested to an equivalent of 10 years. The layer being added to the SSM Equipment Section is a composite-coated (silicone dioxide) stainless steel layer, known as the New Outer Blanket Layer (NOBL). The light shield/ forward shell material is Teflon with a scrim backing for durability.  5.1.7 Safing (Contingency) System Overlapping or redundant Telescope equipment safeguar ds against any br eakdown. Nonetheless, a contingency or Safing System exists for emergency operations. It uses many pointing contr ol and data management components as well as dedicated PSEA har dwar e. This system maintains stable Telescope attitude, moves the SAs for maximum Sun exposure, and conserves electrical power by minimizing power drain. The Safing System can operate the spacecraft indefinitely with no communications link to ground control. During scientific observations (normal mode), the Safing System is r elegated to monitor automatically Telescope onboard functions. The system sends Advanced-Computer-generated  5-16   ALUMINIZED FLEXIBLE OPTICAL SOLAR REFLECTOR (FOSR) APERTURE DOOR LIGHT SHIELD BLACK CHEMGLAZE ALUMINIZED FOSR SILVERIZED FOSR FORWARD SHELL EQUIPMENT AFT SHROUD SECTION 90-DEG MULTILAYER INSULATION (MLI)  ALUMINIZED SILVERIZED FOSR FOSR  +V1 OPTICAL BLACK MLI MLI MLI MLI FOSR MLI 90-DEG MLI K70110-516  Fig. 5-16 Placement of thermal protection on Support Systems Module  ""keep-alive"" signals to the PSEA that indicate all Telescope systems are functioning. Entry into the Safemode is autonomous once a failure is detected. The Safing System is designed to follow a progression of contingency operating modes, depending on the situation aboar d the Telescope. If a malfunction occurs and does not threaten the Telescope's survival, the Safing System moves into a Software Inertial Hold Mode. This mode holds the Telescope in the last position commanded. If a maneuver is in progress, the Safing System completes the maneuver, then holds the Telescope in that position, suspending all science operations. Only ground control can return to science operations from Safemode. If the system detects a marginal electrical power problem, or if an internal PCS safety check fails, the Telescope enters the Software Sun Point Mode. The Safing System maneuvers the Telescope so the SAs point toward the Sun to continuously generate solar power. Telescope equipment is maintained within operating temperatures and above survival temperatures, anticipating a return to normal operations. The ST OCC must inter cede to corr ect the K9322-05M  malfunction before any science operations or normal functions can be resumed. Since deployment of the Telescope in 1990, the Safing System has seen additional improvements to increase its robustness to survive hardware failures and still protect the Telescope. Paragraph 5.1.4 describes these features. For the modes described above, the Safing System operates through computer software. If conditions worsen, the system turns over control to the PSEA in Hardware Sun Point Mode. Problems that could provoke this action include any of the following:  Computer malfunction  Batteries losing more than 50 percent of their charge  Two of the three RGAs failing  DMS failing. If these conditions occur, the Advanced Computer stops sending keep-alive signals. This is the ""handshake"" mechanism between the flight software and the PSEA. In the Hardware Sun Point Mode, the PSEA computer commands the Telescope and turns  5-17   off selected equipment to conserve power. Components shut down include the Advanced Computer and, within two hours, the SI C&DH. Befor e this, a payload (instruments) safing sequence begins and, if it has not already done so, the Telescope turns the SAs toward the Sun, guided by the CSSs. The PSEA removes operating power from equipment not r equir ed for Telescope survival. Once ground control is alerted to a problem, NASA management of the STOCC convenes a failure analysis team to evaluate the problem and seek the best and safest corrective action while the Safing System maintains control of the Telescope. The failure analysis team is led by a senior management representative from NASA/GSFC with the authority not only to call upon the expertise of engineers and scientists employed by NASA or its support contractors, but also to draft support fr om any or ganization pr eviously af filiated with the Telescope Project. The failure analysis team is chartered to identify the nature of the anomaly and to r ecommend corrective action. This recommendation is reviewed at a higher management level of NASA/GSFC. All changes to the Telescope's hardware and all software configurations require NASA Level I concurrence as specified in the HST Level I Operations Requirements Document. Pointing/Safemode Electronics and Retrieval Mode Gyro Assemblies. The PSEA consists of 40 electr onic printed-boar d cir cuits with redundant functions to run the Telescope, even in the case of internal circuit failure. It weighs 86 lb (39 kg) and is installed in the Equipment Section Bay 8. A backup gyroscope package, the RMGA, is dedicated for the PSEA and is also located in Bay 8. The RMGA consists of three K9322-05M  gyroscopes. These are lower quality rate sensors than the RGAs because they are not intended for use during observations.  5.2  Optical Telescope Assembly  The OTA was designed and built by the PerkinElmer Corporation (Raytheon Optical Systems, Inc.). Although the OTA is modest in size by ground-based observatory standards and has a straightforward optical design, its accuracy  coupled with its place above the Earth's atmosphere  renders its performance superior. The OTA uses a ""folded"" design, common to large telescopes, which enables a long focal length of 189 ft (57.6 m) to be packaged into a small telescope length of 21 ft (6.4 m). (Several smaller mirrors in the science instruments are designed similarly to lengthen the light path within the particular science instrument.) This form of telescope is called a Cassegrain, and its compactness is an essential component of an observatory designed to fit inside the Shuttle cargo bay. Conventional in design, the OTA is unconventional in other aspects. Lar ge telescopes at ground-based sites are limited in their performance by the resolution attainable while operating under the Earth's atmosphere, but the HST orbits high above the atmosphere and provides an unobstructed view of the universe. For this reason the OTA was designed and built with exacting tolerances to provide near-perfect image quality over the broadest possible region of the spectrum. The OTA is a variant of the Cassegrain, called a Ritchey-Chretien, in which both the mirrors are hyperboloidal in shape (having a deeper curvature than a parabolic mirror). This form is completely corr ected for coma (an image observation having a ""tail"") and spherical  5-18   aberrations to provide an aplanatic system in which aberrations are correct everywhere in the FOV. The only residual aberrations are field curvature and astigmatism. Both of these are zero exactly in the center of the field and increase toward the edge of the field. These aberrations are easily corrected within the instrument optics. For example, in the Faint Object Camera (FOC) there is a small telescope designed to remove image astigmatism. Figure 5-17 shows the path of a light ray from a distant star as it travels through the Telescope to the focus. Light travels down the tube, past baffles that attenuate r eflected light fr om unwanted bright sources, to the 94.5-in. (2.4-m) primary mirror. Reflecting off the front surface of the concave mirror, the light bounces back up the tube to the 12-in. (0.3-m)-diameter convex secondary mirror. The light is now reflected and converged through a 23.5-in. (60-cm) hole in the primary mirror to the Telescope focus, 3.3 ft (1.5 m) behind the primary mirror. Four science instruments and three FGSs share the focal plane by a system of mirrors. A small ""folding"" mirror in the center of the FOV directs  light into the WFPC2. The remaining ""science"" field is divided among three axial science instruments, each receiving a quadrant of the circular FOV. Around the outside of the science field, a ""guidance"" field is divided among the three FGSs by their own folding mirrors. Each FGS receives 60 arcmin2 of field in a 90-degree sector. Figure 5-18 shows instrument/sensor fields of view. The OTA hosts the science instruments and FGSs in that it maintains the structural support and optical-image stability required for these instruments to fulfill their functions (see Fig. 5-19). Components of the OTA are the primary mirror, the secondary mirror, the FPS, and the OTA Equipment Section. Perkin-Elmer Corporation designed and built all the optical assemblies; Lockheed Martin built the OTA equipment section.  5.2.1 Primary Mirror Assembly and Spherical Aberration As the Telescope was put through its paces on orbit in 1990, scientists discovered its primary mirror had a spherical aberration.

After intensive investigation, the problem was traced to faulty test equipment used to define and measure mirror curvature. The optical component of this test equipment was slightly out of focus and, as a result, had shown the mirr or to be gr ound corr ectly. After the discovery, Ball Aer ospace scientists and engineers built the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR). The COSTAR was installed during the First Servicing Mission in December 1993 and br ought the Telescope back to its original specifications. The primary mirror assembly consists of the mirror supported inside the main ring, which is the structural backbone of the Telescope, and the main and central baffles shown in Fig. 5-20. K9322-05M  This assembly provides the structural coupling to the rest of the spacecraft through a set of kinematic brackets linking the main ring to the SSM. The assembly also supports the OTA baffles. Its major parts are:     Primary mirror Main ring structure Reaction plate and actuators Main and central baffles.  Primary Mirror. The primary mirror blank, a product of Corning Glass Works, is known as ultralow-expansion (ULE) glass. It was chosen for its very low-expansion coefficient, which ensures the Telescope minimum sensitivity to temperatur e changes. The mirr or is of a ""sandwich"" construction: two lightweight facesheets separated by a core, or filling, of glass honeycomb ribs in a rectangular grid (see Fig. 5-21).

After being ground and polished, the mirror was coated with a reflective layer of aluminum and a protective layer of magnesium fluoride only 0.1 and 0.025 micr ometer thick,  Fig. 5-20 Primary mirror assembly K9322-05M  5-21   MIRROR CONSTRUCTION FRONT FACESHEET  beam 15 in.

The reaction plate is a wheel of I-beams forming a bulkhead behind the main ring, spanning its diameter. It radiates from a central ring that supports the central baffle. Its primary function is to carry an array of heaters that warm the back of the primary mirror, maintaining its temperature at 70 degrees. Made of lightweight, stiff beryllium, the plate also supports 24 figure-control actuators attached to the primary mirror and arranged around the reaction plate in two concentric circles. These can be commanded fr om the gr ound, if necessary, to make small corrections to the shape of the mirror. Baffles. The baffles of the OTA prevent stray light from bright objects, such as the Sun, Moon, and Earth, from reflecting down the Telescope tube to the focal plane. The primary mirror assembly includes two of the three assembly baffles. Attached to the front face of the main ring, the outer, main baffle is an aluminum cylinder 9 ft (2.7 m) in diameter and 15.7 ft (4.8 m) long. Internal fins help it attenuate stray light.

The primary mirror is mounted to the main ring thr ough a set of kinematic linkages. The linkages attach to the mirror by three rods that penetrate the glass for axial constraint and by three pads bonded to the back of the glass for lateral support. Main Ring.

It extends down the centerline of the Telescope tube. The baf fle interiors ar e painted flat black to minimize light reflection.  5.2.2 Secondary Mirror Assembly The Secondary Mirror Assembly cantilevers off the front face of the main ring and supports the secondary mirror at exactly the correct position in front of the primary mirror. This position must be accurate within 1/10,000 in. whenever the Telescope is operating. The assembly consists of the mirror subassembly, a light baffle, and an outer graphite-epoxy metering truss support structure (see Fig. 5-23). The Secondary Mirror Assembly contains the mirror, mounted on three pairs of alignment actuators that contr ol its position and orientation. All are enclosed within the central hub at the forward end of the truss support. The secondary mirror has a magnification of 10.4X, converting the primary-mirr or  converging rays from f/2.35 to a focal ratio system prime focus of f/24 and sending them back toward the center of the primary mirror, where they pass through the central baffle to the focal point. The mirror is a convex hyperboloid 12 in. (0.3 m) in diameter and made of Zerodur glass coated with aluminum and magnesium fluoride. Steeply convex, its surface accuracy is even greater than that of the primary mirror. Ground command adjusts the actuators to align the secondary mirror to provide perfect image quality. The adjustments are calculated from data picked up by tiny optical control system sensors located in the FGSs. The principal structural element of the Secondary Mirror Assembly is the metering truss, a cage with 48 latticed struts attached to three rings and a central support structure for the secondary mirror. The truss, 16 ft (4.8 m) long and 9 ft (2.7 m) in diameter, is a graphite, fiber-reinforced epoxy structure. Graphite was chosen for its high stiffness, light weight, and ability to reduce the structure's expansiveness to nearly zero. This is vital because the secondary mirror must stay perfectly placed relative to the primary mirror, accurate to within 0.0001 in. (2.5 micrometers) when the Telescope operates. The truss attaches at one end to the front face of the main ring of the Primary Mirr or Assembly. The other end has a central hub that houses the secondary mirror and baffle along the optical axis. Aluminized mylar MLI in the truss compensates for temperature variations of up to 30 degrees Fahrenheit when the Telescope is in Earth's shadow so the primary and secondary mirrors remain aligned. The conical secondary mirror subassembly light baffle extends almost to the primary mirror. It r educes the stray bright-object light fr om sources outside the Telescope FOV.

The -V3 side of the structure, away from the Sun in space, supports the FHSTs and RSUs (see Fig. 5-24). It also provides facilities for on-orbit replacement of any instruments and thermal isolation between instruments. The structure is 7 ft (2.1 m) by 10 ft (3.04 m) long and weighs more than 1200 lb (545.5 kg). Because it must have extreme thermal stability and be stiff, lightweight, and strong, the FPS is constructed of graphite-epoxy, augmented with mechanical fasteners and metallic joints at strength-critical locations. It is equipped with metallic mounts and supports for Orbital Replacement Units (ORU) used during maintenance. The FPS cantilevers off the rear face of the main ring, attached at eight flexible points that adjust to eliminate thermal distortions. The structure provides a fixed alignment for the FGSs. It has PRIMARY MIRROR MAIN RING FOCAL PLANE STRUCTURE AXIAL SCIENCE INSTRUMENT SCIENCE INSTRUMENT CONNECTOR PANEL  guiderails and latches at each instr ument mounting location so Shuttle crews can easily exchange science instr uments and other equipment in orbit.  5.2.4  OTA Equipment Section  The Equipment Section for the OTA is a large semicircular set of compartments mounted outside the spacecraft on the forward shell of the SSM (see Fig. 5-25). It contains the OTA Electrical Power and Thermal Contr ol Electronics (EP/TCE) System, Fine Guidance Electronics (FGE), Actuator Control Electronics (ACE), Optical Control Electronics (OCE), and the fourth DMS DIU. The OTA Equipment Section has nine bays: seven for equipment storage and two for support. All bays have outward-opening doors for easy astronaut access, cabling and connectors for the electronics, and heaters and insulation for thermal control. The EP/TCE System distributes power from the SSM EPS and the OTA system. Thermostats regulate mirror temperatures and prevent mirror distortion from the cold of space. The electrical and thermal electronics also collect thermal sensor data for transmission to the ground. The three FGE units provide power, commands, and telemetry to each FGS. The electronics perform computations for the sensor and interface with the spacecraft pointing system for effective Telescope line-of-sight pointing and stabilization. There is a guidance electronics assembly for each guidance sensor. The ACE unit provides the command and telemetry interface to the 24 actuators attached to the primary mirror and to the six actuators attached to the secondary mirr or. These electronics select which actuator to move and monitor its r esponse to the command.

This is equivalent to seeing from New York City the motion of a landing light on an aircraft flying over San Francisco. When two sensors lock on a target, the third measures the angular position of a star, a process called astrometry. Sensor astrometric functions are discussed in Section 4. During SM2 a re-certified FGS (S/N 2001) was installed as a replacement in the HST FGS Bay 1. During SM3A a re-certified FGS (S/N 2002) will be installed in the HST FGS Bay 2.  5.3  Fine Guidance Sensor 5.3.1 Fine Guidance Sensor Composition and Function Each FGS consists of a large structure housing a collection of mirrors, lenses, servos to locate an image, prisms to fine-track the image, beam splitters, and four photomultiplier tubes, as shown in Fig. 5-26. The entire mechanism adjusts to move the Telescope into precise alignment with a target star. Each FGS has a large (60 arcmin2) FOV to search for and track stars, and a 5.0 arcsec2 FOV used by the detector prisms to pinpoint the star. The sensors work in pairs to aim the Telescope. The Guide Star Selection System, developed by the Science Institute, catalogs and charts guide stars near each observation target to make it  The thr ee FGSs ar e located at 90-degr ee intervals around the circumference of the focal plane structure, between the structure frame and the main ring. Each sensor is 5.4 ft (1.5 m) long and 3.3 ft (1 m) wide and weighs 485 lb (220 kg). Each FGS enclosure houses a guidance sensor and a wavefront sensor. The wavefront sensors are elements of the optical control sensor used to align and optimize the optical system of the Telescope. The Telescope's ability to remain pointing at a distant target to within 0.005 arcsec for long periods of time is due largely to the accuracy of the FGSs. They lock on a star and measure any K9322-05M  5-25   ENCLOSURE ASPHERIC COLLIMATING MIRROR PINHOLE/LENS ASSEMBLY (4)  DOUBLET LENS (4)  STAR SELECTOR MIRRORS CORRECTOR GROUP DEVIATION PRISM OPTICAL BENCH  The FGS can move its line of sight anywhere within its large FOV using a pair of star selector servos. Each can be thought of as an optical gimbal: One servo moves in a north-south direction, the other east and west. They steer the small FOV (5 arcsec2) of the FGS detectors to any position in the sensor field. Encoders within each servo system send back the exact coordinates of the detector field centers at any point. Because the exact location of a guide star may be uncertain, the star selector servos also can cause the detector to search the region around the most pr obable guide star position. It searches in a spiral pattern, starting at the center and spiraling out until it finds the guide star it seeks. Then the detectors are commanded to go into fine-track mode and hold the star image exactly centered in the FOV, while the star selector servo encoders send information about the position of the star to the spacecraft PCS. The detectors are a pair of interferometers, called Koester 's prisms, coupled to photomultiplier tubes (see Fig. 5-27). Each detector operates in one axis, so two detectors ar e needed. Operating on the incoming wavefront from the distant guide star, the interferometers compare the wave phase at one edge of the Telescope's entrance aperture with COLLIMATOR FIRST STAR SELECTOR REFRACTIVE GROUP SECOND STAR SELECTOR BEAM SPLITTER  KOESTERS' PRISMS FILTERS (5) PICKOFF MIRROR  K70110-526  Fig. 5-26 Cutaway view of Fine Guidance Sensor  easier to find the tar get. First, one sensor searches for a target guide star. After the first sensor locks onto a guide star, the second sensor locates and locks onto another target guide star. The guide stars, once designated and located, keep the image of the observation target in the aperture of the selected science instrument. Each FGS uses a 90-degr ee sector of the Telescope's FOV outside the central ""science"" field. This region of the FOV has the greatest astigmatic and curvature distortions. The size of the FGS's FOV was chosen to heighten the probability of finding an appropriate guide star, even in the dir ection of the lowest star population near the galactic poles. An FGS ""pickof f"" mirr or inter cepts the incoming stellar image and projects it into the sensor 's large FOV. Each FGS FOV has 60 arcmin2 available. The guide star of interest can be anywhere within this field, so the FGS will look anywhere in that field to find it. After finding the star, the sensor locks onto it and sends err or signals to the Telescope, telling it how to move to keep the star image perfectly still.

When the phases are equal, the star is exactly centered. Any phase difference shows a pointing error that must be corrected. Along the optical path fr om Telescope to detector are additional optical elements that turn or fold the beam to fit everything inside the FGS enclosure, and to correct the Telescope's astigmatism and field curvature. All optical elements ar e mounted on a temperatur econtrolled, graphite-epoxy composite optical bench.  5.3.2 Articulated Mirror System Analysis of the FGS on-orbit data revealed that minor misalignments of the optical pupil centering on Koester 's prism interferometer in the presence of spherical aberration prevented the FGS fr om achieving its optimum performance. During the recertification of FGS (S/N 2001), fold flat #3 in the radial bay module optical train was mechanized to allow on-orbit alignment of the pupil. Implementation of this system utilized existing signals and commands by rerouting them with a unique interface harness enhancement kit (OCE-EK) interfacing the OCE, the DIU, and the Fine Guidance System/Radial Bay Module (FGS/RBM). The OCE-EK was augmented with the Actuator Mechanism Electronics (AME) and the fold flat #3 Actuator Mechanism Assembly (AMA) located internal to the FGS/RBM. Ground tests indicate a substantial increase in performance of the FGS with this innovative design improvement.  built by British Aerospace, Space Systems  have been scheduled for replacement because of their power loss from radiation exposure in space. However, as engineers put the Telescope through its paces in April 1990, they discovered two problems: a loss of focus and images that jittered briefly when the Telescope flew into and out of Earth's shadow. The jitter problem was traced to the two large SAs. Abrupt temperature changes, from -150 to 200 degrees Fahrenheit during orbit, cause the panels to distort twice during each orbit. As a temporary fix, engineers created software that commanded the PCS to compensate for the jitter automatically. The problem was mitigated during SM1 by the replacement of the old arrays with new ones that had been modified to reduce thermal swings of the bi-stems.  5.4.1 Configuration The SAs are two large rectangular wings of retractable solar cell blankets fixed on a twostem frame. The blanket unfurls from a cassette in the middle of the wing. A spreader bar at each end of the wing stretches the blanket and maintains tension. For the replacement SAs delivered to the Telescope during the First Servicing Mission, the spring-loaded roller assembly was replaced by a series of springs connecting the spreader bar to the blanket. This change eliminated the jitter induced into the Telescope as it passed from eclipse (night) into sunlight (day) each orbit. The wings are on arms that connect to a drive assembly on the SSM forward shell at one end and to the secondary deployment mechanism (blankets and bistems) on the other end. The total length of the cassette, arm, and drive is 15.7 ft (4.8 m) (see Fig. 5-28). Each wing has 10 panels that roll out from the cassette. The panels are made of 2438 solar cells  5.4  Solar Array and Jitter Problems  From the beginning, in the late 1970s, the SAs  designed by the European Space Agency and K9322-05M  5-27   SOLAR ARRAY DRIVE DEPLOYMENT ARM BISTEM CASSETTE  PRIMARY DEPLOYMENT MECHANISM BISTEM WITH NEW THERMAL SHIELD SPREADER BAR BISTEM CASSETTE COMPENSATOR RAIL K70110-528  mechanism assembly: a cassette drum to hold solar panels, a cushion to protect the blanket, and motors and subassemblies. The assembly rolls out the blanket, applies tension evenly so the blankets stretch, and transfers data and power along the wing assembly. The blanket can r oll out completely or part way. The secondary deployment mechanism also has a manual override (see Fig. 5-29). A SA drive at the base of each mast rotates the deployed array toward the Sun, turning in either direction. Each drive has a motor that rotates the mast on command and a brake to keep the array in a fixed position with respect to the Telescope. The drive can move and lock the SA into any position. Each drive has a clamp ring that acts as a release mechanism if opened. This allows a cr ew member to jettison the entire SA if necessary. Two electronics assemblies (boxes)  the Solar Array Deployment Electronics and the Solar Array Drive Electronics  control and monitor all functions of each SA. They provide the electr onic interface to the other Telescope systems and generate the commands for the primary and secondary deployment mechanisms and the SA drive.  Fig. 5-28 Solar Array wing detail  attached to a glass-fiber/Kapton surface, with silver mesh wiring underneath, covered by another layer of Kapton. The blankets are less than 500 micrometers thick, so they roll up tightly when the wings are stowed. Each wing weighs 17 lb (7.7 kg) and, at full extension, is 40 ft (12.1 m) long and 8.2 ft (2.5 m) wide.  5.4.2 Solar Array Subsystems The SA subsystems include the primary and secondary deployment mechanisms, their drives, and associated electronics. The primary deployment mechanism raises the SA mast from the side of the SSM to a standing position perpendicular to the Telescope. There are two mechanisms, one for each wing. Each mechanism has motors to raise the mast and supports to hold it in place when erect. An astronaut can raise the array mast manually if the drive power fails. Using a wrench fitting on the deployment drive, the astronaut handcranks the mast after releasing the latches. Once the SA is raised, the secondary deployment mechanism unfurls the wing blankets.

It works with the DMU to process, format, temporarily store on the data recorders, or transmit all science and engineering data created by the instruments to the ground. Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corporation and IBM built this unit.  A210 REMOTE INTERFACE UNIT CONTROL UNIT/ SCIENCE DATA' FORMATTER BUS COUPLER UNIT A240 CONTROL UNIT/ SCIENCE DATA FORMATTER POWER CONTROL UNIT ORBITAL REPLACEMENT UNIT TRAY K70110-530  5.5.1 Components The SI C&DH unit is a collection of electronic components attached to an ORU tray mounted on the door of Bay 10 in the SSM Equipment Section (see Fig. 5-30). Small Remote Interface Units (RIU), also part of the system, provide the interface to individual science instruments. Components of the SI C&DH unit are the NASA Standard Spacecraft Computer (NSCC-I), two standard interface circuit boards for the computer, two control units/science data formatter units, two CPU modules, a PCU, two RIUs, and various memory, data, and command communications lines (buses) connected by couplers. The SI C&DH components are redundant so the system can recover from any single failure. NASA Computer. The NSSC-I has a CPU and eight memory modules, each holding 8,192 eighteen-bit words. One embedded software program (the ""executive"") runs the computer. It moves data, commands, and operation programs (called applications) for individual science instruments in and out of the processing unit. The application programs monitor and K9322-05M  Fig. 5-30 Science Instrument Control and Data Handling unit  control specific instruments and analyze and manipulate the collected data. The memory stores operational commands for execution when the Telescope is not in contact with the ground. Each memory unit has five areas reserved for commands and pr ograms unique to each science instr ument. The computer can be reprogrammed from the ground for future requests or for working around failed equipment. Standard Interface Unit. The standard interface board is the communications bridge between the computer and the CU/SDF. Control Unit/Science Data Formatter. The heart of the SI C&DH unit is the CU/SDF. It formats and sends all commands and data to designated destinations such as the DMU of the SSM, the NASA computer, and the science instr uments. The unit has a micr opr ocessor for contr ol and formatting functions.  5-29   The CU/SDF receives ground commands, data requests, science and engineering data, and system signals. Two examples of system signals are ""time tags,"" clock signals that synchronize the entire spacecraft, and ""processor interface tables,"" or communications codes. The CU/SDF transmits commands and r equests after formatting them so that the specific destination unit can read. For example, ground commands and SSM commands ar e transmitted with different formats. Ground commands use 27-bit words, and SSM commands use 16-bit words. The formatter translates each command signal into a common format. The CU/SDF also reformats and sends engineering and science data. Onboard analysis of the data is an NSSC-I function. Power Control Unit. The PCU distributes and switches power among components of the SI C&DH unit. It conditions the power required by each unit. For example: The computer memory boards typically need +5 volts, -5 volts, and +12 volts; the CU/SDF, on the other hand, requires +28 volts. The PCU ensures that all voltage requirements are met. Remote Interface Units. RIUs transmit commands, clock and other system signals, and engineering data between the science instruments and the SI C&DH unit. The RIUs do not send science data. There are six RIUs in the Telescope: five attached to the science instruments and one dedicated to the CU/SDF and PCUs in the SI C&DH unit. Each RIU can be coupled with up to two expander units. Communications Buses. The SI C&DH unit contains data bus lines that pass signals and data between the unit and the science instruments. Each bus is multiplexed: one line sends system messages, commands, and engineering data requests to the module units, and a reply line transmits requested information K9322-05M  and science data back to the SI C&DH unit. A coupler attaches the bus to each remote unit. This isolates the module if the RIU should fail. The SI C&DH coupler unit is on the ORU tray.  5.5.2 Operation The SI C&DH unit handles science instrument system monitoring (such as timing and system checks), command pr ocessing, and data processing. System Monitoring. Engineering data tells the monitoring computer whether instr ument systems are functioning. At regular intervals, varying from every 500 milliseconds to every 40 seconds, the SI C&DH unit scans all monitoring devices for engineering data and passes data to the NSCC-I or SSM computer. The computers process or store the information. Any failure indicated by these constant tests could initiate a ""safing hold"" situation (see para 5.1.7), and thus a suspension of science operations. Command Processing. Figure 5-31 shows the flow of commands within the SI C&DH unit. Commands enter the CU/SDF (bottom right in the drawing) through the SSM Command DIU (gr ound commands) or the DIU (SSM commands). The CU/SDF checks and reformats the commands, which then go either to the RIUs or to the NSCC-I for storage. ""Time-tagged"" commands, stored in the computer 's memory (top right of drawing), also follow this process. Each command is interpreted as ""real time,"" as if the SI C&DH just r eceived it. Many commands actually ar e onboar d stor ed commands activated by certain situations. For example, when the Telescope is positioned for a programmed observation using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph, that program is activated. The SI C&DH can issue certain requests to the SSM, such as to execute a limited  5-30   REMOTE MODULES  TO SCIENCE INSTRUMENTS 1-5  SCIENCE INSTRUMENT UNIQUE MEMORY STORED COMMAND MEMORY STORED COMMAND OUTPUT BUFFER  SCIENCE INSTRUMENT UNIQUE MEMORY SCIENCE INSTRUMENT UNIQUE MEMORY SCIENCE INSTRUMENT UNIQUE MEMORY TIME TAGS & COMMANDS DATA MANAGEMENT UNITS 6 AND 7  REMOTE MODULES  REMOTE MODULES  SCIENCE INSTRUMENT UNIQUE MEMORY NASA STANDARD SPACECRAFT COMPUTER MODEL-I AND STANDARD INTERFACE  REMOTE MODULES  COMMANDS  DATA MANAGEMENT UNITS 4 AND 5  DATA MANAGEMENT UNIT 1  COMPUTER COMMANDS  REMOTE MODULES  SUPPORT SYSTEMS MODULE PROCESSOR INTERFACE TABLE WORDS  WORD ORDER, TIME TAG, AND PARITY CHECKS  SUPERVISORY BUS REFORMAT  PARITY AND TYPE CODE CHECKS  FROM COMMAND DATA INTERFACE 27-BIT COMMANDS  REMOTE MODULES  CU/SDF COMMAND PROCESSING  CONTROL  TO CU/SDF LOGIC  PARITY AND WORD ORDER CHECKS  16-BIT COMMANDS FROM DATA INTERFACE UNIT  TO POWER CONTROL UNIT  CONTROL UNIT/SCIENCE DATA FORMATTER (CU/SDF)  K70110-531  Fig. 5-31 Command flow for Science Instrument Control and Data Handling unit  number of pointing control functions to make small Telescope maneuvers. Science Data Processing. Science data can come from all science instruments at once. The CU/ SDF transfers incoming data through computer memory locations called packet buffers. It fills each buffer in order, switching among them as the buffers fill and empty. Each data packet goes fr om the buffer to the NSCC-I for further processing, or directly to the SSM for storage in the data r ecor ders or transmission to the ground. Data returns to the CU/SDF after computer processing. When transmitting, the CU/ SDF must send a continuous stream of data, either full packet buffers or empty buffers called filler packets, to maintain a synchronized link with the SSM. Special checking codes 5-31 K9322-05M  (Reed-Solomon and pseudo-random noise) can be added to the data as options. Figure 5-32 shows the flow of science data in the Telescope.  5.6  Space Support Equipment  The Hubble Space Telescope was designed to be maintained, repaired, and enhanced while in orbit, extending its life and usefulness. For servicing, the Space Shuttle will capture and position the Telescope vertically in the aft end of the cargo bay, and the crew will perform maintenance and replacement tasks. The Space Support Equipment (SSE) to be used during the mission provides a maintenance platform to hold the Telescope, provides electrical support of the Telescope during servicing, and provides storage for replacement components known as ORUs.   NASA STANDARD SPACECRAFT COMPUTER MODEL-I AND STANDARD INTERFACES  DATA LOGS AND PROCESSED SCIENCE DATA  DIRECT MEMORY ACCESS 14  DIRECT MEMORY ACCESS 3  CONTROL WORDS DIRECT MEMORY ACCESS 8  NASA MODEL-I COMPUTER  CONTROL WORDS  DIRECT MEMORY ACCESS 3  SCIENCE DATA BIT STREAM  DIRECT MEMORY ACCESS 5  CONTROL LOGIC  FROM CENTRAL UNIT/ SCIENCE DATA CONTROL COMMANDS FORMATTER COMMAND PROCESSING  END OF PERIOD  TO DATA MANAGEMENT UNIT  SCIENCE DATA PACKET SEGMENTS  REED-SOLOMON CHECKBIT SEGMENTS  PACKET BUFFER 1  CONTROL  RAW SCIENCE DATA  (ONLY IF PN ENCODING SELECTED)  (ONLY IF REED-SOLOMON ENCODING SELECTED)  PN CODE  CONTROL UNIT/SCIENCE DATA FORMATTER LOGIC  RAW OR PACKETIZED DATA  CONTROL SWITCH  SCIENCE DATA INPUT SELECTION LOGIC  The major SSE items used for the Servicing Mission 3A are the Flight Support System (FSS) and the ORU Carrier (ORUC). Additionally, crew aids and tools will be used during servicing.  5.6.1  The FSS provides the platform that holds the Telescope during servicing (see Fig. 5-33). The FSS has been used in different configurations for the HST First and Second Servicing Missions, the Solar Maximum Repair Mission, and the Upper Atmospheric Research Satellite Deploy Mission. The FSS consists of two major components: a horseshoe-shaped cradle and a supporting latch beam providing a structural and electrical interface with the Shuttle. A circular ring called the Berthing and Positioning System (BAPS) interfaces with the Telescope, allowing it to pivot or rotate during the mission. The BAPS ring is pivoted down and locked for liftoff.

A closed-circuit television camera mounted to the FSS helps astronauts guide the Telescope onto the ring. Three remote-controlled latches on the ring grab and hold three towel-rack-like pins on the rear of the Telescope. A remote-controlled electrical umbilical connector on the FSS engages the Telescope, providing it with orbiter power through the FSS. This power helps relieve the drain on the Telescope's batteries during the mission. Radio communications pr ovide telescope telemetry data and control. Once the Telescope is berthed to the ring (see Fig. 5-34), the FSS can pivot (tilt) or rotate the Telescope. This positions the appropriate region of the Telescope for access during extravehicular activity. Additionally, the ring can pivot the Telescope to an appropriate attitude for orbiter reboost. During the first EVA, crew members will install the BAPS Support Post (BSP). The BSP provides an additional linkage to support and isolate the  5-32   K9322_203  Fig. 5-33 Flight Support System configuration  Telescope during EVAs and for any orbital reboosts. The BSP will remain in position for landing. Astronauts remotely control all FSS mechanisms  berthing latches, umbilical connector, pivoter, BSP lock, rotator, and ring down-lock  from the orbiter 's aft flight deck, providing the crew maximum flexibility. Besides being fully electrically r edundant, each mechanism contains manual overrides and backups to ensure mission success and astronaut safety.  5.6.2 Orbital Replacement Unit Carrier An ORUC is used to carry replacements into orbit and to return replaced units to Earth. The carrier consists of a Spacelab pallet outfitted with shelves and protective enclosures to hold the replacement units (see Fig. 5-35). Items on the ORUC for SM3A include (1) the Advanced Computer and two spare VIKs in the LOPE and (2) a Solid State Recorder, an S-Band Single Access Transmitter, the Rate Sensor Units, and associated flight harnesses in the COPE. The FGS will be transported in the FGS Scientific Instr ument Protective Enclosur e (FSIPE). A spare Advanced Computer, a spare Rate Sensor Unit, and Multi-Layer Insulation patches will be carried in the Axial Scientific Instrument Protective Enclosure (ASIPE). The NOBL will be carried in a NOBL Protective Enclosure (NPE). All ORUs and scientific instruments are carried within protective enclosures to provide them a benign environment throughout the mission.

Instruments are mounted in the enclosures using the same manually driven latch system that holds instruments in the Telescope. The ASIPE and FSIPE are mounted to the pallet on a spring system that r educes the level of vibration the instruments receive, especially during liftoff and landing. The other ORUs are carried in an additional enclosure called the Large ORU Protective Enclosure (LOPE). The enclosure also provides contamination and thermal control, though not to such stringent requirements as the SIPE. The  LOPE contains Transport Modules that are designed to custom fit each ORU. The transport modules have foam or Visco-Elastic Material that surrounds the ORU and isolates it from launch and landing vibration environments. During the change-out pr ocess, r eplaced science instruments are stored temporarily in the ORUC. A typical change-out begins with an astronaut removing the old instrument fr om the Telescope and attaching it to a bracket on the ORUC. The astronaut then r emoves the new instr ument fr om its protective enclosur e and installs it in the Telescope. Finally, the astronaut places the old instr ument in the appr opriate pr otective enclosure for return to Earth.  5-34 K9322-05M   The ORUC receives power for its TCS from the FSS. The carrier also provides temperature telemetry data through the FSS for readout in the Shuttle and on the ground during the mission.  as on the FGS. Another tool is the Portable Foot Restraint (PFR), shown in Fig. 5-36. While the astronauts work, they use tethers to hook tools to their suits and tie replacement units to the Telescope. Each crew member has a ratchet wrench to manually crank the antenna and array masts if power for the mast drives fails. A power wrench also is available if handcranking is too time consuming. Other hand tools include portable lights and a jettison handle, which attach to sockets on the aperture door and to SA wings so the crew can push the equipment away from the Telescope.  5.6.3  Crew Aids  Astronauts perform extravehicular activities using many tools to replace instruments and equipment, to move around the Telescope and the cargo bay, and to operate manual override drives. Tools and equipment, bolts, connectors, and other hardware were standardized not only for the Telescope but also between the Telescope and the Shuttle. For example, grappling receptacles share common features. To move around the Telescope, the crew uses 225 ft of handrails encircling the spacecraft. For visibility, the rails ar e painted yellow. In addition, the crew can hold onto guiderails, trunnion bars, and scuff plates fore and aft. The astronauts can install portable handhold plates where there are no permanent holds, such  LOCK YAW CONTROL  PITCH CONTROL A  A  ELEVATION CONTROL K70110-536  Fig. 5-36 Portable Foot Restraint  5-35 K9322-05M"
GX257-02-6107454	"HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE SYSTEMS  T  he Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has three interacting systems:   The Support Systems Module (SSM), an outer structure that houses the other systems and provides services such as electrical power, data communications, and pointing control and maneuvering  The Optical Telescope Assembly (OTA), which collects and concentrates the incoming light in the focal plane for use by the science instruments  Eight major science instruments, four housed in an aft section focal plane structure (FPS) and four placed along the circumference of the spacecraft. With the exception of the Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS), the Science Instrument Control and Data Handling (SI C&DH) unit controls all. Additional systems that also support HST operations include two Solar Arrays (SA).  These generate electrical power and charge onboar d batteries and communications antennas to r eceive commands and send telemetry data from the HST. Figure 5-1 shows the HST configuration. The Telescope performs much like a ground observatory. The SSM is designed to support functions required by any ground astronomical observatory. It provides power, points the Telescope, and communicates with the OTA, SI C&DH unit, and instr uments to r eady an observation. Light from an observed target passes through the Telescope and into one or more of the science instruments, where the light is recorded. This information goes to onboard computers for processing, and then it is either temporarily stored or sent to Earth in real time, via the spacecraft communication system.

The primary axis, V1, runs through the center of the Telescope. The other two axes parallel the SA masts (V2) and the High Gain Antenna (HGA) masts (V3) (see Fig. 5-2). The Telescope points and maneuvers to new targets by rotating about its body axes. Pointing instruments use references to these axes to aim at a target in space, position the SA, or change Telescope orientation in orbit.

Fitting together are the light shield, the forward shell, the SSM Equipment Section, and the aft shroud/bulkhead  all designed and built by Lockheed Martin Missiles & Space (see Fig. 5-4). Aperture Door. The apertur e door, approximately 10-ft (3 m) in diameter, covers the opening to the Telescope's light shield. The door is made from honeycombed aluminum sheets. The outside is covered with solar reflecting material, and the inside is painted black to absorb stray light. The door opens a maximum of 105 degrees from the closed position. The Telescope aperture allows for a 50-degree field of view (FOV) centered on the +V1 axis. Sun-avoidance sensors provide ample warning to automatically close the door befor e sunlight can damage the Telescope's optics.

An example is observing a bright object, using the dark limb (edge) of the Moon to partially block the light. Light Shield. The light shield (see Fig. 5-4) blocks out stray light. It connects to both the aperture door and the forward shell. On the outer skin of the Telescope on opposite sides are latches to secure the SAs and HGAs when they are stowed. Near the SA latches are scuff plates, 5-3  EQUIPMENT SECTION  AFT SHROUD  K70110-504  Fig. 5-4 Structural components of Support Systems Module  K9322-05M   large protective metal plates on struts that extend approximately 30 in. from the surface of the spacecraft. Trunnions lock the Telescope into the Shuttle cargo bay by hooking to latches in the bay. The light shield supports the forward Low Gain Antenna (LGA) and its communications waveguide, two magnetometers, and two sun sensors. Handrails encircle the light shield, and built-in foot restraints support the astronauts working on the Telescope. Figure 5-5 shows the aperture door and light shield. The shield is 13-ft (4 m) long, with an internal diameter of 10-ft (3 m). It is machined from magnesium, with a stiffened, corrugatedskin barrel cover ed by a thermal blanket. Internally the shield has 10 light baffles, painted flat black to suppress stray light. Forward Shell. The forward shell, or central section of the structure, houses the OTA main baffle and the secondary mirror (see Fig. 5-6). When stowed, the SAs and HGAs are latched flat against the forward shell and light shield. Four magnetic torquers are placed 90 degrees  apart around the circumference of the forward shell. The outer skin has two grapple fixtures next to the HGA drives, where the Shuttle's Remote Manipulator System can attach to the Telescope. The forward shell also has handholds, footholds, and a trunnion, which is used to lock the Telescope into the Shuttle cargo bay. The forward shell is 13-ft (4 m) long and 10-ft (3 m) in diameter. It is machined from aluminum plating, with external reinforcing rings and internal stiffened panels. The rings are on the outside to ensure clearance for the OTA inside. Thermal blankets cover the exterior. Equipment Section. This section is a ring of storage bays encircling the SSM. It contains about 90 percent of the electronic components that run the spacecraft, including equipment serviced during extravehicular activities (EVA) by Space Shuttle astronauts. The Equipment Section is a doughnut-shaped barrel that fits between the forward shell and aft shr oud. This section contains 10 bays for equipment and two bays to support aft trunnion pins and scuff plates.

The bays are 4-ft (1.2 m) wide and 5-ft (1.5 m) deep. The Equipment Section is constr ucted of machined and stif fened aluminum frame panels attached to an inner aluminum barr el. Eight bays have flat honeycombed aluminum doors mounted with equipment. In Bays 6 and 9, thermal-stiffened panel doors cover the r eaction wheels. A forward frame panel and aft bulkhead enclose the SSM Equipment Section. Six mounts on the inside of the bulkhead hold the OTA. Aft Shroud and Bulkhead. The aft shroud (see Fig. 5-8) houses the FPS containing the axial science instruments. It is also the location of the Corr ective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) unit. The three FGSs and the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) are housed radially near the connecting point between the aft shroud and SSM Equipment Section. Doors on the outside of the shroud allow shuttle astronauts to remove and change equipment and instruments easily. Handrails and foot restraints for the crew run along the length and circumference of the 5-6 K9322-05M  Fig. 5-8 Support Systems Module aft shroud and bulkhead  shroud. During maintenance or removal of an instr ument, interior lights illuminate the compartments containing the science instruments. The shroud is made of aluminum, with a stiffened skin, internal panels and reinforcing rings, and 16 external and internal longeron bars for support. It is 11.5-ft (3.5 m) long and 14-ft (4.3 m) in diameter. The aft b ulkhead contains the umbilical connections between the Telescope and the shuttle, used during launch/deployment and on-orbit maintenance. The rear LGA attaches to the bulkhead, which is made of 2-in.-thick honeycombed aluminum panels and has three radial aluminum support beams. The shroud and bulkhead support a gas purge system that was used to prevent contamination of the science instruments before launch. All vents used to expel gases are light tight. Thus, stray light is prevented from entering the OTA focal plane. Mechanisms. Along the SSM str ucture are mechanisms that perform various functions, including:    Latches to hold antennas and SAs  Hinge drives to open the aperture door and erect arrays and antennas  Gimbals to move the HGA dishes  Motors to power the hinges and latches and to rotate arrays and antennas. There are nine latches: four for antennas, four for arrays, and one for the aperture door. They latch and release using four-bar linkages and are driven by stepper motors called Rotary Drive Actuators (RDA). There are three hinge drives, one for each HGA and one for the door. The hinges also use an RDA. Both hinges and latches have hex-wrench fittings so an astronaut can manually operate the mechanism to deploy the door, antenna, or array if a motor fails.  science data is transmitted, and ""Single Access"" specifies the type of antenna on the TDRS satellite to which the data is sent. High Gain Antennas. Each HGA is a parabolic reflector (dish) mounted on a mast with a twoaxis gimbal mechanism and electronics to rotate it 100 degrees in either direction (see Fig. 5-9). General Electric designed and made the antenna dishes. They ar e manufactur ed fr om honeycomb aluminum and graphite-epoxy facesheets. Each antenna can be aimed with a one-degree pointing accuracy. This accuracy is consistent with the overall antenna beam width of over four degrees. The antennas transmit over two frequencies: 2255.5 MHz or 2287.5 MHz (plus or minus 10 MHz). Low Gain Antennas. The LGAs receive ground commands and transmit engineering data. They are set 180 degrees apart on the light shield and aft bulkhead of the spacecraft. Each antenna is a spiral cone that can operate over a frequency range fr om 2100 MHz to 2300 MHz. Manufactured by Lockheed Martin, the LGAs  5.1.2 Instrumentation and Communications Subsystem This subsystem provides the communications loop between the Telescope and the Tracking and Data Relay Satellites (TDRS), receiving commands and sending data through the HGAs and LGAs. All information is passed through the Data Management Subsystem (DMS). The HGAs achieve a much higher RF signal gain, which is required, for example, when transmitting high-data-rate scientific data. These antennas require pointing at the TDRSs because of their characteristically narrow beam widths. On the other hand, the LGAs provide spherical coverage (omnidirectional) but have a much lower signal gain. The LGAs are used for lowrate-data transmission and all commanding of the Telescope. S-Band Single Access Transmitter (SSAT). The Telescope is equipped with two SSATs. ""S-Band"" identifies the frequency at which the 5-7 K9322-05M  HIGH GAIN ANTENNA  TWIN-AXIS GIMBALS  K70110-509  Fig. 5-9 High Gain Antenna   are used for all commanding of the Telescope and for low-data-rate telemetry, particularly during Telescope deployment or retrieval on orbit, or during safemode operations.  The components ar e located in the SSM Equipment Section, except for one DIU stored in the OTA Equipment Section. The DMS receives, processes, and transmits five types of signals: 1. Ground commands sent to the HST systems 2. Onboard computer-generated or computerstored commands 3. Scientific data from the SI C&DH unit 4. Telescope engineering status data for telemetry 5. System outputs, such as clock signals and safemode signals. Figur e 5-10 is the subsystem functional diagram. DF-224 Computer. The DF-224 computer is a general-purpose digital computer for onboard  5.1.3 Data Management Subsystem The DMS r eceives communications commands from the STOCC and data from the SSM systems, OTA, and science instruments. It processes, stores, and sends the information as r equested. Subsystem components are:  DF-224 computer (will be replaced on SM3A with the Advanced Computer)  Data Management Unit (DMU)  Four Data Interface Units (DIU)  Three engineering/science data recorders  Two oscillators (clocks).

It executes stored commands; formats status data (telemetry); performs all Pointing Control Subsystem (PCS) computations to maneuver, point, and attitude stabilize the Te lescope; generates onboard commands to orient the SAs toward the Sun; evaluates the health status of the Telescope systems; and commands the HGAs. The Advanced Computer will replace the DF-224 on SM3A and will assume its functions. Advanced Computer. The Advanced Computer is based on the Intel 80486 microchip. It operates 20 times faster and has six times as much memory as the DF-224. The Advanced Computer was designed using commercially developed components. A battery of mechanical, electrical, radiation and thermal tests were performed at GSFC to assure its survival in the space environment. A successful flight test of the hardware was carried out aboard the space shuttle Discovery on STS-95 in October 1998. The Advanced Computer is configured as three independent single-board computers. Each single-boar d computer (SBC) has two megabytes of fast static random access memory and one megabyte of non-volatile memory. The Advanced Computer communicates with the HST by using the direct memory access capability on each SBC thr ough the Data Management Unit (DMU). Only one SBC may control the Telescope at a time. The other SBCs can be off, in an idle state, or performing internal tasks. Upon power on, each SBC runs a built-in selftest and then copies the operating software from slower non-volatile memory to faster random access memory. The self-test is capable of diagnosing any problems with the Advanced 5-9 K9322-05M  Computer and reporting them to the ground. Fast static random access memory is used in the Advanced Computer to eliminate wait states and allow it to run at its full-rated speed. The Advanced Computer measures 18.8 x 18 x 13 inches (0.48 x 0.46 x 0.33 m) and weighs 70.5 lb (32 kg). It will be located in Bay 1 of the SSM Equipment Section (see Fig. 5-11). Data Management Unit. The DMU links with the computer. It encodes data and sends messages to selected Telescope units and all DMS units, powers the oscillators, and is the central timing source. The DMU also receives and decodes all incoming commands, then transmits each pr ocessed command to be executed. The DMU receives science data from the SI C&DH unit. Engineering data, consisting of sensor and hardware status readings (such as temperature or voltages), comes from each Telescope subsystem. The data can be stored in the onboard data recorders if direct telemetry via a TDRS is unavailable.  K70110-511  Fig. 5-11 Advanced computer   The DMU is an assembly of printed-circuit boards, interconnected through a backplate and external connectors. The unit weighs 83 lb (37.7 kg), measures 26 x 30 x 7 in. (60 x 70 x 17 cm), and is attached to the door of Equipment Section Bay 1 (see Fig. 5-12). Data Interface Unit. The four DIUs provide a command and data link between DMS and other Telescope electronic boxes. The DIUs receive commands and data requests from the DMU and pass data or status information back to the DMU. The OTA DIU is located in the OTA Equipment Section; the other units are in Bays 3, 7, and 10 of the SSM Equipment Section. As a safeguard, each DIU is two complete units in one; either part can handle the unit's functions. Each DIU measures 15 x 16 x 7 in. (38 x 41 x 18 cm) and weighs 35 lb (16 kg). Engineering/Science Data Recorders. The DMS includes thr ee data r ecor ders that stor e POWER SUPPLY NO. 2 (CDI DC-DC CONVERTER) TOP COVER (WITH COMPRESSION PAD)  engineering or science data that cannot be transmitted to the ground in real time. The recorders, which are located in Equipment Section Bays 5 and 8, hold up to 12 billion bits of information. Two recorders are used in normal operations; the third is a backup. Each recorder measures 12 x 9 x 7 in. (30 x 23 x 18 cm) and weighs 20 lb (9 kg). Solid State Recorder. During SM2 a Solid State Recorder (SSR) was installed, replacing a reelto-reel tape recorder. A second state-of-the-art SSR will be installed during SM3A. This digital recorder will replace one of the two remaining reel-to-reel recorders on HST. The Solid State Recorders have an expected on-orbit life of at least eight years. They can record two data streams simultaneously, allowing both science and engineering data to be captured on a single recorder. In addition, data can be recorded and played back at the same time. The SSR has no reels or tape, and no moving parts to wear out and limit lifetime. Data is stored digitally in computer-like memory chips until HST's operators at GSFC command the SSR to play it back. Although they are the same size as the reel-to-reel recorders, the SSRs can store over 10 times more data -- 12 gigabits versus only 1.2 gigabits for the tape recorders they replace. Oscillator. The oscillator provides a highly stable central timing pulse required by the Telescope. It has a cylindrical housing 4 in. (10 cm) in diameter and 9 in. (23 cm) long and weighs 3 lb (1.4 kg). The oscillator and a backup are mounted in Bay 2 of the SSM Equipment Section.  PC BOARD STANDARD (5 X 7 in.) HEAT SHIELD PARTITION (TYP)  CARD GUIDE ENCLOSURE (DIP-BRAZED AL.)

The PCS is designed for pointing to within 0.01 arcsec and holding the Telescope in that orientation with 0.007-arcsec stability for up to 24 hours while the Telescope continues to orbit the Earth at 17,500 mph. If the Telescope wer e in Los Angeles, it could hold a beam of light on a dime in San Francisco without the beam straying from the coin's diameter. Nominally, the PCS maintains the Telescope's precision attitude by locating guide stars into two FGSs and controlling the Telescope to keep it in the same position relative to these stars. When specific tar get r equests r equir e r epositioning the spacecraft, the pointing system selects different reference guide stars and moves the Telescope into a new attitude. The PCS encompasses the Advanced Computer, various attitude sensors, and two types of devices, called actuators, to move the spacecraft (see Fig. 5-13). It also includes the Pointing/ Safemode Electronics Assembly (PSEA) and the Retrieval Mode Gyro Assembly (RMGA); both used by the spacecraft safemode system. See para 5.1.7 for details. Sensors. The five types of sensors used by the PCS are the Coarse Sun Sensors (CSS), the Magnetic Sensing System (MSS), the Rate Gyro Assemblies (RGA), the Fixed Head Star Trackers (FHST), and the FGSs. The CSSs measure the Telescope's orientation to the Sun. They are used to calculate the initial deployment orientation of the Telescope, determine when to begin closing the aperture door, and point the Telescope in special sunorientation modes during contingency operations. Five CSSs are located on the light shield and aft shroud. CSSs also provide signals to the PSEA, located in Bay 8 of the SSM Equipment Section. K9322-05M  The MSS measures the Telescope's orientation relative to Earth's magnetic field. The system consists of magnetometers and dedicated electronic units that send data to the Advanced Computer and the Safemode Electr onic Assembly. Two systems are provided. Both are located on the front end of the light shield. Three RGAs are provided on the Telescope. Each assembly consists of a Rate Sensor Unit (RSU) and an Electronics Control Unit (ECU). An RSU contains two rate-sensing gyroscopes, each measuring attitude rate motion about its sensitive axis. This output is processed by its dedicated electronics, which are contained in the ECU. Each unit has two sets of electronics. The RSUs are located behind the SSM Equipment Section, next to the FHSTs in the aft shroud. The ECUs are located inside Bay 10 of the SSM Equipment Section. The RGAs provide input to the PCS to control the orientation of the Telescope's line of sight and to provide the attitude reference when maneuvering the Telescope. Four of the original six rate gyros were replaced during the First Servicing Mission. All six rate gyros are planned for replacement during SM3A. Three of six gyroscopes are required to continue the Telescope science mission. An FHST is an electro-optical detector that locates and tracks a specific star within its FOV. Three FHSTs are located in the aft shroud behind the FPS, next to the RSUs. STOCC uses star trackers as an attitude calibration device when the Telescope maneuvers into its initial orientation. The trackers also calculate attitude information before and after maneuvers to help the FGS lock onto guide stars. Three FGSs, discussed in more detail in para 5.3, provide angular position with respect to the stars.

Two of the FGSs perform guide-star pointing, while the third is available for astr ometry, the positional measurement of specific stars. Pointing Control Subsystem Software. PCS software accounts for a large percentage of the flight code executed by the Hubble's main computer. This software translates ground targeting commands into reaction wheel torque profiles that reorient the spacecraft. All motion of the spacecraft is smoothed to minimize jitter during data collection. The software also determines Telescope orientation, or attitude, from FHST or FGS data and commands the magnetic torquer bars so that reaction wheel speeds are always minimized. In addition, the software provides various telemetry formats. Since the Telescope was launched, major modifications have been made to the PCS. A digital filtering scheme, known as Solar Array Gain Augmentation (SAGA) was incorporated to mitigate the effect of any SA vibration or jitter on pointing stability. Software also was used to improve FGS performance when the Telescope is subjected to the same disturbances. This algorithm is referred to as the FGS Re-Centering Algorithm. Software is used extensively to increase Telescope robustness when hardwar e failures are experienced. Two additional software safemodes have been provided. The spin-stabilized mode provides pointing of the Telescope -V1 axis to the Sun with only two of the four RWAs operating. The other mode allows Sun pointing of the Telescope without any input from the RGA; magnetometer and CSS data is used to derive all reference information needed to maintain Sun pointing (+V3 and -V1 are options). A further software change ""refreshes"" the FGS configuration. This is achieved by maintaining  data in the Advanced Computer memory so it can be sent periodically to the FGS electronics, which are subject to single-event upsets (logic state change) when transitioning through the South Atlantic Anomaly. Actuators. The PCS has two types of actuators: RWAs and magnetic torquers. Actuators move the spacecraft into commanded attitudes and provide required control torques to stabilize the Telescope's line of sight. The reaction wheels work by rotating a large flywheel up to 3000 rpm or braking it to exchange momentum with the spacecraft. The wheel axes are oriented so that the Telescope can provide science with only three wheels operating. Wheel assemblies are paired, two each in Bays 6 and 9 of the SSM Equipment Section. Each wheel is 23 in. (59 cm) in diameter and weighs about 100 lb (45 kg). Figure 5-14 shows the RWA configuration. Magnetic torquers create torque on the spacecraft and are primarily used to manage reaction wheel speed. The torquers react against Earth's magnetic field. The torque reaction occurs in the direction that reduces the reaction wheel speed, managing the angular momentum. The magnetic torquers also provide backup contr ol to stabilize the Telescope's orbital attitude during the contingency modes, as described in para 5.1.2. Each torquer, located externally on the forward shell of the SSM, is 8.3  RWA  RWA  K70110-514  Fig. 5-14 Reaction Wheel Assembly  5-13 K9322-05M   ft (2.5 m) long and 3 in. (8 cm) in circumference and weighs 100 lb (45 kg). Pointing Control Operation. To point precisely, the PCS uses the gyroscopes, reaction wheels, magnetic torquers, star trackers, and FGSs. The FGSs provide the precision reference point from which the Telescope can begin repositioning. Flight software commands the reaction wheels to spin, accelerating or decelerating as required to rotate the Telescope toward a new target. Rate gyr oscopes sense the Telescope's angular motion and pr ovide a short-term attitude reference to assist fine pointing and spacecraft maneuvers. The magnetic torquers r educe reaction wheel speed. As the Telescope nears the target area, star trackers locate preselected reference stars that stand out brightly in that region of the sky. Once the star trackers reduce the attitude error below 60 arcsec, the two FGSs take over the pointing duties. Working with the gyroscopes, the FGSs make possible pointing the Telescope to within 0.01 arcsec of the target. The PCS can maintain this position, wavering no more than 0.005 arcsec, for up to 24 hours to guarantee faintobject observation.  into electricity. Energy will be stored in nickelhydrogen (NiH2) batteries and distributed by the PCUs and PDUs to all Telescope components as shown in Fig. 5-15. The Telescope will not be released until the batteries are fully charged. Solar Arrays. The SA panels, discussed later in this section, are the primary source of electrical power. Each array wing has a solar cell blanket that converts solar energy into electrical energy. Electricity produced by the solar cells charges the Telescope batteries. Each array wing has associated electronics. These consist of a Solar Array Drive Electronics (SADE) unit, which transmits positioning commands to the wing assembly; a Deployment Control Electronics Unit, which controls the drive motors extending and retracting the wings; and diode networks to dir ect the electrical current flow. Batteries and Charge Current Controllers. Developed for the 1990 deployment mission, the Telescope's batteries were NASA's first flight NiH2 batteries. They provide the observatory with a robust, long-life electrical energy storage system. Six NiH 2 batteries support the Telescope's electrical power needs during three periods: when demand exceeds SA capability, when the Telescope is in Earth's shadow, and during safemode entry. The batteries reside in SSM Equipment Section Bays 2 and 3. These units have extensive safety and handling provisions to protect the Shuttle and its astronauts. The design and operation of these batteries, along with special nondestructive inspection of each cell, have allowed these units to be ""astronaut-rated"" for replacement during a servicing mission. To compensate for the effects of battery aging, SM3A astronauts will install a Voltage/Temperature Im provement Kit (VIK) on each of  5.1.5 Electrical Power Subsystem Power for the Telescope and science instruments comes from the Electrical Power Subsystem (EPS). The major components are two SA wings and their electr onics, six batteries, six Char ge Curr ent Contr ollers (CCC), one Power Control Unit (PCU), and four Power Distribution Units (PDU). All except the SAs are located in the bays around the SSM Equipment Section. During the servicing mission, the Shuttle will provide the electrical power.

The VIK provides battery thermal stability by precluding battery overcharge when the HST enters safemode, effectively lowering the Charge Current Controller (CCC) recharge current. Each battery consists of 22 cells in series along with heaters, heater contr ollers, pr essur e measurement transducers and electronics, and temperatur e-measuring devices and their associated electronics. Thr ee batteries ar e packaged into a module measuring roughly 36 by 36 by 10 in. (90 x 90 x 25 cm) and weighing about 475 lb (214 kg). Each module is equipped with two large yellow handles that astronauts use to maneuver the module in and out of the Telescope in space. The SAs recharge the batteries every orbit following eclipse (the time in the Earth's shadow). The recharge current is controlled by the CCCs. Each battery has its own CCC that uses voltage-temperature measurements to control battery recharge.  Fully charged, each battery contains more than 75 amp-hours. This is sufficient energy to sustain the Telescope in normal science operations mode for 7.5 hours or five orbits. The batteries provide an adequate energy reserve for all possible safemode contingencies and all enhancements programmed into the Telescope since launch. Power Control and Distribution Units. The PCU interconnects and switches current flowing among the SAs, batteries, and CCCs. Located in Bay 4 of the Equipment Section, the PCU provides the main power bus to the four PDUs. The PCU weighs 120 lb (55 kg) and measures 43 x 12 x 8 in. (109 x 30 x 20 cm). Four PDUs, located on the inside of the door to Bay 4, contain the power buses, switches, fuses, and monitoring devices for electrical power distribution to the rest of the Telescope. Two buses are dedicated to the OTA, science instruments, and SI C&DH; two supply the SSM. Each PDU measures 10 x 5 x 18 in. (25 x 12.5 x 45 cm) and weighs 25 lb (11 kg).  5-15 K9322-05M   5.1.6  Thermal Control  Multilayer insulation (MLI) covers 80 percent of the Telescope's exterior, and supplemental electric heaters maintain its temperatures within safe limits. The insulation blankets are 15 layers of aluminized Kapton, with an outer layer of aluminized Teflon flexible optical solar reflector (FOSR). Aluminized or silvered flexible reflector tape covers most of the remaining exterior. These coverings protect against the cold of space and r eflect solar heat. In addition, reflective or absorptive paints are used. The SSM Thermal Control Subsystem (TCS) maintains temperatures within set limits for the components mounted in the Equipment Section and structures interfacing with the OTA and science instruments. The TCS maintains safe component temperatures even for worst-case conditions such as environmental fluctuations, passage from ""cold"" Earth shadow to ""hot"" solar exposure during each orbit, and heat generated from equipment operation. Specific thermal-protection features of the SSM include:  MLI thermal blankets for the light shield and forward shell  Aluminum FOSR tape on the aperture door surface facing the sun  Specific patterns of FOSR and MLI blankets on the exteriors of the Equipment Section bay doors, with internal MLI blankets on the bulkheads to maintain thermal balance between bays  Efficient placement of equipment and use of equipment bay space to match temperature requirements, such as placing heat-dissipating equipment on the side of the Equipment Section mostly exposed to orbit shadow  Silvered FOSR tape on the aft shroud and aft bulkhead exteriors K9322-05M   Radiation shields inside the aft shroud doors and MLI blankets on the aft bulkhead and shroud interiors to protect the science instruments  More than 200 temperature sensors and thermistors placed throughout the SSM, externally and internally, to monitor individual components and control heater operations. Figure 5-16 shows the location and type of thermal pr otection used on the SSM. SM2 observations identified degradations of all of the MLI. Additional material will be installed during SM3A to cover some of the degraded material and restore the external layer surface properties. The additional material has been life-tested to an equivalent of 10 years. The layer being added to the SSM Equipment Section is a composite-coated (silicone dioxide) stainless steel layer, known as the New Outer Blanket Layer (NOBL). The light shield/ forward shell material is Teflon with a scrim backing for durability.  5.1.7 Safing (Contingency) System Overlapping or redundant Telescope equipment safeguar ds against any br eakdown. Nonetheless, a contingency or Safing System exists for emergency operations. It uses many pointing contr ol and data management components as well as dedicated PSEA har dwar e. This system maintains stable Telescope attitude, moves the SAs for maximum Sun exposure, and conserves electrical power by minimizing power drain. The Safing System can operate the spacecraft indefinitely with no communications link to ground control. During scientific observations (normal mode), the Safing System is r elegated to monitor automatically Telescope onboard functions. The system sends Advanced-Computer-generated  5-16   ALUMINIZED FLEXIBLE OPTICAL SOLAR REFLECTOR (FOSR) APERTURE DOOR LIGHT SHIELD BLACK CHEMGLAZE ALUMINIZED FOSR SILVERIZED FOSR FORWARD SHELL EQUIPMENT AFT SHROUD SECTION 90-DEG MULTILAYER INSULATION (MLI)  ALUMINIZED SILVERIZED FOSR FOSR  +V1 OPTICAL BLACK MLI MLI MLI MLI FOSR MLI 90-DEG MLI K70110-516  Fig. 5-16 Placement of thermal protection on Support Systems Module  ""keep-alive"" signals to the PSEA that indicate all Telescope systems are functioning. Entry into the Safemode is autonomous once a failure is detected. The Safing System is designed to follow a progression of contingency operating modes, depending on the situation aboar d the Telescope. If a malfunction occurs and does not threaten the Telescope's survival, the Safing System moves into a Software Inertial Hold Mode. This mode holds the Telescope in the last position commanded. If a maneuver is in progress, the Safing System completes the maneuver, then holds the Telescope in that position, suspending all science operations. Only ground control can return to science operations from Safemode. If the system detects a marginal electrical power problem, or if an internal PCS safety check fails, the Telescope enters the Software Sun Point Mode. The Safing System maneuvers the Telescope so the SAs point toward the Sun to continuously generate solar power. Telescope equipment is maintained within operating temperatures and above survival temperatures, anticipating a return to normal operations. The ST OCC must inter cede to corr ect the K9322-05M  malfunction before any science operations or normal functions can be resumed. Since deployment of the Telescope in 1990, the Safing System has seen additional improvements to increase its robustness to survive hardware failures and still protect the Telescope. Paragraph 5.1.4 describes these features. For the modes described above, the Safing System operates through computer software. If conditions worsen, the system turns over control to the PSEA in Hardware Sun Point Mode. Problems that could provoke this action include any of the following:  Computer malfunction  Batteries losing more than 50 percent of their charge  Two of the three RGAs failing  DMS failing. If these conditions occur, the Advanced Computer stops sending keep-alive signals. This is the ""handshake"" mechanism between the flight software and the PSEA. In the Hardware Sun Point Mode, the PSEA computer commands the Telescope and turns  5-17   off selected equipment to conserve power. Components shut down include the Advanced Computer and, within two hours, the SI C&DH. Befor e this, a payload (instruments) safing sequence begins and, if it has not already done so, the Telescope turns the SAs toward the Sun, guided by the CSSs. The PSEA removes operating power from equipment not r equir ed for Telescope survival. Once ground control is alerted to a problem, NASA management of the STOCC convenes a failure analysis team to evaluate the problem and seek the best and safest corrective action while the Safing System maintains control of the Telescope. The failure analysis team is led by a senior management representative from NASA/GSFC with the authority not only to call upon the expertise of engineers and scientists employed by NASA or its support contractors, but also to draft support fr om any or ganization pr eviously af filiated with the Telescope Project. The failure analysis team is chartered to identify the nature of the anomaly and to r ecommend corrective action. This recommendation is reviewed at a higher management level of NASA/GSFC. All changes to the Telescope's hardware and all software configurations require NASA Level I concurrence as specified in the HST Level I Operations Requirements Document. Pointing/Safemode Electronics and Retrieval Mode Gyro Assemblies. The PSEA consists of 40 electr onic printed-boar d cir cuits with redundant functions to run the Telescope, even in the case of internal circuit failure. It weighs 86 lb (39 kg) and is installed in the Equipment Section Bay 8. A backup gyroscope package, the RMGA, is dedicated for the PSEA and is also located in Bay 8. The RMGA consists of three K9322-05M  gyroscopes. These are lower quality rate sensors than the RGAs because they are not intended for use during observations.  5.2  Optical Telescope Assembly  The OTA was designed and built by the PerkinElmer Corporation (Raytheon Optical Systems, Inc.). Although the OTA is modest in size by ground-based observatory standards and has a straightforward optical design, its accuracy  coupled with its place above the Earth's atmosphere  renders its performance superior. The OTA uses a ""folded"" design, common to large telescopes, which enables a long focal length of 189 ft (57.6 m) to be packaged into a small telescope length of 21 ft (6.4 m). (Several smaller mirrors in the science instruments are designed similarly to lengthen the light path within the particular science instrument.) This form of telescope is called a Cassegrain, and its compactness is an essential component of an observatory designed to fit inside the Shuttle cargo bay. Conventional in design, the OTA is unconventional in other aspects. Lar ge telescopes at ground-based sites are limited in their performance by the resolution attainable while operating under the Earth's atmosphere, but the HST orbits high above the atmosphere and provides an unobstructed view of the universe. For this reason the OTA was designed and built with exacting tolerances to provide near-perfect image quality over the broadest possible region of the spectrum. The OTA is a variant of the Cassegrain, called a Ritchey-Chretien, in which both the mirrors are hyperboloidal in shape (having a deeper curvature than a parabolic mirror). This form is completely corr ected for coma (an image observation having a ""tail"") and spherical  5-18   aberrations to provide an aplanatic system in which aberrations are correct everywhere in the FOV. The only residual aberrations are field curvature and astigmatism. Both of these are zero exactly in the center of the field and increase toward the edge of the field. These aberrations are easily corrected within the instrument optics. For example, in the Faint Object Camera (FOC) there is a small telescope designed to remove image astigmatism. Figure 5-17 shows the path of a light ray from a distant star as it travels through the Telescope to the focus. Light travels down the tube, past baffles that attenuate r eflected light fr om unwanted bright sources, to the 94.5-in. (2.4-m) primary mirror. Reflecting off the front surface of the concave mirror, the light bounces back up the tube to the 12-in. (0.3-m)-diameter convex secondary mirror. The light is now reflected and converged through a 23.5-in. (60-cm) hole in the primary mirror to the Telescope focus, 3.3 ft (1.5 m) behind the primary mirror. Four science instruments and three FGSs share the focal plane by a system of mirrors. A small ""folding"" mirror in the center of the FOV directs  light into the WFPC2. The remaining ""science"" field is divided among three axial science instruments, each receiving a quadrant of the circular FOV. Around the outside of the science field, a ""guidance"" field is divided among the three FGSs by their own folding mirrors. Each FGS receives 60 arcmin2 of field in a 90-degree sector. Figure 5-18 shows instrument/sensor fields of view. The OTA hosts the science instruments and FGSs in that it maintains the structural support and optical-image stability required for these instruments to fulfill their functions (see Fig. 5-19). Components of the OTA are the primary mirror, the secondary mirror, the FPS, and the OTA Equipment Section. Perkin-Elmer Corporation designed and built all the optical assemblies; Lockheed Martin built the OTA equipment section.  5.2.1 Primary Mirror Assembly and Spherical Aberration As the Telescope was put through its paces on orbit in 1990, scientists discovered its primary mirror had a spherical aberration.

After intensive investigation, the problem was traced to faulty test equipment used to define and measure mirror curvature. The optical component of this test equipment was slightly out of focus and, as a result, had shown the mirr or to be gr ound corr ectly. After the discovery, Ball Aer ospace scientists and engineers built the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR). The COSTAR was installed during the First Servicing Mission in December 1993 and br ought the Telescope back to its original specifications. The primary mirror assembly consists of the mirror supported inside the main ring, which is the structural backbone of the Telescope, and the main and central baffles shown in Fig. 5-20. K9322-05M  This assembly provides the structural coupling to the rest of the spacecraft through a set of kinematic brackets linking the main ring to the SSM. The assembly also supports the OTA baffles. Its major parts are:     Primary mirror Main ring structure Reaction plate and actuators Main and central baffles.  Primary Mirror. The primary mirror blank, a product of Corning Glass Works, is known as ultralow-expansion (ULE) glass. It was chosen for its very low-expansion coefficient, which ensures the Telescope minimum sensitivity to temperatur e changes. The mirr or is of a ""sandwich"" construction: two lightweight facesheets separated by a core, or filling, of glass honeycomb ribs in a rectangular grid (see Fig. 5-21). This construction results in an 1800-lb  5-20   SECONDARY MIRROR ASSEMBLY  GRAPHITE EPOXY METERING TRUSS CENTRAL BAFFLE SUPPORT  FINE GUIDANCE SENSORS (3)  FOCAL PLANE STRUCTURE  ALUMINUM MAIN BAFFLE  AXIAL SCIENCE INSTRUMENTS (4)  ELECTRONIC BOXES  PRIMARY MIRROR  MAIN RING FIXED-HEAD STAR TRACKER RADIAL SCIENCE INSTRUMENT (1) K70110-519  Fig. 5-19 Optical Telescope Assembly components PRIMARY MIRROR ASSEMBLY  (818-kg) mirror instead of an 8000-lb solid-glass mirror.

When it was close to its final hyperboloidal shape, the mirror was transferred to Perkin-Elmer 's computer -contr olled polishing facility. After being ground and polished, the mirror was coated with a reflective layer of aluminum and a protective layer of magnesium fluoride only 0.1 and 0.025 micr ometer thick,  Fig. 5-20 Primary mirror assembly K9322-05M  5-21   MIRROR CONSTRUCTION FRONT FACESHEET  beam 15 in. (38 cm) thick, weighing 1200 lb (545.5 kg), with an outside diameter of 9.8 ft (2.9 m) (see Fig. 5-22). It is suspended inside the SSM by a kinematic support. Reaction Plate. The reaction plate is a wheel of I-beams forming a bulkhead behind the main ring, spanning its diameter. It radiates from a central ring that supports the central baffle. Its primary function is to carry an array of heaters that warm the back of the primary mirror, maintaining its temperature at 70 degrees. Made of lightweight, stiff beryllium, the plate also supports 24 figure-control actuators attached to the primary mirror and arranged around the reaction plate in two concentric circles. These can be commanded fr om the gr ound, if necessary, to make small corrections to the shape of the mirror. Baffles. The baffles of the OTA prevent stray light from bright objects, such as the Sun, Moon, and Earth, from reflecting down the Telescope tube to the focal plane. The primary mirror assembly includes two of the three assembly baffles. Attached to the front face of the main ring, the outer, main baffle is an aluminum cylinder 9 ft (2.7 m) in diameter and 15.7 ft (4.8 m) long. Internal fins help it attenuate stray light. The central baffle is 10 ft (3 m) long, conical in shape, CENTRAL BAFFLE BRACKETS (5) RADIAL CENTRAL I-BEAMS (15) RING FIGURE CONTROL INTERCOSTAL ACTUATORS (24) RIBS (48) MAIN RING  INNER EDGEBAND LIGHTWEIGHT CORE  OUTER EDGEBAND  REAR FACESHEET  THE MIRROR IS MADE OF CORNING CODE 7971 ULTRA-LOW EXPANSION (ULE) SILICA GLASS K70110-521  Fig. 5-21 Primary mirror construction  respectively. The fluoride layer protects the aluminum fr om oxidation and enhances reflectance at the important hydrogen emission line known as Lyman-Alpha. The reflective quality of the mirror is better than 70 percent at 1216 angstr oms (Lyman-Alpha) in the ultraviolet spectral range and better than 85 percent for visible light. The primary mirror is mounted to the main ring thr ough a set of kinematic linkages. The linkages attach to the mirror by three rods that penetrate the glass for axial constraint and by three pads bonded to the back of the glass for lateral support. Main Ring. The main ring encircles the primary mirror; supports the mirror, the main baffle and central baffle, and the metering truss; and integrates the elements of the Telescope to the spacecraft. The titanium ring is a hollow box  AXIAL MOUNTS (15) FLEXURE MOUNTS (15) MIRROR PADS (24) K70110-522  Fig. 5-22 Main ring and reaction plate  5-22 K9322-05M   and attached to the reaction plate through a hole in the center of the primary mirror. It extends down the centerline of the Telescope tube. The baf fle interiors ar e painted flat black to minimize light reflection.  5.2.2 Secondary Mirror Assembly The Secondary Mirror Assembly cantilevers off the front face of the main ring and supports the secondary mirror at exactly the correct position in front of the primary mirror. This position must be accurate within 1/10,000 in. whenever the Telescope is operating. The assembly consists of the mirror subassembly, a light baffle, and an outer graphite-epoxy metering truss support structure (see Fig. 5-23). The Secondary Mirror Assembly contains the mirror, mounted on three pairs of alignment actuators that contr ol its position and orientation. All are enclosed within the central hub at the forward end of the truss support. The secondary mirror has a magnification of 10.4X, converting the primary-mirr or  converging rays from f/2.35 to a focal ratio system prime focus of f/24 and sending them back toward the center of the primary mirror, where they pass through the central baffle to the focal point. The mirror is a convex hyperboloid 12 in. (0.3 m) in diameter and made of Zerodur glass coated with aluminum and magnesium fluoride. Steeply convex, its surface accuracy is even greater than that of the primary mirror. Ground command adjusts the actuators to align the secondary mirror to provide perfect image quality. The adjustments are calculated from data picked up by tiny optical control system sensors located in the FGSs. The principal structural element of the Secondary Mirror Assembly is the metering truss, a cage with 48 latticed struts attached to three rings and a central support structure for the secondary mirror. The truss, 16 ft (4.8 m) long and 9 ft (2.7 m) in diameter, is a graphite, fiber-reinforced epoxy structure. Graphite was chosen for its high stiffness, light weight, and ability to reduce the structure's expansiveness to nearly zero. This is vital because the secondary mirror must stay perfectly placed relative to the primary mirror, accurate to within 0.0001 in. (2.5 micrometers) when the Telescope operates. The truss attaches at one end to the front face of the main ring of the Primary Mirr or Assembly. The other end has a central hub that houses the secondary mirror and baffle along the optical axis. Aluminized mylar MLI in the truss compensates for temperature variations of up to 30 degrees Fahrenheit when the Telescope is in Earth's shadow so the primary and secondary mirrors remain aligned. The conical secondary mirror subassembly light baffle extends almost to the primary mirror. It r educes the stray bright-object light fr om sources outside the Telescope FOV.

The -V3 side of the structure, away from the Sun in space, supports the FHSTs and RSUs (see Fig. 5-24). It also provides facilities for on-orbit replacement of any instruments and thermal isolation between instruments. The structure is 7 ft (2.1 m) by 10 ft (3.04 m) long and weighs more than 1200 lb (545.5 kg). Because it must have extreme thermal stability and be stiff, lightweight, and strong, the FPS is constructed of graphite-epoxy, augmented with mechanical fasteners and metallic joints at strength-critical locations. It is equipped with metallic mounts and supports for Orbital Replacement Units (ORU) used during maintenance. The FPS cantilevers off the rear face of the main ring, attached at eight flexible points that adjust to eliminate thermal distortions. The structure provides a fixed alignment for the FGSs. It has PRIMARY MIRROR MAIN RING FOCAL PLANE STRUCTURE AXIAL SCIENCE INSTRUMENT SCIENCE INSTRUMENT CONNECTOR PANEL  guiderails and latches at each instr ument mounting location so Shuttle crews can easily exchange science instr uments and other equipment in orbit.  5.2.4  OTA Equipment Section  The Equipment Section for the OTA is a large semicircular set of compartments mounted outside the spacecraft on the forward shell of the SSM (see Fig. 5-25). It contains the OTA Electrical Power and Thermal Contr ol Electronics (EP/TCE) System, Fine Guidance Electronics (FGE), Actuator Control Electronics (ACE), Optical Control Electronics (OCE), and the fourth DMS DIU. The OTA Equipment Section has nine bays: seven for equipment storage and two for support. All bays have outward-opening doors for easy astronaut access, cabling and connectors for the electronics, and heaters and insulation for thermal control. The EP/TCE System distributes power from the SSM EPS and the OTA system. Thermostats regulate mirror temperatures and prevent mirror distortion from the cold of space. The electrical and thermal electronics also collect thermal sensor data for transmission to the ground. The three FGE units provide power, commands, and telemetry to each FGS. The electronics perform computations for the sensor and interface with the spacecraft pointing system for effective Telescope line-of-sight pointing and stabilization. There is a guidance electronics assembly for each guidance sensor. The ACE unit provides the command and telemetry interface to the 24 actuators attached to the primary mirror and to the six actuators attached to the secondary mirr or. These electronics select which actuator to move and monitor its r esponse to the command.

This is equivalent to seeing from New York City the motion of a landing light on an aircraft flying over San Francisco. When two sensors lock on a target, the third measures the angular position of a star, a process called astrometry. Sensor astrometric functions are discussed in Section 4. During SM2 a re-certified FGS (S/N 2001) was installed as a replacement in the HST FGS Bay 1. During SM3A a re-certified FGS (S/N 2002) will be installed in the HST FGS Bay 2.  5.3  Fine Guidance Sensor 5.3.1 Fine Guidance Sensor Composition and Function Each FGS consists of a large structure housing a collection of mirrors, lenses, servos to locate an image, prisms to fine-track the image, beam splitters, and four photomultiplier tubes, as shown in Fig. 5-26. The entire mechanism adjusts to move the Telescope into precise alignment with a target star. Each FGS has a large (60 arcmin2) FOV to search for and track stars, and a 5.0 arcsec2 FOV used by the detector prisms to pinpoint the star. The sensors work in pairs to aim the Telescope. The Guide Star Selection System, developed by the Science Institute, catalogs and charts guide stars near each observation target to make it  The thr ee FGSs ar e located at 90-degr ee intervals around the circumference of the focal plane structure, between the structure frame and the main ring. Each sensor is 5.4 ft (1.5 m) long and 3.3 ft (1 m) wide and weighs 485 lb (220 kg). Each FGS enclosure houses a guidance sensor and a wavefront sensor. The wavefront sensors are elements of the optical control sensor used to align and optimize the optical system of the Telescope. The Telescope's ability to remain pointing at a distant target to within 0.005 arcsec for long periods of time is due largely to the accuracy of the FGSs. They lock on a star and measure any K9322-05M  5-25   ENCLOSURE ASPHERIC COLLIMATING MIRROR PINHOLE/LENS ASSEMBLY (4)  DOUBLET LENS (4)  STAR SELECTOR MIRRORS CORRECTOR GROUP DEVIATION PRISM OPTICAL BENCH  The FGS can move its line of sight anywhere within its large FOV using a pair of star selector servos. Each can be thought of as an optical gimbal: One servo moves in a north-south direction, the other east and west. They steer the small FOV (5 arcsec2) of the FGS detectors to any position in the sensor field. Encoders within each servo system send back the exact coordinates of the detector field centers at any point. Because the exact location of a guide star may be uncertain, the star selector servos also can cause the detector to search the region around the most pr obable guide star position. It searches in a spiral pattern, starting at the center and spiraling out until it finds the guide star it seeks. Then the detectors are commanded to go into fine-track mode and hold the star image exactly centered in the FOV, while the star selector servo encoders send information about the position of the star to the spacecraft PCS. The detectors are a pair of interferometers, called Koester 's prisms, coupled to photomultiplier tubes (see Fig. 5-27). Each detector operates in one axis, so two detectors ar e needed. Operating on the incoming wavefront from the distant guide star, the interferometers compare the wave phase at one edge of the Telescope's entrance aperture with COLLIMATOR FIRST STAR SELECTOR REFRACTIVE GROUP SECOND STAR SELECTOR BEAM SPLITTER  KOESTERS' PRISMS FILTERS (5) PICKOFF MIRROR  K70110-526  Fig. 5-26 Cutaway view of Fine Guidance Sensor  easier to find the tar get. First, one sensor searches for a target guide star. After the first sensor locks onto a guide star, the second sensor locates and locks onto another target guide star. The guide stars, once designated and located, keep the image of the observation target in the aperture of the selected science instrument. Each FGS uses a 90-degr ee sector of the Telescope's FOV outside the central ""science"" field. This region of the FOV has the greatest astigmatic and curvature distortions. The size of the FGS's FOV was chosen to heighten the probability of finding an appropriate guide star, even in the dir ection of the lowest star population near the galactic poles. An FGS ""pickof f"" mirr or inter cepts the incoming stellar image and projects it into the sensor 's large FOV. Each FGS FOV has 60 arcmin2 available. The guide star of interest can be anywhere within this field, so the FGS will look anywhere in that field to find it. After finding the star, the sensor locks onto it and sends err or signals to the Telescope, telling it how to move to keep the star image perfectly still.

When the phases are equal, the star is exactly centered. Any phase difference shows a pointing error that must be corrected. Along the optical path fr om Telescope to detector are additional optical elements that turn or fold the beam to fit everything inside the FGS enclosure, and to correct the Telescope's astigmatism and field curvature. All optical elements ar e mounted on a temperatur econtrolled, graphite-epoxy composite optical bench.  5.3.2 Articulated Mirror System Analysis of the FGS on-orbit data revealed that minor misalignments of the optical pupil centering on Koester 's prism interferometer in the presence of spherical aberration prevented the FGS fr om achieving its optimum performance. During the recertification of FGS (S/N 2001), fold flat #3 in the radial bay module optical train was mechanized to allow on-orbit alignment of the pupil. Implementation of this system utilized existing signals and commands by rerouting them with a unique interface harness enhancement kit (OCE-EK) interfacing the OCE, the DIU, and the Fine Guidance System/Radial Bay Module (FGS/RBM). The OCE-EK was augmented with the Actuator Mechanism Electronics (AME) and the fold flat #3 Actuator Mechanism Assembly (AMA) located internal to the FGS/RBM. Ground tests indicate a substantial increase in performance of the FGS with this innovative design improvement.  built by British Aerospace, Space Systems  have been scheduled for replacement because of their power loss from radiation exposure in space. However, as engineers put the Telescope through its paces in April 1990, they discovered two problems: a loss of focus and images that jittered briefly when the Telescope flew into and out of Earth's shadow. The jitter problem was traced to the two large SAs. Abrupt temperature changes, from -150 to 200 degrees Fahrenheit during orbit, cause the panels to distort twice during each orbit. As a temporary fix, engineers created software that commanded the PCS to compensate for the jitter automatically. The problem was mitigated during SM1 by the replacement of the old arrays with new ones that had been modified to reduce thermal swings of the bi-stems.  5.4.1 Configuration The SAs are two large rectangular wings of retractable solar cell blankets fixed on a twostem frame. The blanket unfurls from a cassette in the middle of the wing. A spreader bar at each end of the wing stretches the blanket and maintains tension. For the replacement SAs delivered to the Telescope during the First Servicing Mission, the spring-loaded roller assembly was replaced by a series of springs connecting the spreader bar to the blanket. This change eliminated the jitter induced into the Telescope as it passed from eclipse (night) into sunlight (day) each orbit. The wings are on arms that connect to a drive assembly on the SSM forward shell at one end and to the secondary deployment mechanism (blankets and bistems) on the other end. The total length of the cassette, arm, and drive is 15.7 ft (4.8 m) (see Fig. 5-28). Each wing has 10 panels that roll out from the cassette. The panels are made of 2438 solar cells  5.4  Solar Array and Jitter Problems  From the beginning, in the late 1970s, the SAs  designed by the European Space Agency and K9322-05M  5-27   SOLAR ARRAY DRIVE DEPLOYMENT ARM BISTEM CASSETTE  PRIMARY DEPLOYMENT MECHANISM BISTEM WITH NEW THERMAL SHIELD SPREADER BAR BISTEM CASSETTE COMPENSATOR RAIL K70110-528  mechanism assembly: a cassette drum to hold solar panels, a cushion to protect the blanket, and motors and subassemblies. The assembly rolls out the blanket, applies tension evenly so the blankets stretch, and transfers data and power along the wing assembly. The blanket can r oll out completely or part way. The secondary deployment mechanism also has a manual override (see Fig. 5-29). A SA drive at the base of each mast rotates the deployed array toward the Sun, turning in either direction. Each drive has a motor that rotates the mast on command and a brake to keep the array in a fixed position with respect to the Telescope. The drive can move and lock the SA into any position. Each drive has a clamp ring that acts as a release mechanism if opened. This allows a cr ew member to jettison the entire SA if necessary. Two electronics assemblies (boxes)  the Solar Array Deployment Electronics and the Solar Array Drive Electronics  control and monitor all functions of each SA. They provide the electr onic interface to the other Telescope systems and generate the commands for the primary and secondary deployment mechanisms and the SA drive.  Fig. 5-28 Solar Array wing detail  attached to a glass-fiber/Kapton surface, with silver mesh wiring underneath, covered by another layer of Kapton. The blankets are less than 500 micrometers thick, so they roll up tightly when the wings are stowed. Each wing weighs 17 lb (7.7 kg) and, at full extension, is 40 ft (12.1 m) long and 8.2 ft (2.5 m) wide.  5.4.2 Solar Array Subsystems The SA subsystems include the primary and secondary deployment mechanisms, their drives, and associated electronics. The primary deployment mechanism raises the SA mast from the side of the SSM to a standing position perpendicular to the Telescope. There are two mechanisms, one for each wing. Each mechanism has motors to raise the mast and supports to hold it in place when erect. An astronaut can raise the array mast manually if the drive power fails. Using a wrench fitting on the deployment drive, the astronaut handcranks the mast after releasing the latches. Once the SA is raised, the secondary deployment mechanism unfurls the wing blankets. Each wing has a secondary  FITTING FOR MANUAL DEPLOYMENT  MAST  WING  SECONDARY DRIVE MECHANISM K70110-529  Fig. 5-29 Fitting for Solar Array manual deployment  5-28 K9322-05M   5.4.3 Solar Array Configuration for Servicing Mission 3A The Solar Array wings will remain deployed during servicing.

It works with the DMU to process, format, temporarily store on the data recorders, or transmit all science and engineering data created by the instruments to the ground. Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corporation and IBM built this unit.  A210 REMOTE INTERFACE UNIT CONTROL UNIT/ SCIENCE DATA' FORMATTER BUS COUPLER UNIT A240 CONTROL UNIT/ SCIENCE DATA FORMATTER POWER CONTROL UNIT ORBITAL REPLACEMENT UNIT TRAY K70110-530  5.5.1 Components The SI C&DH unit is a collection of electronic components attached to an ORU tray mounted on the door of Bay 10 in the SSM Equipment Section (see Fig. 5-30). Small Remote Interface Units (RIU), also part of the system, provide the interface to individual science instruments. Components of the SI C&DH unit are the NASA Standard Spacecraft Computer (NSCC-I), two standard interface circuit boards for the computer, two control units/science data formatter units, two CPU modules, a PCU, two RIUs, and various memory, data, and command communications lines (buses) connected by couplers. The SI C&DH components are redundant so the system can recover from any single failure. NASA Computer. The NSSC-I has a CPU and eight memory modules, each holding 8,192 eighteen-bit words. One embedded software program (the ""executive"") runs the computer. It moves data, commands, and operation programs (called applications) for individual science instruments in and out of the processing unit. The application programs monitor and K9322-05M  Fig. 5-30 Science Instrument Control and Data Handling unit  control specific instruments and analyze and manipulate the collected data. The memory stores operational commands for execution when the Telescope is not in contact with the ground. Each memory unit has five areas reserved for commands and pr ograms unique to each science instr ument. The computer can be reprogrammed from the ground for future requests or for working around failed equipment. Standard Interface Unit. The standard interface board is the communications bridge between the computer and the CU/SDF. Control Unit/Science Data Formatter. The heart of the SI C&DH unit is the CU/SDF. It formats and sends all commands and data to designated destinations such as the DMU of the SSM, the NASA computer, and the science instr uments. The unit has a micr opr ocessor for contr ol and formatting functions.  5-29   The CU/SDF receives ground commands, data requests, science and engineering data, and system signals. Two examples of system signals are ""time tags,"" clock signals that synchronize the entire spacecraft, and ""processor interface tables,"" or communications codes. The CU/SDF transmits commands and r equests after formatting them so that the specific destination unit can read. For example, ground commands and SSM commands ar e transmitted with different formats. Ground commands use 27-bit words, and SSM commands use 16-bit words. The formatter translates each command signal into a common format. The CU/SDF also reformats and sends engineering and science data. Onboard analysis of the data is an NSSC-I function. Power Control Unit. The PCU distributes and switches power among components of the SI C&DH unit. It conditions the power required by each unit. For example: The computer memory boards typically need +5 volts, -5 volts, and +12 volts; the CU/SDF, on the other hand, requires +28 volts. The PCU ensures that all voltage requirements are met. Remote Interface Units. RIUs transmit commands, clock and other system signals, and engineering data between the science instruments and the SI C&DH unit. The RIUs do not send science data. There are six RIUs in the Telescope: five attached to the science instruments and one dedicated to the CU/SDF and PCUs in the SI C&DH unit. Each RIU can be coupled with up to two expander units. Communications Buses. The SI C&DH unit contains data bus lines that pass signals and data between the unit and the science instruments. Each bus is multiplexed: one line sends system messages, commands, and engineering data requests to the module units, and a reply line transmits requested information K9322-05M  and science data back to the SI C&DH unit. A coupler attaches the bus to each remote unit. This isolates the module if the RIU should fail. The SI C&DH coupler unit is on the ORU tray.  5.5.2 Operation The SI C&DH unit handles science instrument system monitoring (such as timing and system checks), command pr ocessing, and data processing. System Monitoring. Engineering data tells the monitoring computer whether instr ument systems are functioning. At regular intervals, varying from every 500 milliseconds to every 40 seconds, the SI C&DH unit scans all monitoring devices for engineering data and passes data to the NSCC-I or SSM computer. The computers process or store the information. Any failure indicated by these constant tests could initiate a ""safing hold"" situation (see para 5.1.7), and thus a suspension of science operations. Command Processing. Figure 5-31 shows the flow of commands within the SI C&DH unit. Commands enter the CU/SDF (bottom right in the drawing) through the SSM Command DIU (gr ound commands) or the DIU (SSM commands). The CU/SDF checks and reformats the commands, which then go either to the RIUs or to the NSCC-I for storage. ""Time-tagged"" commands, stored in the computer 's memory (top right of drawing), also follow this process. Each command is interpreted as ""real time,"" as if the SI C&DH just r eceived it. Many commands actually ar e onboar d stor ed commands activated by certain situations. For example, when the Telescope is positioned for a programmed observation using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph, that program is activated. The SI C&DH can issue certain requests to the SSM, such as to execute a limited  5-30   REMOTE MODULES  TO SCIENCE INSTRUMENTS 1-5  SCIENCE INSTRUMENT UNIQUE MEMORY STORED COMMAND MEMORY STORED COMMAND OUTPUT BUFFER  SCIENCE INSTRUMENT UNIQUE MEMORY SCIENCE INSTRUMENT UNIQUE MEMORY SCIENCE INSTRUMENT UNIQUE MEMORY TIME TAGS & COMMANDS DATA MANAGEMENT UNITS 6 AND 7  REMOTE MODULES  REMOTE MODULES  SCIENCE INSTRUMENT UNIQUE MEMORY NASA STANDARD SPACECRAFT COMPUTER MODEL-I AND STANDARD INTERFACE  REMOTE MODULES  COMMANDS  DATA MANAGEMENT UNITS 4 AND 5  DATA MANAGEMENT UNIT 1  COMPUTER COMMANDS  REMOTE MODULES  SUPPORT SYSTEMS MODULE PROCESSOR INTERFACE TABLE WORDS  WORD ORDER, TIME TAG, AND PARITY CHECKS  SUPERVISORY BUS REFORMAT  PARITY AND TYPE CODE CHECKS  FROM COMMAND DATA INTERFACE 27-BIT COMMANDS  REMOTE MODULES  CU/SDF COMMAND PROCESSING  CONTROL  TO CU/SDF LOGIC  PARITY AND WORD ORDER CHECKS  16-BIT COMMANDS FROM DATA INTERFACE UNIT  TO POWER CONTROL UNIT  CONTROL UNIT/SCIENCE DATA FORMATTER (CU/SDF)  K70110-531  Fig. 5-31 Command flow for Science Instrument Control and Data Handling unit  number of pointing control functions to make small Telescope maneuvers. Science Data Processing. Science data can come from all science instruments at once. The CU/ SDF transfers incoming data through computer memory locations called packet buffers. It fills each buffer in order, switching among them as the buffers fill and empty. Each data packet goes fr om the buffer to the NSCC-I for further processing, or directly to the SSM for storage in the data r ecor ders or transmission to the ground. Data returns to the CU/SDF after computer processing. When transmitting, the CU/ SDF must send a continuous stream of data, either full packet buffers or empty buffers called filler packets, to maintain a synchronized link with the SSM. Special checking codes 5-31 K9322-05M  (Reed-Solomon and pseudo-random noise) can be added to the data as options. Figure 5-32 shows the flow of science data in the Telescope.  5.6  Space Support Equipment  The Hubble Space Telescope was designed to be maintained, repaired, and enhanced while in orbit, extending its life and usefulness. For servicing, the Space Shuttle will capture and position the Telescope vertically in the aft end of the cargo bay, and the crew will perform maintenance and replacement tasks. The Space Support Equipment (SSE) to be used during the mission provides a maintenance platform to hold the Telescope, provides electrical support of the Telescope during servicing, and provides storage for replacement components known as ORUs.   NASA STANDARD SPACECRAFT COMPUTER MODEL-I AND STANDARD INTERFACES  DATA LOGS AND PROCESSED SCIENCE DATA  DIRECT MEMORY ACCESS 14  DIRECT MEMORY ACCESS 3  CONTROL WORDS DIRECT MEMORY ACCESS 8  NASA MODEL-I COMPUTER  CONTROL WORDS  DIRECT MEMORY ACCESS 3  SCIENCE DATA BIT STREAM  DIRECT MEMORY ACCESS 5  CONTROL LOGIC  FROM CENTRAL UNIT/ SCIENCE DATA CONTROL COMMANDS FORMATTER COMMAND PROCESSING  END OF PERIOD  TO DATA MANAGEMENT UNIT  SCIENCE DATA PACKET SEGMENTS  REED-SOLOMON CHECKBIT SEGMENTS  PACKET BUFFER 1  CONTROL  RAW SCIENCE DATA  (ONLY IF PN ENCODING SELECTED)  (ONLY IF REED-SOLOMON ENCODING SELECTED)  PN CODE  CONTROL UNIT/SCIENCE DATA FORMATTER LOGIC  RAW OR PACKETIZED DATA  CONTROL SWITCH  SCIENCE DATA INPUT SELECTION LOGIC  The major SSE items used for the Servicing Mission 3A are the Flight Support System (FSS) and the ORU Carrier (ORUC). Additionally, crew aids and tools will be used during servicing.  5.6.1  The FSS provides the platform that holds the Telescope during servicing (see Fig. 5-33). The FSS has been used in different configurations for the HST First and Second Servicing Missions, the Solar Maximum Repair Mission, and the Upper Atmospheric Research Satellite Deploy Mission. The FSS consists of two major components: a horseshoe-shaped cradle and a supporting latch beam providing a structural and electrical interface with the Shuttle. A circular ring called the Berthing and Positioning System (BAPS) interfaces with the Telescope, allowing it to pivot or rotate during the mission. The BAPS ring is pivoted down and locked for liftoff.

A closed-circuit television camera mounted to the FSS helps astronauts guide the Telescope onto the ring. Three remote-controlled latches on the ring grab and hold three towel-rack-like pins on the rear of the Telescope. A remote-controlled electrical umbilical connector on the FSS engages the Telescope, providing it with orbiter power through the FSS. This power helps relieve the drain on the Telescope's batteries during the mission. Radio communications pr ovide telescope telemetry data and control. Once the Telescope is berthed to the ring (see Fig. 5-34), the FSS can pivot (tilt) or rotate the Telescope. This positions the appropriate region of the Telescope for access during extravehicular activity. Additionally, the ring can pivot the Telescope to an appropriate attitude for orbiter reboost. During the first EVA, crew members will install the BAPS Support Post (BSP). The BSP provides an additional linkage to support and isolate the  5-32   K9322_203  Fig. 5-33 Flight Support System configuration  Telescope during EVAs and for any orbital reboosts. The BSP will remain in position for landing. Astronauts remotely control all FSS mechanisms  berthing latches, umbilical connector, pivoter, BSP lock, rotator, and ring down-lock  from the orbiter 's aft flight deck, providing the crew maximum flexibility. Besides being fully electrically r edundant, each mechanism contains manual overrides and backups to ensure mission success and astronaut safety.  5.6.2 Orbital Replacement Unit Carrier An ORUC is used to carry replacements into orbit and to return replaced units to Earth. The carrier consists of a Spacelab pallet outfitted with shelves and protective enclosures to hold the replacement units (see Fig. 5-35). Items on the ORUC for SM3A include (1) the Advanced Computer and two spare VIKs in the LOPE and (2) a Solid State Recorder, an S-Band Single Access Transmitter, the Rate Sensor Units, and associated flight harnesses in the COPE. The FGS will be transported in the FGS Scientific Instr ument Protective Enclosur e (FSIPE). A spare Advanced Computer, a spare Rate Sensor Unit, and Multi-Layer Insulation patches will be carried in the Axial Scientific Instrument Protective Enclosure (ASIPE). The NOBL will be carried in a NOBL Protective Enclosure (NPE). All ORUs and scientific instruments are carried within protective enclosures to provide them a benign environment throughout the mission.

Instruments are mounted in the enclosures using the same manually driven latch system that holds instruments in the Telescope. The ASIPE and FSIPE are mounted to the pallet on a spring system that r educes the level of vibration the instruments receive, especially during liftoff and landing. The other ORUs are carried in an additional enclosure called the Large ORU Protective Enclosure (LOPE). The enclosure also provides contamination and thermal control, though not to such stringent requirements as the SIPE. The  LOPE contains Transport Modules that are designed to custom fit each ORU. The transport modules have foam or Visco-Elastic Material that surrounds the ORU and isolates it from launch and landing vibration environments. During the change-out pr ocess, r eplaced science instruments are stored temporarily in the ORUC. A typical change-out begins with an astronaut removing the old instrument fr om the Telescope and attaching it to a bracket on the ORUC. The astronaut then r emoves the new instr ument fr om its protective enclosur e and installs it in the Telescope. Finally, the astronaut places the old instr ument in the appr opriate pr otective enclosure for return to Earth.  5-34 K9322-05M   The ORUC receives power for its TCS from the FSS. The carrier also provides temperature telemetry data through the FSS for readout in the Shuttle and on the ground during the mission.  as on the FGS. Another tool is the Portable Foot Restraint (PFR), shown in Fig. 5-36. While the astronauts work, they use tethers to hook tools to their suits and tie replacement units to the Telescope. Each crew member has a ratchet wrench to manually crank the antenna and array masts if power for the mast drives fails. A power wrench also is available if handcranking is too time consuming. Other hand tools include portable lights and a jettison handle, which attach to sockets on the aperture door and to SA wings so the crew can push the equipment away from the Telescope.  5.6.3  Crew Aids  Astronauts perform extravehicular activities using many tools to replace instruments and equipment, to move around the Telescope and the cargo bay, and to operate manual override drives. Tools and equipment, bolts, connectors, and other hardware were standardized not only for the Telescope but also between the Telescope and the Shuttle. For example, grappling receptacles share common features. To move around the Telescope, the crew uses 225 ft of handrails encircling the spacecraft. For visibility, the rails ar e painted yellow. In addition, the crew can hold onto guiderails, trunnion bars, and scuff plates fore and aft. The astronauts can install portable handhold plates where there are no permanent holds, such  LOCK YAW CONTROL  PITCH CONTROL A  A  ELEVATION CONTROL K70110-536  Fig. 5-36 Portable Foot Restraint  5-35 K9322-05M"

BACKGROUND The invention at issue in this appeal is a Hidden Markov Model (""HMM"") generator that is applicable to such pattern recognitions as speech recognition. The HMM generator  includes a vector quantizing means for quantizing vectors of a training pattern having a vector series and converting the   Appeal No. 2000-0189 Application No. 08/864,460  Page 2  vectors to a label series of clusters to which they belong. continuous distribution probability density HMM generating means generates a continuous distribution probability density  A  HMM from a quantized vector series corresponding to each label of the label series. Incidence of a label in each state is  calculated from the training vectors classified in the same clusters and the continuous distribution probability density HMM.  Claim 1, which is representative for present purposes, follows: 1. An HMM (Hidden Markov Model) generator, comprising: vector quantizing means for generating a model by quantizing vectors of a training pattern having a vector series, and converting said quantizing vectors into a label series of clusters to which they belong, continuous probability distribution density HMM generating means for generating a continuous probability distribution density HMM from a quantized vector series corresponding to each label of said label series of clusters, and label incidence calculating means for calculating the incidence of the labels in each state from said quantizing vectors of a training pattern classified in the same label series of   Appeal No. 2000-0189 Application No. 08/864,460  Page 3  clusters and the continuous probability distribution density HMM. (Appeal Br. at A1.)  The prior art applied by the examiner in rejecting the claims follows: Thomson 5,023,910 June 11, 1991  J. N.

OPINION After considering the record, we are persuaded that the examiner erred in rejecting claims 1-13. reverse. Accordingly, we  Rather than reiterate the positions of the examiner or appellant in toto, we address the main points of contention therebetween. The examiner makes the following assertions.   Appeal No. 2000-0189 Application No. 08/864,460  Page 4  Holmes teaches generating a continuous distribution probability density HMM from a quantized vector series for training and recognition: ""A more widely used method for coping with the fact that particular sets of finely quantized feature values will occur only very rarely is to represent the distribution of feature vectors by some simple parametric model, and to use the calculated probabilities from this model to supply the probability distributions in the training and recognition processes. The Baum-Welch re-estimation must then be used to optimize the parameters of the feature distribution model, rather than the probabilities of the particular feature vectors"" (p. 143). Said computation of optimum parameters of the feature distribution model (for each state, tacitly understood) is just the recited calculation of the incidence of the labels in each state, from the HMM state likelihood functions described by said parameters (claim 3), determined from the training vectors. Holmes also teaches clustering and using nearest-neighbor templates representing the average properties in each cluster (p. 125), and vector quantizing training (and test) patterns into a label series of clusters to which they belong (""It is possible to make a useful approximation to the feature vectors that actually occur by choosing only a small subset (perhaps about 100) of feature vectors, and replacing each measured vector by the one in the subset that is `nearest' to it according to a suitable distance metric. This process is known as vector quantization"", p. 142, emphasis in original). As discussed above, since the Specification does not teach a two-step quantization, the examiner has interpreted the recited ""vectors so quantized"" as a reference to the inherent quantization involved in the measurement of continuous data.   Appeal No. 2000-0189 Application No. 08/864,460  Page 5  (Paper No. 16 at 5-6.)  The appellant argue, ""[i]n claim 1,  the quantizing vectors are converted into a label series of clusters, for example. two quoted sentences?

Having determined what subject matter is being claimed, the next inquiry is whether the subject matter is obvious.

Here, the examiner fails to show that Holmes or Thomson teaches or would have suggested the claimed limitations. Rather than comparing the language of the claims with the references, he merely describes the references. We will not  ""resort to speculation,"" In re Warner, 379 F.2d 1011, 1017, 154 USPQ 173, 178 (CCPA 1967), as to where the claimed limitations might be found in Holmes or Thomson.

DECISION ON APPEAL This is a decision on the appeal under 35 U.S.C.  134 from the final rejection of claims 1, 6-9, 12, 14-17, and 21. We reverse.  BACKGROUND The invention at issue in this appeal relates to handwriting recognition. Computer-implemented recognition   Appeal No. 1998-1386 Application No. 08/269,156  Page 2  systems seek to determine the most likely alphanumeric characters written by a user. Such writing is done on a  digitizing tablet, which transforms movement of the user's stylus into ""ink data."" Segmentation processing and context  processing have both been used for handwriting recognition. Segmentation processing relates to the shape of a character. Context processing relates to whether a character is meaningful in the literal context of other likely characters.  Speed and accuracy are the primary design considerations for handwriting recognition systems. Speed is affected by how  a computer's processing time is allocated to a recognition task. Prior recognition systems postponed the processing of  ink data until all of the ink data were provided by a user. Such an approach, however, failed to efficiently use processing time that was available when the computer was collecting ink data.  Speed and accuracy are both affected by the order in which the ink data are processed. Prior recognition systems  performed segmentation processing first, followed by context   Appeal No. 1998-1386 Application No. 08/269,156  Page 3  processing.  In such sequential processing, however, the  segmentation processing took place with limited information, without reference to context information that could help in determining the most likely characters. Commencing with  characters determined by a segmentation process based on limited information, moreover, correspondingly hindered the accuracy of the context processing.  The invention at issue in this appeal integrates segmentation and context processing into a two-pass searching process. First, a dynamic programming path search performs  all the segmentation processing and most of the context processing while the user is still writing. Accordingly, the  context processing is not delayed until after all ink data are collected. Second, a stack-based path search completes the  context processing after all the ink data are received.  Claim 1, which is representative for our purposes, follows: 1. A method of processing data that represents strokes of handwritten information, thereby to identify characters represented by the data, the method comprising the steps of:   Appeal No. 1998-1386 Application No. 08/269,156  Page 4  receiving the data provided by a user, the data having a beginning part and an end part that define therebetween a complete amount of handwritten information to be processed; assembling portions of the data into a sequence of packages; and determining for the sequence of packages a probable result set of characters represented by the sequence, the determining step occurring before the end part of the data is received and comprising the steps of simultaneously considering information pertaining to the character shapes represented by the packages and information pertaining to the literal context of the characters represented by the packages; wherein the determining step includes searching for the result set of characters from among a plurality of character candidates using a first search technique; and wherein the first of two search techniques comprises the steps of: developing for each package at least one path representing a string of character candidates, each path having a respective beginning and a respective end; and generating for each path a first cost value that reflects the probability that the path includes the result set of characters, the first cost value being based upon information pertaining to the character shapes represented by the packages and information pertaining to the literal context of the characters represented by the packages and wherein the second of the two search techniques assigns a second cost value to a considered path based upon the literal context of the considered path, and wherein the second search technique conducts a reverse search towards the respective beginning of at least some of the paths developed by the first   Appeal No. 1998-1386 Application No. 08/269,156  Page 5  search technique to identify the result set as a path having the lowest of the combined first and second cost values.

Written Description and Enablement of Claims 1, 6-9, 12, 14, 15, 17, and 21 The examiner's explanation of an arguments about the rejection of claims 1, 6-9, 12, 14, 15, 17, and 21 under 35 U.S.C.  112 confuses the written description and enablement requirements of the statute. By way of  clarification, we note the following principles from Vas-Cath, Inc. v. Mahurkar, 935 F.2d 1555, 1563, 19 USPQ2d 1111, 1117 (Fed. Cir. 1991). 35 U.S.C.  112, first paragraph, requires a ""written description of the invention"" which is separate and distinct from the enablement requirement. The purpose of the ""written description"" requirement is broader than to merely explain how to ""make and use""; the applicant must also convey with reasonable clarity to those skilled in the art that, as of the filing date sought, he or she was in possession of the invention.   Appeal No. 1998-1386 Application No. 08/269,156  Page 8  With these principles in mind, we separately and distinctly address the written description and enablement of the claims.  Written Description of the Claims Regarding the written description of claims 1, 6-9, 12, 14, 15, 17, and 21, the examiner asserts, ""Appellant does not have adequate support in the disclosure for a second search technique performed subsequent to a first search techniques wherein both search techniques consider information pertaining to both character shapes and literal context of the characters."" (Supplemental Examiner's Answer at 4.) The  appellant's reply follows. The First Search As depicted in Fig. 7 and explained, for example, on page 13, lines 23-28, the first search considers character least-cost values for symbols corresponding to the node (i.e., character) under consideration. This is character shape information. In the next steps of the search, the first search considers, for example, trigram least-cost values for the node. This is literal context information. The Second Search Inasmuch as the second search (the SBP search, see Fig. 8) considers the path cost established by the first search (see, for example, page 14, lines 24-28), it inherently considers character shape, which made up part of the first search. The   Appeal No. 1998-1386 Application No. 08/269,156  Page 9  dictionary values added by the second search (see page 14, line 28, through page 15, line 10) provides literal context, in addition to the literal context of the first search (such as the trigram). (Substitute Reply Br. at 2-3.)  ""To fulfill the written description requirement, the patent specification `must clearly allow persons of ordinary skill in the art to recognize that [the inventor] invented what is   Appeal No. 1998-1386 Application No. 08/269,156  Page 10  claimed.'""

Here, the examiner fails to show that the original specification, which includes the original claims, does not describe ""a second search technique performed subsequent to a first search techniques wherein both search techniques consider information pertaining to both character shapes and literal context of the characters."" Answer at 4.) (Supplemental Examiner's  To the contrary, the specification discloses  two search techniques: ""one of the two search techniques,   Appeal No. 1998-1386 Application No. 08/269,156  Page 11  designated DPP,"" (Spec. at 4), and ""the second of the two search techniques, designated SBP ...."" (Id.) Figure 6 of  the specification shows that the SBP search (234) is performed after the DPP search (200).  The specification also reveals that the DPP search considers information pertaining to both character shape and literal context. Specifically, the ""DPP retrieves for the  node under consideration the character least-cost value "" ... for the symbol that now comprises the node under consideration."" (Spec. at 13.) The least-cost value pertains  to character shape.  The DPP search also retrieves ""the cost  value, $, representing the trigram least-cost value ... for the path node under consideration."" (Id.) The trigram least-  cost value pertains to literal context.  Furthermore, the specification reveals that the SBP search considers information pertaining to both character shape and literal context. Specifically, ""the SBP search  first retrieves the nodes that occur at each end of the DPP   Appeal No. 1998-1386 Application No. 08/269,156  Page 12  paths (that is, the dynamic programming search paths established by the DPP object as mentioned above)."" 14.)

(Id. at 14-15.) The dictionary values pertain to  literal context.  In view of these disclosures, we are not persuaded that persons skilled in the art would not recognize in the disclosure a description of the invention defined by the claims. The examiner has not met his initial burden.  Therefore, we reverse the rejection of claims 1, 6-9, 12, 14, 15, 17, and 21 as lacking a written description. address the enablement of the claims. Next, we  Enablement of the Claims   Appeal No. 1998-1386 Application No. 08/269,156  Page 13  Regarding the enablement of claims 1, 6-9, 12, 14, 15, 17, and 21, the examiner asserts, ""there is no support for any search technique, other than in the `Summary of the Invention', that adequately teaches and supports `a' search technique that uses both or either of the two, information pertaining to character   Appeal No. 1998-1386 Application No. 08/269,156  Page 14  shapes and literal context.

[T]he specification, beginning on page 17, line 1 explains that the present invention can be implemented using a variety of different computer systems, such as a personal computer using an Intel 66 MHZ 80486 microprocessor, running on Microsoft Windows 3.1 operating system. Also provided in the specification is a list of exemplary data structures and functions that may be employed in programming in C language a digital computer to perform the functions described in the specification and diagrammed in step-by-step detail in Figs. 3 through 9. (Appeal Br. at 26-27.)  To fulfill the enablement requirement, a specification must contain a description that enables one skilled in the art to make and use the claimed invention. That some  experimentation is necessary does not preclude enablement. All that is required is that experimentation not be unduly extensive. Atlas Powder Co. v. E. I. Du Pont de Nemours &  Co., 750 F.2d 1569, 1576, 224 USPQ 409, 413 (Fed. Cir. 1984). ""[T]he PTO bears an  initial burden of setting forth a reasonable explanation as to   Appeal No. 1998-1386 Application No. 08/269,156  Page 15  why it believes that the scope of protection provided by that claim is   Appeal No. 1998-1386 Application No. 08/269,156  Page 16  not adequately enabled by the description of the invention provided in the specification of the application ....""

Here, the examiner fails to set forth a reasonable explanation why the scope of protection provided by the claims is not adequately enabled by the specification. Even before  the invention, computer-implementations of segmentation processing and context processing were known in the art of handwriting recognition. (Spec. at 1-2.) Turning to the  invention, the specification explains that the invention can be implemented on a platform comprising ""a personal computer using an Intel 66 MHZ 80486 microprocessor, running the Microsoft Windows 3.1 operating system."" (Id. at 17.)  Figures 3-9 of the specification show detailed flow charts of the functions described to be performed by such a computer. The specification also lists ""exemplary data structures and functions that may be employed in programming in C language"" the computer to perform the functions.

The examiner has not  Therefore, we reverse the rejection  of claims 1, 6-9, 12, 14, 15, 17, and 21 as non-enabled. Next, we address the anticipation of claims 1, 6, 8, 12, 1417, and 21 by Fujisaki.  Anticipation of Claims 1, 6, 8, 12, 14-17, and 21 by Fujisaki We begin by noting the following principles from Rowe v. Dror, 112 F.3d 473, 478, 42 USPQ2d 1550, 1553 (Fed. Cir. 1997). A prior art reference anticipates a claim only if the reference discloses, either expressly or inherently, every limitation of the claim. See Verdegaal Bros., Inc. v. Union Oil Co., 814 F.2d 628, 631, 2 USPQ2d 1051, 1053 (Fed. Cir. 1987). ""[A]bsence from the reference of any claimed element negates anticipation."" Kloster Speedsteel AB v. Crucible, Inc., 793 F.2d 1565, 1571, 230 USPQ 81, 84 (Fed. Cir. 1986). With these in mind, we address the appellant's argument that ""Fujisaki ... cannot be fairly considered as simultaneously   Appeal No. 1998-1386 Application No. 08/269,156  Page 18  considering character shape and context information ...."" (Appeal Br. at 8.)  Claims 1, 6, and 8, each specify in pertinent part the following limitations: ""the determining step ... comprising the steps of simultaneously considering information pertaining to the character shapes represented by the packages and information pertaining to the literal context of the characters represented by the packages."" Similarly, claims 16  and 17 each specify in pertinent part the following limitations: ""search means for selecting the result by substantially simultaneously considering the shape and literal content of the character hypotheses ...."" In summary, claims  1, 6, 8, 16, and 17 each recite simultaneously or substantially simultaneously considering character shape and context information.  The examiner fails to show a teaching of the claimed limitations. ""The Patent Office has the initial duty of It may not ...  supplying the factual basis for its rejection.   Appeal No. 1998-1386 Application No. 08/269,156  Page 19  resort to speculation, unfounded assumptions[,] or hindsight reconstruction to supply deficiencies in its factual basis."" In re Warner, 379 F.2d 1011, 1017, 154 USPQ 173, 178 (CCPA 1967).   Appeal No. 1998-1386 Application No. 08/269,156  Page 20  Fujisaki does teach considering both character shape and context information. Regarding the former, the reference  mentions, ""a Frame Shape Recognizer, associates conditional probabilities to each frame ...."" Col. 13, ll. 67-68.  Regarding the latter, the reference states, ""The language model block 26 provides language model probabilities which may be used to determine what characters are most likely to occur in a given context, or what words are most likely to occur in a given context."" Col. 9, ll. 23-27.  The examiner does not show, however, that the Frame Shape Recognizer and the language model block operate substantially simultaneously, let alone simultaneously. To the contrary,  Fujisaki suggests that the components operate sequentially. Specifically, the reference characterizes the Frame Shape Recognizer as one of the ""pre-processing components ...."" Col. 13, ll. 63-66. Such a characterization implies that the  Frame Shape Recognizer operates before the processing of the language model block.   Appeal No. 1998-1386 Application No. 08/269,156  Page 21  In view of this characterization, we are not persuaded that the reference discloses the claimed limitation of simultaneously or substantially simultaneously considering character shape and context information. disclosure negates anticipation. The absence of this  Regarding claims 1, 6, 8, 12, 14, 15, and 21, the appellant argues, ""traversal of the vocabulary trie from the leaves back towards the root pertains to construction of the vocabulary trie and not with reverse searching of paths that comprise character hypotheses corresponding to received ink data."" (Appeal Br. at 14.) The examiner replies, ""Fujisaki  et al clearly teach the paths are reversed-searched (traversed) in a direction opposite to the direction the data was received (from the leaves back to the root) in column 19, line 67-column 20, line 1."" (Examiner's Answer at 15.)  Claims 1, 6, and 8, each specify in pertinent part the following limitations: ""the second search technique conducts a reverse search towards the respective beginnings of at least some of the paths developed by the first search technique   Appeal No. 1998-1386 Application No. 08/269,156  Page 22  ....""  Similarly, claims 12, 15, 15, and 21 each specify in  pertinent part the following limitations: ""reverse-searching the constructed paths in a direction opposite to the direction the data was received."" In summary, claims 1, 6, 8, 12, 14,  15, and 21 each recite reverse-searching paths that comprise character hypotheses corresponding to received data.  The examiner fails to show an unambiguous teaching of the claimed limitations. The passage of Fujisaki relied on by the  examiner merely states, ""Next, the trie is traversed from the leaves back towards the root, summing the frequencies at each d-node."" Col. 19, l. 67, - col. 20, l. 1. The passage is  ambiguous at best.  The passage possibly could be interpreted  as teaching reverse-searching paths that comprise character hypotheses corresponding to received data. It also could be  interpreted, however, as teaching building a vocabulary trie.  In view of the ambiguity, the examiner's interpretation amounts to speculation or an unfounded assumption. Accordingly, we are not persuaded that the reference discloses the claimed limitation of reverse-searching paths that   Appeal No. 1998-1386 Application No. 08/269,156  Page 23  comprise character hypotheses corresponding to received data. The absence of the disclosure negates anticipation. Therefore, we reverse the rejection of claims 1, 6, 8, 12, 14-17, and 21 as anticipated by Fujisaki. Next, we address the obviousness  of claim 9 over Fujisaki in view of Guyon.  Obviousness of Claim 9 over Fujisaki in view of Guyon We begin by noting the following principles from In re Rijckaert, 9 F.3d 1531, 1532, 28 USPQ2d 1955, 1956 (Fed. Cir. 1993). In rejecting claims under 35 U.S.C.  103, the examiner bears the initial burden of presenting a prima facie case of obviousness. In re Oetiker, 977 F.2d 1443, 1445, 24 USPQ2d 1443, 1444 (Fed. Cir. 1992).... ""A prima facie case of obviousness is established when the teachings from the prior art itself would appear to have suggested the claimed subject matter to a person of ordinary skill in the art."" In re Bell, 991 F.2d 781, 782, 26 USPQ2d 1529, 1531 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (quoting In re Rinehart, 531 F.2d 1048, 1051, 189 USPQ 143, 147 (CCPA 1976)). If the examiner fails to establish a prima facie case, the rejection is improper and will be overturned. In re Fine, 837 F.2d 1071, 1074, 5 USPQ2d 1596, 1598 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Like claims 1, 6, and 8, claim 9 recites simultaneously considering character shape and context information and also   Appeal No. 1998-1386 Application No. 08/269,156  Page 24  reverse-searching paths that comprise character hypotheses corresponding to received data.   Appeal No. 1998-1386 Application No. 08/269,156  Page 25  The examiner fails to show a teaching or suggestion of the claimed limitation. As mentioned regarding the  anticipation by Fujisaki, the examiner has not shown that Fujisaki teaches the claimed limitations. He likewise has not  shown that the reference would have suggested the limitations. The examiner also fails to allege, let alone show, that Guyon remedies the defects of Fujisaki.  Accordingly, we are not persuaded that teachings from the prior art would appear to have suggested the claimed limitation of simultaneously considering character shape and context information and also reverse-searching paths that comprise character hypotheses corresponding to received data. Therefore, we reverse the rejection of claim 9 over Fujisaki in view of Guyon. Next, and last, we address the anticipation  of claims 1, 6, and 9 by Hullender.  Anticipation of Claims 1, 6, and 9 by Hullender Regarding the anticipation of claims 1, 6, and 9 by Hullender, the appellant argues, ""In Hullender, there is no searching in reverse (relative to another search) ....""   Appeal No. 1998-1386 Application No. 08/269,156  Page 26  (Substitute Reply Br. at 6.)  The examiner replies, ""in col.  7, lines 20-21, Hullender teaches comparing two character hypotheses by probability in reverse order ...."" (Supplemental Examiner's Answer at 3.)  As mentioned regarding the anticipation by Fujisaki and the obviousness over Fujisaki in view of Guyon, claims 1, 6, and 9 each recite reverse-searching paths that comprise character hypotheses corresponding to received data. The  examiner fails to show an unambiguous teaching of the claimed limitations. The passage of Hullender relied on by is a  comment in a program listing that merely states, ""/* Routine to compare two hypotheses by probability for qsort in reverse order (most probable first)[.] */"" passage is ambiguous at best. Col. 7, ll. 20-21. The  The passage possibly could be  interpreted as teaching reverse-searching paths that comprise character hypotheses corresponding to received data. It also  could be interpreted, however, as teaching sorting hypotheses probabilities, i.e., most probable first.   Appeal No. 1998-1386 Application No. 08/269,156  Page 27  In view of the ambiguity, the examiner's interpretation amounts to speculation or an unfounded assumption. Accordingly, we are not persuaded that the reference discloses the claimed limitation of reverse-searching paths that comprise character hypotheses corresponding to received data. The absence of the disclosure negates anticipation. Therefore, we reverse the rejection of claims 1, 6, and 9 as anticipated by Hullender.  CONCLUSION To summarize, the rejection of claims 1, 6-9, 12, 14, 15, 17, and 21 under 35 U.S.C.  112,  1, as lacking a written description is reversed. The rejection of claims 1, 6-9, 12,  14, 15, 17, and 21 under 35 U.S.C.  112,  1, as non-enabled is reversed. The rejection of claims 1, 6, 8, 12, 14-17, and  21 under 35 U.S.C.  102(e) as anticipated by Fujisaki is reversed. The rejection of claim 9 under 35 U.S.C.  103 as The  obvious over Fujisaki in view of Guyon is reversed.  rejection of claims 1, 6, and 9 under 35 U.S.C.  102(b) as anticipated by Hullender is reversed.   Appeal No. 1998-1386 Application No. 08/269,156  Page 28  REVERSED  JAMES D.

The appellants' invention relates to a method of making a composite pipe. An understanding of the invention can be Claims 1 through 30 have been  1  Application for patent filed May 16, 1995.   Appeal No. 1998-3427 Application No. 08/442,109  Page 2  derived from a reading of exemplary claim 31, which appears in the appendix to the appellants' brief.  The prior art The prior art reference of record relied upon by the examiner in rejecting the appealed claims is: Cocks 1982 4,351,364 Sep. 28,  The rejections Claims 31 through 35, 37 through 41, 43, 45 and 46 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C.  102 as being anticipated by Cocks. Claims 36, 42 and 44 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C.  103 as being unpatentable over Cocks. Rather than reiterate the conflicting viewpoints advanced by the examiner and the appellants regarding the above-noted rejections, we make reference to the examiner's answer (Paper No. 12, mailed January 6, 1998) for the examiner's complete reasoning in support of the rejections, and to the appellants' brief (Paper No. 11, filed October 10, 1997) and reply brief (Paper No. 14, filed March 6, 1998) for the appellants' arguments thereagainst.   Appeal No. 1998-3427 Application No. 08/442,109  Page 3  OPINION In reaching our decision in this appeal, we have given careful consideration to the appellants' specification and claims, to the applied prior art reference, and to the respective positions articulated by the appellants and the examiner. As a consequence of our review, we make the  determinations which follow. We turn first to the examiner's rejection of claims 31 through 35, 37 through 41, 43, 45 and 46 under 35 U.S.C.  102(b) as anticipated by Cocks. We initially note that a  claim is anticipated only if each and every element as set forth in the claim is found, either expressly or inherently described, in a single prior art reference. Verdegaal Bros.  Inc. v. Union Oil Co., 814 F.2d 628, 631, 2 USPQ2d 1051, 1053 (Fed. Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 827 (1987). Appellants argue that Cocks does not disclose ""forming the outer lining by helically winding a plurality of layers of continuous filament fiber material onto said core"" as recited in claim 31. The examiner responds to this argument by stating:   Appeal No. 1998-3427 Application No. 08/442,109  Page 4  . . . Cocks' disclosed fiber materials are considered to be suitable teachings of Appellants' ""continuous filament fiber material"" as claimed. [Examiner's answer at page 6]. Cocks discloses a steel reinforced pipe in which a fine facing cloth 20 is wound onto a mandrel and impregnated from underneath by epoxy resin. Another layer of epoxy resin is  then sprayed onto the facing cloth 20 and during the spraying a layer of woven glass fiber 21 is wound over the face cloth. (Col. 2, lines 51 to 65). The resinated layers of woven glass A  fiber fabric and fine facing cloth are allowed to gel.  further layer of epoxy resin is then applied together with a layer of chopped fiber strand mat 22 (Col. 3, lines 5-8). A  bandaging layer of facing tissue 23 is wound over the chopped fiber strand mat 22 (Col. 3, lines 18-20). A layer of epoxy  resin is then sprayed on the facing tissue layer (Col. 3, lines 22 to 23). Cocks also discloses that steel reinforcing  strips 31, 33, and 35 are wound on the resin impregnated facing cloth 41 and that an outer lining 16 comprised of a layer of chopped fiber strand mat 40 and woven glass fiber 42 with resin therebetween is wound on the steel layers (Col. 3,   Appeal No. 1998-3427 Application No. 08/442,109  Page 5  lines 21-48; Col. 4, lines 54 to 62). of continuous filament fiber material.  There is no discussion  As such, we agree with the appellants that Cocks does not disclose the use of continuous filament fibers. Therefore, we  will not sustain this rejection of claims 31 or claims 32 through 35, 37 through 41, 43, 45 and 46 dependent therefrom. We turn next to the examiner's rejection of claims 36, 42 and 44 under 35 U.S.C.  103 as being unpatentable over Cocks. Each of the claims subject to this rejection is ultimately dependent on claim 31. As such, each of the claims which are  subject to this rejection require the step of ""forming the outer lining by helically winding a plurality of layers of continuous filament fiber material."" We find no suggestion in Rather,  Cocks to utilize continuous filament fiber material.  Cocks suggest that a composite pipe should be formed using woven glass fiber and chopped fiber strand mat. (Col. 2, lines 51 to 65; Col. 4, lines 57 to 62). we will not sustain this rejection. The decision of the examiner is reversed.

GROSS, Administrative Patent Judge.  DECISION ON APPEAL This is a decision on appeal from the examiner's final rejection of claims 1 through 7, which are all of the claims pending in this application. Appellant's invention relates to a character input apparatus which includes a display for displaying characters and corresponding character type identifiers simultaneously. We observe that on August 2, 2000 (paper no. 24), appellant filed a waiver of the oral hearing set for September 12, 2000. 1   Appeal No. 1996-1418 Application No. 08/247,521  Claim 1 is illustrative of the claimed invention, and it reads as follows:  1.  A character data input apparatus comprising: for storing together codes of characters identifiers for distinguishing characters each of said identifiers corresponding to characters of the same kind;  a memory and character kind of different kinds, a plurality of said  a display for displaying together said characters and their corresponding character kind identifiers; means for inputting a hand written character: a controller responsive to said input means for outputting a character and its corresponding character kind identifier from said memory; a first area in said display for displaying one said character; and a second area in said display for displaying said character kind identifier individually associated with said one character wherein said one character may be distinguished from a character of similar appearance, but of a different kind. The prior art of record relied upon by the examiner in rejecting the appealed claims is: Appellant's admitted prior art discussed on pages 1-2 of the specification and illustrated in Figure 21 (APA) Claims 1 through 7 stand rejected under 35 U.S.C.  102(a) as being anticipated by APA. 2   Appeal No. 1996-1418 Application No. 08/247,521  Reference is made to the Examiner's Answer (Paper No. 21, mailed November 15, 1995) for the examiner's complete reasoning in support of the rejection, and to appellant's Brief (Paper No. 20, filed August 16, 1995) for appellant's arguments thereagainst. OPINION As a preliminary matter, we note that appellant indicates on page 3 of the Brief that the claims do not stand or fall together. Appellant argues each of claims 1, 4, and 6  separately, but not the remaining dependent claims. Therefore, we will treat the claims according to the following three groups: (1) claims 1 through 3 and 7/(1-3), (2) claims 4, 5, and 7/(4, 5), and (3) claims 6 and 7/6. We have carefully considered the claims, the applied prior art, and the respective positions articulated by appellant and the examiner. As a consequence of our review,  we will affirm the rejection of claims 4, 5, and 7/(4, 5) and reverse the rejection of claims 1 through 3, 6, and 7/(1-3, 6). 3   Appeal No. 1996-1418 Application No. 08/247,521  Claim 1 recites that plural characters and their corresponding character kind identifiers are to be displayed together. Appellant contends (Brief, page 4) that in APA as  shown in Figure 21 ""clearly characters and their corresponding identifiers are not displayed together, nor are plural identifiers displayed."" The examiner responds (Answer, page  5) that recognized characters and character kind information for the recognized characters are displayed together since the information is displayed on the same tablet display and displayed at the same time. The conventional display system illustrated in claim [sic, Figure] 21 displays a plurality of characters and their character kind identifiers since when the user wants to view the kind information for any of the displayed characters, he simply moves the cursor to that displayed character and that character and corresponding kind information are displayed together. We agree with the examiner that plural characters are displayed and that for any character displayed the character kind identifier can be displayed together therewith. However,  only one identifier can be displayed at any given time. Therefore, plural characters and the corresponding plural identifiers are not displayed together, as required by claim 1. ""It is axiomatic that anticipation of a claim under  102 4   Appeal No. 1996-1418 Application No. 08/247,521  can be found only if the prior art reference discloses every element of the claim."" In re King, 801 F.2d 1324, 1326, 231 USPQ 136, 138 (Fed. Cir. 1986). See also Lindemann Maschinenfabrik GMBH v. American  Hoist & Derrick Co., 730 F.2d 1452, 1458, 221 USPQ 481, 485 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Since APA fails to meet every limitation of  claim 1, APA does not anticipate claim 1 nor its dependents, claims 2, 3, and 7/(1-3). Regarding claim 4, appellant's sole argument is that ""identification of handwritten characters is displayed in the second areas associated with the first areas in which the characters are entered, simultaneously with data entry, without having to initiate a separate procedure, as is the case in connection with the apparatus of Fig. 21."" we first note that we find no limitation of display simultaneous with data entry recited in the claim. Nonetheless, as the examiner explains (Answer, page 6), as each handwritten character is input and the recognized character is output in a square B, the cursor is located at the same square B. As admitted by appellant (Specification, However,  page 2, lines 16-20), portion D displays the character kind 5   Appeal No. 1996-1418 Application No. 08/247,521  for the character located in the square B where the character cursor is positioned. Since the cursor is located at the  square of the character being input, the character type identifier for the character being input will be displayed in portion D. Thus, the identification of a character being  entered is displayed in the second area simultaneously with data entry. Accordingly, we will affirm the rejection of  claim 4 and the claims grouped therewith, claims 5 and 7/(4, 5). Claim 6 requires that each character has a first and second area and that the two areas are contiguous to each other. The examiner asserts that ""contiguous"" is defined as  ""nearby or adjacent"" and that areas B and D in APA Figure 21 ""can be reasonably characterized as nearby or adjacent."" disagree. We  First, in Figure 21 there is not a separate second All of  area for displaying the identifier for each character. the characters share a single area of identifiers. APA fails to meet the first portion of the claim.  Therefore, Further,  even taking the examiner's definition of ""contiguous,"" we do not find areas B and D in Figure 21 to be contiguous. Area D  is adjacent to the last four characters, but not to each 6   Appeal No. 1996-1418 Application No. 08/247,521  character.  Accordingly, we cannot sustain the anticipation  rejection of claim 6. CONCLUSION The decision of the examiner rejecting claims 1 through 7 under 35 U.S.C.  102 is affirmed as to claims 4, 5, and 7/(4, 5) and reversed as to claims 1 through 3, 6, and 7/(1-3, 6). No time period for taking any subsequent action in connection with this appeal may be extended under 37 CFR  1.136(a). AFFIRMED-IN-PART  ERROL A.

The invention pertains to a logic circuit simulator. is illustrative and reads as follows: Claim 8 1  Application for patent filed May 1, 1995. According to the appellant, the application is a division of Application 08/074,725, filed June 10, 1993, now Patent No. 5,572,708, issued November 5, 1996, which is a continuation of Application 07/486,705, filed February 28, 1990, now abandoned.  1  1   Appeal No. 1997-1637 Application 08/432,270  A logic simulator for simulating a logic circuit defined by a plurality of sentences, each sentence being identified by an identifier and comprising at least one operator and at least two variables which are operated on according to said at least one operator, said logic simulator comprising: an identifier memory for memorizing a plurality of identifiers each specifying one of said sentences, respectively; a model memory for memorizing a plurality of operators which carry out operations specified by said sentences; a variable memory for memorizing a plurality of initial values of the variables specified by said sentences; a flag memory for memorizing a plurality of flags in correspondence with said sentences, each of said flags being indicative of whether or not said initial values of the variables specified by each of said sentences are changed during said simulation of said sentences; a sentence calculating means connected to said identifier memory, said model memory, said variable memory, and said flag memory for carrying out calculation on one of said sentences at a time only when a change is indicated by one of said flags that corresponds to said one of said sentences, said sentence calculating means producing a result of said calculation based on at least one of said operators and at least two of said initial values of said variable, said at least one of said operators and said at least two of said initial values of said variables being specified by said one of said sentences; a result memory for memorizing an initial result value; and substituting means connected to said result memory and said sentence calculating means for substituting said result of said calculation for said initial result value. The reference relied upon by the examiner as evidence of obviousness is: Cocke et al. (Cocke) 1981 The appealed claims stand rejected under 35 U.S.C.  103 as being unpatentable over Cocke. 2 4,306,286 Dec. 15,   Appeal No. 1997-1637 Application 08/432,270  The respective positions of the examiner and the appellant with regard to the propriety of the rejections is set forth in the final rejection (Paper No. 6) and the examiner's answer (Paper No. 13) and the appellant's brief (Paper No. 12) and reply brief (Paper No. 14). Appellant's Invention  We agree with the examiner that the summary of the invention contained in pages 2-5 of the brief is correct and we adopt it as our own. The Rejection under 35 U.S.C. 103 Appellant observes that claim 8 requires a sentence calculating means for carrying out calculation on one of a plurality of sentences at a time only when a change is indicated by one of the flags stored in memory. The contention is made that  the examiner concedes that this feature is not taught by Cocke. With respect to the above, the examiner takes the position at pages 3 and 4 of his answer that, Even [though] Cocke do not explicitly disclose sentence calculating means for carrying out calculation on one of the sentences as claimed, [a] practitioner in the art at the time the invention was made would have found it obvious the computer would distribute data and instructions to the simulator to perform the simulation, and centrally control the computation of the 3   Appeal No. 1997-1637 Application 08/432,270  processors because Cocke disclose that the computer controls the processors [sic] operations by setting the reservation table (see Figs. 11, 12), sending simulation instruction and data to the processors, and the processors would simulate the instructions. We will not sustain the rejection of claim 8. It is considered that even though Cocke discloses that the basic processors of its logic simulation device may operate in combination with a host computer and a local computer (collectively, the examiner's central computer) which are used to provide loading functions and to analyze the results of a simulation, the examiner has not satisfied his burden of showing how the computer operation referred to by him satisfies the language of claim 8 requiring sentence calculating means ""for carrying out calculation on one of said sentences at a time only when a change is indicated by one of said flags that corresponds to said one of said sentences"". It is not apparent to us that the  prior art structure would perform the above function. In the final rejection at page 3, the examiner acknowledged that the flag settings of the claimed invention utilized to control calculation on sentences are different from flag settings of Cocke disclosed at column 8, lines 12-24. However, the  examiner indicated it would have been obvious to logic designers to set up correct input values to logic functions in order to 4   Appeal No. 1997-1637 Application 08/432,270  correctly simulate the logic functions. persuasive either.  This position is not  It appears to presume that the flag settings  of Cocke are not correct and would not result in accurate gate simulation of logic circuits, and that one of ordinary skill in the art would have sought to change them so as to provide flags of the type claimed by appellant so as to correctly simulate logic functions. There is no evidence to support such a position.  To the extent that the examiner may have misstated his position and simply means that it would have been obvious to modify the flags of Cocke so as to perform the function of appellant's sentence calculating means, the examiner has provided no convincing motivation for doing so. The motivation set forth  by the examiner at page 3 of the final rejection, that being to correctly simulate logic functions, assumes that Cocke does not correctly simulate such functions. effect. The examiner rejected claim 12, the only other independent claim, based ""under the same rationale"" as claim 8 due to the similarities of the two claims. Whereas we have decided not to 5 There is no evidence to that   Appeal No. 1997-1637 Application 08/432,270  sustain the rejection of claim 8, we will not sustain the rejection of claim 12. In view of our decision with respect to independent claims 8 and 12, we will not sustain the rejection of dependent claims 911 and 13. Although we will not sustain the rejection of claims 8-13 for the reasons given above, we agree with the examiner that Cocke discloses identifier, model, variable, flag and result memories such as recited in claim 8 for the reasons given in the answer. We also agree with the examiner that Cocke teaches a simulation device capable of simulating circuitry at a functional level. Appellant has not drawn attention to any specific definition of simulation at a functional level which is recognized in the art, nor has appellant provided its own definition of the term. It is  considered that Cocke performs simulation at a functional level in that Cocke simulates the function of gates, such as the NAND function of the gates illustrated in Figure 2 of the reference.

GX231-17-12845409	"December 2000  CLASSIFICATION DEFINITIONS  119 - 1  CLASS 119, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY (3) SECTION I - CLASS DEFINITION This class provides for methods or apparatus for the propagation, rearing, training, exercising, amusing, feeding, milking, grooming, housing, controlling, han dling, or general care of a living animal unless provided for elsewhere. (1) Note. The word ""animal"" is used in its generic biological meaning of a living sen tient multicellular organism and is applica ble to insects, fish, fowl, mammals, and other members of the animal kingdom. Note. This class is subdivided into: FOR SUBJECT MATTER RELATED TO MILKERS (a)an array of specified animal culturing subclass groups, the common bond within each group being determined by the partic ular kind of animal that is the subject of the invention; (b)an array of subclass groups directed to a method or apparatus for obtaining milk from an animal other than a human; and (c)a number of subclass groups, the com mon bond within each group being determined by the function or mode of operation rather than the particular creature to which the invention is applied. The groups mentioned in (c) may include subject matter specifically limited in use to a human or to fowl, and patents directed to said specific uses are classified in subclasses having a distinctive title which pro vides for the respective human or fowl specific use. It should be noted that the sub class(es) that specifically provide for a human use are the only areas in this class providing for a human application, and since these subclasses are the residual areas for human application not otherwise pro vided for, the definitions of these subclasses are strictly limited. The outside classes listed in the search notes of both the class definition and the subclass(es) relat ing to a human should be exhausted before placement of a patent relating to a human application in this class. Class 60, Power Plants, has pulsators distinguished from Class 119 and Class 137 Fluid Handling, subclasses 103+, pulsators or fluid distributors in that the former do not relate to through-flow mechanisms but rather effect the pulsing of a confined body of fluid, the same body of fluid, for example, operating upon a pressure responsive mechanism. Milking machine pulsators are broadly con strued as valving arrangements which cyclicly control fluid flowing under pressure and not involving the same body of fluid. See References to Other Classes, below, labeled as having other subject matter related to milkers Note. A method provided for in this class is appropriately classified in a subclass spe cifically providing for the method or, absent a specific method subclass, in a subclass providing for the apparatus of this class used in the method. Note. A method of making an apparatus of this class is excluded from this class, and may be found in an appropriate manufac turing class.

Subject matter wherein the limiting means con sists of horizontally spaced, upright members which engage opposite sides of a neck region of the animal to prevent the animal from retracting its head region therethrough, i.e., a stanchion. (1) Note. The term ""stanchion"" is generally used to connote the entire frame assem bly used to hold an animal in a desired  December 2000 Edition   119 - 68  CLASSIFICATION DEFINITIONS  December 2000  location. An upright member is fre quently called a stanchion bar, a neck bar, or a restraining arm. At least one of the upright members of a stanchion is usually pivotally or slidably supported such that it can be moved away from the other upright member to admit the head and neck of the animal to be restrained. It can then be moved toward locking engagement relative to the other upright member to embrace the neck and prevent withdrawal of the head. An upright member may be made from a flexible material or plural rigid members acting as an upright member, e.g., a chain, etc. If one of the upright members is intended to travel along with the head or neck region of the animal as it moves up or down, the moving member is consid ered to be part of a tether and not part of a stanchion. (2) Note. The head region of an animal is considered to contain the skull and brain and is attached to the neck region, which contains the upper vertebrae and throat of a vertebrate animal, e.g., a head or neck of a cow, hog, etc. The neck region is located immediately above or in front of the main trunk of the body of the ani mal, e.g., in front of its shoulder, etc. Note. A stanchion differs from a head or neck stock in that it permits more free dom of movement. A head or neck stock more firmly clamps or immovably holds the neck of the animal and is designed to reduce to a minimum any movement of the head or neck, while a stanchion is designed simply to prevent escape of the animal from its stall or to segregate it for a feeding or housing purpose.  cific body part, particularly 815 for limiting bending of the neck, and 837 for limiting use of the head, face, or horn to, for example, butt or gore. 739 Multiple stanchions: This subclass is indented under subclass 738. Subject matter wherein plural sets of the hori zontally separated, upright members prevent plural animals from retracting their head regions therethrough. (1) Note. To be proper for this subclass, more than one stanchion must be claimed, or connecting or controlling structure for more than one stanchion, e.g., for causing simultaneous secure ment or release, etc., must also be claimed. Mere disclosure that a single stanchion may be used in a multiple stanchion environment without any claimed structure relating to the multiple stanchion environment is not proper for this subclass.  740  Having animal actuated securing means: This subclass is indented under subclass 739.

(1) Note. The upright stanchion members usually have a relatively horizontal por tion integral with, or fixedly attached to, their bottoms so that they can remain upright in use and still be pivotally con nected near both their bottoms and the vertical centerline of the stanchion.

Subject matter wherein the limiting means includes an animal-supported projection (i.e., extension) having a proximal portion supported from an animal and a distal portion protruding away from or dragged by the animal, the distal portion being constructed and arranged to contact, hook onto, or otherwise interact with a barricade (e.g., fence, etc.) in order to either stop the progress of the animal or otherwise discourage the desire of the animal to pass through or over (i.e., breach) the barricade, or to prevent the animal from pushing upward (i.e., lifting) or otherwise tearing off a part of the barricade (e.g., fence wire, board, etc.). (1) Note. The extension is usually of the nature of a lever-type arm or hooklike member that extends from the animal in a manner so as to increase the apparent size of the animal as ""seen"" by a fence, so as to engage the fence as the animal attempts to breach the fence. However, an extension can be in the form of, for example, an anchor like hook dragged by the animal via a tether so as to hook onto the fence if the animal does proceed to pass through or over a fence. Note. A device classifiable in this subclass should be distinguished from: (a)a hitching device, where an animal is held fast to something other than the ani mal to prevent roaming; or (b)a head-butting device, which may engage a fence and discourage pushing, ramming, or butting of the fence but does not rely upon an extension that  755  Having distinct limb restraint: This subclass is indented under subclass 753.

Subject matter wherein the only means to support the extension from the animal is by means of an element adapted to protrude into the skin of the animal. (1) Note. To be proper for this subclass, the skin piercing element must be for pur poses of supporting the extension on or from the animal, as opposed to an ancil lary purpose such as a punishment or pain inflicting means provided for elsewhere.  to the neck of the animal includes a neck sur rounding member (e.g., bow, collar, etc.). (1) Note. The degree of stiffness required is only that stiffness necessary to stop the animal from passing through the fence, or the stiffness required to transmit suffi cient force to, for example, a pain inflict ing pricker or spur, as distinguished from, for example, a hook connected to the animal via a tether. Note. To be classified herein, the exten sion must have its most distally located support attachment point to the animal at a support located on the neck of the ani mal. That is, where an extension has plu ral points of attachment to an animal support, the most distal attachment point of the extension governs classification. Likewise, when the extension is supported from the neck and protrudes away from the animal between its ears or horns, classification is proper in this subclass based upon the support location and is not affected by the projection of the extension from an area other than the neck (i.e., between the ears or horns).

Subject matter having only one extension, wherein the one extension is rigid and is pivotally connected to the neck-encircling support in a hanging manner under the animal's neck or head. (1) Note. To be classifiable in this subclass, there must be only one extension of any kind for engaging a fence to prevent breach of the fence. An extension having plural spaced bars mounted to pivot in unison is considered to be a sole exten sion.  765  Having pricker, spur, or electric shock ele ment: This subclass is indented under subclass 760. Subject matter including a breach discouraging element in the form of a sharply pointed objec tor a means for providing electric current to the animal, wherein the discouraging element is adapted to actively interact with the animal to discourage breaching when the rigid extension engages a fence during an attempted breach.

GX128-79-14246195	"Installing the Second SCSI Hard Drive     NOTE: Mention of any particular brand name, product or service on this Web page does not constitute an endorsement by the National Weather Service of that company, product or service.      Physically Installing the Drive.    Configure the Workstation.    Partition the New Drive.    The default SCSI ID numbers for the primary and secondary contoller in the Dell Precision 420 workstation as shipped from the factory are:          SCSI controller: SCSI ID 7         Boot SCSI hard disk drive: SCSI ID 0   There is no requirement that SCSI ID numbers be assigned sequentially or that devices be attached to the SCSI cable in order by ID number.  However, to keep life simple, I recommend you assign SCSI ID 1 to the new hard drive.      1.  Physically Installing The Drive    A.   The Seagate Cheeta drive comes from the factory configured with the SCSI ID of 0.  Use the J6 connector located on the front of the hard drive to set the SCSI ID of 1.  (see figure below).      Since the Seagate Cheeta drive does not have internal terminators, and the Dell workstation uses terminated cables, you do not have to set or disable termination on the drive.  After setting the SCSI ID number it will be ready to install.    B.   Turn off your computer and peripherals, and make sure that you unplug the computer from its electrical outlet before you remove the computer cover.    C.   If you have installed a padlock through the padlock ring on the back panel (item #2 in figure below), remove the padlock and slide the padlock ring to the open position.       D.   Facing the left side cover, press the release button (located at the bottom-left corner of the front bezel -- item #1 in figure below) and lift the bottom of the cover, allowing it to pivot up toward you.       E.   Disengage the hooks that secure the cover to the top of the chassis, and lift the cover away.  Now remove the front bezel by pressing the tab release (#1) marked with the arrow in the figure below.  While pressing the tab release, tilt the bezel away from the chassis, disengage the two retaining hooks at the bottom of the bezel (#2 on the figure), and carefully pull the bezel away from the chassis.        F.   Disconnect the DC power cable and EIDE cable from the hard drive in the drive bracket and pull the drive door forward and down until the hard-disk drive bracket is ejected halfway out of the chassis (see figure below).  Grasp the bracket and pull it completely out of the chassis.        G.   Slide the drive into the chosen bay of the bracket, oriented so that the connectors on the back of the drive will face the back of the chassis when the bracket is reinstalled.  Align the four screw holes of the drive and bracket. Insert and tighten the screws (see figure below).        H.   Reinstall the hard-disk drive bracket in the chassis by inserting the bracket into the drive cage by sliding it in until the tabs snap into place.  Rotate the drive door up and toward the chassis until it snaps securely into place.  Be sure to fold down the drive door handle so that the bezel can be replaced on the chassis.         I.   Attach the SCSI cable (#1 in figure below) to each SCSI device.  The connectors on Ultra 160/m low-voltage differential (LVD) SCSI cables are shaped so that they can be attached one way only.  Connect a DC power cable (#2 in figure below) to the power input connector on the SCSI device.        J.   If you already have installed the combination CD/DVD drive, you should replace the front bezel and computer cover following the steps below.   To replace the bezel, fit the two retaining hooks on the bezel into their corresponding slots at the bottom of the chassis (see figure above). Then rotate the top of the bezel toward the chassis until the top tabs snap into their corresponding slots on the bezel.   To replace the computer cover, perform the following steps:      Check all cable connections, especially those that might have come loose during your work. Fold cables out of the way so that they do not catch on the computer cover. Make sure cables are not routed over the drive cage since they will prevent the cover from closing properly.    Check to see that no tools or extra parts (including screws) are left inside the computer's chassis.    Facing the left side of the computer, hold the cover at a slight angle as shown in the figure above and then align the top of the cover with the top of the chassis.    Insert the three hooks on the cover into the three recessed slots on the computer chassis so that the tabs catch the hooks inside the slots.    Pivot the cover down toward the bottom of the chassis and into position. Make sure the securing hooks at the bottom of the cover click into place.        2.  Configuring The Workstation for New SCSI Hard Drive.  Boot the workstation.  To reset the chassis intrusion detector, enter System Setup by pressing F2 when prompted in the upper right corner of the screen.  Reset the Chassis Intrusion detection.   Scroll down the System Setup screen to  System Security .  Type <ENTER>.  Scroll down to Chasis Intrusion.  Use the Space Bar to change the setting to Enabled.    If necessary, update the drive system configuration information in System Setup. After installing a SCSI hard-disk drive, Primary Drive 0 and Primary Drive 1 should be set to None.   (If you have any EIDE devices on the second EIDE channel, such as a CD-ROM or tape drive, Secondary Drive 0 and/or Secondary Drive 1 should be set to Auto. If you have any SCSI devices on the second SCSI channel, Secondary Drive 0 and/or Secondary Drive 1 should be set to None.)    Press <ENTER> then <ESC> to exit System Setup.  If prompted, press <ENTER> to Save Changes and Exit.   As the machine continues the boot procedure the Kudzu program will activate and ask whether you wish to configure the drive(s).  Select ""Configure"" on the Kudzu menu and the boot-up will continue.       3.  Partition the New Hard Drive.  Log into the WES/DRT AWIPS system as the root user.  What we will do is remove the four partitions initially configured on the drive, then create a new, single partition,  /dev/sdb1 , to be mounted at  /data.  We will use the fdisk utilitily to do that:    >fdisk /dev/sdb <ENTER>  (Start the fdisk utility on the hard drive, device /dev/sdb)   >p <ENTER>   (Print the list of current partitions)   You will see four partitions listed, each with the same Start, End, Blocks and Id numbers and with an ""Unknown"" System.  We will remove those partitions.      >d <ENTER>   (Delete)   >4 <ENTER>   (Partition #4)   >d <ENTER>   (Delete)   >3 <ENTER>   (Partition #3)   >d <ENTER>   (Delete)   >2 <ENTER>   (Partition #2)   >d <ENTER>   (Delete)   >1 <ENTER>   (Partition #1)   >n <ENTER>   (Create a new partition)   >p <ENTER>   (A primary partition)   >1 <ENTER>   (That's a numeral one!)   >2 <ENTER>   (There's a school of thought that says never start with 1!)   > <ENTER>   (Accept the default ending point of 8924)   >p <ENTER>   (Print the new list of partitions.  You should see:  /dev/sdb1      2   8924   71681998+   83   Linux   >w    (Write to disk and exit fdisk)     Now we make a file system on the new hard drive.  Continuing as the user ""root"":  >mkfs /dev/sdb1 <ENTER>   (Ignore any warning message.)     Reboot the machine.   Next edit the  /etc/fstab  file and add the following line:  /dev/sdb1   /data    ext2   defaults  1  2   The WES software looks for case data in the directory /data/awips.  Because the WES software created a link  /data  to  /usr1/data  when you first installed the WES software, we must remove that link before we create the new mount point.  At the command prompt type:  > cd / <ENTER>     (Change to the root directory)  > ls -al <ENTER>    (Can you see /data linked to /usr1/data?)  > rm /data <ENTER>    (Remove the link)  > mkdir /data <ENTER>    (Make a mount point for the new disk)  > chown fxa:fxalpha /data <ENTER>  (Change ownership of that directory to user fxa, group fxalpha)  > chmod 775 /data <ENTER>   (Change the permissions of that directory)   Now you can mount the drive (and check that line in /etc/fstab!) by typing:  > mount /dev/sdb1  (Mount the drive's only partition (dev/sdb1) at  /data. )  > df    (Can you see /dev/sdb1 mounted at /data?)   Now let's make the subdirectories used by the WES for case data and log files:   > su - fxa <ENTER>   (Switch to the ""fxa"" user)  > cd /data <ENTER>   (Change to the /data directory)  > mkdir awips <ENTER>   (Make the awips subdirectory)  > mkdir logs <ENTER>   (Make the logs subdirectory)   Link any existing cases to the new disk directories (e.g., 1998Apr08).  As the user ""fxa"" at the command prompt type:  > cd /data/awips <ENTER>  (Change to the /data/awips subdirectory)  > ls /usr1/data/awips <ENTER>  (List all the existing cases stored under /usr1/data/awips)  Create a link for each of those cases:   > ln -s /usr1/data/awips/1998Apr08 <ENTER>  (Add the link)  Continue for any other existing cases.   Reboot the machine.  Log in as the user ""fxa.""     Use the ""df"" command to confirm the new drive is correctly mounted.    Start the D2D software and confirm you can display the existing cases (e.g., awips5x 1998Apr08).    Start the Weather Event Simulator software and confirm you can display any existing cases and issue warnings using the WARNGEN software.    Remember to load any new cases into the directory  /data/awips  on the device  /dev/sdb1 .     Thanks to Richard Black, ESA WFO Atlanta, for some of the material included on this page.

Included herein are systems that transform an image for the purpose of (a) enhancing its visual quality prior to recognition, (b) locating and registering the image relative to a sensor or stored prototype, or reducing the amount of image data by discarding irrelevant data, and (c) measuring significant characteristics of the image.         (1)   Note. Automated document pattern* analysis or verification, which includes detection of alphanumerics, is classified in this class.         (2)   Note. To be classified herein, no actual recognition or identification need be performed. It is sufficient that substantial digital image processing, such as a coding, enhancement, or transformation process, be performed on the image data for classification herein.   SECTION II - LINES WITH OTHER CLASSES AND WITHIN THIS CLASS   Pattern* analysis or verification limited to the intrinsic properties of a document is classified elsewhere. Documents that are analyzed or verified by information content, such as pattern*s or alphanumeric characters, are classified in this class (382). Document verification limited to a photocell system is classified elsewhere. See References to Other Classes, below.   Alphanumeric characters and other pattern*s are to be distinguished from coded indicia. Coded indicia are designed specifically to facilitate reading by machine and are not intended to be read by humans (e.g., the Universal Product Code on grocery items). Reading or sensing of coded indicia which does not include the recognition of any alphanumeric character or pattern* is classified elsewhere. However, reading or sensing of pattern*s or alphanumeric characters in combination with coded indicia is classified in this class (382). Example: Reading a credit card that contains a printed name plus a magnetic code is classified in Class 235 if only the magnetic code is read. Otherwise, if both the printed name and the magnetic code are read, classification is herein.   The images analyzed and processed herein are images that are representative of a ""real"" scene (such as images obtained by a camera, scanner, or image detector), including obtained images of people, places, and things, wherein the image represents the actual scene. The presentation or generation of images that are (a) computer generated or otherwise artificial, or (b) a combination of computer-generated images and real images is properly classified elsewhere, including for computer graphics and control of data presentation with creation or manipulation of graphic objects or text performed by a computer or processor, and operator interfaces. See References to Other Classes, below.   The specific processing of television pictures and signals, where a television system is an integral part of the system, is properly classified elsewhere. See References to Other Classes, below. When images generated by a television camera are processed, and the television system is not an integral part of the overall system, and the system is either disclosed or claimed in an environment with substantial digital image processing or in a pattern* recognition* environment, proper classification is herein.   For systems directed to the processing of a displayed image, where the processing is directed to the altering of the display image or of the display system itself, proper classification is elsewhere. See References to Other Classes, below.   The testing or measuring of distances, areas, volumes, thicknesses, or defects in objects is excluded from this class. However, where the measurements of these parameters are either disclosed or claimed in an environment with substantial digital image processing or in a pattern* recognition* environment, classification is in this class.   Image analysis* having specific and significantly claimed utility in art environments external to this class is classified in the appropriate external classes unless it is specifically excluded therefrom. For example: radar, facsimile, color facsimile, coded record sensor; and purely optical systems for image processing are all excluded from this class. See references to Other Classes, below.   Subcombinations specific to image analysis* or pattern* recognition are classified herein.

Included herein are systems that transform an image for the purpose of (a) enhancing its visual quality prior to recognition, (b) locating and registering the image relative to a sensor or stored prototype, or reducing the amount of image data by discarding irrelevant data, and (c) measuring significant characteristics of the image.         (1)   Note. Automated document pattern* analysis or verification, which includes detection of alphanumerics, is classified in this class.         (2)   Note. To be classified herein, no actual recognition or identification need be performed. It is sufficient that substantial digital image processing, such as a coding, enhancement, or transformation process, be performed on the image data for classification herein.   SECTION II - LINES WITH OTHER CLASSES AND WITHIN THIS CLASS   Pattern* analysis or verification limited to the intrinsic properties of a document is classified elsewhere. Documents that are analyzed or verified by information content, such as pattern*s or alphanumeric characters, are classified in this class (382). Document verification limited to a photocell system is classified elsewhere. See References to Other Classes, below.   Alphanumeric characters and other pattern*s are to be distinguished from coded indicia. Coded indicia are designed specifically to facilitate reading by machine and are not intended to be read by humans (e.g., the Universal Product Code on grocery items). Reading or sensing of coded indicia which does not include the recognition of any alphanumeric character or pattern* is classified elsewhere. However, reading or sensing of pattern*s or alphanumeric characters in combination with coded indicia is classified in this class (382). Example: Reading a credit card that contains a printed name plus a magnetic code is classified in Class 235 if only the magnetic code is read. Otherwise, if both the printed name and the magnetic code are read, classification is herein.   The images analyzed and processed herein are images that are representative of a ""real"" scene (such as images obtained by a camera, scanner, or image detector), including obtained images of people, places, and things, wherein the image represents the actual scene. The presentation or generation of images that are (a) computer generated or otherwise artificial, or (b) a combination of computer-generated images and real images is properly classified elsewhere, including for computer graphics and control of data presentation with creation or manipulation of graphic objects or text performed by a computer or processor, and operator interfaces. See References to Other Classes, below.   The specific processing of television pictures and signals, where a television system is an integral part of the system, is properly classified elsewhere. See References to Other Classes, below. When images generated by a television camera are processed, and the television system is not an integral part of the overall system, and the system is either disclosed or claimed in an environment with substantial digital image processing or in a pattern* recognition* environment, proper classification is herein.   For systems directed to the processing of a displayed image, where the processing is directed to the altering of the display image or of the display system itself, proper classification is elsewhere. See References to Other Classes, below.   The testing or measuring of distances, areas, volumes, thicknesses, or defects in objects is excluded from this class. However, where the measurements of these parameters are either disclosed or claimed in an environment with substantial digital image processing or in a pattern* recognition* environment, classification is in this class.   Image analysis* having specific and significantly claimed utility in art environments external to this class is classified in the appropriate external classes unless it is specifically excluded therefrom. For example: radar, facsimile, color facsimile, coded record sensor; and purely optical systems for image processing are all excluded from this class. See references to Other Classes, below.   Subcombinations specific to image analysis* or pattern* recognition are classified herein.

GX234-61-9232071	"October 2002  CLASSIFICATION DEFINITIONS  68 - 1  CLASS 68, TEXTILES: APPARATUS  FLUID TREATING Tumbling. These are machines for effecting treatment of textiles by causing them to be tumbled about in a drum or cage which is mounted on a horizontal or inclined axis, said textiles being submerged in a liquid during at least a portion of the revolution of the drum or cage and being free to move in the cage. The drum or cage must make at least a 360 revolution, and may or may not have vanes, buckets, or the like to cause a circulation of liquid within the tumbler and may or may not have vanes to cause a rubbing action within the tumbler. Liquid flowing. These are machines for effecting treatment of textiles by reason of the relative motion of a liquid and the textiles as by the forcing of a liquid by pumps, by centrifuging or the like through the textiles, or by the shifting bodily of the entire mass of textiles through the liquid with free access of the liquid thereto in contradistinction to moving discrete portions of the textiles, or by the agitation of the entire mass of both the liquid and the textiles submerged in the liquid. Liquid applying. These are machines for treating textiles with liquid in which the textiles are subjected to an application of liquid other than by being submerged in the liquid or by being subjected to a vapor, spray, or mist. NOTES (1) PROCESSES: Where both process and apparatus (for Class 68) for its practice are claimed, the patent is classified in the class appropriate to the process claimed and is cross-referenced to this class for the apparatus. (Note: Where the Search notes below are to processes, this is noted by a parenthentical insert at the end of the note. Otherwise, the Search note is to Apparatus.)  SECTION I - CLASS DEFINITION This class is the class of machines, implements and accessories for fluid treatment of textile fabrics, textile fibers, and pulp as for the purpose of carbonizing, bleaching, dyeing, moistening, mercerizing or mordanting the same or for the removal of dirt, grease, soil, and other like substances from them by the use of solvents, saponifiers or emulsifiers, unless specifically provided for elsewhere. The machines of this class have been divided into the following types: Gas, steam, or mist treating. These are machines for subjecting a textile to a fluid in the form of a gas, steam, or mist. Scrubbing. These are machines for effecting treatment of textiles, while saturated with a liquid, by reason of a sliding action taking place between the textiles and a contacting element, during which action the textiles may be kneaded or brushed. Scrubbing may be effected by the use of a pair of cooperating rolls if they rotate at different peripheral velocities or rotate in the same direction. Generally, scrubbers have a squeezing effect which is incidental to the scrubbing action. Squeezing. These are machines for effecting treatment of textiles, while saturated with a liquid, by reason of application and release of pressure on the textiles. Impulsing. These are machines for effecting treatment of textiles, while immersed in a liquid, by causing an intermittently movable element to impart repeated impulses to portions of the textiles as distinguished from the entire mass, such that the textile portions will travel a distance independently of the moving element. Dragging. These are machines for effecting treatment of discrete portions of the entire mass of textiles by causing them to be engaged by and dragged around the tub with a moving element, without the textile portions being clamped to the element, while the textiles are submerged in a liquid. Generally, the moving element is a pin or comprises fingers or narrow blades. Where the entire mass of textiles is moved within a tub or moved into and out of the tub in one continuous cycle, as by rakes or conveyors moving the entire mass, the patents are classified in the liquid flow subclasses.

Pure electric vehicles currently do not have adequate range when powered by batteries alone, and since recharging requires several hours, the vehicles are viewed as impractical for driving extended distances. If air conditioning or heating is used, the vehicle's range is further reduced. Accordingly, the hybrid concept, where the alternative power unit is used as a second source of energy, is gaining acceptance and is overcoming some of the problems of pure electric vehicles.  More electric vehicles were in use in 1915 than there are at present.  Figure 8-1 Electric Vehicles  The hybrid electric vehicle operates the alternative power unit to supply the power required by the vehicle, to recharge the batteries, and to power accessories like the air conditioner and heater. Hybrid electric cars can exceed the limited 100 mile (160 km) range-per-charge of most electric vehicles and have the potential to limit emissions to near zero. A hybrid can achieve the cruising range and performance advantages of conventional vehicles with the low-noise, lowexhaust emissions, and energy independence benefits of electric vehicles. Two types of hybrid vehicle configurations are the series and the parallel hybrids.  8.1.1  Series Hybrids  A series hybrid is similar to an electric vehicle with an on-board generator. The vehicle runs on battery power like a Hydrogen Fuel Cell Engines and Related Technologies: Rev 0, December 2001   PAGE 8-2  Hydrogen Fuel Cell Engines  MODULE 8: FUEL CELL HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLES Key Points & Notes  pure electric vehicle until the batteries reach a predetermined discharged level. At that point the APU turns on and begins recharging the battery. The APU operates until the batteries are charged to a predetermined level. The length of time the APU is on depends on the size of the batteries and the APU itself. Since the APU is not directly connected to the drive train, it can be run at its optimal operating condition; hence, fuel economy is increased and emissions are reduced relative to a pure IC engine vehicle. A schematic of a series hybrid is shown in Figure 8-2.  Figure 8-2 Schematic of a Series HEV  8.1.2  Parallel Hybrids  In the parallel hybrid configuration, an APU capable of producing motive force is mechanically linked to the drive train. This approach eliminates the generator of the series approach. When the APU is on, the controller divides energy between the drive train (propulsion) and the batteries (energy storage). The amount of energy divided between the two is determined by the speed and driving pattern. For example, under acceleration, more power is allocated to the drive train than to the batteries. During periods of idle or low speeds, more power goes to the batteries than the drive train. When the APU is off, the parallel hybrid runs like an electric vehicle. The batteries provide electricity to the electric motor where it is converted to mechanical energy to power the vehicle. The batteries also provide additional power to the drive train when the APU is not producing enough and to power auxiliary systems such as the air conditioner and heater.  Hydrogen Fuel Cell Engines and Related Technologies: Rev 0, December 2001   PAGE 8-3  Hydrogen Fuel Cell Engines  MODULE 8: FUEL CELL HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLES Key Points & Notes  The drive train for a parallel hybrid is more complex than that of a series hybrid as both the electric motor and the APU must be mechanically linked to the driveshaft. Since parallel hybrids only work with APU's that produce a mechanical output, fuel cells cannot be used for this option. Figure 8-3 shows a schematic of a parallel hybrid.  Figure 8-3 A schematic of a Parallel HEV  Hydrogen Fuel Cell Engines and Related Technologies: Rev 0, December 2001   PAGE 8-4  Hydrogen Fuel Cell Engines  MODULE 8: FUEL CELL HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLES Key Points & Notes  8.2 8.2.1  Major Components of Hybrid Vehicles Electric Drive Motors  Hybrid electric vehicles use an electric driveline and motor to provide the power for propulsion. The electric motor is a simple, efficient and durable device that is used every day in all sorts of applications. Electric motors range from those with fractional horsepower that run small appliances, to 5000-horsepower giants used in paper mills and other industries. An electric motor converts electric energy to mechanical energy (motion) to drive the hybrid vehicle. Every motor can be used as a generator by rewiring it to transform mechanical energy into electrical current, but not all motors make efficient generators. For this dual use, the hybrid may use the electric motor to start the engine and then switch to generating electricity to keep the batteries charged. This reduces both the weight and cost of having two separate devices for engine starting and battery recharging. In conventional vehicles, engine size determines the total power available to a moving vehicle. Hybrids, on the other hand, have electric motors that provide additional power when needed by the vehicle. Both electric motors and engines can be rated in kilowatts (kW) -- the preferred international standard -- or in horsepower (hp). One hp equals 0.746 kW. When comparing horsepower ratings of a motor to an engine, it appears that electric vehicles are drastically under-powered. However, internal combustion engines are rated at the maximum power output, while electric motors are rated at their continuous power capabilities. A motor that can produce 10 hp continuously can easily produce three or four times that much power for a few minutes. Unlike internal combustion engines, electric motors emit zero harmful emissions. The electric motor changes electric energy into mechanical power for work. Operation of the motor is based on three concepts:     an electric current that produces a magnetic field the direction of current in an electromagnet that determines the location of the magnet's poles and the magnetic poles attraction or repulsion to each other  Hydrogen Fuel Cell Engines and Related Technologies: Rev 0, December 2001   PAGE 8-5  Hydrogen Fuel Cell Engines  MODULE 8: FUEL CELL HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLES Key Points & Notes  An electric motor consists chiefly of a rotating electrical conductor situated between the north and south poles of a stationary magnet. It also contains a conductor known as an armature, a stationary magnet called the field structure, and a commutator. The field structure establishes a constant magnetic field in the motor. The armature rotates and becomes an electromagnet when a current passes through it. Connection to the driveshaft allows it to drive the load. The commutator reverses the direction of the current in the armature and helps transmit current between the armature and the power source. There are two types of motors: direct current and alternating current.  8.2.1.1 Direct Current Motors In the direct current (DC) motors, the current always flows in the same direction. There are three types of DC motors: series, shunt and compound. In the series motor, the armature and the field magnet are connected electrically in series. Current flows through the field magnet to the armature, increasing the strength of the magnets. The motor can start quickly under a heavy load, but such a heavy load decreases the motor speed. The shunt motor connects the magnet and armature in parallel. Part of the current goes through the magnet while the rest goes through the armature. It runs at an even speed regardless of the load, but if the load is too heavy, the motor is difficult to start. In the compound motor, two field magnets are connected to the armature, one in series and the other in parallel. The compound motor has the benefits of both the series and the shunt. It starts easily with a heavy load and maintains a relatively constant speed even when the load is increased.  Hydrogen Fuel Cell Engines and Related Technologies: Rev 0, December 2001   PAGE 8-6  Hydrogen Fuel Cell Engines  MODULE 8: FUEL CELL HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLES Key Points & Notes  Figure 8-4 Direct Current Motor  8.2.1.2 Alternating Current Motors Alternating current (AC) motors regularly reverse current flow direction. The reversal is typically 60 times per second or 60 Hz in North America and 50 Hz in Europe. Two changes of direction completes one cycle. The number of cycles per second is called the frequency of the alternating current. The AC motor has many advantages over the DC motor. It is easy to build and convenient to use. Most AC motors do not require commutators because the current reverses its direction automatically. Those that use commutators do so to conduct the current from the external power source to the moving part of the motor and back. The two types of AC motors are the induction and the synchronous motors. In the induction motor, the rotor has no direct connection to an external source of electricity. The current flows around the field coils in the stator and produces a rotating magnetic field. This field induces an electric current in the rotor resulting in another magnetic field. The magnetic field from the rotor interacts with the magnetic field from the stator causing the rotor to turn.  Hydrogen Fuel Cell Engines and Related Technologies: Rev 0, December 2001   PAGE 8-7  Hydrogen Fuel Cell Engines  MODULE 8: FUEL CELL HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLES Key Points & Notes  Figure 8-5 Alternating Current Induction Motor  In a synchronous motor, the stator also produces a rotating magnetic field. However, the rotor receives current directly from the power source instead of relying on the magnetic field from the stator to induce an electric current. The rotor moves at a fixed speed in step with the rotating field of the stator. Therefore, the synchronous motor maintains a fixed speed and uses less energy than an induction motor.  8.2.1.3 Electric Motor Configurations The two possible configurations of electric drive motors in a hybrid vehicle are a single electric motor connected to the wheels through a drive train, or multiple electric motors, one located at each wheel. The electric motor connected to the wheels through the drive train is the simplest design and is the present design of conventional vehicles. Multiple electric motors, however, produce better traction and regenerative braking at each wheel, allow more room for other parts, and continue to function even when one or more motors malfunction. This configuration has been used in some all-terrain vehicles.  8.2.2  Auxiliary Power Units  The auxiliary power unit (APU) of a hybrid vehicle supplies the baseline power required to the vehicle, recharges the batteries and powers accessories such as the air conditioner and heater. The APU can consist of a mechanical type engine or a fuel cell. A mechanical type engine can be a spark ignition, compression ignition, rotary, turbine or Stirling engine.

The four-stroke cycle requires two revolutions of the crankshaft for each power stroke and allows the piston to slide back and forth in the cylinder while transmitting the power to the drive shaft.  Figure 8-6 Four-Stroke Engine Operation  The spark ignition engine has a simple, mature, well understood design, a good power-to-weight ratio, and the ability to burn gasoline, methanol, ethanol, natural gas, propane or hydrogen. It also has well developed emission controls. The disadvantages, however, are poor part-load efficiency and relatively high uncontrolled emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen. In order to produce a higher output from the same size engine and to obtain some valve simplification, the two-stroke cycle was developed by Dugald Clerk in 1878. This cycle is applicable both to compression ignition and to spark ignition operation, but has been primarily successful only with the latter. The two-stroke engine's combustion cycle is completed in two strokes (one revolution) of the crankshaft as opposed to the four strokes (two revolutions) required by the four-stroke engine.  Hydrogen Fuel Cell Engines and Related Technologies: Rev 0, December 2001   PAGE 8-9  Hydrogen Fuel Cell Engines  MODULE 8: FUEL CELL HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLES Key Points & Notes  Figure 8-7 Two-Stroke Engine Operation  Compared to the four-stroke, the two-stroke engine has a higher power-to-weight ratio, a simpler design, lower manufacturing costs, and is lightweight. The emissions, however, are a major problem. There are relatively high uncontrolled hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide emissions, and emission control systems have not been sufficiently developed. Twostroke engines are common in small gasoline motors, such as on chainsaws and smaller motorcycles.  8.2.2.2 Compression Ignition Engines The compression ignition engine is typified by the diesel engine. The diesel cycle is similar to the Otto cycle except that a high compression ratio and air are required instead of a combustible mixture. Air is admitted to the engine on the intake stroke and the rapid compression of the air raises the temperature to such a point that a fuel, when delivered into the combustion chamber, ignites spontaneously. There is no requirement for a spark to initiate the combustion, or for a homogeneous mixture to propagate the flame. The advantages of Compression Ignition engines are efficiency at high compression ratios, they are well developed and dependable, and have low carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions. The disadvantages, however, are a high levels of carbon particulate and oxides of nitrogen emissions.  Hydrogen Fuel Cell Engines and Related Technologies: Rev 0, December 2001   PAGE 8-10  Hydrogen Fuel Cell Engines  MODULE 8: FUEL CELL HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLES Key Points & Notes  8.2.2.3 Wankel (Rotary) Engines In 1954, Felix Wankel found that an engine could be made of three variable-volume chambers formed between a stationary epitrochoid-shaped housing and a rotating equilateral triangular rotor. (A epitrochoid is a curve like an epicycloid, but generated by any point on a radius. An epicycloid is a curve described by a point on the circumference of a circle rolling on the outside of the circumference of another circle. Basically, the housing is circular, and the action is rotational.) Together with proper arrangement of intake, exhaust and ignition mechanisms, this variation of volume in the three chambers makes it possible to carry out the four main events of the Otto cycle within each of the three chambers. Wankel engines have a compact design, a high power-toweight ratio, are lightweight, and use the same emission control systems as the four-stroke SI engines. However, they have relatively poor efficiency and high uncontrolled emissions of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen. Wankel engines were produced commercially for Mazda cars in the 1980's, but were eventually replaced by conventional spark ignition engines.  Figure 8-8 Wankel (Rotary) Engine Operation  8.2.2.4 Stirling Engines An alternative to the internal combustion engine is an external combustion engine known as the Stirling engine. The Stirling cycle has two isothermal processes and two constant-volume processes. The thermal efficiency of the Stirling cycle with perfect regeneration is equal to that of the Carnot cycle for the same temperature range. The Stirling engine has low emissions, good efficiency, and operates quietly. The Hydrogen Fuel Cell Engines and Related Technologies: Rev 0, December 2001   PAGE 8-11  Hydrogen Fuel Cell Engines  MODULE 8: FUEL CELL HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLES Key Points & Notes  disadvantages are a complicated design, a low power-toweight ratio, high cost and a large cooling requirement.  Figure 8-9 Stirling Engine Operation  8.2.2.5 Gas Turbines Gas turbines, one of the oldest forms of combustion engines, are composed of a turbine, a combustion chamber and an air compressor. The turbine has a rotor that is turned by moving fluid such as water, steam, gas or wind. It changes kinetic energy (energy of movement) into mechanical energy (energy in form of mechanical power). The mechanical energy is transmitted by the turbine through the spinning motion of the rotor's axle. A gas turbine burns fuels such as oil, natural gas or kerosene. Gas turbines are small, lightweight, smooth running, have good power-to-weight ratios and low emissions. The fundamental problem with them, however, is their expense, poor efficiency at part load and their high operating temperaHydrogen Fuel Cell Engines and Related Technologies: Rev 0, December 2001   PAGE 8-12  Hydrogen Fuel Cell Engines  MODULE 8: FUEL CELL HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLES Key Points & Notes  ture. Gas turbines engines are used on jet aircraft and burn jet fuel, which is a kind of kerosene.  Figure 8-10 Gas Turbine Engine Major Components  8.2.2.6 Fuel Cells Fuel cells are discussed in detail in other modules of this course. Fuel cells are convenient in electrical hybrid applications since they can be used in tandem with other electricity generating devices.  8.2.3  Generators  All the power systems described above, except for the fuel cell, require a generator to convert the mechanical power into electrical power when used in a series hybrid. Generators, like electrical motors, are either AC or DC.  8.2.3.1 AC Generators An AC generator (or alternator) produces an electric current that reverses direction many times per second. It is also called a synchronous generator because it generates a voltage containing a high frequency proportional to, or synchronous with, the speed of the rotor. A simple AC generator has each end of its wire loop, or armature, attached to a slip ring. A carbon brush connected to the outside circuit rests against each of the slip rings. As the armature rotates, the current moves in the direction of the arrows. The brush at the first slip ring conducts the current out of the armature, and the brush at the second slip ring brings it back in. Hydrogen Fuel Cell Engines and Related Technologies: Rev 0, December 2001   PAGE 8-13  Hydrogen Fuel Cell Engines  MODULE 8: FUEL CELL HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLES Key Points & Notes  When the armature rotates parallel to the magnetic field, no current is generated for a moment. When the armature rotates into the magnetic field again, the current reverses direction. It then flows out of the armature through the second slip ring and back into the armature at the first slip ring.  8.2.3.2 DC Generators A DC generator produces an electric current that always flows in the same direction. It is different from the AC generator in both the way it is built and how it is used. The commutator rotates with a loop of wire just as the slip rings do with the rotor of an AC generator. Each half of the commutator ring is called the commutator segment and is insulated from the other half. Each end of the rotating loop of wire is connected to a commutator segment. Two carbon brushes connected to the outside circuit rest against the rotating commutator. One brush conducts the current out of the generator and the other brush feeds the current back in. The commutator is designed so that no matter how current in the loop alternates, the commutator segment containing outward-going current is always against the ""out"" brush at the proper time.  8.2.4  Energy Storage Systems  The peak power required in hybrid vehicles is met by devices like batteries, capacitors or a flywheel. These devices store energy and readily release it when needed.  8.2.4.1 Batteries Batteries are one vehicle. A battery action. It consists all the chemicals current. of the most important parts of a hybrid produces electricity by means of chemical of one or more electric cells. Each cell has and parts needed to produce an electric  There are two types of batteries: primary and secondary (or storage) batteries. Primary batteries discharge and must be discarded after one or more of the chemicals is used up. Secondary batteries, on the other hand, can be recharged after they have delivered their electrical energy. Consequently, secondary batteries are ideal for hybrid application. They are able to supply power to the vehicle and be re-used. The criteria used for battery selection are: temperature, energy density, power density, service life, shelf life, cost, reliability, cell configuration, charge/discharge cycle, safety, Hydrogen Fuel Cell Engines and Related Technologies: Rev 0, December 2001   PAGE 8-14  Hydrogen Fuel Cell Engines  MODULE 8: FUEL CELL HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLES Key Points & Notes  operating environment, recycling, minimal memory effect and efficiency.  8.2.4.2 Capacitors A capacitor is a device that stores electrical energy in the form of an electrical charge. A capacitor consists of two metal plates with an insulating material called a dielectric between them. Wires usually connect the plates to a source of electric current such as a battery. When an electric charge flows through the wires from one plate of the capacitor to the other, both plates become charged -- one with a positive charge, and the other with a negative charge. The two plates then have potential difference in energy -- a voltage -- between them. The plates release their charge when their wires are disconnected from the source and touched together. The ability of the capacitor to store electric energy is its capacitance. The main difference between a battery and a capacitor is that a capacitor can be rapidly charged and discharged.  8.2.4.3 Flywheels The flywheel is an alternative energy storage system that is capable of replacing chemical batteries in conventional electric vehicles. A flywheel is a balanced mass spinning around a constant axis that stores energy as rotational kinetic energy. Simply put, a flywheel is a mechanical battery that is capable of delivering multi-kilowatt-hours of energy to the drive system of an electric vehicle. Flywheel energy storage (FES) systems have been researched for many decades, but their application has been limited due to the high cost of inefficient materials. However, recent advancement in fiber-composite materials, control electronics, and frictionless magnetic bearings have led researchers to believe that modern FES systems could be used to power efficient non-polluting electric vehicles. The FES systems chemical batteries life, charge time, mental friendliness The FES systems tive braking, for storing energy on example, FES have been shown to theoretically rival in terms of power, energy density, cycle operating temperature range, environand maintenance needs.  are now a viable technology for regeneraaveraging peak power demands, and for electric and hybrid vehicles. In hybrids, for systems can replace expensive ultra-  Hydrogen Fuel Cell Engines and Related Technologies: Rev 0, December 2001   PAGE 8-15  Hydrogen Fuel Cell Engines  MODULE 8: FUEL CELL HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLES Key Points & Notes  capacitors for energy storage energy and to average out power demands.  8.2.5  Regenerative Braking  Brakes are devices that slow or stop the movement of a wheel, engine or entire vehicle. Most brakes have a fixed part called a brake shoe or block that presses against a turning wheel to create friction (heat) that causes the wheel to stop or slow down. In regenerative (or dynamic) braking, some of the energy is converted into electrical energy and stored. Pressing on the brake pedal first activates the regenerative braking system, and then the conventional friction brake. The rotational energy of the braking mechanism generates electrical power and stores it in the batteries. Electric and hybrid vehicles are well suited to use regenerative braking, as the captured electricity can power the drive motor. This electricity can be used in place of, or to supplement the APU, further reducing fuel use and improving fuel economy.  8.2.6  Control Systems  The electronic control system regulates the high-intensity current, helping it work with the APU counterparts. It controls the power flow between the battery and the motor as well as regenerative braking. A control system contains two main components, namely the command and power components. The command component manages and processes the driver's instructions. The power component chops power flows to control the motor's power intake. There are two choppers to manage this power flow. The primary chopper is the startup phase and works at low motor speeds. The excitation chopper regulates the motor at medium and high motor speeds.

GX262-60-3275743	Report of the Review Committee On the Fermilab HGQ R&D Program (FNAL, 18-19 March 1999)  A. Devred (Chairman), M. Anerella, D. Leroy, R. Ostojic, R. Schermer and P. Vdrine    Foreword Enclosed is the report of the committee which met at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory on 18 and 19 March 1999 to review the Fermilab R&D program on High Gradient Quadrupole magnets for the Large Hadron Collider Insertion Regions. The review committee consisted of Arnaud Devred, CEA/Saclay (Chairman), Mike Anerella, BNL, Daniel Leroy, CERN, Ranko Ostojic, CERN, Bob Schermer, consultant, and Pierre Vdrine, CEA/Saclay. It initially included Akira Yamamoto, KEK, who could not attend the review. The review was called up by Jim Strait, US LHC Accelerator Project Manager, with the charge given in Appendix 1. Prior to the review, the committee was provided through the World Wide Web with a number of relevant documents, including a technical summary of the model magnet program written by Jim Kerby, Fermilab LHC Accelerator Project Manager, enclosed in Appendix 2. The two-day review itself was articulated around presentations by Jim Kerby and Alexander Zlobin, IR Quadrupole Level 3 Project Manager, and included a detailed tour of the coil winding, curing, sizing and collaring facilities located in Industrial Building 3. Copies of the presentations by Kerby and Zlobin are given in Appendix 3. Additional information provided to the committee included a summary table of measured RRR, a summary table for the cable R&D test program, a table of material properties used in the ANSYS computations, a plot of cable short sample training measured at BNL, examples of strain gauge measurements, and various plots of computed electromagnetic forces in the coil ends. Some of these documents are given in Appendix 4. In general, the discussions were very open and the committee was very pleased with the cooperation of the FNAL team.  i   ii   Executive Summary The committee is pleased with the results of model magnet HGQ05, whose quench performance is greatly improved with respect to previous model magnets. In particular, the level of the first quench during the initial test at 4.5 K is significantly higher and the magnet reached its short sample limit in a small number of steps. Furthermore, during the subsequent test at 1.9 K, the currents of the first few quenches increase more rapidly than on previous magnets, with only two training quenches below the maximum operating gradient of 215 T/m. The quench current levels off at about 96 % of the estimated short sample limit at 1.9 K, making this magnet the most successful of the series. The promising results of model magnet HGQ05 constitute a significant step forward and provide a solid basis upon which to base the magnet program. The committee strongly recommends that the test results of this magnet be fully analyzed and compared to those of previous model magnets so as to understand which modifications can explain the improved performance. Furthermore, the committee suggests that FNAL gets as much information as possible from this magnet by re-testing it, for instance, with different end configurations. Although the quench performance of magnet HGQ05 shows good progress, it is not yet fully satisfactory and can still be improved. The committee recommends that particular attention be paid to the first training quenches at 1.9 K and that more analyses be carried out to find possible correlations between quench start localization and specific mechanical features. In particular, the committee recommends analyzing in detail collar deflection data that seem to indicate that the first training quenches at 1.9 K may have originated in a region of low azimuthal coil pre-compression. The relative success of magnet HGQ05 and a detailed understand ing of the reasons behind it should help focus the magnet program on a limited number of clearly identified issues. The magnet program should be revised immediately to incorporate the lessons learned from magnet HGQ05 and to address the most outstanding issues. The committee, however, strongly recommends that the design variants investigated in the oncoming model magnets be limited to a strict minimum, and that only one major change be implemented in each new magnet. At this stage, the goal of the program should be to duplicate and improve the performance of magnet HGQ05 rather than explore new design features. Following are some comments the committee wishes to make on a number of technical matters that were discussed during the two-day review. The list is not exhaustive and the recommendations are only meant to help identify critical design issues and to establish priorities.  1   1  End Part Material HGQ03 coil end models magnet  There is clear evidence from the test results of model magnets HGQ02 and that the quench performance of these magnets was impaired by the use of Ultem for the parts. This conclusion is supported by test results from two LHC arc dipole magnet built at CERN. Magnets HGQ01 and HGQ05 use G10 end parts, while starting with HGQ06, the end parts will be made out of G11.  The committee endorses the change of end part material from Ultem back to impregnated glass fibers and recommends stopping all further R&D effort on Ultem. 2 Thermodynamic Cable Stability  There is a lingering discussion among the accelerator magnet community about the possibility that slow training observed on a number of NbTi model magnets operated at 1.9 K may be a signature of inherent thermodynamic cable stability problems. For example, data were presented at the review from a series of critical current measurements performed at BNL on short samples taken from the cables used in model magnet HGQ06 (at 1.9 K and in a 8.7 T transverse field). These cable short samples trained rather badly. The inner coil cable was especially poor; first quench was slightly above 11500 A and quench current crept up to about 17000 A after 30 to 40 quenches, while the expected critical current (extrapolated from the 4.2 K data) is above 18500 A. In comparison, it was announced that similar measurements performed on a short sample of LHC outer dipole cable exhibited very little training. It is the committee's strong conviction that thermodynamic stability is only of concern when within a few percent of the short sample limit, and that poor training behavior like that observed on model magnets HGQ01 through HGQ03 is of mechanical origin. The results of model magnet HGQ05, which uses cables very similar to those used in previous model magnets, and yet exhibits much better quench performance, reinforce this conviction. There were some debates among the committee about the degree to which the short sample test results are representative of magnet performance and it is suggested to wait for the test results of model magnet HGQ06 before drawing any conclusions. 3 Cable Annealing, Adhesive for the Insulation, and Curing Temperature  Unlike the cables developed by CERN for the LHC arc dipole and quadrupole magnets, the cables used for the HGQ magnets are not baked and are made from un-annealed strands left over from the SSC program. The cable strands are thus heavily cold-worked, as proven by the low RRR measured on the as received cables (between 34 and 57). The cable insulation used for the coils of model magnets HGQ02 and HGQ03 relies on a polyimide adhesive, with a softening temperature of 180 to 190 C. Curing the coils of model magnets HGQ02 and HGQ03 at such temperature resulted in a significant annealing of the copper, as proven by RRR measurements performed on the magnet coils during cold test: the RRR of the inner coil cables went from 45 to 215-225 while the RRR of the outer coil cables went from 35 to 95-105. According to SSC experience, a measured cable RRR of the order 2   of 200, corresponds to a bulk copper RRR of 300, which, for IGC-type wires, is indicative of a fully-annealed state. Such annealing is, of course, accompanied by microstructure reorganizations and internal stress re-distributions within the cable strands that result, typically, in an increase in strand diameter and a reduction in strand length. As a direct effect of this annealing the coils shrink axially when removed from the curing mold, thereby requiring special handling procedures. The cable insulation used for the coils of model magnets HGQ01 and HGQ05 relies on an epoxy-based adhesive, with a low thermosetting temperature (135 C for 90 minutes). Compared to model magnets HGQ02 and HGQ03, the low-temperature curing of the coils of model magnets HGQ01 and HGQ05 only resulted in partial annealing of the cable strand copper, as again shown by RRR measurements on the magnet coils (RRR of the inner coil cable used for magnet HGQ01 changed from 43 to 145, while that of the outer coil cable increased from 34 to 57  The RRR data for magnet HGQ05 were not available at the time of the review). It is likely that this partial annealing causes less microstructure reorganization and less internal stress redistribution. There are some indications that the axial shrinkage measured after curing on the straight sections of the outer coils of model magnets HGQ01 and HGQ05 is somewhat lower than that measured on magnets HGQ02 and HGQ03. The use of un-annealed strands and cables in the HGQ magnets is a legacy of the SSC program that was becoming a hot issue at the time of SSC cancellation. CERN has a very different approach to the issue, which is to de-couple the annealing step from the curing step. Requirements on coil size reproducibility imply that the curing operation be performed under pressure and in confined space. This is particularly true for the curing of the HGQ magnet coils where the mold is kept closed during the high temperature phase. The worry, then, is that, when curing is performed in a confined volume and accompanied with strong annealing, the internal stresses cannot freely redistribute and may remain frozen at some locations. This creates a potential risk that, upon magnet energization, the application of the Lorentz forces causes stress releases that may lead to premature quenching. The risk of freezing internal stresses can be diminished by maintaining a low pressure during the high temperature phase of the curing cycle as promoted by BNL for all-polyimide coils (but then, a coil sizing step is required during the cool off phase of the curing schedule). The risk can be further reduced (if not altogether eliminated) by performing an annealing step on the strands at final size, and, if needed, a baking of the cable. The committee wishes to point out that one of the differences between model magnet HGQ05 and its two predecessors (magnets HGQ02 and HGQ03) is that it uses an insulation system with an epoxy-based adhesive and that, therefore, its coils were cured at a lower temperature. (Magnet HGQ01 also uses the same insulation system and its coils were also cured at the same low temperature, and yet its quench performance was as bad as that of magnets HGQ02 and HGQ03. This, however, can be explained by the fact that the outer coils of this magnet were badly oversized, which was corrected by decreasing the thickness of the pole shims in the magnet straight sections, while nothing could be done to the coil ends. As a result, there were steps at the transitions between the coil straight sections and the coil ends where, as it turned out, most of the training quenches originated.) The committee suggests that  3   the low temperature cure may be one of the reasons for the better performance of model magnet HGQ05 and recommends that this issue be investigated further. The choice of a polyimide adhesive was driven by the fact that the company contracted by Fermilab to apply an epoxy layer on the polyimide tape had trouble controlling the layer thickness. Thus, there is a risk that extra material will flow and thereby occlude the 2-mm-wide cooling channels deliberately left in the outer insulation wrap of the inner cable. The KEK team working on the LHC IR quadrupole magnet program was confronted with a similar problem, and they have found a company in Japan able to produce very thin epoxy layers. The committee recommends that FNAL get information from KEK, and, if required, order material from the Japanese company. If this material is appropriate, the committee suggests using it for magnet production and staying with the low temperature cure. If FNAL decides to go ahead with the polyimide adhesive and high temperature cure, the committee deems it necessary to seriously address the annealing issue. As it is quite complex and there is not enough time to develop a complete R&D program, the committee suggests that FNAL rely extensively on the experience accumulated at CERN and follow the same procedures for strand annealing and stabrite coating. CERN also employs a cable baking procedure that is mainly designed to ensure a proper and reproducible level of interstrand resistances. The same procedure could also be followed if a control of the interstrand resistance is required. It must be stressed, however, that the recipes developed by CERN are applied to strands produced according to a specific schedule of cold-work and heat-treatment cycles optimized to fulfil LHC requirements, and it may be that these recipes are not directly applicable to SSC strands. In particular, annealing the strand at final size may result in unwanted critical current density degradation. It is, therefore, necessary to validate these recipes by a complete set of electrical and mechanical measurements on strands and cable short samples. The committee feels that these measurements should be done as quickly as possible and should serve as a basis for the decision on the cables to be used in magnets HGQ08 and HGQ09. 4 Number of inner and outer cable strands  Magnets HGQ01 through HGQ06 use inner cables made up of 38 strands and outer cables made up of 46 strands. Starting with magnet HGQ07, FNAL proposes to reduce the number of strands in the inner cables to 37 for all further magnets and to use a 45-strand cable in the outer coils of magnet HGQ07. The present 38-strand cable has a high lateral compaction (15.35 mm for a final width of 15.4 mm, yielding 99.7 %), while the lateral compaction of the 46-strand cable is of the order of 96.8 %. A high lateral compaction makes the cable puffy and easily unstable mechanically. The committee sees no reason to reduce the number of strands in the outer cable and suggests reverting to a 46-strand cable for the outer coils of magnet HGQ07. The committee does see some good reasons for reducing the number of strands in the inner cable from 38 to 37. However, the quoted packing factor of 87.6% for the 37-strand cable is lower than the present packing factors of the LHC inner and outer cables, which are of  4   the order of 89%. The committee therefore recommends that winding tests be performed as soon as possible on this new cable before using it in a magnet. 5 Cable Lay Pitch and Splice Design  Magnets HGQ01 through HGQ05 use right lay cables for the inner coils and left lay cables for the outer coils. Starting with magnet HGQ06, the inner coils are wound from left-lay cables in order to utilize the stock of righttwisted strands left over from SSC. The committee thinks that the choice of cable lay direction should be based on technical criteria, such as windability, and not on cost, given that the savings of using leftover SSC strands is probably minimal (for instance, how does it compare to the cost of an additional model magnet?). The committee wishes also to point out that in the case of the LHC dipole magnets the inner and outer cable lay directions were chosen so as to ensure that the cable with the largest aspect ratio is wound in the favorable direction, and that, when spliced together, the strands of the two cables do not lie parallel but cross at an angle. It is believed that strand crossing in the splice forces the current to redistribute itself more evenly among the strands when transferring from one cable to the other, thereby limiting the risk of highly non-uniform current distribution. In any case, and especially if the chosen cable lay directions are such that the strands of the two cables are parallel in the splice, the committee recommends to develop and evaluate procedures which ensure low and reproducible splice resistances. 6 Overlapping of Cable Insulation  Starting with magnet HGQ03, the overlap of the inner layer of the inner cable polyimide insulation was increased from 50 to about 55% in an effort to increase coil sizes. While somewhat successful in achieving the desired coil size goal, the committee feels that the overlap should be restored to 50% at the earliest convenience. The temptation to revise the insulation overlap is clear: it is a fast way to implement a change in coil size and still use cable which is on hand. However, its use results in areas along the conductor where for about 22% of the width of the polyimide film there are 3 layers, whereas for the other 78%, there are only 2. When closing the curing mold, the 3-layer areas are subjected to higher stresses than the 2-layer areas. It is likely that these higher stresses produce plastic deformations of the polyimide film, which locally reduce its thickness and allow the spacing between conductors to become more or less uniform. To achieve uniform spacing, the film thickness in the 3-layer area must be reduced by about one third. This may degrade the film, leave it vulnerable to long term fatigue and create a risk of electrical shorts. Furthermore, upon coil winding, there can be points in the coil where 3-layer areas of adjacent turns pile up atop of each other, resulting in undesirable non-uniformities in the coil package. In order to tune up coil sizes, the committee recommends either to increase strand diameter and cable midthickness or to revise the insulation scheme so as to achieve the desired azimuthal sizes while maintaining a 50% overlap, as was done for the LHC arc quadrupole magnet. The first solution is propably more efficient, but depends on whether or not FNAL 5   must rely on the existing inventory of SSC strands at final size or has the freedom to change strand parameters. Note that increasing the conductor volume may also help increase the inner coil Young's modulus (see next section). 7 Matching Coil Mechanical Properties  The Young's moduli of the inner coils assembled in magnets HGQ02 through HGQ04 were of the order of 4 to 5 GPa, while the Young's moduli of the outer coils were of the order of 10 to 11 GPa. In the case of magnet HGQ05, the inner coils were re-cured at a smaller size in order to increase the Young's modulus (up to 8 GPa) and better match the mechanical properties of the outer coils. The committee considers that matching the Young's moduli of the inner and outer coils is probably a good idea, but thinks that further investigations should be carried out to understand the origin of the low inner coil modulus. It can be, for instance, that the pressure applied during the curing of the inner coils is too low. This can be compensated by increasing the conductor volume as suggested in the previous section. 8 Collar Packs  On model magnets HGQ01 through HGQ03, the 1.5-mm-thick collars, manufactured by stamping, were assembled one by one around the coil assembly. Tests carried out on magnet HGQ04 showed that there could be some benefit in grouping the collars into packs so as to reduce the risks of buckling and increase stability under axial forces. It also facilitates the mounting of the bearing strips at the collar poles while providing a continuous support to the coil pole turns. Starting with model magnet HGQ05, the collars are assembled into 3-inch-long packs before being mounted around the coil assembly. The committee sees no objection to the use of collar packs but recommends that their engineering be revised to reduce the high frictional forces that need to be overcome to assemble them. 9 Magnetic Design of Coil Ends  Several variants for the design of the coil ends have been developed and are being tried on the model magnets. In particular, starting with magnet HGQ06, the largest conductor block of the inner coils is split into two in order to reduce the size of the inner coil end spacers. This change was mainly driven by mechanical considerations. The committee suggests pursuing the optimization of the field, forces and winding geometry of the coil ends so as to ensure that the peak field in the ends is significantly smaller than in the straight section, and that, for each winding block, the axial outward force is larger than the inward force coming from the other winding blocks. The committee also recommends studying a split of the largest conductor block in the outer coils.  6   10  Studying Axial Mechanics  The committee is pleased to see that FNAL has conducted analytic and FEA studies of axial mechanics and recommends that these studies be continued. In particular, it would be very useful to gain a more precise understanding of the effects of collet and end bullet restraint. 11 Axial Pre-Loading by Bullets  The HGQ model magnets include bullets that can be used to apply an axial pre-load to the coil ends. The justifications for this axial pre-loading are as follows: (1) to ensure that the coil ends are compacted and remain in compression so as to limit the risk of conductor motion, and (2) to prevent stick-slip motions between coil and collars and collars and yoke, which may cause premature quenching. Various tests have been carried out on the early model magnets which have shown that applying or removing axial pre-loading neither improved nor degraded the poor quench performance of these magnets. The ends of the more successful model magnet HQS05 were axially constrained. The committee wishes to point out that, in the case of the HGQ magnet design, the collars are supposedly free to move within the iron yoke, which should eliminate the risk of stick-slip motions. This is similar to the case of the LHC arc quadrupole magnets designed at CEA/Saclay, where the ends are not constrained. CEA/Saclay has already built and tested two full-length arc quadrupole magnets that exhibited reasonable quench performance. The committee therefore thinks that the necessity of constraining the magnet ends axially has yet to be proven, and recommends that model magnet HGQ05 be re-tested with unscrewed bullets. 12 Aluminum Collets and Coil End Shimming  The return ends of model magnets HGQ01 and HGQ02 and both ends of model magnet HGQ03 were supported by round collars, while the lead ends of magnets HGQ01 and HGQ02 and both ends of magnet HGQ05 were supported by aluminum collets. FNAL proposes to support all magnet ends with collets. The committee considers that the collets are a reasonable solution to end clamping, with which Fermilab has a lot of experience and feels confident. However, the committee recommends improving the reproducibility of coil end sizes and developing a more productionoriented procedure for coil end shimming.  7   13  Bolting of Collets to End Plates  On model magnet HGQ05, the collets at both ends of the collared-coil assembly were bolted to the end plates while bullet screws, also mounted on the end plates, applied an axial pre-load to the coil ends. The justification for doing so is as follows. During cooldown, the collared-coil assembly shrinks more in the axial direction than the shell-end-plate assembly. As a result, bolting to the end plates should result, at the end of cooldown, in a tensile axial force. This force is expected to put the straight section of the collared-coil assembly into tension, and, when combined with the axial pre-load applied by the bullets, to ensure that the coil ends are compacted and remain in compression. Maintaining the coil ends under compression is believed to reduce the risk of conductor motions under the axial component of the Lorentz force and, thereby, may help limiting premature quenching in these areas. Bolting the collets to the end plates is one of the major differences between magnet HGQ05 and its predecessors that could explain the better quench performance of this magnet. The committee, however, thinks that, as already pointed out in recommendation 11, the necessity of constraining the magnet ends axially has yet to be proven and once again recommends to retest model magnet HGQ05 with unbolted collets and unscrewed bullets. The committee thinks that more efforts should be made to achieve a detailed understanding of the effects of the collet bolting on the overall axial mechanics of the magnet and on how these effects scale with magnet length. These efforts should go into refining the FEA model under development and in trying to verify the simulation results on an actual magnet. In particular, if FNAL decides to keep bolting the collets on the oncoming model magnets, the committee recommends instrumenting the bolts with strain gauges (as is considered for model magnet HGQ06). Also, the long term behavior after thermal cycling and quench performance should be addressed, as the compression of the magnet ends relies on collet friction which may be modified by the loading cycles to which the collets are subjected. 14 Quench Protection and Energy Extraction  At present, power tests of the model magnets are performed with energy extraction (up to 70% of the stored energy is extracted). There is evidence from the test results of at least two of the model magnets (HGQ01 and HGQ03) that the heater tests performed without energy extraction may have resulted in degradation of the quench current. The committee recommends that systematic tests be carried out to demonstrate that the magnets are protected and that their quench performance is not significantly degraded when the energy is not extracted, as is the case in LHC. However, the committee does not see the need of pursuing studies on different quench heater configurations and suggest choosing the one the most reliable and easy to assemble.  8   15  R&D Program and Prototype Schedule  The committee suggests that the magnet R&D program be revised to incorporate fully the results of recent and future retest of model magnet HGQ05. The committee also recommends that the model magnet program be carried out at a pace leaving enough time for evaluating each model and allowing a reasonable degree of feedback. In particular, the committee insists that all models be tested thoroughly, both in terms of quench performance and field quality. The committee recommends that the program focus on a limited number of issues in order to still improve the performance and ensure reproducibility. The committee strongly recommends that the revised program include at least two nominally identical magnets having the final magnetic and mechanical design. The committee recommends keeping the original schedule for the full-scale prototype, even if FNAL decides to extend the model magnet program, but strongly insists that the prototype be built using the final cable design. 16 Overall Program Priority  From all the issues discussed above, the committee considers that the most critical are those concerning strand annealing and coil curing, and recommends that they be addressed as quickly as possible (in particular, in time for choosing the cables to be used in the full-length prototype).  9   10   Appendix 1: Charge of the Review Committee   Appendix 2: Technical Summary of the Model Magnet R&D Program   Appendix 3: Copies of the Presentations By Jim Kerby and Alexander Zlobin   Appendix 4: Selected Additional Informations Provided During the Review

Note that the copper     conductor of the suppy/return power is also water cooled all the way from the buss-bar     connection. The hoses are of different lengths. They should be fitted appropriately.                      Detail of the manifolding and buss-bars in the corner.                      A picture of the return manifold and of the electrical connections. Note that the     electrical connection is at two different levels.                 Pictures of the Phobos Magnet Yoke pieces taken on   September 28, 1998                                The Phobos Magnet!                     The Phobos Magnet from the side of the interaction region.                     The orange tubes feed the cooling water to the four coils. Note how the manifolding     goes along one of the columns, so as not to shadow any TOF elements.                      A more detailed look at the coil connections.                      A detailed look at the other coil and also showing how the manifolding and bussbar is     tucked underneath the magnet.                                          A look at one of the cooling water feeds and the electrical connections. The water     feeds are on both sides of the magnet, the electrical connection is on the outer wall side     of the tunnel.                      Another look at the manifolding, from the outer wall side.                  Pictures of the Phobos Magnet Yoke pieces taken on   September 21, 1998                          The upper yoke of the Phobos magnet. The bussbar and manifolding are clearly visible.                     Closer look at the bussbars. The bussbars consist of two tinned copper conductors.

The nipples on the manifolding will connect the cooling tubes     to the coils (the coils are not installed on this picture). There are five in and outlet     connections per coil.                      Note the way the bussbar goes around the corner. Both the positive and negative     terminal of the electrical connections have to follow the same path to cancel any     additional magnetic field coming from the bussbar as much as possible.                     One more look at the upper yoke.                                      Pictures of the Phobos Magnet Coils taken on   September 3, 1998                          Impregnated coil mounted on one of the pole tips. Straps hold the coil down and you     can see the coil connections on the left. The water connections will have a 45deg elbow,     bending the waterflow down towards the manifolding which runs horizontally (on the     left   in the picture).

There was some concern that the coils would turn     out to be higher due to 'keystoning' problems. This turned out to be a minor effect, the     coils are only 3mm higher than originally designed.                      A Coil is being insulated just before the impregnation.                                                                                                                 Last edited:  Friday, February 04, 2000  by  Patrick Decowsk i.
